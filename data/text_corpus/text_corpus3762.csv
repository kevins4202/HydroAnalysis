18810,we have investigated the suitability of phosphate addition in the form mh2po4 m na k or nh4 for the selective removal of uranium from a complex waste effluent the effluent in question is generated as part of a treatment strategy for a spent uranium catalyst used in the production of acrylonitrile sohio process which has been in temporary storage in korea since 2004 both ph 3 0 11 0 and phosphate dosages 0 25 10 mm have been screened to identify the optimal conditions of 6 25 and 1 mm respectively for an initial uranium concentration of 0 16 mm precipitation kinetics have been investigated revealing the rapid removal of uranium from solution with 30 min found to be optimal the effluent was effectively decontaminated via meta ankoleite k uo2 po4 3h2o formation to uranium levels below the korean release limit of 1 ppm for uranium bearing liquid wastes with kh2po4 addition being chosen for the real process final decontamination factors of the order of 8000 were readily achieved aluminium calcium and iron containing coagulants were screened for the clean up of the remaining supernatant post uranium removal ensuring the final effluent meets the relevant release criteria ph total suspended solids total phosphate and turbidity for general non radioactive effluents a process scheme is presented and discussed for adaptation to similar uranium containing effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords uranium phosphate meta ankoleite effluent treatment precipitation sohio process 1 introduction since its discovery uranium has found a number of civilian uses in the modern world beyond energy production typically as depleted uranium 0 7 235u nas 1971 instances of depleted uranium containing materials include counterweights roberts 1999 radiation shields nrc 1999 and catalysts nas 1971 ismagilov and kuntsevich 2009 an example of which being the production of acrylonitrile as part of the sohio acrylonitrile process which used a uranium antimonite usb3o10 active phase catalyst callahan and berthold 1965 cavani et al 2009 despite the beneficial uses uranium is one of the most damaging heavy metals due to its radioactivity and bio toxicity and is a contaminant of great concern for industry and governments alike defra 2001 who 2001 therefore it must be handled and disposed of correctly to limit unwarranted environmental release with strict discharge controls in place 1 bq g iaea 2004 this is particularly prevalent when uranium containing materials reach their end of life and require disposal with even low level uranium wastes requiring some form of treatment and or long term storage and disposal management strategy oecd iaea 2001 this need for responsible treatment and disposal methods leads to an ever growing wealth of knowledge surrounding radioactive waste treatment processes iaea 1997 it is in light of these issues coupled with subsequent catalysts offering process improvements that the uranium catalyst used in the sohio process has been phased out horvath 2002 despite this change initially occurring some 30 40 years ago remnants still remain awaiting appropriate waste management strategies notable cases exist in japan sugai 2007 and korea kim et al 2018a in korea approximately 7000 drums 200 l of the spent uranium antimonite catalyst has been in temporary storage since 2004 sugai 2007 kim et al 2018a although a non radioactive replacement has since been used the original catalyst estimated to contain 18 000 kg of uranium 0 19 235u 14 841 bq g is still awaiting an appropriate management strategy recently the korea atomic energy research institute kaeri has developed such a process to treat and ultimately dispose of this spent catalyst kim et al 2018a 2018b the process has proved successful for the treatment and volume reduction of the catalyst waste however during the process a large amount of complex waste effluent is generated which requires a uranium decontamination process in order to meet the korean release criteria for uranium bearing effluents 1 ppm u nssc 2014 a previously proposed hydrogen peroxide precipitation methodology generating the studtite mineral phase uo2o2 h2o 4 was found to be successful for the removal of uranium oh et al 2018 unfortunately the removal kinetics were far too slow for commercial scale and thus was ultimately inadequate consequently a new treatment method was required for the rapid 2 h and selective removal of uranium to levels adequate for release uranium phosphate mineral formation has garnered a lot of interest in recent years for the purpose of uranium sequestering and immobilisation owing to their low solubility and high stability vermeul et al 2006 zheng et al 2006 mehta et al 2013 kanematsu et al 2014 martinez et al 2014 this interest is backed by extensive literature on the thermodynamic stability and solubility of such minerals due to their importance as secondary uranium mineral phases and as uranium thermodynamic sinks in radionuclide contaminated groundwater and soil vesely et al 1964 markovic et al 1988 haverbeke et al 1996 gorman lewis et al 2008 the latter being particularly relevant in the context of nuclear facility clean up and nuclear waste repository settings many of the relevant uranyl phosphates are categorised in the autunite meta autunite group with a number of cation and anion substitutions possible zheng et al 2006 such group members include autunite 1 mehta et al 2013 chernikovite 2 haverbeke et al 1996 sodium autunite 3 gorman lewis et al 2008 meta ankoleite 4

thermodynamic literature has been well documented and summarized by gorman lewis et al 2008 as part of a review of uranyl mineral solubilities in addition martinez et al 2014 offers a review of phosphate induced metal remediation and sequestering which includes numerous references to the sequestering of uranium from contaminated sub surface soils groundwater treatment and expands to the implementation of reactive geo barriers despite this knowledge there has been limited application of uranium phosphate phase formation as a method of waste treatment although there is some application in the mining industry iaea 1993 dulama et al 2013 the formation of insoluble uranium phosphate precipitates as part of a problematic radioactive effluent treatment process has the potential for the rapid and effective decontamination of such waste streams in this paper we describe the steps taken to screen and verify a uranium removal method via phosphate addition mh2po4 m na k or nh4 for the treatment of the aforementioned effluent the method has been verified at the bench scale and a process schematic has been suggested 2 experimental 2 1 materials all materials were used as received

drums before use and used as received 2 2 effluent generation a complete description of the spent uranium catalyst and dissolution process has been previously reported kim et al 2018a 2018b in short the spent catalyst consists of a uranium antimonite active phase usb3o10 3 to 7 wt u 15 to 25 wt sb on a silica support 70 vol as silica constitutes the largest volume fraction this was targeted for removal via dissolution and purification for a theoretical 70 volume reduction following thermal treatment 550 600 c for 3 h to remove tar like substances formed during acrylonitrile synthesis the catalyst was dissolved in 4 m naoh 5 ml g at 105 c a solid liquid filtration stage was performed to separate the dissolved silica from undissolved residual particulates a portion of uranium was carried over into solution as part of the dissolution stage the dissolved silica is precipitated from solution by ph adjustment to below ph 10 via the addition of h2so4 to prevent the co precipitation of residual uranium it was retained in solution by the formation of the soluble uranyl peroxocarbonate species uo2 o2 co3 2 4 by the addition of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide prior to any ph adjustment kim et al 2012 a second solid liquid filtration stage was performed to separate the precipitated silica from the uranium laden effluent the solid silica cake was washed twice with water and once with h2so4 to further purify the silica for free release 1 bq g alpha the water and acid washes were combined with the uranium effluent which awaits a uranium removal method fig 1 the chemical and physical properties of the resulting effluent hereinafter referred to as sims silica mixed solution are summarized in table 1 2 3 thermodynamic calculations to establish uranium speciation thermodynamic calculations of the experimental conditions were performed using the mineql software version 5 0 a modified thermodynamic database thermos com v8 r6 available from the lawrence livermore national laboratory llnl was used for the calculations additional thermodynamic stability constants of u vi species and non uranyl species and solubility products of u vi solids were incorporated in to the data set table s1 s2 and s3 calculations were done at a pco2 10 3 5 atm 2 4 u vi removal experiments 2 4 1 ph dose and kinetic screening for ph and dose screening a 10 ml aliquot of the effluent was placed into a 50 ml glass beaker while kinetic screening used 100 ml of effluent in a 250 ml beaker the effluent was stirred at 180 rpm with a magnetic stirrer bar phosphate mh2po4 m na k or nh4 1 0 m solution was added to reach the required concentration 0 25 10 mm based on an estimated uranium concentration of 1 mm hydroxide moh m na k or nh4 was added until the desired ph was reached 3 0 10 5 and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature 25 c the addition of ca oh 2 for the formation of autunite was considered however due to calcium sulfate formation and the excessive consumption of reagents this was not used aliquots of the supernatant 2 5 ml were sampled and filtered through a syringe filter 0 22 μm after reaction completion for icp oes analysis for the purpose of kinetic analysis the target ph and phosphate dosages were fixed at 6 25 and 0 5 4 0 mm respectively solution samples were taken at 30 s and 1 2 4 8 16 30 60 and 120 min and prepared for icp oes analysis 2 4 2 variable so4 2 and uo2 2 concentrations the sulfate concentration of the sims solution was adjusted by the addition of a na2so4 solution to a 10 ml aliquot of the effluent sodium sulfate solution 2 m was added 1 25 10 0 ml water was added to make up a total solution volume of 20 ml for each experiment allowing the results to be directly compared u initial 20 ppm sulfate concentrations ranged from 0 125 to 1 00 m in 0 05 m increments phosphate dose was maintained at 1 mm the sims effluent was diluted with water to vary the uo2 2 concentration dilutions were performed at ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 9 sims water corresponding to initial uranium concentrations of 20 10 and 4 ppm respectively the phosphate dose was either varied to compensate the reduced uranium concentration or maintained at a target dose of 1 mm table s4 precipitation of uranium from the modified solutions proceeded as described in section 2 4 1 2 5 phosphate removal experiments 2 5 1 ph and dose screening a volume of 25 ml of the filtered supernatant post uranium removal was placed into a polypropylene centrifuge tube 50 ml the selected coagulation reagent al2 so4 3 naalo2 cacl2 ca oh 2 fecl3 or fe2 so4 3 1m was added as a solution to the required dose 0 25 10 mm sodium hydroxide was added until the target ph was reached 5 0 10 each tube was then capped and placed onto an end over end shaker at 50 rpm and allowed to react for 2 h after reaction completion an aliquot of the supernatant 2 5 ml was removed for icp oes analysis 2 5 2 kinetic screening a 100 ml of filtered u free effluent was added to a 150 ml glass beaker and stirred at 180 rpm with a magnetic stirrer bar iron iii chloride was added to reach the required concentration 1 10 mm sodium hydroxide was added until ph 7 was reached and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature 25 c for kinetic analysis solution samples were taken at 30 s and 1 2 4 8 16 30 60 and 120 min and prepared for icp oes analysis 2 6 bench scale tests larger scale 2 l reproducibility tests were performed using the optimised conditions for both the uranium phosphate and iron phosphate precipitation stages a 5 l plastic container was used with stirring provided by an overhead mechanical stirrer fitted with a twin bladed stirrer shaft the uranium phosphate precipitate was separated using a 3 chamber membrane filter

results and discussion 3 1 effluent characterisation the effluent prior to phosphate dosing is highly acidic ph 0 86 and possess a high conductivity and ionic strength of 85 18 ms cm and 0 75 m respectively due to the high concentration of so4 2 0 24 m table 1 the effluent is also considerably turbid 149 ntu corresponding to 280 mg l of suspended solids particle size morphological and elemental analysis of the solids via psa and sem edx analysis show irregularly shaped amorphous silica particles with an average particle size of 17 2 μm the uranium content of the waste is found to be of the order of 40 ppm 0 16 mm despite the prior silica precipitation step a considerable amount of dissolved silicon remains in solution at approximately 20 times higher than the molar concentration of uranium table 1 table s7 3 2 thermodynamic calculations calculated thermodynamic solubility of u vi aq in the effluent in the presence of molar excess phosphate po4 3 uo2 2 10 as a function of ph is reported fig 2 dissolved u vi aq concentration is predicted to be lowest u vi aq 10 10 m at circumneutral ph due to the formation of insoluble uranium phosphates gorman lewis et al 2008 the presence of high sulfate concentrations as found in the effluent owing to the h2so4 ph control will result in soluble uranium sulfate species dominating under acidic conditions amphlett et al 2018 the shape and position of the solubility curve between ph 3 8 is found to be in good agreement with previous published values namely gorman lewis et al 2008 and kanematsu et al 2014 beyond ph 8 a difference in modelled solubility is noted between kanematsu et al 2014 and the results in this study due to the inclusion of carbonate uranium forms stable water soluble uranyl carbonate species under alkaline conditions with uranyl tricarbonate dominating at higher ph gorman lewis et al 2008 kim et al 2009 as there is no attempt to control carbon dioxide ingress into the effluent carbonate should be present the effect of carbonate upon uranium solubility must therefore be considered as part of the precipitation process thus maintaining a ph 8 0 is desirable to prevent soluble uranyl carbonate formation fig 2 thermodynamically the lowest u vi aq concentration excluding uranyl phosphate precipitation is predicted to occur at ph 7 8 8 0 owing to the formation of insoluble uranyl oxide hydrates uranyl carbonate and uranyl silicate species fig 2 black dotted line the precipitation of which are predicted to start at ph 5 2 a significantly higher ph than when phosphate is present beyond ph 8 0 uranium is re solubilised as anionic uranyl carbonate species the point of lowest solubility is predicted to be both higher and narrower than when uranyl phosphate precipitation occurs modelling uranyl solubility as a function of uranyl phosphate precipitation only predicts the solubility of u vi aq to increase rapidly beyond ph 7 6 until ph 9 2 fig 2 black dot dash line due to uranyl phosphate dissolution as similarly predicted by kanematsu et al 2014 at an equimolar concentration of phosphate uranyl the removal of uranium from solution is predicted to be predominated by uranyl phosphate formation prior to ph 6 0 while uranyl oxide hydrates carbonates and silicates dominate at higher ph fig 3 black solid line the lowest u vi aq solubility is predicted at ph 7 4 u vi aq 10 9 m which is identical to when no phosphate is present fig 3 black dash line considering only uranyl phosphate precipitation the limit of u vi aq solubility occurs at ph 7 0 u vi aq 10 7 m corresponding to a concentration of 22 5 ppb fig 3 black dot dash line substantially lower than the korean release limit of 1 ppm thus the addition of phosphate even at equimolar concentration offers a thermodynamically viable option for the removal of uranium from the process effluent 3 3 u vi removal 3 3 1 ph and dose screening the effect of different phosphate reagents on the removal of uranium from solution as a function of ph is reported fig 4 uranium removal in the absence of phosphate was also measured comparing these results it is clear that the addition of phosphate has a dramatic effect on the removal of uranium to concentrations well below the release limit at ph 5 0 the final uranium concentration is also dependent upon the counter ion used according to the order nh4 k na although all three readily achieve uranium removal of 99 88 11 0 38 8 ppb df 4000 1000 between ph 5 5 6 5 the observed trend can be accounted for based on previously reported solubility products for the different uranium phosphates equations 3 5 despite the phosphate dosage being at a molar excess 6 25 1 po4 3 uo2 2 the theoretical uranyl solubility limit in the presence of excess phosphate u vi aq 10 10 m is not reached with the experimental solubility profile being akin to that of the modelled data for an equimolar phosphate uranyl addition u vi aq 10 7 m fig 4 highlighted area this is likely explained by the kinetics to reach thermodynamic equilibrium being slower than the 2 h allowed and or the fact that minor contaminants capable of forming phosphate species e g cu fe see table 1 were not taken into consideration in the model for comparison m kanematsu et al 2014 reported an experimentally determined u vi aq solubility at ph 5 of 10 10 m 23 8 ppt po4 3 uo2 2 3 after equilibrating for 30 days experimentally the lowest solubility was found under mildly acidic conditions compared to the modelled data indicating the lowest solubility at ph 7 0 this was similarly observed by kanematsu et al 2014 and was attributed to the reliability of published solubility products for uranium phosphate mineral phases namely meta ankoleite beyond ph 6 5 there is an increase in recorded uranium solubility likely due to dissolution of uranyl phosphate phases and the formation of uranyl carbonate species figs 2 and 4 despite this the concentration of uranium does not exceed the release limit at ph 9 0 irrespective of counter ion used beyond neutral ph the formation of insoluble uranyl oxide hydrates uranyl carbonates and uranyl silicates are thermodynamically favourable this is seen experimentally when no phosphate was added to the effluent and may explain why the uranyl concentration in the presence of phosphate does not reach the initial uranyl concentration fig 4 however the limit of solubility was never reached nor was the release limit until ph 9 0 under the conditions used this is likely to be the result of either 1 kinetics with the formation kinetics of uranyl silicates in particular being documented as slow soderholm et al 2008 or 2 the concentration of carbonate in the effluent being lower than predicted in the model due to insufficient time for the effluent to equilibrate with atmospheric co2 such slow kinetics and an inability to reach the release limit for uranium containing effluents is unsuitable for the process thus confirming the addition of phosphate as a viable option the concentration of co contaminants table 1 table s7 remaining in solution were also recorded at ph 6 25 major contaminants sb mo si and ca were removed by approximately 15 12 10 and 8 respectively corresponding to decontamination factors 1 2 minimal removal occurred indicating the feasibility to selectively remove uranium leaving the bulk of the other contaminants in solution for the purpose of further testing kh2po4 was chosen as the phosphate reagent despite a lower uranium solubility in the presence of nh4h2po4 this decision was taken in light of the superior thermal stability of kuo2po4 over nh4uo2po4 which decomposes beyond 250 c releasing ammonia schaekers 1974 this is due to a proposed high temperature sintering process for the final wasteform kim et al 2018b optimal phosphate dose was determined by varying the initial phosphate concentration in the range of 0 25 10 mm in effect approximately 2 100 times the molar concentration of uranium while maintaining the optimal ph 6 25 and a reaction time of 2 h under all tested conditions uranium removal was successful to below the release limit fig 5 showing the expected trend of higher phosphate doses resulting in greater uranium removal beyond a concentration of 2 mm po4 3 uranium was not detected in solution via icp oes based on these results a dose in the range of 0 5 2 mm was considered optimal due to the final uranium concentration being recorded two orders of magnitude lower than the release limit this would allow for variations in the uranium concentration of the incoming sims effluent to occur and still satisfy the release criteria thus providing an adequate safety margin 3 3 2 uranium removal kinetics kinetic profiles were obtained for optimal ph and dose 0 5 2 mm fig 6 the formation of visible precipitates identifiable by an increase in solution turbidity occurs instantaneously upon the addition of phosphate due to uranium phosphate formation the rapid removal of uranium to below the release limit was confirmed for all dose ranges when a dose of 1 mm po4 3 was used a uranium concentration of less than 10 ppb df 4000 could be obtained within 30 min a maximum precipitation time of 30 min is therefore considered optimal for the process uranium precipitated at a dosage of 4 mm phosphate was also performed for reference there appears to be no significant benefit to the removal kinetics or final uranium concentration under 30 min at this higher dose thus confirming that a dose of between 1 and 2 mm is optimal 3 3 3 variable so4 2 and uo2 2 consideration was made for variations in so4 2 and uo2 2 concentrations brought about by variations in ph control and silica cake acid washing stages on the viability of uranium phosphate precipitation it is considered that any changes would result in an increased sulfate concentration and a decreased uranium concentration through dilution in the event of an increased sulfate concentration all solutions were found to behave similarly with respect to the rate of uranium removal fig s2 after 2 h the uranium concentration is of the same order of magnitude to that of the sims solution so4 2 0 24 m table s8 it is concluded that sulfate concentration has little effect upon uranium removal thus any variations in sulfate concentration are considered negligible a possible explanation for this observation may be given by comparing uranyl sulfate and uranyl phosphate stability constants table s1 a simplistic approximation of the stability constants suggests that phosphate shows a greater affinity for uranyl over sulfate as exemplified by equations 9 and 10 9 uo2 2 so4 2 uo2so4 aq log k 3 15 10 uo2 2 h po4 3 uo2hpo4 aq log k 19 59 the effect of effluent dilution on the removal of uranium was also investigated table s4 solution analysis revealed the rapid removal 2 min of uranium to below the release limit regardless of dilution factor or phosphate concentration fig s3 table s9 however there was a measurable difference in uranium removal kinetics and final uranium concentration as a function of dilution dilution of the effluent resulted in reduced precipitation kinetics and an increase in the final uranium concentration after 2 h fig s3 altering the phosphate concentration further impacted the removal efficiency which ranged from 10 2 ppb no dilution to 95 8 ppb ten time dilution and decreased phosphate this corresponds to a 100 fold df decrease fig 7 in the unlikely event that a tenfold dilution occurred removal of uranium at or below 0 1 ppm is predicted to occur 3 3 4 solid characterisation the formation of pale yellow solids occurs rapidly upon the addition of phosphate and ph adjustment powder xrd analysis confirmed the solids to be the meta ankoleite mineral phase kuo2po4 3h2o database pattern pdf 29 1061 fig 8 lower than expected peak intensities and peak broadening indicates the particles to be semi amorphous this was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy fig 9 elemental mapping showed the particles contain a mix of uranium antimony and silicon 52 22 wt 3 76 wt and 6 35 wt respectively as the amount of sb falls below the 5 wt limit for xrd detection no phases were observed further no peaks can be assigned to si containing materials it is highly likely that the si material is amorphous silica particles carried across from the earlier si precipitation step the average mean volume size of the particles is 59 8 μm with little variation found as a function of phosphate concentration fig s4 table s10 the measured mean particle size is bigger than that found for the sims solution table 1 it is therefore likely that the fine si particles act at least in part as seed particles for the growth of kuo2po4 solids retaining these seed particles seems to cause no obvious detriment to the process therefore do not require removal prior to phosphate addition 3 4 phosphate removal environmental release of excess nutrients such as phosphate is problematic and leads to eutrophication chislock et al 2013 as such any remaining phosphate must be removed to acceptable levels for the purpose of free release in korea a total phosphorous t p concentration of 2 ppm or lower must be achieved for industrial effluents moe 2018 at the recommended phosphate dose of 1 mm t p of 31 ppm an excess t p of 16 2 ppm 0 5 mm is recorded and requires removal fig s5 the removal of excess phosphate via coagulant flocculation with an appropriate coagulant is well documented jenkins and hermanowicz 1991 typically aluminium calcium or iron compounds are dosed leading to the formation of insoluble metal phosphates 3 4 1 ph and dose screening the effect of selected coagulants on the removal of excess phosphate from the effluent as a function of ph is reported fig 10 during preliminary testing the initial phosphate dose was higher than recommended leading to an excess t p concentration of 86 ppm aluminium and iron coagulants are capable of phosphate removal across the ph range of 6 0 8 5 desirable for free release without further ph adjustment however a maximum removal of only 32 achieved with an initial iron iii chloride dosage of 1 mm is insufficient to meet the release requirements calcium was by far the worst performing coagulant across the tested ph range this is not entirely unexpected as calcium coagulants typically operate best at a ph 10 ayeche 2012 the efficiency of phosphate removal as a function of coagulant dosage was investigated at ph 7 0 both iron and aluminium coagulants were capable of removing phosphate from solution to below the required t p release limit at a dose of 5 mm fig 11 the addition of iron iii chloride was found to have the greatest effect at the lowest dose advantageous due to reduced reagent requirements and final solid volumes both calcium coagulants were found to be ineffective across the entire dose range based on the results of the ph and dose screening tests the coagulants can be ordered as follows fecl3 fe2so4 al2 so4 3 naalo2 cacl2 ca oh 2 at an excess t p concentration of 85 ppm 2 7 mm a minimum iron iii chloride dose of 5 mm was required for t p removal to below the release limit this corresponds to an iron to phosphorous molar ratio of fe p 2 at the recommended phosphate dose of 1 mm the excess t p concentration is expected to be around 16 ppm 0 5 mm and would require a minimum iron iii chloride dose of 1 mm therefore for the purposes of excess phosphate removal iron iii chloride was identified as the most suitable coagulant at a minimum fe p 2 followed by ph adjustment to ph 7 0 3 4 2 kinetics kinetic profiles were obtained for three dosages of iron iii chloride 1 5 and 10 mm precipitation occurred rapidly at all three dosages however only a dose of 5 mm fecl3 was capable of removing phosphate to below the t p 2 ppm release limit fig 12 when a dose of 5 mm iron iii chloride was used a t p concentration of 0 2 ppm was obtained within a minute the resulting phosphate concentration was found to remain constant over the course of 2 h a maximum precipitation time of 15 min at a dose ratio of 2 is therefore considered suitable for the real process 3 4 3 solid characterisation brown amorphous precipitates occurred at each of the tested iron dosages after iron iii chloride addition and ph adjustment fig s6 image analysis showed a range of particle sizes were formed as confirmed by particle size analysis fig 13 fig s7 the size of the particles were found to increase as a function of iron dosage while the spread of sizes decreased an iron dose of 5 mm produced particles sufficiently large enough for filtration through a 0 2 μm filter cloth as used for the removal of silica kim et al 2018a however a dose increase to 10 mm would likely yield better filtration properties based on the larger average particle size and narrower spread fig 13 no iron phosphate phases were identifiable from powder xrd confirming earlier image analysis that the precipitates are amorphous fig s8 potassium sodium sulfate was identified present after solid drying 4 bench scale verification repeatability tests were conducted to verify the process including a solid liquid separation stage using 2 l of effluent optimal conditions were used for both uranium and phosphate removal uranium removal of 99 99 df 8000 was readily achievable under 30 and 4 min for phosphate dosages of 1 mm bench 01 and 2 mm bench 02 respectively fig s9 the size of the formed particles were comparable to those formed during earlier tests mean size of 53 8 and 32 9 μm for bench 01 and bench 02 respectively and were found to settle quickly from solution leaving a clear supernatant in under 15 min fig s10 table s11 a uranium phosphate yield of 1 2 0 1 ml of solid per 10 l of treated effluent was achieved corresponding to a volume reduction factor 7500 separation of the solid using a filter press was successful and resulted in reduced solution turbidity fig s10 fig s11 table s11 and table s12 solid phase analysis confirmed a mix of meta ankoleite antimony v oxide and sodium potassium sulfate the latter of which was removed by washing with water fig s12 the chemical composition of the final solid formed after filtering 2 l of effluent is presented in table 2 there is a high si content owing to the use of the diatomite filter aid the uranium content was found to be 2 4 0 02 wt corresponding to an estimated activity of 360 bq g which is too high for clearance but sufficiently low to meet the radiological disposal requirements of the gyeongju low and intermediate level waste repository korea the limit for which is 3 700 bq g for α emitting radionuclides korad 2011 an increased throughput of effluent per mass of filter aid could be possible resulting in a higher uranium content in the final solid while still meeting radiological requirements table s13 phosphate removal via the addition of iron iii chloride at the bench scale was confirmed table 3 shows the concentration of the contaminants present in the solution prior to iron iii chloride dosage fig 14 shows the remaining t p after a 15 min precipitation period fig 14 also shows the resultant floc volumes after being allowed to settle for 1 h fig s13 the addition of 5 mm iron iii chloride is sufficient to reduce the phosphate concentration to below the 2 ppm t p release limit furthermore a dose of 50 mm is sufficient to reduce the concentration of each element to below 1 ppm with the exception of mo 2 3 ppm which required a 100 mm dose for removal below 1 ppm fig s14 fig s15 table s14 however this increase in iron dosage 5 mm generates significant floc volumes and decreasing volume reduction factors thus is therefore not proposed for the purpose of phosphate removal fig 14 table s15 table 4 summarizes allowable release criteria for wastewaters in korea and the quality of the final effluent generated after iron dosing the effluent generated from the process meets all relevant release criteria and is therefore suitable for implementation within korea 5 proposed process flow sheet a proposed process flow sheet is illustrated in fig 15 for simplicity the catalyst dissolution and silica precipitation stages are combined as u catalyst treatment the proposed effluent treatment is as follows wastewater from the silica cake washing is combined with the uranium laden effluent from the silica precipitation stage mono potassium phosphate is dosed 1 mm into the effluent before ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 optimal for meta ankoleite formation precipitate growth is allowed to progress under slow stirring for 30 min after which the precipitated uranium phosphate slurry is separated by filtration with the use of a diatomite filter aid the separated solid is to be sent for immobilisation and disposal as llw 1 bq g waste 3 700 bq g alpha the resulting phosphate containing effluent is then dosed with iron iii chloride fe p 2 before a final ph adjustment 7 0 iron induced flocculation is allowed to occur for 15 min a second solid liquid separation stage is proposed with the resulting effluent and solids screened before free release 6 conclusions a suitable uranium removal method based on the formation of insoluble uranium phosphate has been proposed and verified at the laboratory and bench scales optimal process conditions ph 6 0 6 5 counter ion k phosphate dosage 1 mm po4 3 uo2 2 6 25 and precipitation time 30 min have been determined resulting in a recorded removal percentage and df for uranium of 99 99 and 8000 respectively the process has been shown to be robust to process variables namely sulfate concentration and initial uranium concentration due to dilution a final uranium concentration of 10 ppb is readily achievable and well below the korean release limit of 1 ppm for uranium bearing effluents a treatment process for the resulting effluent containing excess phosphate is also suggested based on iron induced flocculation phosphate removal to below the 2 ppm t p release limit is achievable with an iron to phosphate molar ratio of 2 at ph 7 0 additional iron dosage leads to the removal of additional contaminants i e si sb and mo both precipitation steps have been verified at the bench scale and show good agreement with the laboratory scale tests further a process flow sheet suitable for integration into the current uranium catalyst treatment process has been suggested based on experimental results and process technologies currently utilized throughout the treatment of the uranium catalyst the success of the laboratory tests and bench scale verification has led to the commissioning of pilot plant testing based on the described uranium removal method and process flow sheet notes

18810,we have investigated the suitability of phosphate addition in the form mh2po4 m na k or nh4 for the selective removal of uranium from a complex waste effluent the effluent in question is generated as part of a treatment strategy for a spent uranium catalyst used in the production of acrylonitrile sohio process which has been in temporary storage in korea since 2004 both ph 3 0 11 0

uses in the modern world beyond energy production typically as depleted uranium 0 7 235u nas 1971 instances of depleted uranium containing materials include counterweights roberts 1999 radiation

antimonite usb3o10 active phase catalyst callahan and berthold 1965 cavani et al 2009 despite the beneficial uses uranium is one of the most damaging heavy metals due to its radioactivity and bio toxicity and is a contaminant of great concern for industry and governments alike defra 2001 who 2001 therefore it must be handled and disposed of correctly to limit unwarranted environmental release with strict discharge controls in place 1 bq g iaea 2004 this is particularly prevalent when uranium containing materials reach their end of life and require disposal with even low level uranium wastes requiring some form of treatment and or long term storage and disposal management strategy oecd iaea 2001 this need for responsible treatment and disposal methods leads to an ever growing wealth of knowledge surrounding radioactive waste treatment processes iaea 1997 it is in light of these issues coupled with subsequent catalysts offering process improvements that the uranium catalyst used in the sohio process has been phased out horvath 2002 despite this change initially occurring some 30 40 years ago remnants still remain awaiting appropriate waste management strategies notable cases exist in japan sugai 2007 and korea kim et al 2018a in korea approximately 7000 drums 200 l of the spent uranium antimonite catalyst has been in temporary storage since 2004 sugai 2007 kim et al

strategy recently the korea atomic energy research institute kaeri has developed such a process to treat and ultimately dispose of this spent catalyst kim et al 2018a 2018b the process has proved successful for the treatment and volume reduction of the catalyst waste however during the process a large amount of complex waste effluent is generated which requires a uranium decontamination

phase uo2o2 h2o 4 was found to be successful for the removal of uranium oh et al 2018 unfortunately the removal kinetics were far too slow for commercial scale and thus was ultimately inadequate consequently a new treatment method was required for the rapid 2 h and selective removal of uranium to levels adequate for release uranium phosphate mineral formation has garnered a lot of interest in recent years for the purpose of uranium sequestering and immobilisation owing to their low solubility and high stability vermeul et al 2006 zheng et al 2006 mehta et al 2013 kanematsu et al 2014 martinez et al 2014 this interest is backed by extensive literature on the thermodynamic stability and solubility of such minerals due to their importance as secondary uranium mineral phases and as uranium thermodynamic sinks in radionuclide contaminated groundwater and soil vesely et al 1964 markovic et al 1988 haverbeke et al 1996 gorman lewis et al 2008 the latter being particularly relevant

thermodynamic literature has been well documented and summarized by gorman lewis et al 2008 as part of a review of uranyl mineral solubilities in addition martinez et al 2014 offers a review of phosphate induced metal remediation and sequestering which includes numerous references to the sequestering of uranium from contaminated sub surface soils groundwater treatment and expands to the implementation of reactive geo barriers despite this knowledge there has been limited application of uranium phosphate phase formation as a method of waste treatment although there is some application in the mining industry iaea 1993 dulama et al 2013 the formation of insoluble uranium phosphate precipitates as part of a problematic radioactive effluent treatment process has the potential for the rapid and effective decontamination of such waste streams in this paper we describe the steps taken to screen and verify a uranium removal method via phosphate addition mh2po4 m na k or nh4 for the

the spent catalyst consists of a uranium antimonite active phase usb3o10 3 to 7 wt u 15 to 25 wt sb on a silica support 70 vol as silica constitutes the largest volume fraction this was targeted for removal via dissolution and purification for a theoretical 70 volume reduction following thermal treatment 550 600 c for 3 h to remove tar like substances formed during acrylonitrile synthesis the catalyst was dissolved in 4 m naoh 5 ml g at 105 c a solid liquid filtration stage was performed to separate the dissolved silica from undissolved residual particulates a portion of uranium was carried over into solution as part of the dissolution stage the dissolved silica is precipitated from solution by ph adjustment to below ph 10 via the addition of h2so4 to prevent the co precipitation of residual uranium it was retained in solution by the formation of the soluble uranyl peroxocarbonate species uo2 o2 co3 2 4 by the addition of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide prior to any ph adjustment kim et al 2012 a second solid liquid filtration stage was performed to separate the precipitated silica from the uranium laden effluent the solid silica cake was washed twice with water and once with h2so4 to further purify the silica for free release 1 bq g alpha the water and acid washes were combined with the uranium effluent which awaits a uranium removal method fig 1 the chemical and physical properties of the resulting effluent hereinafter referred to as sims silica mixed solution are summarized in table 1 2 3 thermodynamic calculations to establish uranium speciation

reached 3 0 10 5 and allowed to react for 2 h at room temperature 25 c the addition of ca oh 2 for the formation of autunite was considered however due to calcium sulfate formation and the excessive consumption of reagents this was not used aliquots of the supernatant 2 5 ml were sampled and filtered through a syringe filter 0 22 μm after reaction completion for icp oes analysis for the purpose of kinetic analysis the target ph and phosphate dosages were fixed at 6 25 and 0 5 4 0 mm respectively solution samples were taken at 30 s and 1 2 4 8 16 30 60 and 120 min and prepared for icp oes

at ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 9 sims water corresponding to initial uranium concentrations of 20 10 and 4 ppm respectively the phosphate dose was either varied to compensate the reduced uranium

results and discussion 3 1 effluent characterisation the effluent prior to phosphate dosing is highly acidic ph 0 86 and possess a high conductivity and ionic strength of 85 18 ms cm and 0 75 m respectively due to the high concentration of so4 2 0 24 m table 1 the effluent is also considerably turbid 149 ntu corresponding to 280 mg l of suspended solids particle size morphological and elemental analysis of the solids via psa and sem edx analysis show irregularly shaped amorphous silica particles with an average particle size of 17 2 μm the uranium content of the waste is found to be of the order of 40 ppm 0 16 mm despite the prior silica precipitation step a considerable amount of dissolved silicon remains in solution at approximately 20 times higher than the molar concentration of uranium table 1 table s7 3 2 thermodynamic calculations calculated thermodynamic solubility of u vi aq in the effluent in the presence of molar excess phosphate po4 3 uo2 2 10 as a function of ph is reported fig 2 dissolved u vi aq concentration is predicted to be lowest u vi aq 10 10 m at circumneutral ph due to the formation of insoluble uranium phosphates gorman lewis et al 2008 the presence of high sulfate concentrations as found in the effluent owing to the h2so4 ph control will result in soluble uranium sulfate species dominating under acidic conditions amphlett et al 2018 the shape and position of the solubility curve between ph 3 8 is found to be in good agreement with previous published values namely gorman lewis et al 2008 and kanematsu et al 2014 beyond ph 8 a difference in modelled solubility is noted between kanematsu et al 2014 and the results in this study due to the inclusion of carbonate uranium forms stable water soluble uranyl carbonate species under alkaline conditions with uranyl tricarbonate dominating at higher ph gorman lewis et al 2008 kim et al 2009 as there is no attempt to control carbon dioxide ingress into the effluent carbonate should be present the effect of carbonate upon uranium solubility must therefore be considered as part of the precipitation process thus maintaining a ph 8 0 is desirable to prevent soluble uranyl carbonate formation fig 2 thermodynamically the lowest u vi aq concentration excluding uranyl phosphate precipitation is predicted to occur at ph 7 8 8 0 owing to the formation of insoluble uranyl oxide hydrates uranyl carbonate and uranyl silicate species fig 2 black dotted line the precipitation of which are predicted to start at ph 5 2 a significantly higher ph than when phosphate is present beyond ph 8 0 uranium is re solubilised as anionic uranyl carbonate species the point of lowest solubility is predicted to be both higher and narrower than when uranyl phosphate precipitation occurs modelling uranyl solubility as a function of uranyl phosphate precipitation only predicts the solubility of u vi aq to increase rapidly beyond ph 7 6 until ph 9 2 fig 2 black dot dash line due to uranyl phosphate dissolution as similarly predicted by kanematsu et al 2014 at an equimolar concentration of phosphate uranyl the removal of uranium from solution is predicted to be predominated by uranyl phosphate formation prior to ph 6 0 while uranyl oxide hydrates carbonates and silicates dominate at higher ph fig 3 black solid line the lowest u vi aq solubility is predicted at ph 7 4 u vi aq 10 9 m which is identical to when no phosphate is present fig 3 black dash line considering only uranyl phosphate precipitation the limit of u vi aq solubility occurs at ph 7 0 u vi aq 10 7 m corresponding to a concentration of 22 5 ppb fig 3 black dot dash line substantially lower than the korean release limit of 1 ppm thus the addition of phosphate even at equimolar concentration offers a thermodynamically viable option for the removal of uranium from the process effluent 3 3 u vi removal 3 3 1 ph and dose screening the effect of different phosphate reagents on the removal of uranium from solution as a function of ph is reported fig 4 uranium removal in the absence of phosphate was also measured comparing these results it is clear that the addition of phosphate has a dramatic effect on the removal of uranium to concentrations well below the release limit at ph 5 0 the final uranium concentration is also dependent upon the counter ion used according to the order nh4 k na although all three readily achieve uranium removal of 99 88 11 0 38 8 ppb df 4000 1000 between ph 5 5 6 5 the observed trend can be accounted for based on previously reported solubility products for the different uranium phosphates equations 3 5 despite the phosphate dosage being at a molar excess 6 25 1 po4 3 uo2 2 the theoretical uranyl solubility limit in the presence of excess phosphate u vi aq 10 10 m is not reached with the experimental solubility profile being akin to that of the modelled data for an equimolar phosphate uranyl addition u vi aq 10 7 m fig 4 highlighted area this is likely explained by the kinetics to reach thermodynamic equilibrium being slower than the 2 h allowed and or the fact that minor contaminants capable of forming phosphate species e g cu fe see table 1 were not taken into consideration in the model for comparison m kanematsu et al 2014 reported an experimentally determined u vi aq solubility at ph 5 of 10 10 m 23 8 ppt po4 3 uo2 2 3 after equilibrating for 30 days experimentally the lowest solubility was found under mildly acidic conditions compared to the modelled data indicating the lowest solubility at ph 7 0 this was similarly observed by kanematsu et al 2014 and was attributed to the reliability of published solubility products for uranium phosphate mineral phases namely meta ankoleite beyond ph 6 5 there is an increase in recorded uranium solubility likely due to dissolution of uranyl phosphate phases and the formation of uranyl carbonate species figs 2 and 4 despite this the concentration of uranium does not exceed the release limit at ph 9 0 irrespective of counter ion used beyond neutral ph the formation of insoluble uranyl oxide hydrates uranyl carbonates and uranyl silicates are thermodynamically favourable this is seen experimentally when no phosphate was added to the effluent and may explain why the uranyl concentration in the presence of phosphate does not reach the initial uranyl concentration fig 4 however the limit of solubility was never reached nor was the release limit until ph 9 0 under the conditions used this is likely to be the result of either 1 kinetics with the formation kinetics of uranyl silicates in particular being documented as slow soderholm et al 2008 or 2 the concentration of carbonate in the effluent being lower than predicted in the model due to insufficient time for the effluent to equilibrate with atmospheric co2 such slow kinetics and an inability to reach the release limit for uranium containing effluents is unsuitable for the process thus confirming the addition of phosphate as a viable option the concentration of co contaminants table 1 table s7 remaining in solution were also recorded at ph 6 25 major contaminants sb mo si and ca were removed by approximately 15 12 10 and 8 respectively corresponding to decontamination factors 1 2 minimal removal occurred indicating the feasibility to selectively remove uranium leaving the bulk of the other contaminants in solution for the purpose of further testing kh2po4 was chosen as the phosphate reagent despite a lower uranium solubility in the presence of nh4h2po4 this decision was taken in light of the superior thermal stability of kuo2po4 over nh4uo2po4 which decomposes beyond 250 c releasing ammonia schaekers 1974 this is due to a proposed high temperature sintering process for the final wasteform kim et al 2018b optimal phosphate dose was determined by varying the initial phosphate concentration in the range of 0 25 10 mm in effect approximately 2 100 times the molar concentration of uranium while maintaining the optimal ph 6 25 and a reaction time of 2 h under all tested conditions uranium removal was successful to below the release limit fig 5 showing the expected trend of higher phosphate doses resulting in greater uranium removal beyond a concentration of 2 mm po4 3 uranium was not detected in solution via icp oes based on these results a dose in the range of 0 5 2 mm was considered optimal due to the final uranium concentration being recorded two orders of magnitude lower than the release limit this would allow for variations in the uranium concentration of the incoming sims effluent to occur and still satisfy the release criteria thus providing an adequate safety margin 3 3 2 uranium removal kinetics kinetic profiles were obtained for optimal ph and dose 0 5 2 mm fig 6 the formation of visible precipitates identifiable by an increase in solution turbidity occurs instantaneously upon the addition of phosphate due to uranium phosphate formation the rapid removal of uranium to below the release limit was confirmed for all dose ranges when a dose of 1 mm po4 3 was used a uranium concentration of less than 10 ppb df 4000 could be obtained within 30 min a maximum precipitation time of 30 min is therefore considered optimal for the process uranium precipitated at a dosage of 4 mm phosphate was also performed for reference there appears to be no significant benefit to the removal kinetics or final uranium concentration under 30 min at this higher dose thus confirming that a dose of between 1 and 2 mm is optimal 3 3 3 variable so4 2 and uo2 2 consideration was made for variations in so4 2 and uo2 2 concentrations brought about by variations in ph control and silica cake acid washing stages on the viability of uranium phosphate precipitation it is considered that any changes would result in an increased sulfate concentration and a decreased uranium concentration through dilution in the event of an increased sulfate concentration all solutions were found to behave similarly with respect to the rate of uranium removal fig s2 after 2 h the uranium concentration is of the same order of magnitude to that of the sims solution so4 2 0 24 m table s8 it is concluded that sulfate concentration has little effect upon uranium removal thus any variations in sulfate concentration are considered negligible a possible explanation for this observation may be given by comparing uranyl sulfate and uranyl phosphate stability constants table s1 a simplistic approximation of the stability constants suggests that phosphate shows a greater affinity for uranyl over sulfate as exemplified by equations 9 and 10 9 uo2 2 so4 2 uo2so4 aq log k 3 15 10 uo2 2 h po4 3 uo2hpo4 aq log k 19 59 the effect of effluent dilution on the removal of uranium was also investigated table s4 solution analysis revealed the rapid removal 2 min of uranium to below the release limit regardless of dilution factor or phosphate concentration fig s3 table s9 however there was a measurable difference in uranium removal kinetics and final uranium concentration as a function of dilution dilution of the effluent resulted in reduced precipitation kinetics and an increase in the final uranium concentration after 2 h fig s3 altering the phosphate concentration further impacted the removal efficiency which ranged from 10 2 ppb no dilution to 95 8 ppb ten time dilution and decreased phosphate this corresponds to a 100 fold df decrease fig 7 in the unlikely event that a tenfold dilution occurred removal of uranium at or below 0 1 ppm is predicted to occur 3 3 4 solid characterisation the formation of pale yellow solids occurs rapidly upon the addition of phosphate and ph adjustment powder xrd analysis confirmed the solids to be the meta ankoleite mineral phase kuo2po4 3h2o database pattern pdf 29 1061 fig 8 lower than expected peak intensities and peak broadening indicates the particles to be semi amorphous this was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy fig 9 elemental mapping showed the particles contain a mix of uranium antimony and silicon 52 22 wt 3 76 wt and 6 35 wt respectively as the amount of sb falls below the 5 wt limit for xrd detection no phases were observed further no peaks can be assigned to si containing materials it is highly likely that the si material is amorphous silica particles carried across from the earlier si precipitation step the average mean volume size of the particles is 59 8 μm with little variation found as a function of phosphate concentration fig s4 table s10 the measured mean particle size is bigger than that found for the sims solution table 1 it is therefore likely that the fine si particles act at least in part as seed particles for the growth of kuo2po4 solids retaining these seed particles seems to cause no obvious detriment to the process therefore do not require removal prior to phosphate addition 3 4 phosphate removal environmental release of excess nutrients such as phosphate is problematic and leads to eutrophication chislock et al 2013 as such any remaining phosphate must be removed to acceptable levels for the purpose of free release in korea a total phosphorous t p concentration of 2 ppm or lower must be achieved for industrial effluents moe 2018 at the recommended phosphate dose of 1 mm t p of 31 ppm an excess t p of 16 2 ppm 0 5 mm is recorded and requires removal fig s5 the removal of excess phosphate via coagulant flocculation with an appropriate coagulant is well documented jenkins and hermanowicz 1991 typically aluminium calcium or iron compounds are dosed leading to the formation of insoluble metal phosphates 3 4 1 ph and dose screening the effect of selected coagulants on the removal of excess phosphate from the effluent as a function of ph is reported fig 10 during preliminary testing the initial phosphate dose was higher than recommended leading to an excess t p concentration of 86 ppm aluminium and iron coagulants are capable of phosphate removal across the ph range of 6 0 8 5 desirable for free release without further ph adjustment however a maximum removal of only 32 achieved with an initial iron iii chloride dosage of 1 mm is insufficient to meet the release requirements calcium was by far the worst performing coagulant across the tested ph range this is not entirely unexpected as calcium coagulants typically operate best at a ph 10 ayeche 2012 the efficiency of phosphate removal as a function of coagulant dosage was investigated at ph 7 0 both iron and aluminium coagulants were capable of removing phosphate from solution to below the required t p release limit at a dose of 5 mm fig 11 the addition of iron iii chloride was found to have the greatest effect at the lowest dose advantageous due to reduced reagent requirements and final solid volumes both calcium coagulants were found to be ineffective across the entire dose range based on the results of the ph and dose screening tests the coagulants can be ordered as follows fecl3 fe2so4 al2 so4 3 naalo2 cacl2 ca oh 2 at an excess t p concentration of 85 ppm 2 7 mm a minimum iron iii chloride dose of 5 mm was required for t p removal to below the release limit this corresponds to an iron to phosphorous molar ratio of fe p 2 at the recommended phosphate dose of 1 mm the excess t p concentration is expected to be around 16 ppm 0 5 mm and would require a minimum iron iii chloride dose of 1 mm therefore for the purposes of excess phosphate removal iron iii chloride was identified as the most suitable coagulant at a minimum fe p 2 followed by ph adjustment to ph 7 0 3 4 2 kinetics kinetic profiles were obtained for three dosages of iron iii chloride 1 5 and 10 mm precipitation occurred rapidly at all three dosages however only a dose of 5 mm fecl3 was capable of removing phosphate to below the t p 2 ppm release limit fig 12 when a dose of 5 mm iron iii chloride was used a t p concentration of 0 2 ppm was obtained within a minute the resulting phosphate concentration was found to remain constant over the course of 2 h a maximum precipitation time of 15 min at a dose ratio of 2 is therefore considered suitable for the real process 3 4 3 solid characterisation brown amorphous precipitates occurred at each of the tested iron dosages after iron iii chloride addition and ph adjustment fig s6 image analysis showed a range of particle sizes were formed as confirmed by particle size analysis fig 13 fig s7 the size of the particles were found to increase as a function of iron dosage while the spread of sizes decreased an iron dose of 5 mm produced particles sufficiently large enough for filtration through a 0 2 μm filter cloth as used for the removal of silica kim et al 2018a however a dose increase to 10 mm would likely yield better filtration properties based on the larger average particle size and narrower spread fig 13 no iron phosphate phases were identifiable from powder xrd confirming earlier image analysis that the precipitates are amorphous fig s8 potassium sodium sulfate was identified present after solid drying 4 bench scale verification repeatability tests were conducted to verify the process including a solid liquid separation stage using 2 l of effluent optimal conditions were used for both uranium and phosphate removal uranium removal of 99 99 df 8000 was readily achievable under 30 and 4 min for phosphate dosages of 1 mm bench 01 and 2 mm bench 02 respectively fig s9 the size of the formed particles were comparable to those formed during earlier tests mean size of 53 8 and 32 9 μm for bench 01 and bench 02 respectively and were found to settle quickly from solution leaving a clear supernatant in under 15 min fig s10 table s11 a uranium phosphate yield of 1 2 0 1 ml of solid per 10 l of treated effluent was achieved corresponding to a volume reduction factor 7500 separation of the solid using a filter press was successful and resulted in reduced solution turbidity fig s10 fig s11 table s11 and table s12 solid phase analysis confirmed a mix of meta ankoleite antimony v oxide and sodium potassium sulfate the latter of which was removed by washing with water fig s12 the chemical composition of the final solid formed after filtering 2 l of effluent is presented in table 2 there is a high si content owing to the use of the diatomite filter aid the uranium content was found to be 2 4 0 02 wt corresponding to an estimated activity of 360 bq g which is too high for clearance but sufficiently low to meet the radiological disposal requirements of the gyeongju low and intermediate level waste repository korea the limit for which is 3 700 bq g for α emitting radionuclides korad 2011 an increased throughput of effluent per mass of filter aid could be possible resulting in a higher uranium content in the final solid while still meeting radiological requirements table s13 phosphate removal via the addition of iron iii chloride at the bench scale was confirmed table 3 shows the concentration of the contaminants present in the solution prior to iron iii chloride dosage fig 14 shows the remaining t p after a 15 min precipitation period fig 14 also shows the resultant floc volumes after being allowed to settle for 1 h fig s13 the addition of 5 mm iron iii chloride is sufficient to reduce the phosphate concentration to below the 2 ppm t p release limit furthermore a dose of 50 mm is sufficient to reduce the concentration of each element to below 1 ppm with the exception of mo 2 3 ppm which required a 100 mm dose for removal below 1 ppm fig s14 fig s15 table s14 however this increase in iron dosage 5 mm generates significant floc volumes and decreasing volume reduction factors thus is therefore not proposed for the purpose of phosphate removal fig 14 table s15 table 4 summarizes allowable release criteria for wastewaters in korea and the quality of the final effluent generated after iron dosing the effluent generated from the process meets all relevant release criteria and is therefore suitable for implementation within korea 5 proposed process flow sheet a proposed process flow sheet is illustrated in fig 15 for simplicity the catalyst dissolution and silica precipitation stages are combined as u catalyst treatment the proposed effluent treatment is as follows wastewater from the silica cake washing is combined with the uranium laden effluent from the silica precipitation stage mono potassium phosphate is dosed 1 mm into the effluent before ph adjustment 6 0 6 5 optimal for meta ankoleite formation precipitate growth is allowed to progress under slow stirring for 30 min after which the precipitated uranium phosphate slurry is separated by filtration with the use of a diatomite filter aid the separated solid is to be sent for immobilisation and disposal as llw 1 bq g waste 3 700 bq g alpha the resulting phosphate containing effluent is then dosed with iron iii chloride fe p 2 before a final ph adjustment 7 0 iron induced flocculation is allowed to occur for 15 min a second solid liquid separation stage is proposed with the resulting effluent and solids screened before free release 6 conclusions a suitable uranium removal method based on the formation of insoluble uranium phosphate has been proposed and verified at the laboratory and bench scales optimal process conditions ph 6 0 6 5 counter ion k phosphate dosage 1 mm po4 3 uo2 2 6 25 and precipitation time 30 min have been determined resulting in a recorded removal percentage and df for uranium of 99 99 and 8000 respectively the process has been shown to be robust to process variables namely sulfate concentration and initial uranium concentration due to dilution a final uranium concentration of 10 ppb is readily achievable and well below the korean release limit of 1 ppm for uranium bearing effluents a treatment process for the resulting effluent containing excess phosphate is also suggested based on iron induced flocculation phosphate removal to below the 2 ppm t p release limit is achievable with an iron to phosphate molar ratio of 2 at ph 7 0 additional iron dosage leads to the removal of additional contaminants i e si sb and mo both precipitation steps have been verified at the bench scale and show good agreement with the laboratory scale tests further a process flow sheet suitable for integration into the current uranium catalyst treatment process has been suggested based on experimental results and process technologies currently utilized throughout the treatment of the uranium catalyst the success of the laboratory tests and bench scale verification has led to the commissioning of pilot plant testing based on the described uranium removal method and process flow sheet notes

18811,this study discovered a strong correlation between the autoinducer 2 ai 2 mediated quorum sensing qs with the performance of a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor during its recovery from a pentachlorophenol pcp shock a decrease in ai 2 levels coincided with a reduction in volatile fatty acid concentrations and corresponded significantly to a decrease in the relative abundance of firmicutes and to an increase in the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and synergistetes further batch experiments with the addition of an ai 2 regulating escherichia coli mutant culture showed that a reduction in ai 2 levels resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a pcp shock in contrast an increase in ai 2 levels via addition of the e coli wild type strain or an ai 2 precursor showed no obvious effects on biogas production these results suggest that the ai 2 level in anaerobic sludge was governed primarily by firmicutes and the ai 2 mediated qs partially regulates the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge via tuning the activities of firmicutes and synergistetes a decrease in the ai 2 level might reduce acetogenesis and favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus resulting in less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock this study is the first of this type that exploits the role of quorum sensing in the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge it demonstrates a novel approach to shortening the recovery period of anaerobic processes via manipulating the ai 2 mediated qs graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum sensing anaerobic digestion anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr ai 2 toxic shock 1 introduction quorum sensing qs a cell to cell communication system among bacteria has been extensively exploited in pure cultures for the control of group dependant activities including bioluminescence biofilm formation and virulence ng and bassler 2009 the two major classes of qs molecules that have been well characterized are n acyl homoserine lactones ahls which primarily drive intraspecies communication and autoinducer 2 ai 2 which mediates interspecies communication both have been widely detected in complex engineered microbiomes such as activated sludge aerobic and anaerobic granules and their roles in regulating aerobic biofilms and granule formation are partially understood tan et al 2014 xu and liu 2011 and exploited to reduce biofouling in aerobic membrane bioreactors mbrs oh and lee 2018 compared with the extensive investigations of qs in aerobic sludge processes its roles in anaerobic systems have rarely been described in the literature ahls were discovered in a methanogenic archaeon methanosaeta harundinacea however with a carboxyl group substitution they were structurally different from previously described aerobic ahls and regulated the change of cells from rods to filaments favoring the conversion of acetate to methane zhang et al 2012 li et al 2015 further found that the addition of ahl extracts of a m harundinacea culture to a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor greatly enhanced sludge granulation thereby significantly improving its overall performance ding et al 2015 also showed that the addition of either ahl or ai 2 could enhance anaerobic granulation not surprisingly a deeper fundamental understanding of the regulation of qs signalling molecules could aid in opening up a new way of improving the stability and or efficiency of anaerobic systems ai 2 is a group of signalling molecules that are produced spontaneously from 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd the only product of the ai 2 synthesizing gene luxs taga and xavier 2011 vendeville et al 2005 the two characterized ai 2 molecules are chemically different one is produced from a reaction of a dpd derivative with borate and thus contains boron while the other has no boron taga and xavier 2011 the boron associated ai 2 is commonly observed in marine bacteria e g vibrio spp while the non boron associated ai 2 is used by other non marine bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium escherichia coli and others therefore ai 2 activity was proposed to be niche dependent vendeville et al 2005 recent studies suggest that ai 2 mediated qs also plays a role in bacterial stress response an acidic stress increased the ai 2 concentration of a lactobacillus culture moslehi jenabian et al 2009 yeo et al 2015 further discovered that the stresses of bile acid temperature osmotic pressure and starvation all affected the ai 2 concentration of lactobacillus spp and resulted in a species and strain specific increase or decrease in ai 2 levels very recently gu et al 2018 observed higher transcription numbers of the ai 2 mediating gene luxs when l fermentum was under above stress conditions like acid shock low temperature and high osmotic pressure in addition to these fermentative bacteria similar results were also observed in anaerobic granular sludge where an increase in ai 2 content was linked to its stress response to short term nitrogen overloads ding et al 2016 these studies on pure cultures and sludge suggest that a general stress response system involving ai 2 mediated qs occurs in anaerobic systems which could be exploited as a tool to improve their resistance to shocks these systems i e methanogenesis are particularly vulnerable to various toxicants which often result in upset or even temporary shutdown of the process chen et al 2008 therefore the objective of this study was to gain a greater understanding of the role that ai 2 mediated qs has on anaerobic digestion in response to toxic shocks and to exploit this as a novel approach to shorten the recovery period of anaerobic digestion after toxic shocks the anaerobic digester used here was coupled with a membrane for biosolids separation i e an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr due to its ability to reduce the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor thus reducing the system size and footprint and hence increasing its economic viability stuckey 2012 pentachlorophenol pcp was used as a model organic toxicant and was fed to one anmbr anmbr pcp running in parallel with a control anmbr anmbr c operated under identical conditions without any toxic shocks the ai 2 levels in the anmbrs were found to correlate with the reactor performance very well and the microbial community analysis revealed that the correlation was microbe dependant then ai 2 dpd was added into batch reactors under a toxic shock of pcp to investigate the impacts of increased ai 2 levels on toxic resistance of methanogenic sludge finally an ai 2 regulating e coli mutant culture was used in other batch digesters to investigate the impact of reduced ai 2 levels on the pcp shock resistance of the methanogenic sludge 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals pcp from sigma aldrich singapore was used as a model organic toxicant in this study due to its well known toxicity to anaerobic digestion sludge chen et al 2008 dpd was purchased from omm scientific inc dallas tx usa while the stable isotope labelled 13c dpd and dimethyl 2 2 4 5 diamino 1 2 phenylene bis oxy diacetate m1cq were purchased from the instituto de tecnologia química e biológica oeiras portugal 2 2 anmbr set up and operation two identical flat sheet submerged anmbrs effective volume of 3 2 l were set up in the laboratory with a kubota microfiltration membrane module filtration area 0 11 m2 and pore size 0 4 μm details of the anmbrs are provided elsewhere kunacheva et al 2017 both anmbrs were operated at 35 c using a water bath to treat an oecd synthetic sewage oecd 2010 see the composition in the supporting information si table s1 the hrt was controlled at 6 h and the sludge retention time srt was controlled at 213 days via sampling 30 ml of the mixed liquor every 2 days the seed sludge was obtained from ulu pandan water reclamation plant singapore and maintained in 4x oecd synthetic sewage with a chemical oxygen demand cod of 2000 mg l for more than 1 year in order to avoid frequent membrane cleaning the flux was maintained constant at a low level of 5 l m2 h lmh the transmembrane pressure tmp ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were continuously monitored with a digital pressure gauge cole parmer usa and a ph orp probe inpro 4260i mettler toledo usa connected to a data logger after more than 160 days of stable operation 10 μm of pcp was fed into the anmbr pcp continuously for 15 days which significantly inhibited cod removal and biogas production see fig 1 after this addition ceased the reactor was operated under normal conditions until it recovered the anmbr c was operated at normal conditions without any toxic shocks 2 3 ai 2 signalling molecule add in test dpd was added to the batch anaerobic digestion sludge assay either 1 h before the exposure to pcp pre addition or 1 h after the exposure to pcp post addition to investigate the impact of increased ai 2 levels on the sludge under a pcp shock before the experiment the seed sludge was washed once with tap water resuspended in fresh oecd medium and added to 20 ml hungate tubes at a final concentration of 1 g l vss then an appropriate volume of oecd medium containing pcp was added to each tube to result in a final pcp concentration of 15 μm in a final volume of 10 ml the tubes were flushed with n2 sealed and incubated at 35 c and shaken at 120 rpm after 1 h incubation 300 μl of a 10 ppm dpd final concentration 300 μg l stock solution was added to each tube post addition of dpd mixed liquor samples were taken at specific intervals for volatile fatty acid vfa and dpd analyses and biogas volumes measured with a calibrated glass syringe samco s murray co uk for the pre addition of dpd the experimental procedure was similar to the above except that another 100 μg l of dpd and 20 μm of pcp were spiked 1 day after the experiment was started to generate a dominant toxic effect 2 4 ai 2 regulating strains add in test a genetically mutated e coli strain δlsrrluxs and the e coli wild type wt strain which could substantially decrease or increase ai 2 levels thompson et al 2015 respectively were added to the batch anaerobic digestion assays to further elucidate the role of ai 2 mediated qs on the biomass under a pcp shock the e coli wt strain contained the ai 2 synthesizing gene luxs thus providing an additional source of ai 2 in the batch anaerobic digesters in e coli strain δlsrrluxs the luxs gene was removed hence it could not produce ai 2 and would not increase the extracellular ai 2 concentration in addition the lsrr gene encoding a suppressor regulating the uptake of extracellular ai 2 was also deleted thus resulting in a constitutive uptake of exogenous ai 2 all together the e coli strain δlsrrluxs showed a strong ability to quench ai 2 levels thompson et al 2015 the same seed sludge as mentioned above was used for this experiment the e coli strains wt and δlsrrluxs from the 80 c frozen stock were resuscitated in lb medium one day before the experiment harvested at an optical density od of 0 8 washed with 1x phosphate buffer solution pbs once and resuspended in 1x pbs then 1 ml of the e coli cultures with an equivalent od of 4 was added to a 500 ml bottle 350 ml working volume containing 3 5 g vss l of sludge and 2 g cod l of the oecd medium for the control the e coli culture was replaced with 1x pbs these bottles were operated as semi batch reactors for 10 weeks once the biogas production ceased a complete medium change or a spike feed of 10x oecd medium stock was performed alternately every 5 days for 14 times the same amount of e coli culture or 1x pbs as the initial dose was supplemented whenever there was a medium change or spike and the total volume was kept at 350 ml all the time for the 15th batch 15 μm of pcp was added to each bottle together with the oecd medium and the e coli cultures or 1x pbs the experiment was conducted in triplicate in an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden which was operated at 35 c with an 80 pulse mixing power 160 rpm 60 s on and 30 s off and the methane production was automatically measured and data logged before and after each spike 1 ml of a mixed liquor sample was drawn from each bottle after centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was collected and stored at 80 c for ai 2 analysis 2 5 ai 2 analysis both bioluminescence assay and mass spectrometry are widely used for the quantification of ai 2 for bioluminescence assay the most widely used reporter strain is v harveyi bb170 which can only sense the boron associated ai 2 other s typhimurium and e coli reporter strains must be used to analyze the non boron associated ai 2 taga and xavier 2011 in either case only the relative ai 2 activity can be measured to quantify the absolute ai 2 concentration dpd is the only standard able to calibrate the assay taga and xavier 2011 furthermore bioassays can be easily affected by the assay conditions thus showing lower reproducibility compared to other chemical analytical methods wang et al 2018 in our test pcp was used as a model toxic organic which might interfere with any bioassays hence a mass spectrometric ai 2 quantification method was used in this study the method was based on the measurement of dpd with lc ms ms following the method of campagna et al 2009 briefly supernatant samples were first centrifuged and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter 50 μl of the sample was added to an hplc vial containing 2 5 μl of 1 mg l 13c dpd as the internal standard then 5 μl of 4 g l of m1cq a derivatizing reagent was added to the vial to derivatize dpd into a quinoxaline dimethyl 2 2 2 1 2 dihydroxyethyl 3 methylquinoxaline 6 7 diyl bis oxy diacetate dpd m1cq the reaction was allowed to continue at room temperature for 1 h and then the vials were stored at 80 c before analysis a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a z spray electro spray interface lcms 8030 shimadzu japan following separation by hplc on a 2 1 100 mm poroshell 120 2 7 μm sb aq column agilent us was used for the final analysis 2 6 rna extraction and microbial community analysis sludge samples 1 ml from both anmbrs were taken at specific intervals and stored at 80 c immediately for total genomic nucleic acid extraction using the method of towe et al 2011 the total nucleic acid was treated with rq1 rnase free dnase promega usa to obtain rna according to the manufacturer s instructions the goscript reverse transcription system promega usa was then used to synthesize cdna from the rna as per the manufacturer s protocol the cdna was then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform by aitbiotech pte ltd singapore illumina overhang adapters and the primers described by takahashi et al 2014 were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna of a wide range of bacterial and archaeal species in the cdna following pcr the reaction products were quantified using the kapa library quantification kit roche usa and pooled in equimolar concentrations into a single library the final pool was validated and quantified on agilent bioanalyzer 2100 dna 1000 chips the pooled library was subsequently denatured and loaded on an illumina miseq instrument and sequenced in a 2x250bp paired end format the sequencing data was analyzed using the qiime 1 pipeline caporaso et al 2010 the paired end data was joined using the join paired ends script at the settings of 50 bp of min overlap and 15 of perc max diff and then quality filtered using the default strategy in qiime bokulich et al 2013 the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the open reference otu picking protocol rideout et al 2014 finally the diversity was analyzed using the core diversity analyses script and the results were visualized in principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots using the emperor tool vázquez baeza et al 2013 2 7 other analytical methods and statistical analysis the biogas was collected in a gas bag and the volume measured using a drum type gas meter ritter germany while the composition was analyzed using a shimadzu gc 2010 cod was analyzed according to standard methods eaton et al 2005 all statistical analyses were performed using r www r project org pearson correlation coefficients between the abundance of the microbial communities and the ai 2 and vfa levels were determined and the p values were reported the correlation matrixes were clustered using the hierarchical clustering package pvclust via multiscale bootstrap resampling using the ward d method 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance with and without the pcp shock without pcp the anmbr c showed a steady cod removal of 94 1 and a constant effluent soluble cod scod of 26 4 mg l fig 1 a the biogas was comprised of 82 ch4 7 co2 and 11 n2 fig s1 while the methane yield at 22 c was 221 ml ch4 g cod removed 59 of its theoretical value and this was probably due to cell growth and the loss of soluble methane 17 19 in the effluent kunacheva et al 2017 both acetic and propionic acids were detected at low levels in the supernatants of anmbr c in the first 20 days of operation but were not detected in the permeate this could be due to the hydraulic shock caused by reducing the hrt from 12 to 6 h one week before the experiments which might also partially result in a low methane production rate at the beginning however the extremely low methane production rate during the initial 24 days was most likely because of a minor leak in the gas collection bag as much more methane gas was collected since a new gas bag was used on day 21 during the course of the experiment the total suspended solids tss in anmbr c gradually increased from 3200 mg l to 5980 mg l on day 49 but then slowly decreased to 4600 mg l on day 60 overall the biomass increase rate was 34 mg tss l d and the biomass yield was 0 08 mg tss mg cod removal fig s1 in contrast pcp severely impaired the anmbr pcp which did not recover from the pcp shock until 40 days later fig 1 b during the pcp shock the cod removal decreased to 52 and the reactor supernatant scod increased from 200 to 500 mg l the methane production rate also decreased from 1 6 to 0 74 l d although the biogas composition was only slightly affected fig s2 correspondingly vfas accumulated in the supernatant during the pcp shock of which acetic propionic and isovaleric acids became dominant thus leading to increasing effluent cod in the anmbr pcp this suggests that not only methanogenesis but also acetogenesis was inhibited by pcp the isovaleric acid disappeared 10 days after the pcp feed was stopped while acetic and propionic acids were present for 30 more days during recovery the scod slowly decreased from 205 26 to 36 10 mg l in the effluent and from 470 46 to 286 42 mg l in the reactor supernatant concordantly the cod removal increased back to 93 2 and methane production back to 1 64 0 57 l d the relatively higher supernatant scod in anmbr pcp compared to that in anmbr c was primarily due to the slow degradation of the soluble microbial products smps generated during the toxic shock kim et al 2016 the biomass content in anmbr pcp varied around 4000 mg tss l during the pcp shock but gradually increased from 3880 mg l day 19 to 6600 mg l day 67 with an overall biomass increase rate and yield of 49 mg tss l d and 0 12 mg tss mg cod removal fig s2 this relatively higher biomass yield in anmbr pcp compared to that in anmbr c was probably because the water level fluctuations in anmbr c had negatively affected biomass growth the water level fluctuations were due to the false activation of the level sensor which also led to a higher initial transmembrane pressure tmp in anmbr c and a complete fouling incident on day 45 however after physical cleaning the tmp remained at a very constant low level during the pcp shock the ai 2 concentrations in the supernatant averaged around 10 5 0 6 μg l similar to that in anmbr c 10 3 1 3 μg l interestingly during recovery day 15 45 the ai 2 concentrations decreased with time from 10 5 0 6 to 4 8 1 9 μg l and this change in ai 2 matched well with the vfa profile in contrast the ai 2 concentrations varied between 8 and 14 μg l in anmbr c without any decreasing trend in order to confirm the correlation between ai 2 and reactor performance the parameters cod eff cod removal ch4 production rate and vfas were plotted against ai 2 concentrations independently amongst them vfas showed the best correlation r2 0 78 fig s3 this strong correlation may be indicative of some effects of the ai 2 mediated qs on the recovery of methanogenesis from the pcp shock the microbial community change during the shock and its correlation with ai 2 were further examined to elucidate these effects it is noteworthy that ai 2 based qs is a biomass density dependant phenomenon in ai 2 producing strains ai 2 is produced by the luxs enzyme transported out of cells and then internalized again via the lsrb or luxp transporter vendeville et al 2005 this mass transfer may result in a decreasing gradient of ai 2 from the vicinity of the cells to the bulk liquid laganenka et al 2016 therefore the bulk ai 2 concentrations are affected by cell density mass transfer properties and the spatial distribution of cells hense et al 2007 due to this complexity the bulk concentration song et al 2018 taga and xavier 2011 wang et al 2018 is the prevalent quantitative measurement of ai 2 in the literature in the present study only extracellular ai 2 was measured hence the concentration of ai 2 was used for the analysis and reported moreover if the ai 2 concentrations were normalized to biomass density their correlation with the vfa concentrations remained almost the same r2 0 76 fig s3 3 2 impact of pcp on the microbial communities in anmbrs both rrna and rrna genes rdna have been widely used for the study of microbial community dynamics the major limitation associated with rdna based analysis is that it only shows the presence of microorganisms while ignoring their physiological status as the rdna of dead or dormant cells can also be amplified blazewicz et al 2013 therefore rrna based analysis has been proposed as an alternative approach to targeting active microorganisms since the presence of rrna shows the ability to synthesize proteins which is not directly related to the realized protein synthesis activity rrna based analysis reveals the potential instead of actual activity of microorganisms blazewicz et al 2013 nevertheless the term active community is widely used in the literature to refer to the community obtained from the rrna based analysis elekwachi et al 2017 shu et al 2019 tarja pitkä nen et al 2013 vrieze et al 2016 to be more accurate the term expressed community has also been used gill et al 2017 in the present study both ai 2 and pcp could have instant effects on the microbial activity hence a 16s rrna based community analysis may provide better insight into the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between ai 2 and the toxic shock response of anaerobic digestion since only 16s rrna based community analysis was carried out the term active community was not used specially in this study the variations in microbial communities in both anmbrs over the operation time were evident in the pcoa plot in fig 2 a the pcp shock resulted in a maximum variation of 75 2 in the community structure of the anmbr pcp biomass during the recovery the variation in microbial communities decreased significantly as the sample dots in the pcoa plot shifted backwards along the pc1 axis this shift was primarily attributed to the change in the relative abundance of two dominant methanogenic classes methanobacteria and methanomicrobia and two bacterial classes synergistia and clostridia which together represented 90 of all otu counts fig 2 b at the genus level fig 2c methanobacterium member of methanobacteria and methanosaeta member of methanomicrobia were the most dominant genera in a well functioning anmbr each accounted for 30 of the total otu counts under the toxic shock of pcp the abundance of methanosaeta decreased to 2 although it gradually recovered when the pcp feed was stopped the dominance of methanogens in microbial communities was also observed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb bioreactor treating simulated brewery wastewater kovacik et al 2010 where members related to methanobacterium and methanosaeta equally represented 38 of the 16s rrna clones a similar archaeal community dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta like members also occurred in anaerobic bioreactors treating wastewater containing long chain fatty acids salvador et al 2013 as well known methanobacterium and methanosaeta are hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens respectively demirel and scherer 2008 note that a significant reduction in methanosaeta abundance corresponded well with the accumulation of vfas under toxic shocks which occurred during the pcp shock in our study as one of the most prevalent acetoclastic methanogens methanosaeta was vulnerable to organic or hydraulic shock loads and lost its dominance in anaerobic digesters regueiro et al 2015 although it was found to have higher activity under oxygen shocks cherukuri 2012 or at elevated vfa concentrations chen et al 2017 in other anaerobic digesters during the pcp shock the abundance of synergistia which was comprised primarily of the genus lactivibrio of the family dethiosulfovibrionaceae decreased from 17 to 11 concurrently the abundance of clostridia increased from 12 to 21 after the anmbr pcp recovered the abundance of both classes of bacteria returned to their original levels a significant increase in the abundance of gammaproteobacteria was observed during the pcp shock but they disappeared soon after the pcp feed was stopped this suggests that the members of gammaproteobacteria were putative pcp or phenol degraders hug et al 2013 the pcoa plot also indicates that the microbial community in the fully recovered anmbr pcp was slightly different from that before the shock and that in the anmbr c the gradual increase in abundance of an unclassified genus of the putative family wsa2 and methanospirillum like members fig s4 together with a significant decrease in abundance of an unclassified genus of the order clostridiales fig s5 contributed to this variation 3 3 correlation between ai 2 levels and microbial communities in anmbrs correlation of the variation in the microbial communities with the ai 2 levels and vfa concentrations in both anmbrs were evaluated using the pearson correlation coefficient and the community members at the phylum level were clustered into 4 clusters accordingly fig 3 cluster a was comprised of crenarchaeota archaea bacteroidetes euryarchaeota and actinobacteria all of which were inversely correlated with the ai 2 levels under the pcp shock but showed no correlations in the anmbr c members in cluster b correlated negatively with the vfa levels under the pcp shock but positively in anmbr c in contrast members in cluster c positively correlated with the vfa levels in both anmbr c and anmbr pcp cluster d including firmicutes nitrospirae etc correlated positively to ai 2 changes under the pcp shock but only showed moderately negative correlations in anmbr c from the figure only a few significant correlations were observed however since the microbial community was dominated by a few phyla including euryarchaeota firmicutes and synergistetes the significant correlations of ai 2 with euryarchaeota and firmicutes indicate that ai 2 might play an important role in recovery of anaerobic digestion from the pcp shock a lot of bacterial strains in the phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria can produce ai 2 however ai 2 producing ability is a species specific property for example ai 2 was produced by clostridium perfringens c botulinum and c difficile but not by c chauvoei kumar et al 2018 hence it cannot be postulated that all members of a phylum can produce ai 2 if some genera in that phylum are known to generate it in the current study the illumina sequencing data revealed 264 genera in the anmbrs among them only 7 genera are known to contain ai 2 producing members another 4 genera are known to possess no genes analogous to luxs the only identified gene encoding ai 2 synthesis but they carry ai 2 receptors and therefore can sense the ai 2 produced by others as shown in table s2 the relative abundance of these genera is very low considering the influential effects of ai 2 on the microbial community there must be some other genera that can generate or sense ai 2 the genera with a relative abundance 1 in either anmbr were re examined for their potential roles in ai 2 mediated qs and metabolic functions in anaerobic digestion among the top 14 genera table 1 figs s5 3 genera possess ai 2 producing and sensing abilities and only 1 genus pseudomonas shows no ai 2 activity while the presence or absence of ai 2 mediated qs has not been examined in the literature for the other 10 genera the most abundant genus lactivibrio a member of the phylum synergistetes was the primary amino acids fermenter in both anmbrs hugenholtz et al 2009 qiu et al 2014 all the other genera in the phylum firmicutes were polysaccharide fermenters with butyrate propionate and acetate as the products the significantly higher abundance of synergistetes was attributed to the greater protein content in the synthetic feed the presence of ai 2 mediated qs has been observed in various members of the phylum firmicutes pereira et al 2009 however no studies have reported its presence or absence in any strains of the phylum synergistetes considering the increase in the abundance of synergistetes coincident with the reduction in the ai 2 level during the recovery the ai 2 in the anmbr was not likely to be produced by synergistetes hence from table 1 the ai 2 in anmbrs was most likely produced by members of firmicutes under the pcp shock the relative abundance of firmicutes increased while the abundance of synergistetes and bacteroidetes decreased the relative abundance ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes f b was proposed to be a performance indicator of anaerobic digestion processes chen et al 2016 however changes in the f b ratio were not seen to be consistent in the literature the f b ratio was found to increase under the shocks of ammonia chen et al 2018 gao et al 2015 temperature liu et al 2018 watanabe et al 2017 and oxygen fu et al 2016 but decreased under an organic shock load chen et al 2016 the pcp shock in the present study also resulted in an increase in the f b ratio when the pcp addition ceased the relative abundance of firmicutes decreased and bacteroidetes increased concurrently with the decrease in ai 2 levels the same response of these two phyla to the manipulated changes in ai 2 levels was also observed in antibiotic treated gut microbiota thompson et al 2015 hence it might be possible to influence the response of anaerobic digestion sludge to a toxic shock 3 4 effects of dpd addition on anaerobic sludge during a toxic shock of pcp within the first 2 days of the pcp shock 15 μm of pcp did not show a prominent toxic effect as can be seen from both the biogas production and vfa profiles in fig s6 however it resulted in a significant decrease in the ultimate biogas production and an apparent accumulation of vfas despite these toxic effects the ai 2 levels were not affected by the pcp shock as the indigenous dpd levels in both the control and the one with pcp t pcp were the same they almost doubled within 1 day from 5 μg l at the beginning but quickly dropped to 1 μg l on day 2 and dropped further to below the detection limit after that fig s6 b this is consistent with the observations in the anmbrs where the ai 2 levels remained unchanged during the pcp shock post addition of 300 μg l of dpd 1 h after the pcp addition did not reduce the toxic effects to the sludge as the profiles of both biogas production and vfas were almost the same as the assays without dpd addition it was noted that the added dpd quickly decayed from 400 to 15 μg l within 1 day of addition and remained at the same levels as the ones without dpd addition this may explain its ineffectiveness in helping the sludge recover from the pcp shock however it could also be because dpd addition was too late to help the sludge recover hence pre addition of dpd 1 h prior to pcp exposure was tried as shown in fig s7 however there were no differences in biogas production and vfa accumulation between the assays with pre added dpd and those without dpd indicating that the pre added dpd did not mitigate the toxic effects of pcp either as observed previously the added dpd quickly decayed from 150 to 60 μg l within 1 day after the spike it quickly decayed again to 10 μg l in 1 day and remained at around the same concentration as the others the quick decay of dpd makes it impossible to investigate the long term effects of ai 2 by adding dpd and the ineffectiveness of adding dpd to alter the ai 2 regulated gene expression has been reported in a pure culture of clostridium difficile previously carter 2005 the indigenous dpd levels in both control and t pcp showed a similar trend as previously observed they almost tripled from 8 μg l at the beginning within 1 day but quickly dropped to and remained at 2 μg l from day 2 this observation of the increase and then decrease in ai 2 levels a very typical phenomenon across exponential to stationary phase transition in batch pure cultures campagna et al 2009 thiel et al 2009 confirms that ai 2 mediated qs was growth related in batch anaerobic sludge 3 5 effects of ai 2 regulating strains on anaerobic sludge during a toxic shock of pcp the genetically modified e coli strain δlsrrluxs and the e coli wt strain were added to batch anaerobic digesters consecutively for 15 batches before the addition of pcp to understand the long term effects of ai 2 on the sludge as shown in fig 4 a the methane production of the anaerobic sludge was almost the same irrespective of the presence of different e coli strains suggesting that they had no effect on methane production in anaerobic digestion after addition of pcp methane production decreased under all conditions however starting from the 3rd day the methane production in the sludge supplemented with the strain δlsrrluxs was at levels significantly higher than the control and or the assay with the strain wt fig 4b the differences in methane production between the control and the wt were not significant pcp was slowly converted and adsorbed by the sludge during the shock but the ultimate pcp removal was not affected by the e coli strains fig s8 however addition of the e coli strains significantly altered the ai 2 levels in the methanogenic sludge within the initial 6 h the highest levels in wt and the lowest in lsrrluxs fig 4c similar to the dpd addition test however the ai 2 levels increased within the first 2 h then decreased to the same level at the 8th hour and after that for all treatments meanwhile vfas were largely produced within the initial 8 h but addition of the e coli strain lsrrluxs resulted in the lowest vfa concentrations fig 4d it is noteworthy that the highest vfa concentrations were observed in the control which explains the lowest methane production of the control in fig 4b the ai 2 and vfa profiles together suggest that the ai 2 level in methanogenic sludge was primarily governed by fermenting bacteria when they were not active the ai 2 level was at the lowest level irrespective of the presence of ai 2 regulating strains despite the fact that the ai 2 levels were manipulated only for a short period of time the microbial community might have changed during the 15 batches of experiments therefore the long term methane production was significantly improved by lowering the ai 2 levels via addition of the e coli strain lsrrluxs under the pcp shock addition of the e coli strain wt did result in the highest ai 2 levels but not the highest vfa levels this discrepancy together with the results of the dpd addition tests indicates that the elevated ai 2 levels had limited impacts on both fermentation and biogas production the most probable reason for this is that the ai 2 levels in the control were already beyond the threshold concentration to trigger any community density dependent activities boyer and wisniewski dyé 2009 this also explains why there were no changes in ai 2 levels in the anmbr pcp during the pcp shock 3 6 implications of this study previous studies have reported the role of ai 2 in shock responses of some fermentative bacteria the lactobacillus species showed higher ai 2 concentration under stresses of ph bile acid temperature osmotic pressure and starvation moslehi jenabian et al 2009 park et al 2016 yeo et al 2015 while ai 2 was also found to protect the biofilm of staphylococcus aureus from the stress of antibiotics brackman et al 2016 however these studies almost focused entirely on pure cultures our present study shows that the ai 2 levels of a mixed culture sludge in a pcp exposed anmbr were not affected during the pcp shock but significantly reduced while recovering from the shock ai 2 plays two different roles in pure cultures one as a quorum sensing autoinducer and the other as a metabolite vendeville et al 2005 in either case a number of genes are regulated by ai 2 which include not only those controlling bioluminescence biofilm formation and virulence but also genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production shao et al 2012 in addition some specific carbohydrates promote the secretion of ai 2 this occurs at the single cell level and is therefore unaffected by cell density song et al 2018 the carbohydrate fermenting firmicutes was the 2nd most abundant group in the anmbrs hence it is not surprising that a decrease in the ai 2 level might have reduced the metabolic activity of firmicutes which in turn resulted in the decrease in the abundance of firmicutes meanwhile synergistetes primarily lactivibrio the syntrophic lactate acetate oxidizer together with the hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased this counteracted the toxic effects of pcp therefore the overall consequence of a reduction in ai 2 was reduced acetogenesis and enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus resulting in less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock however future studies on metagenomic sequencing of key functional genes are necessary to further elucidate the mechanism moreover the present study does not indicate that the ai 2 mediated qs affects methanogens a study on continuous anaerobic digestion reactors with consecutive addition of ai 2 quenching strains or inhibitors could aid in answering this 4 conclusions this study investigated the role of ai 2 mediated qs on shock responses of anaerobic digestion and demonstrated the potential for improving its resilience to pcp shocks via regulating the ai 2 levels the major conclusions are summarized as follows the ai 2 level in anaerobic digestion was governed primarily by firmicutes and was not significantly affected during a pcp shock during the recovery of a pcp shock a reduction in the ai 2 levels corresponded significantly to a decrease in the population ratio of firmicutes bacteroidetes elevating ai 2 levels in anaerobic digestion had no obvious effects on biogas production during a pcp shock reducing ai 2 levels in anaerobic digestion via the addition of an ai 2 regulating escherichia coli mutant culture resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a pcp shock a reduction in ai 2 levels might reduce acetogenesis and enhance hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus leading to less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18811,this study discovered a strong correlation between the autoinducer 2 ai 2 mediated quorum sensing qs with the performance of a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor during its recovery from a pentachlorophenol pcp shock a decrease in ai 2 levels coincided with a reduction in volatile fatty acid concentrations and corresponded significantly to a decrease in the relative abundance of firmicutes and to an increase in the relative abundance of bacteroidetes and synergistetes further batch experiments with the addition of an ai 2 regulating escherichia coli mutant culture showed that a reduction in ai 2 levels resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a pcp shock in contrast an increase in ai 2 levels via addition of the e coli wild type strain or an ai 2 precursor showed no obvious effects on biogas production these results suggest that the ai 2 level in anaerobic sludge was governed primarily by firmicutes and the ai 2 mediated qs partially regulates the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge via tuning the activities of firmicutes and synergistetes a decrease in the ai 2 level might reduce acetogenesis and favor hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus resulting in less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock this study is the first of this type that exploits the role of quorum sensing in the toxic shock response of anaerobic sludge it demonstrates a novel approach to shortening the recovery period of anaerobic processes via manipulating the ai 2 mediated qs graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum sensing anaerobic digestion anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr ai 2 toxic shock 1 introduction quorum sensing qs a cell to cell communication system among bacteria has been extensively exploited in pure cultures for the control of group dependant activities including bioluminescence biofilm formation and virulence ng and bassler 2009 the two major classes of qs molecules that have been well characterized are n acyl homoserine lactones ahls which primarily drive intraspecies communication and autoinducer 2 ai 2 which mediates interspecies communication both have been widely detected in complex engineered microbiomes such as activated sludge aerobic and anaerobic granules and their roles in regulating aerobic biofilms and granule formation are partially understood tan et al 2014 xu and liu 2011 and exploited to reduce biofouling in aerobic membrane bioreactors mbrs oh and lee 2018 compared with the extensive investigations of qs in aerobic sludge processes its roles in anaerobic systems have rarely been described in the literature ahls were discovered in a methanogenic archaeon methanosaeta harundinacea however with a carboxyl group substitution they were structurally different from previously described aerobic ahls and regulated the change of cells from rods to filaments favoring the conversion of acetate to methane zhang et al 2012 li et al 2015 further found that the addition of ahl extracts of a m harundinacea culture to a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor greatly enhanced sludge granulation thereby significantly improving its overall performance ding et al 2015 also showed that the addition of either ahl or ai 2 could enhance anaerobic granulation not surprisingly a deeper fundamental understanding of the regulation of qs signalling molecules could aid in opening up a new way of improving the stability and or efficiency of anaerobic systems ai 2 is a group of signalling molecules that are produced spontaneously from 4 5 dihydroxy 2 3 pentanedione dpd the only product of the ai 2 synthesizing gene luxs taga and xavier 2011 vendeville et al 2005 the two characterized ai 2 molecules are chemically different one is produced from a reaction of a dpd derivative with borate and thus contains boron while the other has no boron taga and xavier 2011 the boron associated ai 2 is commonly observed in marine bacteria e g vibrio spp while the non boron associated ai 2 is used by other non marine bacteria such as salmonella typhimurium escherichia coli and others therefore ai 2 activity was proposed to be niche dependent vendeville et al 2005 recent studies suggest that ai 2 mediated qs also plays a role in bacterial stress response an acidic stress increased the ai 2 concentration of a lactobacillus culture moslehi jenabian et al 2009 yeo et al 2015 further discovered that the stresses of bile acid temperature osmotic pressure and starvation all affected the ai 2 concentration of lactobacillus spp and resulted in a species and strain specific increase or decrease in ai 2 levels very recently gu et al 2018 observed higher transcription numbers of the ai 2 mediating gene luxs when l fermentum was under above stress conditions like acid shock low temperature and high osmotic pressure in addition to these fermentative bacteria similar results were also observed in anaerobic granular sludge where an increase in ai 2 content was linked to its stress response to short term nitrogen overloads ding et al 2016 these studies on pure cultures and sludge suggest that a general stress response system involving ai 2 mediated qs occurs in anaerobic systems which could be exploited as a tool to improve their resistance to shocks these systems i e methanogenesis are particularly vulnerable to various toxicants which often result in upset or even temporary shutdown of the process chen et al 2008 therefore the objective of this study was to gain a greater understanding of the role that ai 2 mediated qs has on anaerobic digestion in response to toxic shocks and to exploit this as a novel approach to shorten the recovery period of anaerobic digestion after toxic shocks the anaerobic digester used here was coupled with a membrane for biosolids separation i e an anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr due to its ability to reduce the hydraulic retention time hrt of the reactor thus reducing the system size and footprint and hence increasing its economic viability stuckey 2012 pentachlorophenol pcp was used as a model organic toxicant and was fed to one anmbr anmbr pcp running in parallel with a control anmbr anmbr c operated under identical conditions without any toxic shocks the ai 2 levels in the anmbrs were found to correlate with the reactor performance very well and the microbial community analysis revealed that the correlation was microbe dependant then ai 2 dpd was added into batch reactors under a toxic shock of pcp to investigate the impacts of increased ai 2 levels on toxic resistance of methanogenic sludge finally an ai 2 regulating e coli mutant culture was used in other batch digesters to investigate the impact of reduced ai 2 levels on the pcp shock resistance of the methanogenic sludge 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals pcp from sigma aldrich singapore was used as a model organic toxicant in this study due to its well known toxicity to anaerobic digestion sludge chen et al 2008 dpd was purchased from omm scientific inc dallas tx usa while the stable isotope labelled 13c dpd and dimethyl 2 2 4 5 diamino 1 2 phenylene bis oxy diacetate m1cq

the laboratory with a kubota microfiltration membrane module filtration area 0 11 m2 and pore size 0 4 μm details of the anmbrs are provided elsewhere kunacheva et al 2017 both anmbrs were operated at 35 c using a water bath to treat an oecd synthetic sewage oecd 2010 see the composition in the supporting information si table s1 the hrt was controlled at 6 h and the sludge retention time srt was controlled at 213 days via sampling 30 ml of the mixed liquor every 2 days the seed sludge was obtained from ulu pandan water reclamation plant singapore and maintained in 4x oecd synthetic sewage with a chemical oxygen demand cod of 2000 mg l for more than 1 year in order to avoid frequent membrane cleaning the flux was maintained constant at a low level of 5 l m2 h lmh the transmembrane pressure tmp ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were continuously monitored with a digital pressure gauge cole parmer usa and a ph orp probe inpro 4260i mettler toledo usa connected to a data logger after more than 160 days of stable operation 10 μm of pcp was fed into the anmbr pcp continuously for 15 days which significantly inhibited cod removal and biogas production see fig 1 after this addition ceased the reactor was operated under normal conditions until it recovered the anmbr c was operated at normal conditions without any toxic shocks 2 3 ai 2 signalling molecule add in test dpd was added to the batch anaerobic digestion sludge assay either 1 h before the exposure to pcp pre addition or 1 h after the exposure to pcp post addition to investigate the impact of increased ai 2 levels on the sludge under a pcp shock before the experiment the seed sludge was washed once with tap water resuspended in fresh oecd medium and added to 20 ml hungate tubes at a final concentration of 1 g l vss then an appropriate volume of oecd medium containing pcp was added to each tube to result in a final pcp concentration of 15 μm in a final volume of 10 ml the tubes were flushed with n2 sealed and incubated at 35 c and shaken at 120 rpm after 1 h incubation 300 μl of a 10 ppm dpd final concentration 300 μg l stock solution was added to each tube post addition of dpd mixed liquor samples were taken at specific intervals for volatile fatty acid vfa and dpd analyses and biogas volumes measured with a calibrated glass syringe samco s murray co uk for the pre addition of dpd the experimental procedure was similar to the above except that another 100 μg l of dpd and 20 μm of pcp were spiked 1 day after the experiment was started to generate a dominant toxic effect 2 4 ai 2 regulating strains add in test a genetically mutated e coli strain δlsrrluxs and the e coli wild type wt strain which could substantially decrease or increase ai 2 levels thompson et al 2015 respectively were added to the batch anaerobic digestion assays to further elucidate the role of ai 2 mediated qs on the biomass under a pcp shock the e coli wt strain contained the ai 2 synthesizing gene luxs thus providing an additional source of ai 2 in the batch anaerobic digesters in e coli strain δlsrrluxs the luxs gene was removed hence it could not produce ai 2 and would not increase the extracellular ai 2 concentration in addition the lsrr gene encoding a suppressor regulating the uptake of extracellular ai 2 was also deleted thus resulting in a constitutive uptake of exogenous ai 2 all together the e coli strain δlsrrluxs showed a strong ability to quench ai 2 levels thompson et al 2015 the same seed sludge as mentioned above was used for this experiment the e coli strains wt and δlsrrluxs from the 80 c frozen stock were resuscitated in lb medium one day before the experiment harvested at an optical density od of 0 8 washed with 1x phosphate buffer solution pbs once and resuspended in 1x pbs then 1 ml of the e coli cultures with an equivalent od of 4 was added to a 500 ml bottle 350 ml working volume containing 3 5 g vss l of sludge and 2 g cod l of the oecd medium for the control the e coli culture was replaced with 1x pbs these bottles were operated as semi batch reactors for 10 weeks once the biogas production ceased a complete medium change or a spike feed of 10x oecd medium stock was performed alternately every 5 days for 14 times the same amount of e coli culture or 1x pbs as the initial dose was supplemented whenever there was a medium change or spike and the total volume was kept at 350 ml all the time for the 15th batch 15 μm of pcp was added to each bottle together with the oecd medium and the e coli cultures or 1x pbs the experiment was conducted in triplicate in an automatic methane potential test system ampts ii bioprocess control sweden which was operated at 35 c with an 80 pulse mixing power 160 rpm 60 s on and 30 s off and the methane production was automatically measured and data logged before and after each spike 1 ml of a mixed liquor sample was drawn from each bottle after centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was collected and stored at 80 c for ai 2 analysis 2 5 ai 2 analysis both bioluminescence assay and mass spectrometry are widely used for the quantification of ai 2 for bioluminescence assay the most widely used reporter strain is v harveyi bb170 which can only sense the boron associated ai 2 other s typhimurium and e coli reporter strains must be used to analyze the non boron associated ai 2 taga and xavier 2011 in either case only the relative ai 2 activity can be measured to quantify the absolute ai 2 concentration dpd is the only standard able to calibrate the assay taga and xavier 2011 furthermore bioassays can be easily affected by the assay conditions thus showing lower reproducibility compared to other chemical analytical methods wang et al 2018 in our test pcp was used as a model toxic organic which might interfere with any bioassays hence a mass spectrometric ai 2 quantification method was used in this study the method was based on the measurement of dpd with lc ms ms following the method of campagna et al 2009 briefly supernatant samples were first centrifuged and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter 50 μl of the sample was added to an hplc vial containing 2 5 μl of 1 mg l 13c dpd as the internal standard then 5 μl of 4 g l of m1cq a derivatizing reagent was added to the vial to derivatize dpd into a quinoxaline dimethyl 2 2 2 1 2 dihydroxyethyl 3 methylquinoxaline 6 7 diyl bis oxy diacetate dpd m1cq the reaction was allowed to continue at room temperature for 1 h and then the vials were stored at 80 c before analysis a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a z spray electro spray interface lcms 8030 shimadzu japan following separation by hplc on a 2 1 100 mm poroshell 120 2 7 μm sb aq column agilent us was used for the final analysis 2 6 rna extraction and microbial community analysis sludge samples 1 ml from both anmbrs were taken at specific intervals and stored at 80 c immediately for total genomic nucleic acid extraction using the method of towe et al 2011 the total nucleic acid was treated with rq1 rnase free dnase promega usa to obtain rna according to the manufacturer s instructions the goscript reverse transcription system promega usa was then used to synthesize cdna from the rna as per the manufacturer s protocol the cdna was then sequenced on an illumina miseq platform by aitbiotech pte ltd singapore illumina overhang adapters and the primers described by takahashi et al 2014 were used to amplify the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna of a wide range of bacterial and archaeal species in the cdna following pcr the reaction products were quantified using the kapa library quantification kit roche usa and pooled in equimolar concentrations into a single library the final pool was validated and quantified on agilent bioanalyzer 2100 dna 1000 chips the pooled library was subsequently denatured and loaded on an illumina miseq instrument and sequenced in a 2x250bp paired end format the sequencing data was analyzed using the qiime 1 pipeline caporaso et al 2010 the paired end data was joined using the join paired ends script at the settings of 50 bp of min overlap and 15 of perc max diff and then quality filtered using the default strategy in qiime bokulich et al 2013 the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using the open reference otu picking protocol rideout et al 2014 finally the diversity was analyzed using the core diversity analyses script and the results were visualized in principal coordinate analysis pcoa plots using the emperor tool vázquez baeza et al 2013 2 7 other analytical methods and statistical analysis the biogas was collected in a gas bag and the volume measured using a drum type gas meter ritter germany while the composition was analyzed using a shimadzu gc 2010 cod was analyzed according to standard methods eaton et al 2005 all statistical analyses were performed using r www r project org pearson correlation coefficients between the abundance of the microbial communities and the ai 2 and vfa levels were determined and the p values were reported the correlation matrixes were clustered using the hierarchical clustering package pvclust via multiscale bootstrap resampling using the ward d method 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance with and without the pcp shock without pcp the anmbr c showed a steady cod removal of 94 1 and a constant effluent soluble cod scod of 26 4 mg l fig 1 a the biogas was comprised of 82 ch4 7 co2 and 11 n2 fig s1 while the methane yield at 22 c was 221 ml ch4 g cod removed 59 of its theoretical value and this was probably due to cell growth and the loss of soluble methane 17 19 in the effluent kunacheva et al 2017 both acetic and propionic acids were detected at low levels in the supernatants of anmbr c in the first 20 days of operation but were not detected in the permeate this could be due to the hydraulic shock caused by reducing the hrt from 12 to 6 h one week before the experiments which might also partially result in a low methane production rate at the beginning however the extremely low methane production rate during the initial 24 days was most likely because of a minor leak in the gas collection bag as much more methane gas was collected since a new gas bag was used on day 21 during the course of the experiment the total suspended solids tss in anmbr c gradually increased from 3200 mg l to 5980 mg l on day 49 but then slowly decreased to 4600 mg l on day 60 overall the biomass increase rate was 34 mg tss l d and the biomass yield was 0 08 mg tss mg cod removal fig s1 in contrast pcp severely impaired the anmbr pcp which did not recover from the pcp shock until 40 days later fig 1 b during the pcp shock the cod removal decreased to 52 and the reactor supernatant scod increased from 200 to 500 mg l the methane production rate also decreased from 1 6 to 0 74 l d although the biogas composition was only slightly affected fig s2 correspondingly vfas accumulated in the supernatant during the pcp shock of which acetic propionic and isovaleric acids became dominant thus leading to increasing effluent cod in the anmbr pcp this suggests that not only methanogenesis but also acetogenesis was inhibited by pcp the isovaleric acid disappeared 10 days after the pcp feed was stopped while acetic and propionic acids were present for 30 more days during recovery the scod slowly decreased from 205 26 to 36 10 mg l in the effluent and from 470 46 to 286 42 mg l in the reactor supernatant concordantly the cod removal increased back to 93 2 and methane production back to 1 64 0 57 l d the relatively higher supernatant scod in anmbr pcp compared to that in anmbr c was primarily due to the slow degradation of the soluble microbial products smps generated during the toxic shock kim et al 2016 the biomass content in anmbr pcp varied around 4000 mg tss l during the pcp shock but gradually increased from 3880 mg l day 19 to 6600 mg l day 67 with an overall biomass increase rate and yield of 49 mg tss l d and 0 12 mg tss mg cod removal fig s2 this relatively higher biomass yield in anmbr pcp compared to that in anmbr c was probably because the water level fluctuations in anmbr c had negatively affected biomass growth the water level fluctuations were due to the false activation of the level sensor which also led to a higher initial transmembrane pressure tmp in anmbr c and a complete fouling incident on day 45 however after physical cleaning the tmp remained at a very constant low level during the pcp shock the ai 2 concentrations in the supernatant averaged around 10 5 0 6 μg l similar to that in anmbr c 10 3 1 3 μg l interestingly during recovery day 15 45 the ai 2 concentrations decreased with time from 10 5 0 6 to 4 8 1 9 μg l and this change in ai 2 matched well with the vfa profile in contrast the ai 2 concentrations varied between 8 and 14 μg l in anmbr c without any decreasing trend in order to confirm the correlation between ai 2 and reactor performance the parameters cod eff cod removal ch4 production rate and vfas were plotted against ai 2 concentrations independently amongst them vfas showed the best correlation r2 0 78 fig s3 this strong correlation may be indicative of some effects of the ai 2 mediated qs on the recovery of methanogenesis from the pcp shock the microbial community change during the shock and its correlation with ai 2 were further examined to elucidate these effects it is noteworthy that ai 2 based qs is a biomass density dependant phenomenon in ai 2 producing strains ai 2 is produced by the luxs enzyme transported out of cells and then internalized again via the lsrb or luxp transporter vendeville et al 2005 this mass transfer may result in a decreasing gradient of ai 2 from the vicinity of the cells to the bulk liquid laganenka et al 2016 therefore the bulk ai 2 concentrations are affected by cell density mass transfer properties and the spatial distribution of cells hense et al 2007 due to this complexity the bulk concentration song et al 2018 taga and xavier 2011 wang et al 2018 is the prevalent quantitative measurement of ai 2 in the literature in the present study only extracellular ai 2 was measured hence the concentration of ai 2 was used for the analysis and reported moreover if the ai 2 concentrations were normalized to biomass density their correlation with the vfa concentrations remained almost the same r2 0 76 fig s3 3 2 impact of pcp on the microbial communities in anmbrs both rrna and rrna genes rdna have been widely used for the study of microbial community dynamics the major limitation associated with rdna based analysis is that it only shows the presence of microorganisms while ignoring their physiological status as the rdna of dead or dormant cells can also be amplified blazewicz et al 2013 therefore rrna based analysis has been proposed as an alternative approach to targeting active microorganisms since the presence of rrna shows the ability to synthesize proteins which is not directly related to the realized protein synthesis activity rrna based analysis reveals the potential instead of actual activity of microorganisms blazewicz et al 2013 nevertheless the term active community is widely used in the literature to refer to the community obtained from the rrna based analysis elekwachi et al 2017 shu et al 2019 tarja pitkä nen et al 2013 vrieze et al 2016 to be more accurate the term expressed community has also been used gill et al 2017 in the present study both ai 2 and pcp could have instant effects on the microbial activity hence a 16s rrna based community analysis may provide better insight into the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between ai 2 and the toxic shock response of anaerobic digestion since only 16s rrna based community analysis was carried out the term active community was not used specially in this study the variations in microbial communities in both anmbrs over the operation time were evident in the pcoa plot in fig 2 a the pcp shock resulted in a maximum variation of 75 2 in the community structure of the anmbr pcp biomass during the recovery the variation in microbial communities decreased significantly as the sample dots in the pcoa plot shifted backwards along the pc1 axis this shift was primarily attributed to the change in the relative abundance of two dominant methanogenic classes methanobacteria and methanomicrobia and two bacterial classes synergistia and clostridia which together represented 90 of all otu counts fig 2 b at the genus level fig 2c methanobacterium member of methanobacteria and methanosaeta member of methanomicrobia were the most dominant genera in a well functioning anmbr each accounted for 30 of the total otu counts under the toxic shock of pcp the abundance of methanosaeta decreased to 2 although it gradually recovered when the pcp feed was stopped the dominance of methanogens in microbial communities was also observed in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb bioreactor treating simulated brewery wastewater kovacik et al 2010 where members related to methanobacterium and methanosaeta equally represented 38 of the 16s rrna clones a similar archaeal community dominated by methanobacterium and methanosaeta like members also occurred in anaerobic bioreactors treating wastewater containing long chain fatty acids salvador et al 2013 as well known methanobacterium and methanosaeta are hydrogenotrophic and acetotrophic methanogens respectively demirel and scherer 2008 note that a significant reduction in methanosaeta abundance corresponded well with the accumulation of vfas under toxic shocks which occurred during the pcp shock in our study as one of the most prevalent acetoclastic methanogens methanosaeta was vulnerable to organic or hydraulic shock loads and lost its dominance in anaerobic digesters regueiro et al 2015 although it was found to have higher activity under oxygen shocks cherukuri 2012 or at elevated vfa concentrations chen et al 2017 in other anaerobic digesters during the pcp shock the abundance of synergistia which was comprised primarily of the genus lactivibrio of the family dethiosulfovibrionaceae decreased from 17 to 11 concurrently the abundance of clostridia increased from 12 to 21 after the anmbr pcp recovered the abundance of both classes of bacteria returned to their original levels a significant increase in the abundance of gammaproteobacteria was observed during the pcp shock but they disappeared soon after the pcp feed was stopped this suggests that the members of gammaproteobacteria were putative pcp or phenol degraders hug et al 2013 the pcoa plot also indicates that the microbial community in the fully recovered anmbr pcp was slightly different from that before the shock and that in the anmbr c the gradual increase in abundance of an unclassified genus of the putative family wsa2 and methanospirillum like members fig s4 together with a significant decrease in abundance of an unclassified genus of the order clostridiales fig s5 contributed to this variation 3 3 correlation between ai 2 levels and microbial communities in anmbrs correlation of the variation in the microbial communities with the ai 2 levels and vfa concentrations in both anmbrs were evaluated using the pearson correlation coefficient and the community members at the phylum level were clustered into 4 clusters accordingly fig 3 cluster a was comprised of crenarchaeota archaea bacteroidetes euryarchaeota and actinobacteria all of which were inversely correlated with the ai 2 levels under the pcp shock but showed no correlations in the anmbr c members in cluster b correlated negatively with the vfa levels under the pcp shock but positively in anmbr c in contrast members in cluster c positively correlated with the vfa levels in both anmbr c and anmbr pcp cluster d including firmicutes nitrospirae etc correlated positively to ai 2 changes under the pcp shock but only showed moderately negative correlations in anmbr c from the figure only a few significant correlations were observed however since the microbial community was dominated by a few phyla including euryarchaeota firmicutes and synergistetes the significant correlations of ai 2 with euryarchaeota and firmicutes indicate that ai 2 might play an important role in recovery of anaerobic digestion from the pcp shock a lot of bacterial strains in the phyla firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and proteobacteria can produce ai 2 however ai 2 producing ability is a species specific property for example ai 2 was produced by clostridium perfringens c botulinum and c difficile but not by c chauvoei kumar et al 2018 hence it cannot be postulated that all members of a phylum can produce ai 2 if some genera in that phylum are known to generate it in the current study the illumina sequencing data revealed 264 genera in the anmbrs among them only 7 genera are known to contain ai 2 producing members another 4 genera are known to possess no genes analogous to luxs the only identified gene encoding ai 2 synthesis but they carry ai 2 receptors and therefore can sense the ai 2 produced by others as shown in table s2 the relative abundance of these genera is very low considering the influential effects of ai 2 on the microbial community there must be some other genera that can generate or sense ai 2 the genera with a relative abundance 1 in either anmbr were re examined for their potential roles in ai 2 mediated qs and metabolic functions in anaerobic digestion among the top 14 genera table 1 figs s5 3 genera possess ai 2 producing and sensing abilities and only 1 genus pseudomonas shows no ai 2 activity while the presence or absence of ai 2 mediated qs has not been examined in the literature for the other 10 genera the most abundant genus lactivibrio a member of the phylum synergistetes was the primary amino acids fermenter in both anmbrs hugenholtz et al 2009 qiu et al 2014 all the other genera in the phylum firmicutes were polysaccharide fermenters with butyrate propionate and acetate as the products the significantly higher abundance of synergistetes was attributed to the greater protein content in the synthetic feed the presence of ai 2 mediated qs has been observed in various members of the phylum firmicutes pereira et al 2009 however no studies have reported its presence or absence in any strains of the phylum synergistetes considering the increase in the abundance of synergistetes coincident with the reduction in the ai 2 level during the recovery the ai 2 in the anmbr was not likely to be produced by synergistetes hence from table 1 the ai 2 in anmbrs was most likely produced by members of firmicutes under the pcp shock the relative abundance of firmicutes increased while the abundance of synergistetes and bacteroidetes decreased the relative abundance ratio of firmicutes to bacteroidetes f b was proposed to be a performance indicator of anaerobic digestion processes chen et al 2016 however changes in the f b ratio were not seen to be consistent in the literature the f b ratio was found to increase under the shocks of ammonia chen et al 2018 gao et al 2015 temperature liu et al 2018 watanabe et al 2017 and oxygen fu et al 2016 but decreased under an organic shock load chen et al 2016 the pcp shock in the present study also resulted in an increase in the f b ratio when the pcp addition ceased the relative abundance of firmicutes decreased and bacteroidetes increased concurrently with the decrease in ai 2 levels the same response of these two phyla to the manipulated changes in ai 2 levels was also observed in antibiotic treated gut microbiota thompson et al 2015 hence it might be possible to influence the response of anaerobic digestion sludge to a toxic shock 3 4 effects of dpd addition on anaerobic sludge during a toxic shock of pcp within the first 2 days of the pcp shock 15 μm of pcp did not show a prominent toxic effect as can be seen from both the biogas production and vfa profiles in fig s6 however it resulted in a significant decrease in the ultimate biogas production and an apparent accumulation of vfas despite these toxic effects the ai 2 levels were not affected by the pcp shock as the indigenous dpd levels in both the control and the one with pcp t pcp were the same they almost doubled within 1 day from 5 μg l at the beginning but quickly dropped to 1 μg l on day 2 and dropped further to below the detection limit after that fig s6 b this is consistent with the observations in the anmbrs where the ai 2 levels remained unchanged during the pcp shock post addition of 300 μg l of dpd 1 h after the pcp addition did not reduce the toxic effects to the sludge as the profiles of both biogas production and vfas were almost the same as the assays without dpd addition it was noted that the added dpd quickly decayed from 400 to 15 μg l within 1 day of addition and remained at the same levels as the ones without dpd addition this may explain its ineffectiveness in helping the sludge recover from the pcp shock however it could also be because dpd addition was too late to help the sludge recover hence pre addition of dpd 1 h prior to pcp exposure was tried as shown in fig s7 however there were no differences in biogas production and vfa accumulation between the assays with pre added dpd and those without dpd indicating that the pre added dpd did not mitigate the toxic effects of pcp either as observed previously the added dpd quickly decayed from 150 to 60 μg l within 1 day after the spike it quickly decayed again to 10 μg l in 1 day and remained at around the same concentration as the others the quick decay of dpd makes it impossible to investigate the long term effects of ai 2 by adding dpd and the ineffectiveness of adding dpd to alter the ai 2 regulated gene expression has been reported in a pure culture of clostridium difficile previously carter 2005 the indigenous dpd levels in both control and t pcp showed a similar trend as previously observed they almost tripled from 8 μg l at the beginning within 1 day but quickly dropped to and remained at 2 μg l from day 2 this observation of the increase and then decrease in ai 2 levels a very typical phenomenon across exponential to stationary phase transition in batch pure cultures campagna et al 2009 thiel et al 2009 confirms that ai 2 mediated qs was growth related in batch anaerobic sludge 3 5 effects of ai 2 regulating strains on anaerobic sludge during a toxic shock of pcp the genetically modified e coli strain δlsrrluxs and the e coli wt strain were added to batch anaerobic digesters consecutively for 15 batches before the addition of pcp to understand the long term effects of ai 2 on the sludge as shown in fig 4 a the methane production of the anaerobic sludge was almost the same irrespective of the presence of different e coli strains suggesting that they had no effect on methane production in anaerobic digestion after addition of pcp methane production decreased under all conditions however starting from the 3rd day the methane production in the sludge supplemented with the strain δlsrrluxs was at levels significantly higher than the control and or the assay with the strain wt fig 4b the differences in methane production between the control and the wt were not significant pcp was slowly converted and adsorbed by the sludge during the shock but the ultimate pcp removal was not affected by the e coli strains fig s8 however addition of the e coli strains significantly altered the ai 2 levels in the methanogenic sludge within the initial 6 h the highest levels in wt and the lowest in lsrrluxs fig 4c similar to the dpd addition test however the ai 2 levels increased within the first 2 h then decreased to the same level at the 8th hour and after that for all treatments meanwhile vfas were largely produced within the initial 8 h but addition of the e coli strain lsrrluxs resulted in the lowest vfa concentrations fig 4d it is noteworthy that the highest vfa concentrations were observed in the control which explains the lowest methane production of the control in fig 4b the ai 2 and vfa profiles together suggest that the ai 2 level in methanogenic sludge was primarily governed by fermenting bacteria when they were not active the ai 2 level was at the lowest level irrespective of the presence of ai 2 regulating strains despite the fact that the ai 2 levels were manipulated only for a short period of time the microbial community might have changed during the 15 batches of experiments therefore the long term methane production was significantly improved by lowering the ai 2 levels via addition of the e coli strain lsrrluxs under the pcp shock addition of the e coli strain wt did result in the highest ai 2 levels but not the highest vfa levels this discrepancy together with the results of the dpd addition tests indicates that the elevated ai 2 levels had limited impacts on both fermentation and biogas production the most probable reason for this is that the ai 2 levels in the control were already beyond the threshold concentration to trigger any community density dependent activities boyer and wisniewski dyé 2009 this also explains why there were no changes in ai 2 levels in the anmbr pcp during the pcp shock 3 6 implications of this study previous studies have reported the role of ai 2 in shock responses of some fermentative bacteria the lactobacillus species showed higher ai 2 concentration under stresses of ph bile acid temperature osmotic pressure and starvation moslehi jenabian et al 2009 park et al 2016 yeo et al 2015 while ai 2 was also found to protect the biofilm of staphylococcus aureus from the stress of antibiotics brackman et al 2016 however these studies almost focused entirely on pure cultures our present study shows that the ai 2 levels of a mixed culture sludge in a pcp exposed anmbr were not affected during the pcp shock but significantly reduced while recovering from the shock ai 2 plays two different roles in pure cultures one as a quorum sensing autoinducer and the other as a metabolite vendeville et al 2005 in either case a number of genes are regulated by ai 2 which include not only those controlling bioluminescence biofilm formation and virulence but also genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and energy production shao et al 2012 in addition some specific carbohydrates promote the secretion of ai 2 this occurs at the single cell level and is therefore unaffected by cell density song et al 2018 the carbohydrate fermenting firmicutes was the 2nd most abundant group in the anmbrs hence it is not surprising that a decrease in the ai 2 level might have reduced the metabolic activity of firmicutes which in turn resulted in the decrease in the abundance of firmicutes meanwhile synergistetes primarily lactivibrio the syntrophic lactate acetate oxidizer together with the hydrogenotrophic methanogens increased this counteracted the toxic effects of pcp therefore the overall consequence of a reduction in ai 2 was reduced acetogenesis and enhanced hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus resulting in less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock however future studies on metagenomic sequencing of key functional genes are necessary to further elucidate the mechanism moreover the present study does not indicate that the ai 2 mediated qs affects methanogens a study on continuous anaerobic digestion reactors with consecutive addition of ai 2 quenching strains or inhibitors could aid in answering this 4 conclusions this study investigated the role of ai 2 mediated qs on shock responses of anaerobic digestion and demonstrated the potential for improving its resilience to pcp shocks via regulating the ai 2 levels the major conclusions are summarized as follows the ai 2 level in anaerobic digestion was governed primarily by firmicutes and was not significantly affected during a pcp shock during the recovery of a pcp shock a reduction in the ai 2 levels corresponded significantly to a decrease in the population ratio of firmicutes bacteroidetes elevating ai 2 levels in anaerobic digestion had no obvious effects on biogas production during a pcp shock reducing ai 2 levels in anaerobic digestion via the addition of an ai 2 regulating escherichia coli mutant culture resulted in the highest biogas production rate during a pcp shock a reduction in ai 2 levels might reduce acetogenesis and enhance hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis thus leading to less vfa accumulation and higher methane production during the pcp shock declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18812,industrial thiocyanate scn waste streams from gold mining and coal coking have polluted environments worldwide modern scn bioremediation involves use of complex engineered heterotrophic microbiomes little attention has been given to the ability of a simple environmental autotrophic microbiome to biodegrade scn here we present results from a bioreactor experiment inoculated with scn loaded mine tailings incubated autotrophically and subjected to a range of environmentally relevant conditions genome resolved metagenomics revealed that scn hydrolase encoding sulphur oxidizing

microbiomes developed spatially planktonic versus sessile and temporally across changing environmental parameters bioreactor microbiome structures changed significantly with increasing temperature shifting from thiobacilli to a novel scn hydrolase encoding gammaproteobacteria transformation of carbonyl sulphide cos a key intermediate in global biogeochemical sulphur cycling was mediated by plasmid hosted cs2 and cos hydrolase genes associated with thiobacillus revealing a potential for horizontal transfer of this function our work shows that simple native autotrophic microbiomes from

et al 2017a b and used to inoculate a 4l double jacketed bioreactor sartorius stedim biostat b connected to a chiller unit sartorius stedim frigomix r the bioreactor was first filled with 4l of basal salts medium si containing 22 mm scn and adjusted to ph 8 using naoh inoculated and maintained in batch no flow mode in the dark at 30 c with filtered air 0 5 l min 1 through a 0 22 μm filter and impeller set at 150 rpm after this period 16 days flow through of base medium was initiated at 17 21 mm scn throughout flow through ph was maintained at 6 9 via automatic addition of naoh the first 44 days of flow were used to optimise culturing conditions and promote biofilm establishment subject to changing temperature air supply rate vvm and hydraulic residence time hrt this period was followed by 11 days in batch mode and re establishment of flow at 55 days with base medium containing 43 04 mm scn upon re establishment of flow temperature was incrementally increased from 20 c to 45 c in 5 c steps over 30 days and at constant vvm 0 034 l l min and hrt 3 27 days subsequently temperature was decreased to 20 c day 87 and hrt was increased to 5 07 days after maintaining these conditions for 18 days medium flow was incrementally increased to result in hrts of 3 27 days and 2 04 days while maintaining the latter hrt air supply was incrementally increased from 0 034 vvm to 0 057 0 114 and 0 227 vvm days 113 117 and 119 respectively before a decrease back to 0 057 vvm day 125 the remaining 17 days of flow were maintained under constant conditions at 0 057 vvm 5 07 days hrt and 20 c these environmental parameters were varied to test how the microbial community responded and how this impacted the overall functionality of the system 2 2 bioreactor sampling at regular intervals samples of the liquid phase medium including planktonic biomass were removed aseptically using an apparatus attached to a dip tube at each time point approximately 10 ml of liquid was recovered of which 2 5 ml was passed through a 0 22 μm filter for chemical analysis the unfiltered portion of each sample was immediately stored at 80 c for later analysis at strategic time points the unfiltered samples were used for microbial community dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis these timepoints corresponded to the initial inoculum day 16 start of flow through day 0 end of initial optimization period day 44 eight samples over the temperature ramp days 59 61 67 71 77 82 85 and 89 and during high air flow rate day 121 at the end of the experiment day 142 triplicate sampling was performed of the liquid phase 10 ml and two spatially and visually distinct biofilms outer light and inner dark coloured respectively that grew on bioreactor internal components see si fig s1 these samples were immediately

ml phosphate buffered saline solution pbs whole community genomic dna was extracted from this resuspension using a phenol chloroform extraction method described in the si library preparation and sequencing were performed at the australian genome research facility agrf paired end illumina truseq nano libraries with 350 bp inserts were prepared and sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 generating 100 bp paired end reads table s1 2 5 bioinformatic analyses illumina adapters were excised from paired end reads and reads were trimmed using trimmomatic 0 33 bolger et al 2014 trimmed reads were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 scaffolds less than 1000 bp were removed from the data and genes were predicted on 1 kbp long scaffolds using prodigal v2 60 with metagenomic settings hyatt et al 2010 predicted protein coding genes were translated into corresponding amino acid sequences and then annotated using blast against kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 uniref100 and uniprot consortium 2016 databases key functional genes of interest were identified using hmmer v3 1b1 utilizing hidden markov models hmm from https github com banfieldlab pfam finn et al 2015 and custom generated hmm profiles using amino acid sequences from ncbi scaffolds were uploaded to ggkbase ggkbase berkeley edu and binned based on consensus taxonomy percent gc composition and degree of coverage allowing for manual input via visual inspection of single copy gene inventories of putative genome bins this first round of binning was then constrained and improved with emergent self organizing mapping esom utilizing differential abundance profiling across samples sharon et al 2013 visualized and trained through the databionic esom tool ultsch and mörchen 2005 fig s2a and s2b the resulting prokaryotic bins from all of the samples were then dereplicated using drep olm et al 2017 using 99 average nucleotide identity ani as a general cut off with lower ani adopted for clusters of lower quality bins four in total checkm parks et al 2015 was then used to estimate genome completeness and contamination only dereplicated bins that were estimated to be 70 complete with 10 contamination were used for further analysis the resulting genomes were curated using an automated curation tool ra2 py which reassembles or masks areas with local misassemblies brown et al 2015 the genome indices of replication irep were calculated using the irep py tool brown et al 2016 only irep values that passed genome and mapping quality thresholds were retained non specifically mapping reads were removed by filtering out those that had 3 mismatches and by retaining only genomes that had 2 contamination and 75 completeness data were only presented if they passed stringent quality control parameters see si in order to determine the relative abundance of dereplicated genomes across spatial and time series sampling each draft genome was subjected to the average coverage method used in the irep py tool brown et al 2016 firstly the reads for an individual sample were mapped to the dereplicated draft genome again filtering out those that had 3 mismatches coverage values for each scaffold of the draft genome were concatenated and a 5 kbp sliding window 100 bp window length was used to obtain coverage values across the genome with the average coverage calculated these averages were then normalized for sequencing depth by dividing by the reads per sample and then by multiplying by the number of reads for the largest sample the phylogeny of the dereplicated genomes was analysed based on their 16s rrna gene sequences and 16 concatenated ribosomal protein 16rp sequences the details of the methods for the 16s rrna gene sequence and 16rp phylogenetic tree methods are presented in the si with the latter also previously described hug et al 2013 2 6 data availability raw read data are accessible at ncbi under bioproject id number prjna532676 http www ncbi nim nih gov and individual biosample id

performed using the r software with the stats base r package for data pre processing https www r project org univariate analyses and time course modelling the mixomics r package was used for data transformation rohart et al 2017 multivariate analyses for data exploration and data integration the normalized coverage data for the individual taxa and that of taxa grouped by predicted metabolic function were calculated as proportions using total sum scaling followed by centered log ratio transformation lê cao et al 2016 principal component analysis pca was conducted on all samples or a subset of samples to test for differential abundance between any of the spatial conditions one way welch s anova tests with unequal variances were performed on each taxon or grouped metabolic function pairwise comparisons between two conditions with welsh s t tests were also performed p values corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate benjamini and hochberg 1995 with a 5 significance level on the temporal planktonic samples taken from the bioreactor table s1 including an average of the final day day 142 triplicate sample time trajectories for each taxon each predicted metabolic function group and each physico chemistry measurement were modelled using cubic smoothing splines with a 0 5 smoothing parameter prior to data integration this smoothing process enabled to interpolate data points matching across all three data sets taxa grouped metabolic function and physico chemistry measurements in order to identify co abundant profiles between taxa grouped metabolic functions with either temperature or o2 the multivariate multiblock sparse pls method was applied on the smoothing spline profiles interpolated at the 11 time points the method is an extension of singh et al 2018 and enables simultaneous integration of multiple datasets and identification of correlated profiles scaled for visualisation purposes 3 results 3 1 bioreactor chemistry during the

of 3 27 days and air supply of 0 034 vvm removal rates varied with a maximum of 13 1 mm day 1 l 1 during higher flow rates low hrt and temperatures 35 c nitrate consistently measured below 0 1 mm and cno ranged from below detection limit to 0 03 mm with naoh as a buffer ph remained between 6 9 and 8 0 for most of the experiment with the exception of a single pump failure that allowed ph to decrease to 5 for 1 day concomitantly o2 saturation decreased from 56 at 20 c to a mean of 8 9 at t 30 c percentage saturation of o2 reflected both biological consumption and influent supply rates cumulative n concentrations i e analysed n species including residual scn accounted for an average of 72 of n in the influent scn over the experimental period during complete or near complete scn removal 0 1 mm residual scn the average measured recovery of n was 65 with nh4 typically accounting for 99 9 of total n averaged over the entire experiment most s 97 added as scn could be accounted for as so4 2 and residual scn however during complete and near complete scn degradation remaining scn 0 1 mm only 80 of added s could be thus ascribed during the air supply ramp experiment a lower temperature 20 c and hrt 2 04 days were chosen to allow scn accumulation such that the effect of aeration could be detected increasing the air supply 0 034 vvm to 0 227 vvm increased ph from 6 9 at a vvm of 0 034 7 8 at a vvm of 0 227 and resulted in lower nh4 and so4 2 concentrations importantly increased air supply increased the rate of scn removal fig 1 3 2 microbial community phylogeny and metabolic potential phylogenetic placement of dereplicated prokaryotic genome bins fig 2 and table s2 is presented in fig s3 and fig s4 based on concatenated alignments of 16 ribosomal proteins rps and 16s rrna gene sequences respectively the predicted metabolic potential of the 50 recovered draft genomes is summarized in fig 2 and table s4 all prokaryotic genome bins were assigned to bacteria with essentially no archaeal genome fragments detected based on their closest phylogenetic neighbours bacterial genomes represented alphaproteobacteria 27 gammaproteobacteria 8 bacteroidetes 8 betaproteobacteria 3 with the remainder representing deltaproteobacteria 1 deinococcus thermus 1 actinobacteria 1 and firmicutes 1 the majority of samples were dominated by five bacterial strains three thiobacilli thiobacillus 63 thiobacillus 64 thiobacillus 67 one chromatiales gammaproteobacteria 66 and a flavobacteriales flavobacteriales 32 3 3 scn biodegradation within dereplicated genomes three different genes were closely related to afipia type scnase hussain et al 2013 two of which binned to thiobacilli figs 2 and 3a these sequences closely related to other scnases previously identified in thiobacilli including those inhabiting an organic carbon supplied scn degrading bioreactor kantor et al 2015 all scnase genes were directly flanked by genes encoding homologous predicted proteins of unknown function fig 3b the thiobacilli scnases were located downstream of a series of tonb system genes and upstream of the soxax encoding genes as previously noted for other thiobacilli kantor et al 2015 the third putative scnase gene was found in the genome of a gammaproteobacterium interestingly this sequence was most closely related to one previously annotated as thiocyanate dehydrogenase tcdh from gammaproteobacterium thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus strain fokn1 oshiki et al 2017 strain fokn1 is closely related to th thiocyanaticus strain hrh1t which forms cno as an intermediate during scn degradation consistent with use of tcdh in the cno pathway sorokin et al 2010 however all of the sequences from current and prior studies were more closely related to afipia type scnase than to the tcdh protein isolated from gammaproteobacterium thioalkalivibrio paradoxus berben et al 2017 fig 3a we searched for the gamma subunit of the three subunit scnase complex of the alternative carbonyl sulphide pathway katayama et al 1992 and found a number of sequences with homology however all lacked βarg90 which is required along with γarg136 to confer activity towards scn rather than nitrile arakawa et al 2007 yamanaka et al 2013 thus we inferred that no microorganism in the system used the three subunit scnase complex for scn degradation 3 4 cos transforming genes a number of protein sequences closely related to cs2 hydrolase and cos hydrolase cosases sequences within clade d of the β type carbonic anhydrase clade d β ca fig 4 b the cs2 hydrolase protein sequences from this study contained the specific ff motif needed to form the hydrophobic tunnel to the reactive centre smeulders et al 2011 the cosase sequences all contained high sequence similarity in the α5 helix and the extra loop near the n terminus of the α6 hypothesized to confer substrate specificity towards cos ogawa et al 2016 one of the proteins with significant homology to cs2 hydrolases was encoded within the gammaproteobacteria 66 genome the five other sequences were encoded on scaffolds binned to two different plasmids each plasmid encoded a sequence homologous to a cs2 hydrolase in close proximity to a homologous cosase sequence fig 4b the protein sequences for the cs2 hydolases and cosases encoded on each of the plasmids were nearly identical with 2 and 4 amino acid substitutions respectively another clade d β ca sequence not related to cosase and cs2 hydrolases was also encoded in a different region of one of the plasmids the gene clusters surrounding the cosase and cs2 hydrolase sequences on the two plasmids were very similar both having plasmid partitioning peptidase and type iv secretion system encoding genes upstream fig 4a however downstream one plasmid lacked the transposase of the other and contained a sulphide quinone reductase sqr encoding gene interestingly both cosase genes were located near a zn fe permease encoding region potentially supplying zn as the catalytic centre in the cosase ogawa et al 2013 because of difficulty in assembling the complete circular plasmid sequences from original binned scaffolds assembly graphs were visualized with bandage wick et al 2015 and one of the plasmids was resolved fig s5 the consensus phylogeny of the main scaffolds of both plasmids indicated a relationship with the thiobacilli of the three thiobacilli the pattern of plasmid abundance over samples correlated most closely with the pattern of abundance of the thiobacillus 63 and thiobacillus 64 genomes suggesting their association with these bacteria 3 5 sulphur oxidation genes a high proportion of the draft genomes contained genes encoding sulphur oxidation enzymes including sulphide dehydrogenases fccb and sulphide quinone reductases sqr reported to catalyze oxidation of s2 to s0 friedrich et al 2001 fig 2 complete sox pathways enabling conversion of s2 to so4 2 were identified in ten genomes all within the alphaproteobacteria incomplete sox pathways missing sox cd were identified in five genomes and three other genomes lacked soxaxyz or soxb four genomes the three thiobacilli and gammaproteobacteria 66 containing partial sox pathways also contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulphite reductase rdsr enzymes in addition to adenylylsulphate reductase aprab and sulphate adenylyltransferase sat enabling complete oxidation from s2 to so4 2 3 6 carbon acquisition and cycling the ability to fix co2 was widespread in the bioreactor microbial community with thirteen of the fifty genomes encoding co2 fixation pathways including four out of five of the most abundant bacteria twelve genomes contained ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco encoding genes of the calvin benson bassham cbb pathway the majority of rubisco genes encode form i rubiscos with four genomes chromatiales 66 gammaproteobacteria 66 thiobacillus 63 and thiobacillus 64 also containing form ii rubisco genes alongside rubisco encoding genes three genomes also possessed genes encoding carboxysome proteins chromatiales 66 gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 67 in addition to the above cbb cycle genes the deltaproteobacteria 71 genome was tentatively identified as containing three of the key genes of the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca fumarate reductase 2 oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and citrate lysase the remaining genomes lacking key co2 fixation pathway genes were predicted to be derived from heterotrophic organisms genes encoding the complete tca cycle were present in all but clostridiales 31 cytophagia 35 micrococcales 70 and rhodobacterales 68 2 table s4 micrococcales 70 and rhodobacterales 68 2 encode nearly complete tca cycles but lacked two of the eight key genes the clostridiales 31 and cytophagia 35 genomes lacked the majority and all of the genes respectively cytophagia 35 is a predicted obligate symbiont and phylogenetically most closely related to an amoeba endosymbiont clostridiales 31 was predicted to be an obligate fermenter capable of the genesis of ethanol lactatae butyrate and 1 butanol table s4 in addition a wide variety of bacteria in the system is at least capable of some form of facultative fermentation with most encoding ethanol and lactate synthesis with acetate and butyrate synthesis genes also well represented 3 7 nitrogen cycling ammonium oxidation genes encoding nh4 oxidation amo ammonium monooxygenase and no2 oxidation nxrab nitrite oxidoreductase were not found in the bioreactor community fig 2 the gammproteobacteria 66 genome contained a gene encoding a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao protein potentially capable of catalyzing hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite three genomes contained complete denitrification pathways and many encoded partial denitrification pathways one genome rhizobiales 63 2 also contained genes for the complete nitrogen fixation pathway 3 8 aerobic vs anaerobic microbial abundance the bioreactor was dominated by bacteria capable of utilizing oxygen inferred by the presence of genes encoding cytochrome c oxidases fig 2 the presence of these genes does not rule out the potential utilization of facultative anaerobic pathways five genomes however lacked these key genes and were therefore inferred to belong to obligate anaerobes these include clostridiales 31 the predicted endosymbiont cytophagia 35 bacteroidia 44 alphaproteobacteria 50 and algoriphagus 43 3 9 potential for hydrogen metabolism five of the recovered genomes had genes that encode three different types of hydrogenases fig 2 rhizobiales 63 2 encodes a group 1d nife hydrogenase an o2 tolerant enzyme that typically utilizes h2 as an electron donor coupled to o2 or fumarate pandelia et al 2012 greening et al 2016 the gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 63 encode genes for group 1e hydrogenases which can either couple s0 reduction to oxidation of h2 or the reverse of this reaction laurinavichene et al 2007 in addition three genomes thiobacillus 64 gammaproteobacteria 66 and chromatiales 66 encode group 3b hydrogenases and sulphhydrogenases which can catalyze oxidation of nadph and release of h2 the reverse of this reaction or reducing sulphur or polysulphide coupled to h2 as the electron donor laurinavichene et al 2007 sun et al 2010 pedroni et al 1995 3 10 spatial microbial community dynamics the triplicate samples clustered based on their spatial region in the bioreactor planktonic light and dark biofilms in spatio temporal principal component analyses pca fig s6 and in the dendrogram in fig 2 the biofilm regions were more similar to each other than they were to the planktonic phase communities at any time point fig s6 all three regions were dominated 81 92 by five abundant taxa the three thiobacilli gammaproteobacteria 66 and flavobacteriales 32 two of the thiobacilli thiobacillus 64 and thiobacillus 63 exhibited similar abundance behaviour with an r2 of 0 99 tables s6 and s7 and were preferentially enriched in the planktonic phase p values presented in table s8 the remaining thiobacillus thiobacillus 67 exhibited a strong negative correlation with the other two thiobacilli r2 0 94 and was significantly enriched in the biofilm regions the gammaproteobacteria 66 was most abundant in the light biofilm region and the flavobacteriales 32 was more evenly distributed among the three regions when grouped by metabolic potential genomes encoding autotrophic pathway genes clearly dominated 85 relative abundance the microbial communities in all three regions of the autotrophic bacteria those also encoding scn hydrolase genes were the most abundant making up on average 66 73 and 84 total abundance in the planktonic phase light biofilm and dark biofilm respectively with significant enrichment of this trait in the dark biofilm region fig s7 the ability to oxidize sulphur via complete sox or complete rdsr pathways is widely distributed among taxa in all three spatial regions the partial sox including soxb pathway was however preferentially enriched in the light and dark biofilm regions genomes possessing dentrification and nitrogen fixation pathway genes were significantly enriched in the planktonic phase although bacteria with at least the capability of utilizing oxygen as an electron acceptor dominate obligate anaerobes were present at low abundance throughout all three regions this group of bacteria were however significantly enriched within the dark biofilm 3 11 temporal microbial community dynamics the composition of the planktonic microbial community exhibited dynamic changes over time corresponding to changing culturing conditions fig 5 the initial inoculum of the bioreactor was dominated by a scnase containing thiobacillus 67 two pseudomonads a sulphur oxidizing rhiozbium 62 complete sox and hoflea 63 partial sox at the end of the initial batch phase when scn levels were near zero rhizobium 62 dominated the system alongside gammaproetobacteria 66 pseudomonas 63 2 and bacteroidia 48 after the initiation of flow of scn containing media at day 0 the community became dominated by sulphur oxidizing chemolithotrophs that possess scnase genes partial sox and complete dsr pathways of these thiobacillus 64 dominated along with smaller populations of thiobacillus 67 and gammaproteobacteria 66 in addition to the scnase lacking thiobacillus 63 when the temperature increased from 25 to 30 c the community shifted in dominance from thiobacillus 64 to gammaproteobacter 66 fig 5a the gammaproteobacteria 66 continued to dominate up to 45 c and persisted for at least three days after the reactor was returned to 20 c after which the community reverted to thiobacillus 64 dominance the irep values for gammaproteobacteria 66 increased as temperature increased and sustained high replication rates when temperature decreased back to 20 c before decreasing over the remainder of the experiment fig 5b and table s5 thiobacillus 67 and thiobacillus 63 decreased in abundance as temperature increased reaching minimums at 82 89 day samples 40 45 c this observation was concomitant with a decrease in the irep values of the thiobacillus 67 over this period followed by an increase after temperature was decreased in terms of grouped metabolic potential fig 5c the community was consistently dominated by autotrophs although heterotrophic bacteria were relatively more abundant during higher temperatures and in the initial inoculum the proportion of the planktonic community possessing scnase genes increased significantly after initiation of scn supply to the system a trait closely associated with bacteria possessing complete rdsr gene pathway this route to sulphur oxidation was typically more abundant than complete sox pathway containing bacteria which were abundant at the end of the initial batch phase and marginally increased in abundance again at higher temperatures obligate anaerobes also increased in abundance at higher temperatures during a time of low o2 within the bioreactor vessel in order to assess if the changes in abundance correlate best with temperature or o2 the two principle variables in the system we clustered the splined normalized coverage data for individual taxa and metabolic potential groups with temperature and o2 data fig s8 significantly the group of organisms which best correlated with temperature includes the gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 67 both of which did not closely correlate with o2 a number of bacteria correlated with both temperature and o2 deltaproteobacteria 71 rhizobiales 66 rhizobiales 68 and brevundimonas 69 precluding the linking of changes in their abundance with either variable in terms of grouped metabolic potential fig s8c and s8f unsurprisingly temperature also correlated with the encoding of hao and cs2 hydrolase both solely encoded in the gammaproteobacteria 66 the abundance of total autotrophs their individual pathways rubisco and rtca and a number of sulphur and nitrogen cycling pathways correlated with both temperature and o2 however the obligate anaerobes group was found to solely correlate with the o2 4 discussion dominance of the bioreactor consortium by autotrophic scn degrading bacteria revealed this function to be the key metabolic trait consistent with scn being the sole energy source the thiobacilli that dominated this metabolic niche were previously identified in other more complex scn degrading systems kantor et al 2015 ryu et al 2015 huddy et al 2015 watts et al 2017a b villemur et al 2015 by coupling oxidation of released sulphur to carbon fixation these microbes were able to utilise scn in the absence of a labile organic carbon substrate although less abundant a number of other bacteria lacking scnase genes were also able to oxidize reduced sulphur species many also fixing carbon and potentially gaining energy by utilizing hypothesized metabolic handoffs of reduced sulphur from scnase encoding bacteria kantor et al 2017 collectively autotrophic sulphur oxidizers constituted the primary producer base of the bioreactor microbiome supplying organic carbon to less abundant heterotrophs fig 6 and s9 although our data provided a high level of resolution for species function the detailed pathways and intermediate metabolites that enabled cross feeding between chemolithotrophs and heterotrophs remain unresolved this recycling of biomass was likely mediated by the presence of a eukaryotic bacterivore belonging to the acanthamoeba genus lesen et al 2010 irrespective of pathway the majority of predicted heterotrophs were capable of aerobic utilization of simple carbon sources many were also capable of fermentation including the predicted obligate fermenter clostridiales 31 and possibly contributed to carbon cycling in anaerobic biofilm niches within the bioreactor these intriguing trophic interactions likely mirror those occurring in dark sulphur environments xie et al 2011 swan et al 2011 where reduced sulphur can provide the initial energy for primary productivity to sustain a diverse population of heterotrophs lau et al 2016 this study presents the first direct evidence for genes encoding both of the key enzymes implicated in cos degradation cosase ogawa et al 2013 and cs2 hydrolase smeulders et al 2011 being co located on a plasmid given that cos and cs2 are important components of the global sulphur cycle watts 2000 this finding is important for understanding the distribution of this metabolic trait among bacteria genes encoding cs2 hydrolase have been previously located on plasmids and were proposed to represent a lateral gene transfer from bacteria to archaea smeulders et al 2013 conversely cosase has only been identified as encoded in a limited number of bacterial genomes and was not previously reported to be associated with mobile genetic elements our finding therefore indicates that genes encoding this important function can potentially transfer within scn degrading microbial consortia the association of plasmid encoded cosase and cs2 hydrolase with thiobacilli implies an increased metabolic capability for sulphur oxidation in their hosts within scn degrading systems these enzymes are crucial for the release of reduced sulphur for subsequent oxidation a metabolism underpinning the entire microbial community indeed other cosase and cs2 hydrolase sequences fig 4 are encoded in known scn degrading microorganisms kantor et al 2015 berben et al 2017 ogawa et al 2013 their presence in non scn degrading sulphur oxidizers suggests they have a wider role in supplying reduced sulphur as an energy source smeulders et al 2013 as cos and cs2 are nearly ubiquitous in the atmosphere watts 2000 these compounds potentially play a vital role in sustaining microbial populations in the absence of other energy sources and also in sustaining primary productivity in such systems through carbon fixation the degradation of scn evidently results in accumulation of nh4 as an end product this accumulation is proposed to proceed via the cos degradation pathway due to the absence of homologous sequences to tcdh with the latter implicated in the degradation of scn to cno berben et al 2017 although cno was detected at low concentrations in our experiment its occurrence in the environment widner et al 2013 is primarily attributed to formation within cells from urea and carbamoyl phosphate qian et al 1997 purcarea et al 2003 although nh4 from scn biodegradation provides a potential energy source for nitrifying microorganisms little evidence was found in our chemical or metagenomic data for nitrification only the hao gene of the nitrification pathway was identified and the lack of nh4 oxidation likely prevented supply of the hydroxylamine substrate the potential for denitrification was widespread in the bioreactor microbiome however in the absence of nitrification it is unlikely that nitrate was generated without nitrification denitrification the incomplete recovery of n from that added as scn potentially indicated n assimilation only one low abundance bacterium rhizobiales 63 2 was capable of nitrogen fixation clear differences existed among the planktonic and two types of biofilm microbiomes to what extent these differences represented distinct communities was difficult to ascertain where processes such as sloughing of biofilm could represent an exchange with planktonic cells kantor et al 2017 however the physico chemical conditions in the three populations were likely different for example o2 levels were assumed to be lower for the dark biofilm than the planktonic phase or light biofilm hibiya et al 2004 rani et al 2007 yet sulphur oxidizing bacteria e g thiobacillus 67 also dominated the dark biofilm therefore their metabolic mode was unclear possibly the dark biofilm primarily consisted of dead or dormant thiobacillus cells alongside active obligately and facultatively anaerobic heterotrophs van zyl et al 2011 obligate anaerobes although typically residing in biofilms were also observed to colonize the planktonic phase during periods of low o2 concentration obligate and facultative anaerobes could potentially utilise organic substrates via fermentation or respire inorganic so4 2 present in the basal medium and as an end product of scn degradation we acknowledge the limitation of not being able to characterise dynamic response as easily in the biofilm phase of the bioreactor analysis of the light and dark biofilms which formed over time were conducted under steady state conditions we note that the speed at which the biofilm responds compared to the planktonic phase for which we present evidence for a fast response is unclear however a comparison between the light and dark biofilm regions and their community composition and potential metabolic function remains valid within the planktonic phase the three dominant scnase encoding bacteria clearly proliferated within different temperature windows the observed transition from thiobacillus 64 thiobacillus 67 to gammaproteobacteria 66 at higher temperatures had little apparent impact on the metabolic potential of the community as both of these groups encoded scnase partial sox and complete rdsr pathways the only difference was that gammaproteobacteria 66 also encoded cs2 hydrolase in its genome in contrast to thiobacillus 64 which was hypothesized to encode both cs2 hydrolase and cosase on a plasmid 5 conclusions our study revealed the potential for scn to sustain a metabolically diverse microbiome underpinned by chemolithotrophic bacteria this microbiome could mediate scn biodegradation in the absence of organic carbon additions found in previous studies of lab and field bioreactors van zyl et al 2011 the autotrophic microbiome effectively metabolised scn over the environmentally relevant range of tested conditions with different strains of scnase encoding bacteria occupying different spatial and temporal niches genes encoding enzymes that catalyze cos degradation were found co located on plasmids providing the first evidence for potential horizontal transfer of cosase genes and amplifying the view that cs2 hydrolase genes are also mobile our study therefore yields new and fundamental insights into microbial degradation of scn with implications for scn bioremediation and biogeochemical s and n cycling in both natural environments and engineered

18812,industrial thiocyanate scn waste streams from gold mining and coal coking have polluted environments worldwide modern scn bioremediation involves use of complex engineered heterotrophic microbiomes little attention has been given to the ability of a simple environmental autotrophic microbiome to biodegrade scn here we present results from a bioreactor experiment inoculated with scn loaded mine tailings incubated autotrophically and subjected to a range of environmentally relevant conditions genome resolved metagenomics revealed that scn hydrolase encoding sulphur oxidizing autotrophic bacteria mediated scn degradation these microbes supported metabolically dependent non scn degrading sulphur oxidizing autotrophs and non sulphur oxidizing heterotrophs and niche microbiomes developed spatially planktonic versus sessile and temporally across changing environmental parameters bioreactor microbiome structures changed significantly with increasing temperature shifting from thiobacilli to a novel scn hydrolase encoding gammaproteobacteria transformation of carbonyl sulphide cos a key intermediate in global biogeochemical sulphur cycling was mediated by plasmid hosted cs2 and cos hydrolase genes associated with thiobacillus revealing a potential for horizontal transfer of this function our work shows that simple native autotrophic microbiomes from mine tailings can be employed for scn bioremediation thus improving the recycling of ore processing waters and reducing the hydrological footprint of mining graphical abstract image 1 keywords

further degrade cos via β carbonic anhydrases clade d that typically reversibly convert co2 to hco3 ogawa et al 2016 this clade includes the cos hydrolase of t thioparus thi115 exhibiting specificity towards cos ogawa et al 2013 and carbon disulphide cs2 hydrolase known to catalyze cos and cs2 degradation smeulders et al 2011 2013 these enzymes constrain environmental concentrations of cos a major sulphur bearing trace gas watts 2000 with important implications for atmospheric warming similarly cno degradation typically involves cyanate enzymes widely distributed among environmental bacteria anderson et al 1990 that contribute to n biogeochemical cycling end products of scn biodegradation include ammonium nh4 carbon dioxide co2 and sulphide s2 or elemental sulphur s0 watts and moreau 2016 berben et al 2017 degradation of scn cos and cno and the subsequent bioavailability of metabolic intermediates can sustain diverse microorganisms such microbes include chemolithotrophic sulphur and

bacterivores kantor et al 2017 indeed the presence of non scn degrading sulphur and nitrogen oxidizing taxa has been interpreted as indicative of metabolic cross feeding from scn degrading strains kantor et al 2015 such cross feeding helps to render scn biodegradation a net free energy yielding process in prior work we demonstrated the capability for scn degradation by an autotrophic microbiome native to gold mine tailings in a batch run bioreactor watts et al 2017a b here we assess metabolic potentials and community scale interactions within native autotrophic planktonic and biofilm microbiomes growing in a lab scale flow through scn degrading bioreactor our experiments omitted organic carbon and simulated realistic environmental changes thus approximating autotrophic scn biodegradation at full and field scales e g mine sites coal coking plants we employed genome resolved metagenomics to characterise microbiome dynamics across changes in temperature hydraulic residence time and air supply rate recovering high quality bacterial draft genomes including plasmids encoding for metabolism of cos and cs2 our findings permit the deciphering and quantitative assessment of microbial species functions and interactions in scn degrading bioremediation systems 2 methods 2 1 bioreactor culturing an scn degrading microbial consortium was enriched from gold mine tailings watts et al 2017a b and used to inoculate a 4l double jacketed bioreactor sartorius stedim biostat b connected to a chiller unit sartorius stedim frigomix r the bioreactor was first filled with 4l of basal salts medium si containing 22 mm scn and adjusted to ph 8 using naoh inoculated and maintained in batch no flow mode in the dark at 30 c with filtered air 0 5 l min 1 through a 0 22 μm filter and impeller set at 150 rpm after this period 16 days flow through of base medium was initiated at 17 21 mm scn throughout flow through ph was maintained at 6 9 via automatic addition of naoh the first 44 days of flow were used to optimise culturing conditions and promote biofilm establishment subject to changing temperature air supply rate vvm and hydraulic residence time hrt this period was followed by 11 days in batch mode and re establishment of flow at 55 days with base medium containing 43 04 mm scn upon re establishment of flow temperature was incrementally increased from 20 c to 45 c in 5 c steps over 30 days and at constant vvm 0 034 l l min and hrt 3 27 days subsequently temperature was decreased to 20 c day 87 and hrt was increased to 5 07 days after maintaining these conditions for 18 days medium flow was incrementally increased to result in hrts of 3 27 days and 2 04 days while maintaining the latter hrt air supply was incrementally increased from 0 034 vvm to 0 057 0 114 and 0 227 vvm days 113 117 and 119 respectively before a decrease back to 0 057 vvm day 125 the remaining 17 days of flow were maintained under constant conditions at 0 057 vvm 5 07 days hrt and 20 c these environmental parameters were varied to test how the microbial community responded and how this impacted the overall functionality of the system 2 2 bioreactor sampling at regular intervals samples of the liquid phase medium including planktonic biomass were removed aseptically using an apparatus attached to a dip tube at each time point approximately 10 ml of liquid was recovered of which 2 5 ml was passed through a 0 22 μm filter for chemical analysis the unfiltered portion of each sample was immediately stored at 80 c for later analysis at strategic time points the unfiltered samples were used for microbial community dna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis these timepoints corresponded to the initial inoculum day 16 start of flow through day 0 end of initial optimization period day 44

sequencing were performed at the australian genome research facility agrf paired end illumina truseq nano libraries with 350 bp inserts were prepared and sequenced on an illumina hiseq 2500 generating 100 bp paired end reads table s1 2 5 bioinformatic analyses illumina adapters were excised from paired end reads and reads were trimmed using trimmomatic 0 33 bolger et al 2014 trimmed reads were assembled using idba ud peng et al 2012 scaffolds less than 1000 bp were removed from the data and genes were predicted on 1 kbp long scaffolds using prodigal v2 60 with metagenomic settings hyatt et al 2010 predicted protein coding genes were translated into corresponding amino acid sequences and then annotated using blast against kegg kanehisa and goto 2000 uniref100 and uniprot consortium 2016 databases key functional genes of interest were identified using hmmer v3 1b1 utilizing hidden markov models hmm from https github com banfieldlab pfam finn et al 2015 and custom generated hmm profiles using amino acid sequences from ncbi scaffolds were uploaded to ggkbase ggkbase berkeley edu and binned based on consensus taxonomy percent gc composition and degree of coverage allowing for manual input via visual inspection of single copy gene inventories of putative genome bins this first round of binning was then constrained and improved with emergent self organizing mapping esom utilizing differential abundance profiling across samples sharon et al 2013 visualized and trained through the databionic esom tool ultsch and mörchen 2005 fig s2a and s2b the resulting prokaryotic bins from all of the samples were then dereplicated using drep olm et al 2017 using 99 average nucleotide identity ani as a general cut off with lower ani adopted for clusters of lower quality bins four in total checkm parks et al 2015 was then used to estimate genome completeness and contamination only dereplicated bins that were estimated to be 70 complete with 10 contamination were used for further analysis the resulting genomes were curated using an automated curation tool ra2 py which reassembles or masks areas with local misassemblies brown et al 2015 the genome indices of replication irep were calculated using the irep py tool brown et al 2016 only irep values that passed genome and mapping quality thresholds were retained non specifically mapping reads were removed by filtering out those that had 3 mismatches and by retaining only genomes that had 2 contamination and 75 completeness data were only presented if they passed stringent quality control parameters see si in order to determine the relative abundance of dereplicated genomes across spatial and time series sampling each draft genome was subjected to the average coverage method used in the irep py tool brown et al 2016 firstly the reads for an individual sample were mapped to the dereplicated draft genome again filtering out those that had 3 mismatches coverage values for each scaffold of the draft genome were concatenated and a 5 kbp sliding window 100 bp window length was used to obtain coverage values across the genome with the average coverage calculated these averages were then normalized for sequencing depth by dividing by the reads per sample and then by multiplying by the number of reads for the largest sample the phylogeny of the dereplicated genomes was analysed based on their 16s rrna gene sequences and 16 concatenated ribosomal protein 16rp sequences the details of the methods for the 16s rrna gene sequence and 16rp phylogenetic tree methods are presented in the si with the latter also previously described hug et al 2013 2 6 data availability raw read data are accessible at ncbi under bioproject id number prjna532676 http www ncbi nim nih gov and individual biosample id

performed using the r software with the stats base r package for data pre processing https www r project org univariate analyses and time course modelling the mixomics r package was used for data transformation rohart et al 2017 multivariate analyses for data exploration and data integration the normalized coverage data for the individual taxa and that of taxa grouped by predicted metabolic function were calculated as proportions using total sum scaling followed by centered log ratio transformation lê cao et al 2016 principal component analysis pca was conducted on all samples or a subset of samples to test for differential abundance between any of the spatial conditions one way welch s anova tests with unequal variances were performed on each taxon or grouped metabolic function pairwise comparisons between two conditions with welsh s t tests were also performed p values corrected for multiple testing using false discovery rate benjamini and hochberg 1995 with a 5 significance level on the temporal planktonic samples taken from the bioreactor table s1 including an average of the final day day 142 triplicate sample time trajectories for each taxon each predicted metabolic function group and each physico chemistry measurement were modelled using cubic smoothing splines with a 0 5 smoothing parameter prior to data integration this smoothing process enabled to interpolate data points matching across all three data sets taxa grouped metabolic function and physico chemistry measurements in order to identify co abundant profiles between taxa grouped metabolic functions with either temperature or o2 the multivariate multiblock sparse pls method was applied on the smoothing spline profiles interpolated at the 11 time points the method is an extension of singh et al 2018 and enables simultaneous integration of multiple datasets and identification of correlated profiles scaled for visualisation purposes 3 results 3 1 bioreactor chemistry during the temperature ramp experiment scn removal occurred concomitantly with increases in nh4 and so4 2 fig 1 complete removal of influent scn from 43 mm was observed at t 30 c to the maximum of 45 c at a hrt of 3 27 days and air supply of 0 034 vvm removal rates varied with a maximum of 13 1 mm day 1 l 1 during higher flow rates low hrt and temperatures 35 c nitrate consistently measured below 0 1 mm and cno ranged from below detection limit to 0 03 mm with naoh as a buffer ph remained between 6 9 and 8 0 for most of the experiment with the exception of a single pump failure that allowed ph to decrease to 5 for 1 day concomitantly o2 saturation decreased from 56 at 20 c to a mean of 8 9 at t 30 c percentage saturation of o2 reflected both biological consumption and influent supply rates cumulative n concentrations i e analysed n species including residual scn accounted for an average of 72 of n in the influent scn over the experimental period during complete or near complete scn removal 0 1 mm residual scn the average measured recovery of n was 65 with nh4 typically accounting for 99 9 of total n averaged over the entire experiment most s 97 added as scn could be accounted for as so4 2 and residual scn however during complete and near complete scn degradation remaining scn 0 1 mm only 80 of added s could be thus ascribed during the air supply ramp experiment a lower temperature 20 c and hrt 2 04 days were chosen to allow scn accumulation such that the effect of aeration could be detected increasing the air supply 0 034 vvm to 0 227 vvm increased ph from 6 9 at a vvm of 0 034 7 8 at a vvm of 0 227 and resulted in lower nh4 and so4 2 concentrations importantly increased air supply increased the rate of scn removal fig 1 3 2 microbial community phylogeny and metabolic potential phylogenetic placement of dereplicated prokaryotic genome bins fig 2 and table s2 is presented in fig s3 and fig s4 based on concatenated alignments of 16 ribosomal proteins rps and 16s rrna gene sequences respectively the predicted metabolic potential of the 50 recovered draft genomes is summarized in fig 2 and table s4 all prokaryotic genome bins were assigned to bacteria with essentially no archaeal genome fragments detected based on their closest phylogenetic neighbours bacterial genomes represented alphaproteobacteria 27 gammaproteobacteria 8 bacteroidetes 8 betaproteobacteria 3 with the remainder representing deltaproteobacteria 1 deinococcus thermus 1 actinobacteria 1 and firmicutes 1 the majority of samples were dominated by five bacterial strains three thiobacilli thiobacillus 63 thiobacillus 64 thiobacillus 67 one chromatiales gammaproteobacteria 66 and a flavobacteriales flavobacteriales 32 3 3 scn biodegradation within dereplicated genomes three different genes were closely related to afipia type scnase hussain et al 2013 two of which binned to thiobacilli figs 2 and 3a these sequences closely related to other scnases previously identified in thiobacilli including those inhabiting an organic carbon supplied scn degrading bioreactor kantor et al 2015 all scnase genes were directly flanked by genes encoding homologous predicted proteins of unknown function fig 3b the thiobacilli scnases were located downstream of a series of tonb system genes and upstream of the soxax encoding genes as previously noted for other thiobacilli kantor et al 2015 the third putative scnase gene was found in the genome of a gammaproteobacterium interestingly this sequence was most closely related to one previously annotated as thiocyanate dehydrogenase tcdh from gammaproteobacterium thiohalobacter thiocyanaticus strain fokn1 oshiki et al 2017 strain fokn1 is closely related to th thiocyanaticus strain hrh1t which forms cno as an intermediate during scn degradation consistent with use of tcdh in the cno pathway sorokin et al 2010 however all of the sequences from current and prior studies were more closely related to afipia type scnase than to the tcdh protein isolated from gammaproteobacterium thioalkalivibrio paradoxus berben et al 2017 fig 3a we searched for the gamma subunit of the three subunit scnase complex of the alternative carbonyl sulphide pathway katayama et al 1992 and found a number of sequences with homology however all lacked βarg90 which is required along with γarg136 to confer activity towards scn rather than nitrile arakawa et al 2007 yamanaka et al 2013 thus we inferred that no microorganism in the system used the three subunit scnase complex for scn degradation 3 4 cos transforming genes a number of protein sequences closely related to cs2 hydrolase and cos hydrolase cosases sequences within clade d of the β type carbonic anhydrase clade d β ca fig 4 b the cs2 hydrolase protein sequences from this study contained the specific ff motif needed to form the hydrophobic tunnel to the reactive centre smeulders et al 2011 the cosase sequences all contained high sequence similarity in the α5 helix and the extra loop near the n terminus of the α6 hypothesized to confer substrate specificity towards cos ogawa et al 2016 one of the proteins with significant homology to cs2 hydrolases was encoded within the gammaproteobacteria 66 genome the five other sequences were encoded on scaffolds binned to two different plasmids each plasmid encoded a sequence homologous to a cs2 hydrolase in close proximity to a homologous cosase sequence fig 4b the protein sequences for the cs2 hydolases and cosases encoded on each of the plasmids were nearly identical with 2 and 4 amino acid substitutions respectively another clade d β ca sequence not related to cosase and cs2 hydrolases was also encoded in a different region of one of the plasmids the gene clusters surrounding the cosase and cs2 hydrolase sequences on the two plasmids were very similar both having plasmid partitioning peptidase and type iv secretion system encoding genes upstream fig 4a however downstream one plasmid lacked the transposase of the other and contained a sulphide quinone reductase sqr encoding gene interestingly both cosase genes were located near a zn fe permease encoding region potentially supplying zn as the catalytic centre in the cosase ogawa et al 2013 because of difficulty in assembling the complete circular plasmid sequences from original binned scaffolds assembly graphs were visualized with bandage wick et al 2015 and one of the plasmids was resolved fig s5 the consensus phylogeny of the main scaffolds of both plasmids indicated a relationship with the thiobacilli of the three thiobacilli the pattern of plasmid abundance over samples correlated most closely with the pattern of abundance of the thiobacillus 63 and thiobacillus 64 genomes suggesting their association with these bacteria 3 5 sulphur oxidation genes a high proportion of the draft genomes contained genes encoding sulphur oxidation enzymes including sulphide dehydrogenases fccb and sulphide quinone reductases sqr reported to catalyze oxidation of s2 to s0 friedrich et al 2001 fig 2 complete sox pathways enabling conversion of s2 to so4 2 were identified in ten genomes all within the alphaproteobacteria incomplete sox pathways missing sox cd were identified in five genomes and three other genomes lacked soxaxyz or soxb four genomes the three thiobacilli and gammaproteobacteria 66 containing partial sox pathways also contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulphite reductase rdsr enzymes in addition to adenylylsulphate reductase aprab and sulphate adenylyltransferase sat enabling complete oxidation from s2 to so4 2 3 6 carbon acquisition and cycling the ability to fix co2 was widespread in the bioreactor microbial community with thirteen of the fifty genomes encoding co2 fixation pathways including four out of five of the most abundant bacteria twelve genomes contained ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco encoding genes of the calvin benson bassham cbb pathway the majority of rubisco genes encode form i rubiscos with four genomes chromatiales 66 gammaproteobacteria 66 thiobacillus 63 and thiobacillus 64 also containing form ii rubisco genes alongside rubisco encoding genes three genomes also possessed genes encoding carboxysome proteins chromatiales 66 gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 67 in addition to the above cbb cycle genes the deltaproteobacteria 71 genome was tentatively identified as containing three of the key genes of the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca fumarate reductase 2 oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase and citrate lysase the remaining genomes lacking key co2 fixation pathway genes were predicted to be derived from heterotrophic organisms genes encoding the complete tca cycle were present in all but clostridiales 31 cytophagia 35 micrococcales 70 and rhodobacterales 68 2 table s4 micrococcales 70 and rhodobacterales 68 2 encode nearly complete tca cycles but lacked two of the eight key genes the clostridiales 31 and cytophagia 35 genomes lacked the majority and all of the genes respectively cytophagia 35 is a predicted obligate symbiont and phylogenetically most closely related to an amoeba endosymbiont clostridiales 31 was predicted to be an obligate fermenter capable of the genesis of ethanol lactatae butyrate and 1 butanol table s4 in addition a wide variety of bacteria in the system is at least capable of some form of facultative fermentation with most encoding ethanol and lactate synthesis with acetate and butyrate synthesis genes also well represented 3 7 nitrogen cycling ammonium oxidation genes encoding nh4 oxidation amo ammonium monooxygenase and no2 oxidation nxrab nitrite oxidoreductase were not found in the bioreactor community fig 2 the gammproteobacteria 66 genome contained a gene encoding a hydroxylamine oxidoreductase like hao protein potentially capable of catalyzing hydroxylamine oxidation to nitrite three genomes contained complete denitrification pathways and many encoded partial denitrification pathways one genome rhizobiales 63 2 also contained genes for the complete nitrogen fixation pathway 3 8 aerobic vs anaerobic microbial abundance the bioreactor was dominated by bacteria capable of utilizing oxygen inferred by the presence of genes encoding cytochrome c oxidases fig 2 the presence of these genes does not rule out the potential utilization of facultative anaerobic pathways five genomes however lacked these key genes and were therefore inferred to belong to obligate anaerobes these include clostridiales 31 the predicted endosymbiont cytophagia 35 bacteroidia 44 alphaproteobacteria 50 and algoriphagus 43 3 9 potential for hydrogen metabolism five of the recovered genomes had genes that encode three different types of hydrogenases fig 2 rhizobiales 63 2 encodes a group 1d nife hydrogenase an o2 tolerant enzyme that typically utilizes h2 as an electron donor coupled to o2 or fumarate pandelia et al 2012 greening et al 2016 the gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 63 encode genes for group 1e hydrogenases which can either couple s0 reduction to oxidation of h2 or the reverse of this reaction laurinavichene et al 2007 in addition three genomes thiobacillus 64 gammaproteobacteria 66 and chromatiales 66 encode group 3b hydrogenases and sulphhydrogenases which can catalyze oxidation of nadph and release of h2 the reverse of this reaction or reducing sulphur or polysulphide coupled to h2 as the electron donor laurinavichene et al 2007 sun et al 2010 pedroni et al 1995 3 10 spatial microbial community dynamics the triplicate samples clustered based on their spatial region in the bioreactor planktonic light and dark biofilms in spatio temporal principal component analyses pca fig s6 and in the dendrogram in fig 2 the biofilm regions were more similar to each other than they were to the planktonic phase communities at any time point fig s6 all three regions were dominated 81 92 by five abundant taxa the three thiobacilli gammaproteobacteria 66 and flavobacteriales 32 two of the thiobacilli thiobacillus 64 and thiobacillus 63 exhibited similar abundance behaviour with an r2 of 0 99 tables s6 and s7 and were preferentially enriched in the planktonic phase p values presented in table s8 the remaining thiobacillus thiobacillus 67 exhibited a strong negative correlation with the other two thiobacilli r2 0 94 and was significantly enriched in the biofilm regions the gammaproteobacteria 66 was most abundant in the light biofilm region and the flavobacteriales 32 was more evenly distributed among the three regions when grouped by metabolic potential genomes encoding autotrophic pathway genes clearly dominated 85 relative abundance the microbial communities in all three regions of the autotrophic bacteria those also encoding scn hydrolase genes were the most abundant making up on average 66 73 and 84 total abundance in the planktonic phase light biofilm and dark biofilm respectively with significant enrichment of this trait in the dark biofilm region fig s7 the ability to oxidize sulphur via complete sox or complete rdsr pathways is widely distributed among taxa in all three spatial regions the partial sox including soxb pathway was however preferentially enriched in the light and dark biofilm regions genomes possessing dentrification and nitrogen fixation pathway genes were significantly enriched in the planktonic phase although bacteria with at least the capability of utilizing oxygen as an electron acceptor dominate obligate anaerobes were present at low abundance throughout all three regions this group of bacteria were however significantly enriched within the dark biofilm 3 11 temporal microbial community dynamics the composition of the planktonic microbial community exhibited dynamic changes over time corresponding to changing culturing conditions fig 5 the initial inoculum of the bioreactor was dominated by a scnase containing thiobacillus 67 two pseudomonads a sulphur oxidizing rhiozbium 62 complete sox and hoflea 63 partial sox at the end of the initial batch phase when scn levels were near zero rhizobium 62 dominated the system alongside gammaproetobacteria 66 pseudomonas 63 2 and bacteroidia 48 after the initiation of flow of scn containing media at day 0 the community became dominated by sulphur oxidizing chemolithotrophs that possess scnase genes partial sox and complete dsr pathways of these thiobacillus 64 dominated along with smaller populations of thiobacillus 67 and gammaproteobacteria 66 in addition to the scnase lacking thiobacillus 63 when the temperature increased from 25 to 30 c the community shifted in dominance from thiobacillus 64 to gammaproteobacter 66 fig 5a the gammaproteobacteria 66 continued to dominate up to 45 c and persisted for at least three days after the reactor was returned to 20 c after which the community reverted to thiobacillus 64 dominance the irep values for gammaproteobacteria 66 increased as temperature increased and sustained high replication rates when temperature decreased back to 20 c before decreasing over the remainder of the experiment fig 5b and table s5 thiobacillus 67 and thiobacillus 63 decreased in abundance as temperature increased reaching minimums at 82 89 day samples 40 45 c this observation was concomitant with a decrease in the irep values of the thiobacillus 67 over this period followed by an increase after temperature was decreased in terms of grouped metabolic potential fig 5c the community was consistently dominated by autotrophs although heterotrophic bacteria were relatively more abundant during higher temperatures and in the initial inoculum the proportion of the planktonic community possessing scnase genes increased significantly after initiation of scn supply to the system a trait closely associated with bacteria possessing complete rdsr gene pathway this route to sulphur oxidation was typically more abundant than complete sox pathway containing bacteria which were abundant at the end of the initial batch phase and marginally increased in abundance again at higher temperatures obligate anaerobes also increased in abundance at higher temperatures during a time of low o2 within the bioreactor vessel in order to assess if the changes in abundance correlate best with temperature or o2 the two principle variables in the system we clustered the splined normalized coverage data for individual taxa and metabolic potential groups with temperature and o2 data fig s8 significantly the group of organisms which best correlated with temperature includes the gammaproteobacteria 66 and thiobacillus 67 both of which did not closely correlate with o2 a number of bacteria correlated with both temperature and o2 deltaproteobacteria 71 rhizobiales 66 rhizobiales 68 and brevundimonas 69 precluding the linking of changes in their abundance with either variable in terms of grouped metabolic potential fig s8c and s8f unsurprisingly temperature also correlated with the encoding of hao and cs2 hydrolase both solely encoded in the gammaproteobacteria 66 the abundance of total autotrophs their individual pathways rubisco and rtca and a number of sulphur and nitrogen cycling pathways correlated with both temperature and o2 however the obligate anaerobes group was found to solely correlate with the o2 4 discussion dominance of the bioreactor consortium by autotrophic scn degrading bacteria revealed this function to be the key metabolic trait consistent with scn being the sole energy source the thiobacilli that dominated this metabolic niche were previously identified in other more complex scn degrading systems kantor et al 2015 ryu et al 2015 huddy et al 2015 watts et al 2017a b villemur et al 2015 by coupling oxidation of released sulphur to carbon fixation these microbes were able to utilise scn in the absence of a labile organic carbon substrate although less abundant a number of other bacteria lacking scnase genes were also able to oxidize reduced sulphur species many also fixing carbon and potentially gaining energy by utilizing hypothesized metabolic handoffs of reduced sulphur from scnase encoding bacteria kantor et al 2017 collectively autotrophic sulphur oxidizers constituted the primary producer base of the bioreactor microbiome supplying organic carbon to less abundant heterotrophs fig 6 and s9 although our data provided a high level of resolution for species function the detailed pathways and intermediate metabolites that enabled cross feeding between chemolithotrophs and heterotrophs remain unresolved this recycling of biomass was likely mediated by the presence of a eukaryotic bacterivore belonging to the acanthamoeba genus lesen et al 2010 irrespective of pathway the majority of predicted heterotrophs were capable of aerobic utilization of simple carbon sources many were also capable of fermentation including the predicted obligate fermenter clostridiales 31 and possibly contributed to carbon cycling in anaerobic biofilm niches within the bioreactor these intriguing trophic interactions likely mirror those occurring in dark sulphur environments xie et al 2011 swan et al 2011 where reduced sulphur can provide the initial energy for primary productivity to sustain a diverse population of heterotrophs lau et al 2016 this study presents the first direct evidence for genes encoding both of the key enzymes implicated in cos degradation cosase ogawa et al 2013 and cs2 hydrolase smeulders et al 2011 being co located on a plasmid given that cos and cs2 are important components of the global sulphur cycle watts 2000 this finding is important for understanding the distribution of this metabolic trait among bacteria genes encoding cs2 hydrolase have been previously located on plasmids and were proposed to represent a lateral gene transfer from bacteria to archaea smeulders et al 2013 conversely cosase has only been identified as encoded in a limited number of bacterial genomes and was not previously reported to be associated with mobile genetic elements our finding therefore indicates that genes encoding this important function can potentially transfer within scn degrading microbial consortia the association of plasmid encoded cosase and cs2 hydrolase with thiobacilli implies an increased metabolic capability for sulphur oxidation in their hosts within scn degrading systems these enzymes are crucial for the release of reduced sulphur for subsequent oxidation a metabolism underpinning the entire microbial community indeed other cosase and cs2 hydrolase sequences fig 4 are encoded in known scn degrading microorganisms kantor et al 2015 berben et al 2017 ogawa et al 2013 their presence in non scn degrading sulphur oxidizers suggests they have a wider role in supplying reduced sulphur as an energy source smeulders et al 2013 as cos and cs2 are nearly ubiquitous in the atmosphere watts 2000 these compounds potentially play a vital role in sustaining microbial populations in the absence of other energy sources and also in sustaining primary productivity in such systems through carbon fixation the degradation of scn evidently results in accumulation of nh4 as an end product this accumulation is proposed to proceed via the cos degradation pathway due to the absence of homologous sequences to tcdh with the latter implicated in the degradation of scn to cno berben et al 2017 although cno was detected at low concentrations in our experiment its occurrence in the environment widner et al 2013 is primarily attributed to formation within cells from urea and carbamoyl phosphate qian et al 1997 purcarea et al 2003 although nh4 from scn biodegradation provides a potential energy source for nitrifying microorganisms little evidence was found in our chemical or metagenomic data for nitrification only the hao gene of the nitrification pathway was identified and the lack of nh4 oxidation likely prevented supply of the hydroxylamine substrate the potential for denitrification was widespread in the bioreactor microbiome however in the absence of nitrification it is unlikely that nitrate was generated without nitrification denitrification the incomplete recovery of n from that added as scn potentially indicated n assimilation only one low abundance bacterium rhizobiales 63 2 was capable of nitrogen fixation clear differences existed among the planktonic and two types of biofilm microbiomes to what extent these differences represented distinct communities was difficult to ascertain where processes such as sloughing of biofilm could represent an exchange with planktonic cells kantor et al 2017 however the physico chemical conditions in the three populations were likely different for example o2 levels were assumed to be lower for the dark biofilm than the planktonic phase or light biofilm hibiya et al 2004 rani et al 2007 yet sulphur oxidizing bacteria e g thiobacillus 67 also dominated the dark biofilm therefore their metabolic mode was unclear possibly the dark biofilm primarily consisted of dead or dormant thiobacillus cells alongside active obligately and facultatively anaerobic heterotrophs van zyl et al 2011 obligate anaerobes although typically residing in biofilms were also observed to colonize the planktonic phase during periods of low o2 concentration obligate and facultative anaerobes could potentially utilise organic substrates via fermentation or respire inorganic so4 2 present in the basal medium and as an end product of scn degradation we acknowledge the limitation of not being able to characterise dynamic response as easily in the biofilm phase of the bioreactor analysis of the light and dark biofilms which formed over time were conducted under steady state conditions we note that the speed at which the biofilm responds compared to the planktonic phase for which we present evidence for a fast response is unclear however a comparison between the light and dark biofilm regions and their community composition and potential metabolic function remains valid within the planktonic phase the three dominant scnase encoding bacteria clearly proliferated within different temperature windows the observed transition from thiobacillus 64 thiobacillus 67 to gammaproteobacteria 66 at higher temperatures had little apparent impact on the metabolic potential of the community as both of these groups encoded scnase partial sox and complete rdsr pathways the only difference was that gammaproteobacteria 66 also encoded cs2 hydrolase in its genome in contrast to thiobacillus 64 which was hypothesized to encode both cs2 hydrolase and cosase on a plasmid 5 conclusions our study revealed the potential for scn to sustain a metabolically diverse microbiome underpinned by chemolithotrophic bacteria this microbiome could mediate scn biodegradation in the absence of organic carbon additions found in previous studies of lab and field bioreactors van zyl et al 2011 the autotrophic microbiome effectively metabolised scn over the environmentally relevant range of tested conditions with different strains of scnase encoding bacteria occupying different spatial and temporal niches genes encoding enzymes that catalyze cos degradation were found co located on plasmids providing the first evidence for potential horizontal transfer of cosase genes and amplifying the view that cs2 hydrolase genes are also mobile our study therefore yields new and fundamental insights into microbial degradation of scn with implications for scn bioremediation and biogeochemical s and n cycling in both natural environments and engineered

18813,the export of organic carbon export by the rivers to the oceans either as particulate organic carbon poc or dissolved organic carbon doc is very sensitive to climate change especially in permafrost affected catchments where soils are very rich in organic carbon with global warming organic carbon export in both forms is expected to increase in arctic regions it should affect contemporary biogeochemical cycles in rivers and oceans and therefore modify the whole food web this study tries to understand complex processes involved in sediment poc and doc riverine transport in the yenisei river basin and to quantify their respective fluxes at the river outlet the swat soil and water assessment tool hydrological model is used in this study to simulate water and suspended sediment transfers in the largest arctic river poc and doc export have been quantified with empirical models adapted from literature for the study case first the hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step for the 2003 2008 and the 2009 2016 periods respectively and its output has been compared with field data for water and sediment fluxes based on conceptualization of transfer processes calibration on climate and soil properties has been performed in order to correctly represent hydrology and sediment transfer in permafrost basins second calibration of empirical models for doc poc transport have been performed by comparing their output with field data available from 2003 to 2016 our study reveals that swat is capable of correctly representing hydrology sediment transfer poc and doc fluxes and their spatial distribution at a daily timescale and outlines the links between these fluxes and permafrost features our simulation effort results in specific sediment poc and doc fluxes of 2 97 t km 2 yr 1 0 13 t km 2 yr 1 and 1 14 t km 2 yr 1 for the period 2003 2016 which are in the range of previous estimates about 60 of the total fluxes of sediment doc and poc to the arctic ocean are exported during the two months of the freshet spatial analysis show that permafrost free areas have returned higher daily organic carbon export than permafrost affected

overall increase of 32 is expected for each 2 c of basin warming runoff and sediment transport effects combined syvitski 2002 the latter may involve into fluvial turnover and geochemical cycling a significant quantity of eroded material including carbon stored in permafrost soils koven et al 2011 permafrost stores an enormous pool of approx 1030 gt of ancient soil organic carbon in the first 3 m kuhry et al 2013 hugelius et al 2014 preferentially consumed by bacteria to produce climate relevant gases when released to streams mann et al 2015 permafrost degradation has the potential to significantly influence terrestrial carbon exports to global rivers olefeld and roulet 2014 therefore potential release of ancient carbon from frozen soils constitutes a major concern riverine organic carbon is commonly subdivided into three categories based on its origin hope et al 1994 an allochthonous pool derived from terrestrial organic matter soil leaching and physical erosion an autochthonous pool derived from in situ biological production phytoplankton and an anthropogenic pool derived from agricultural domestic and industrial activities diffuse pollution and waste effluents organic carbon oc in stream waters is present in both dissolved doc and particulate poc forms poc and doc originate from either catchment surface bank and channel erosion from 10 to 50 of poc and from 3 to 35 of doc is labile which means it is subjected to various processes in the fluvial estuarine and coastal marine environment like assimilation mineralization or sedimentation ittekkot and laane 1991 søndergaard and middelboe 1995 cole et al 2007 holmes et al 2008 on the one hand poc concentrations vary with total suspended solids tss the poc percent in the tss is decreasing when the concentration of tss is rising in the river as it has already been shown at a global scale in ludwig et al 1996 when the tss concentration is low in the river the riverine poc is linked to the autochthonous pool detailed before the rise of tss is generally due to erosion which implies a substitution of the main source of poc from the autochthonous to the allochthonous part on the other hand doc concentrations increase with discharge ludwig et al 1996 due to its transport by surface and subsurface water flows global organic carbon flux to the ocean is estimated to be 300 tgc yr 1 with a contribution of 140 tgc yr 1 and 160 tgc yr 1 for poc and doc respectively seitzinger et al 2010 previous estimates range between 370 and 380 tgc yr 1 meybeck 1988 ludwig et al 1996 in the arctic ocean basin doc fluxes exceed those of poc with 18 28 tgc yr 1 against 4 7 tgc yr 1 ludwig et al 1996 dittmar and kattner 2003 mcclelland et al 2016 the difference in the poc doc ratio is related to soil properties with the presence of permafrost restricting surface erosion better understanding of organic carbon origin and pathways in permafrost affected catchments will allow more accurate evaluations of potential impact of deeper active layers on sediment and organic carbon exports prokushkin et al 2011 organic carbon concentrations in arctic rivers follow the discharge with maximum values in spring during the high flows period dittmar and kattner 2003 indeed melting water percolates to join the river and is strongly enriched in organic compounds annual average doc concentrations in arctic rivers range between 2 8 and 12 mgc l 1 lobbes et al 2000 köhler et al 2010 amon et al 2012 they are 1 3 28 times higher than poc concentrations lobbes et al 2000 except for the mackenzie river where poc and doc concentrations are comparable the yenisei river presents the biggest flux of doc to the arctic ocean this flux represents 4 64 4 69 tgc yr 1 raymond et al 2007 holmes et al 2012 while the poc export reaches only 0 17 tgc yr 1 lobbes et al 2000 the poc fraction is found to be consistently older than doc in major arctic rivers guo et al 2007 gustafsson et al 2011 carbon transfer in periglacial fluvial systems is complex because of freeze thaw processes only the seasonally thawed part of permafrost soil or active layer i e from first tens to several meters is exposed to biogeochemical activity zhang et al 2005 schuur et al 2008 the doc transfer in soils is mainly possible through the thawed layer while poc may originate from older stocks of glacial or floodplain sediment in permafrost regions 20 60 of the organic carbon is stored in peatlands while 1 20 is stored in mineral soils and its stock totals 472 27 pgc hugelius et al 2014 in the first meter of soil numerous models have been used in past researches to simulate permafrost hydrology fabre et al 2017 the topmodel a surface runoff model has shown its limits for small to the largest arctic watersheds by omitting lateral and groundwater flow stieglitz et al 2003 finney et al 2012 the topoflow model is especially developed for arctic catchments and has shown correct modeling for arctic systems but it seems hard to use for the largest arctic catchments as it requires a lot of data for calibration and does not take into account soil properties at different depths schramm et al 2007 the hydrograph model has been used at small and very large scale in numerous studies vinogradov et al 2011 this model estimates the heat fluxes and permafrost hydrology with good accuracy at a stand scale gusev et al 2010 but its applicability is limited by a randomization of the spatial distribution of model parameters which complicate large scale studies the rithm model which is an adaptation of the modcou model has returned a modeled permafrost hydrology estimated with low accuracy ducharne et al 2003 nohara et al 2006 have performed a simulation on different catchments in the world including some arctic watersheds with the trip tool a model which uses the velocity of water for major calculations this model does not integrate human impacts on the water cycle e g dams and does not include essential parameters for arctic systems studies such as evaporation and sublimation module the lmdz model has been applied to some of the northernmost basins in the world including the yenisei river alkama et al 2006 this model handles snowmelt but does not consider percolation processes which inhibit the conceptualization of permafrost soils in a same way the sdgvm tool has been used in a multi model analysis on various watersheds yang et al 2015 this model has been developed for plant growth optimization but is able to calculate runoff it has returned same difficulties to model permafrost hydrology in this way most of these models have returned bad detections of the freshets after ice melting and does not include tss export simulations which are essential for our study for those which include tss export they generally need a lot of inputs uneasy to measure or to calculate and they often do not integrate a spatial and a temporal variability in the outputs which is imperative for this study and more widely in large scale studies de vente and poesen 2005 concerning modeling efforts on sediment and organic carbon transfers only few models have been performed in arctic watersheds since the processes involved are relatively poorly documented parmentier et al 2017 several models have been previously used in suspended sediment transfer modeling in arctic regions either simple rating curve models chikita et al 2007 or climate based empirical equations syvitski 2002 a recent simulation effort has been employed a coupled swat usle model to show a significant sediment load increase across the northeast china region zhou et al 2017 the relation between suspended load and poc has been modeled on a global scale by ludwig et al 1996 for large rivers at global scale by mcclleland et al 2016 for big arctic rivers by martins and probst 1991 for major african rivers and by boithias et al 2014 for specific agricultural watersheds the data on sediment loads and its poc fraction in arctic streams are scarce and almost no data are available for the ice free period when the organic carbon fluxes are the greatest dittmar and kattner 2003 similarly the doc modeling efforts are mostly based on previous observations and imply regression analysis e g loadest estimator stubbins et al 2015 tank et al 2016 or physiography driven models ludwig et al 1996 in place of complex integrated models hence there is an enormous knowledge gap in the modeling of sediment and poc doc fluxes in high latitude catchments using physically based dynamic models at daily timestep the soil and water assessment tool swat has allowed us to cross all the obstacles revealed by the previous modeling efforts its capability to simulate water and sediment fluxes at a daily time step douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 is an important advantage to detect the freshets in arctic systems fabre et al 2017 and it has already shown its potential to study daily organic carbon exports oeurng et al 2011 this work aims to understand quantify and model the contemporary fluxes of suspended sediment and organic carbon in both dissolved and particulate forms at the scale of the largest siberian watershed using a hydrological model the major objectives set for this study include a analyzing spatial variability of sediment and carbon pathways across different water regime phases i e ice free vs ice covered channel periods b quantifying daily suspended sediment poc and doc fluxes at the yenisei river outlet and finally c assessing swat capabilities to capture permafrost variability across subcatchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yenisei river basin is the seventh largest watershed on earth and the largest in the basins drained by the arctic ocean with a catchment area of 2 540 000 km2 amon et al 2012 it is the fifth longest river in the world 4803 km amon et al 2012 with the sixth biggest discharge at the outlet ludwig et al 1996 raymond et al 2007 holmes et al 2012 amon et al 2012 the main stream comes from western sayan mountains southern siberia and passes through all central siberia going to the north and flows into the kara sea fig 1 amon et al 2012 its largest tributary the angara river comes from mongolia and is fed by the lake baikal the biggest fresh water reserve on earth lake baikal unesco it plays the role of an enormous reservoir sustaining water flows during the frozen period with an average discharge of 3000 m3 s 1 by the irkutsk hydropower station downstream the average discharge at the outlet approaches 20 000 m3 s 1 with peaks higher than 100 000 m3 s 1 and with low flows around 6000 m3 s 1 mainly sustained by releases of dams fig 1 holmes et al 2012 the yenisei river watershed is typically divided in three geographically distinct regions mountainous headwater area at the southern limit of the watershed a relatively plain area of boreal forest in its central and northern parts and the central siberian plateau in its northernmost large tributary basin the nizhnyaya tunguska river fig 1 the mean elevation is 670 m and the average slope is 0 2 amon et al 2012 regarding the soil distribution the southern and central parts of the yenisei watershed are dominated by podzoluvisols cambisols and podzols while cryosols and gleysols cover the largest area in the northern parts fig 2 a amon et al 2012 concerning land use the boreal forest mostly represented by coniferous called taiga is dominant along the watershed fig 2b a lag time for snowmelt due to the forest dominance should be taken into account in the conceptual model as in these hydrosystems the melting processes are slowed by the snowpack density around 90 of the yenisei river watershed is covered by permafrost fig 2c zhang et al 1999 distributed as follows 34 of continuous permafrost 11 of discontinuous permafrost and 45 of sporadic and isolated permafrost fig 2c mcclelland et al 2004 the watershed outlet in the modeling has been established near dudinka 69 26 17 n 86 04 47 e fig 1 it is the place where the tss poc and doc concentrations have been sampled by the partners project and the arctic great rivers observatory arctic gro https arcticgreatrivers org this city has been chosen since the very beginning of the partners project because it was easier to communicate and make arrangements with dudinka hydrologists independent from krasnoyarsk authorities than with igarka hydrologists daily discharges as well as samples of sediment and organic carbon from the tomcar permafrost project have been measured upstream at igarka 67 27 55 n 86 36 09 e fig 1 several physiographical and hydraulic characteristics of this watershed have made our modeling more difficult firstly uneven permafrost distribution across the watershed forces to implement different modeling strategies for the sub basins depending on permafrost types secondly hydropower generation is an important activity in the yenisei river related to metallurgy which is highly energy consumptive seven large dams have been constructed on the yenisei and the angara rivers in the 1960s and 1970s 2 2 model choice swat is a hydro agro climatological model developed by usda agricultural research service usda ars temple tx usa and texas a m agrilife research college station tx usa arnold et al 1998 swat is firstly designed to predict impacts of human activities management on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in ungauged catchments and can provide continuous simulations for dissolved and particulate elements arnold et al 1998 its performance has already been tested at multiple catchment scales in various climatic and soil conditions on hydrology but also on water chemistry especially tss and nitrogen exports schuol et al 2008 douglas mankin et al 2010 kuzin et al 2010 faramarzi et al 2013 krysanova and white 2015 and references therein importantly both the swat model and the arcswat interface are open source and free allowing reproducibility of the results once the input data are well documented olivera et al 2006 the swat model has already been tested in arctic systems krysanova and white 2015 hülsmann et al 2015 and revealed its capability to accurately represent permafrost hydrology fabre et al 2017 theory and details of hydrological processes integrated in swat model are available online in the swat documentation http swatmodel tamu edu this study uses the swat model to simulate hydrology sediment and organic carbon export of a permafrost watershed including hydropower stations swat uses small calculating units called hydrological response units hrus homogeneous in terms of land use and soil properties flügel 1995 the swat system coupled with a geographical information system gis engine integrates various spatial environmental data including soil land cover climate and topographical features the swat model allows the management soils types and properties it decomposes the water cycle and returns the water pathways and other information on the water cycle in the studied watershed 2 3 swat data inputs an overview of the inputs data is given in table 1 the arcswat software has been used in the arcgis 10 2 2 interface http www esri com to compile the swat input files coarse dem resolution has been judged sufficient because of the large watershed size the global soil map containing initially 6000 categories has been simplified into 36 categories by averaging their initial soil properties the soils have been aggregated on their common structural properties 20 soils categories have been covering the watershed the meteorological inputs for swat precipitation temperature average wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity essential for evapotranspiration calculation have been extracted from 20 stations unevenly distributed in the watershed see fig 1 for station locations and compared to a reanalyzed dataset climate forecast system reanalysis http rda ucar edu pub cfsr html the two datasets have been found in good agreement with each other except for precipitations hence this study used reanalyzed data for all meteorological parameters apart from precipitations where observation records have been kept 2 4 observed data daily discharge data at the igarka gauging station from arctic gro shiklomanov et al 2017 and at the exits of two reservoirs have been used roshydromet one on the yenisei river at krasnoyarsk and one on the angara river at ust illimsk fig 1 concerning sediment and organic carbon samples have been collected at dudinka in the scope of partners and arctic gro i ii projects from 2003 to 2013 holmes et al 2017 and have been completed by other samples at igarka from 2014 to 2016 with the collaboration of the tomcar permafrost project herrault et al 2016 le dantec 2018 all of the databases and publications of the arctic gro projects as well as the details on the sampling protocols are freely available online table 1 https arcticgreatrivers org the tomcar permafrost project has followed the same protocols as the arctic gro projects a low number of data is available during the break up as the sampling is dangerous and difficult in these regions most of the sampling have been done during the ice free and the freezing periods from june to december but the tomcar permafrost project has filled the gap on the exports of sediment and organic carbon during the freshet of the yenisei river 2 5 conceptualization the conceptual model used in this study is based on snow and freeze thaw soil behavior depending on the season as shown in fabre et al 2017 during winter the stability of the snowpack and the soil freezing sustain low fluxes of organic carbon an increase in temperature induces a rapid snowmelt leading to a strong surface runoff and a freshet during few days a subsurface flow comes with the surface flow due to a first unfreezing of the superficial soil layers sediment and organic carbon fluxes follow the freshet dynamic in a third time during the recession the thawed layer reaches its maximal depth called active layer resulting in a balance between surface and subsurface flows the last period shows the thawed layer freezing from both the top and the bottom while the snow starts to accumulate only lateral flow is possible by a piston effect which could engender doc fluxes but tss and poc fluxes should be reduced accordingly the catchment has been discretized into 257 sub basins these sub basins have been further divided into 3158 hrus from a combination of 14 land uses 20 soils and three slopes classes 0 1 1 2 and 2 the discharge peak occurring in may is mostly due to the snowpack melt snowfall must be aggregated and should stay in the subbasin until the snowmelt period so the snowpack can be modeled big enough to sustain the spring freshet it is assumed that the annual average ratio rainfall snowfall is 60 40 su et al 2006 the low number of available meteorological stations for precipitations data should be taken into account to respect this ratio indeed the highest station is at 1100 m above sea level whereas the highest point in the yenisei watershed is near 3500 m fig 1 an elevation gradient should be integrated in the modeling to compensate the lack of data evapotranspiration based on hargreaves and samani 1985 equation and sublimation have also been calibrated based on past studies su et al 2006 gusev et al 2010 fukutomi et al 2003 because of their influence in the water balance of arctic catchments ranging respectively between 36 and 50 of precipitations and between 4 and 20 of snowfall suzuki et al 2015 a very low groundwater contribution to streamflow should be considered in watersheds presenting permafrost soils groundwater flows are assumed to be low due to frozen soil conditions but have not been well studied in arctic watersheds yet woo 2012 the surface subsurface flows ratio is depending on the variation of the thawed depth permafrost behavior in the watershed has been conceptualized following an approach from hülsmann et al 2015 an impermeable boundary has been considered in the soil profile which should represent the active layer limiting by this way percolation in permafrost environments woo 2012 more details about the conceptualization of the yenisei river basin water balance can be found in fabre et al 2017 2 6 equations used to model organic carbon release to better understand the poc exports the method used by the swat model to model sediment yield is detailed hereafter the riverine sediment produced by physical soil erosion for each hru is calculated in swat using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 the musle equation is calculating a sediment yield as followed t s s 11 8 q s u r f q p e a k a r e a h r u 0 56 k u s l e c u s l e p u s l e l s u s l e c f r g where tss represents the sediment yield per day in tons ha 1 qsurf is the surface runoff volume mm ha 1 qpeak is the peak runoff rate m3 s 1 areahru is the hru area in ha kusle is the usle soil erodibility factor cusle is the usle cover and management factor pusle is the usle support practice factor lsusle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor the equation is based on the runoff in a hru and on specific factors dependent on the soil and land use properties details of the usle equation factors can be found in neitsch et al 2005 the tss concentration is obtained from the river sediment yield the fluvial transport of sediment in the channel is controlled by two simultaneous processes deposition sedimentation and re suspension erosion the musle equation has already shown its capability to predict sediment yield in various watersheds douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 the advantages of using this equation integrated in swat are that it allows spatial and temporal variability in the resulting sediment yields by using few inputs data and without any measures on the field merritt et al 2003 de vente and poesen 2005 here we assume that the musle equation is working in permafrost affected areas as it has never been tested in this type of watershed however the kusle parameter should allow the user to integrate the freezing effect in the erodibility to model the poc the following relation with tss is used as proposed by boithias et al 2014 p o c 9 40 t s s a b where poc is the part of poc in the tss tss is in mg l 1 a and b two parameters which have to be defined depending on the watershed see details in fig 3 in the end a specific poc flux fpoc is calculated thus sediment exports have to be predicted correctly to model poc with accuracy the reliability of this equation in another type of watershed has been statistically checked as shown in fig 3 concerning doc modeling we have adapted the michaelis menten equation in this study johnson and goody 2011 to predict the doc concentration doc in milligrams per liter mg l 1 by correlating it with discharge q as followed and as shown in fig 4 doc α q β q with q in millimeters per day mm d 1 this equation underlines the need to well model discharge in order to obtain good results for doc concentrations α in mg l 1 represent the potential of the maximum doc concentration we could find at the outlet of the watershed and β in mm d 1 the specific discharge at which the doc concentration is half of α they have been estimated based on observed data from the arctic gro sampling projects the equation is calculating a daily average concentration and has for now been tested only at the basin outlet we have made the hypothesis that the relation is valuable at the subbasin scale to see the spatialization of doc concentrations in the watershed the whole area the subbasin is draining is included in the calculation in order to obtain a hydrological unit similar to a watershed 2 7 from concepts to modeling the impervious boundary depth has been assigned as a function of permafrost type in each sub basin based on active layer depth estimates zhang et al 2005 by using remote sensing the different average active layers depths have been estimated with the annual thawing index the conceptualized maximal depth of the active layer has been set to 800 mm 1500 mm 1750 mm and 2000 mm respectively for continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost the maximal depth to impervious layer parameter depimp has been used to represent this concept the approach used neglects the temporal variations of the thawed depth parameters controlling the snow behavior smtmp sftmp smfmn smfmx timp sno50cov snocovmx see details of parameters role in table 2 and depending on temperature have been calibrated with literature for snocovmx yang et al 2007 and by expertise and auto calibration for the others to separate rainfall and snowfall and to contain the snowpack on the lands before the massive snowmelt as there is no meteorological station in high altitude the precipitation lapse rate plaps parameter has been used to adapt precipitation to mountainous zones evapotranspiration has been calibrated using measures from past studies with parameters that influence soil evaporation esco and water extracted from soils by the vegetation canmx the parameters slsoil lat ttime and surlag have been used in order to model the water volume flowing via surface and subsurface flows and the time lag they need to join the hru outlet for sediment exports the parameter prf bsn has been used to reduce the impact of discharge peaks on erosion and hence on sediment exports while the usle k parameter kusle in the equation above has been calibrated gradually depending on the permafrost type to slow down erosion in the most frozen zones 2 8 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of the hydrology and the different components of the water balance have already been discussed in fabre et al 2017 the simulation has been performed from january 2003 to december 2016 excluding a 4 yr warm up from january 1999 to december 2002 in this study the calibration has been done manually based on fabre et al 2017 and expertise by comparison to observed data sediment and organic carbon exports have been calibrated at a daily time step compared to sparse data from january 2003 to december 2008 and validated from january 2009 to december 2016 table 2 gives calibrated and validated parameters values 2 9 model evaluation the performance of the models has been evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index the coefficient of determination r2 the percent of bias p bias and the root mean square error rmse the nse is a normalized statistic usually used in hydrological modeling which determines the relative magnitude of the

hydrology and water balance the water balance has been calibrated based on results found in fabre et al 2017 the total simulated water yield has been checked at the igarka gauging station upstream of the outlet fig 5 as in this previous work the model shows a good representation of the freshets during the period of study and it reaches an annual mean specific discharge of 188 mm yr 1 for a standard deviation of 21 mm yr 1 on the whole period of study this result is close to the observations with an underestimation of only 45 mm yr 1 it reveals that around 47 of the yearly water is exported during the freshet in may and june concerning meteorological simulations the model returns 477 mm yr 1 of total annual precipitations with 299 mm yr 1 and 178 mm yr 1 respectively for rainfall and snowfall corresponding to a ratio of 63 37 snowmelt amounts to 142 mm yr 1 which equals to 80 of total snowfall and sublimation is returned as 37 mm yr 1 or 21 of total snowfall evapotranspiration is high in these regions with the dominative presence of forest and is returned as 276 mm yr 1 with a potential evapotranspiration of 550 mm yr 1 the average subbasin flow components distribution is as follows 36 164 and 11 mm yr 1 respectively for surface subsurface lateral and groundwater flows corresponding to 17 78 and 5 of total river discharge the ratio between surface and subsurface flows is different from what have been observed in another permafrost affected watershed in canada 60 40 carey and woo 1999 but this difference could be due to the distribution of permafrost soils in the yenisei basin with more than half of the watershed with sporadic isolated or no permafrost fig 2c mcclelland et al 2004 for more details on hydrology modeling and calibration validation details see fabre et al 2017 3 2 simulations of daily tss poc and doc fluxes the model has predicted correctly the specific flow of sediment at the outlet during the calibration and validation periods fig 6 the dynamic is following the freshets the statistical performance is satisfactory for the calibration and validation periods compared to previous studies with nse of 0 74 and 0 26 and r2 of 0 98 and 0 55 for a daily time step modeling our results can be considered as accurate regarding difficulties to calibrate tss fluxes and to catch the freshets without offsets for poc the measures and the simulations are following the equation from boithias et al 2014 with the coefficients a and b statistically determined and fixed respectively to 0 95 and 3 9 for the yenisei river fig 3 daily poc specific fluxes have been correctly predicted fig 7 the same problems are found with the low number of data during high flow periods the statistical performance has returned low nse of 0 27 and 0 16 and satisfactory r2 of 0 91 and 0 54 for the calibration and the validation periods which could be judged as accurate regarding the number of observed data regarding doc simulated concentrations the best fitting for the α and β parameters have been found as 15 0 and 1 29 as shown in fig 4 the model used is estimating with accuracy the doc concentration in the stream at the outlet as shown in fig 8 a the nse reveals some troubles with the validation period but is satisfactory during the calibration period while the r2 is very satisfactory during both of the periods in the same way the predicted doc fluxes exported at the outlet show a good tendency but return a low nse in the validation period fig 8b our results have shown that the predictions are really good during low flows for any export studied on the calibration and the validation period but have revealed underestimations during high flows period for the three variables fig 9 nevertheless the returned p values for each period are good and reveal strong evidence of correlations between observations and predictions 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of tss poc and doc fluxes as expected permafrost thaw triggers the poc and doc transfers fig 10 a poc and doc exports rise drastically with the spring freshet due to snowmelt and follows the surface runoff dynamic this study reveals that poc and doc are mostly exported during the freshet as 57 and 65 of the yearly fluxes are transported in may and june 2013 fig 10a while these exports reach respectively 60 and 68 of the yearly fluxes over the whole simulation in order to outline processes involved in organic carbon transfer we have focused on the year 2013 as this year returned the best statistical responses to study the spatial distribution of poc and doc fluxes in each subbasin fig 10b first a link with the main stream near the outlet is relevant for the poc flux another variable is influencing both poc and doc transfer which is the permafrost type the unfrozen zones present higher fluxes than the most frozen soils during the increase in the exports a disturbance in the subbasins close to the outlet due to the discharge rising is clear some other subbasins have returned significant fluxes due to precipitation events the flux of particles is partially dependent on the permafrost type fig 11 for poc it is mainly driven by the subbasins presenting sporadic permafrost isolated permafrost or without permafrost and it reveals a really low contribution of discontinuous permafrost to the total fluxes regarding doc the contributions are more distributed along the basin with still a dominant contribution from no permafrost zones 4 discussion 4 1 conceptualization of the water sediment and organic carbon river transport in the yenisei river watershed this paper mentions new strengths in modeling permafrost sediment and organic carbon behavior in river this is the first study modeling fluvial sediment and riverine organic carbon behavior in an arctic watershed presenting all the types of permafrost at a daily time step by providing equations to predict organic carbon exports and used it coupled to a daily time step hydrological modeling this paper reveals the possibilities of precise modeling of organic carbon in a permafrost dominated arctic catchment concerning hydrology this paper brings new opportunities as the whole basin of the yenisei river is modeled unlike in fabre et al 2017 where the modeling has been dependent on 2 reservoirs this modeling could represent the flow distribution upstream of the reservoirs and also show the impact of the elevation gradient on the water balance in the higher zones of the basin that have been excluded from the previous work the discharge has been checked at the exits of the reservoirs and at the outlet of the different main tributaries with observed data available for the period 2008 2016 fig 1 for stations location these five gauging stations are not representative of a permafrost type as they integrate more than one this constraint has disturbed the calibration of soil properties for each permafrost type but the two tributary stations are mostly integrating continuous permafrost on one hand and sporadic and isolated permafrost on the other hand which has allowed us to approach soil properties based on these stations the other soils properties have been deduced accordingly concerning precipitations data the lack of data is a problem in this study with 20 stations for the fifth biggest watershed in the world some peaks modeled in summer and not present in reality could be linked to an accumulation of rainfall in the various subbasins linked to a station predicting a strong rainfall event swat transfers the climate data to a subbasin from the closest meteorological station input at this scale with 20 stations and 257 subbasins an accumulation of meteorological events is possible especially in the middle of the basin where we find a low number of stations fig 1 to simulate river sediment yields at a daily step is really rough oeurng et al 2011 using the swat model is an adapted choice to the results expected as this model allows spatial and temporal predictions of river discharge and sediment fluxes in a very large arctic watershed some other models could return more precise results but they need a larger number of measured variables which unlike the variables used in swat are quite difficult to collect moreover swat is one of the model validated for river sediment transport studies moriasi et al 2012 and has already been used to study organic carbon transport oeurng et al 2011 this study includes 20 soil types the good results obtained at the outlets of the reservoirs of the tributaries and of the whole yenisei watershed lead to the conclusion that this resolution is sufficient at this scale to represent the processes in the basin but as the exports of tss poc and doc are mainly driven by soil characteristics the spatial distribution of tss poc and doc fluxes would be more precise by integrating another soil dataset with better distribution and resolution of soil types still the quantification of organic carbon content in permafrost soils remain uncertain as shown in kuhry et al 2013 hugelius et al 2014 or schuur et al 2015 considerations on the databases available should be done to better model organic carbon yields because organic carbon content is much more linked to the permafrost type than to the soil type taking into account a freezing degree in the soil characteristics and adding this parameter to the soil data could be a first good improve to fill this data gap and better predict the transfers in that kind of watersheds without too important calibrations in the same way the parametrization of soil properties has allowed a discretization of permafrost types the soils parameters have been calibrated to limit the erosion and sediment supply in the most frozen zones this paper is the first study trying to explain the permafrost impact on physical erosion of soils and the subsequent river sediment transports by doing other investigations in various watersheds impacted by permafrost with the same size such as the ob the lena or the mackenzie which are the other main contributors of organic carbon to the arctic ocean dittmar and kattner 2003 we could check and refine the calibration suggested here our conceptualization of the processes in permafrost affected watersheds seems quite accurate regarding the results obtained the returned statistical performances have showed the difficulties for the modeling to fit the observations in the validation period this problem is due to offsets of few days between the observed and the predicted freshets this is revealed by fig 9 where the model has returned equally higher or lower fluxes than observed ones more researches are still needed in snowmelt processes to better model the discharge peaks in this type of watersheds these offsets could be due to the lack of meteorological stations with observed precipitations mentioned previously a better spatialization of these data coupled with a spatial study on the order of the subbasins contributions to the snowmelt should provide interesting information to improve the hydrological modeling by better representing the peaks of discharge and removing the offsets then the modeling should be able to reproduce the observed exports of sediment poc and doc however a focus on modeled specific fluxes of sediment on the year 2016 has revealed some troubles to represent the observed peak this year is presenting a low amount of precipitations and a lower discharge peak than the two previous years still the maximal observed sediment concentrations are in the range of the ones observed in 2014 and 2015 with this in mind we could assume that an unknown process is explaining these concentrations or that there have been problems in the sampling for this specific year moreover the influence of the reservoirs is strong field experiments must be performed in different parts of the watershed in order to check the contribution of each stream and each permafrost type on the organic carbon transfer by sampling water chemistry at the reservoirs outlets and doing isotopic studies on river waters at the basin outlet this work could be validated during the freezing period as the soil is inaccessible for water and as the snow accumulates the river sediment and organic carbon exports are really low and mainly dependent to the dams releases as in past researches table 3 the spring freshet is the main factor controlling sediment and organic carbon exports this study provides new information of spatial hotspots of organic carbon exports these spatial outputs are driven by precipitation intensity snow thawing and permafrost type permafrost free areas deliver higher fluxes of organic carbon which has already been demonstrated by comparing different arctic watersheds frey and mcclleland 2009 the spatial study leaves to interesting and solid conclusions on the behavior of river organic carbon in arctic watersheds riverine organic carbon transfer processes are variable in time and space organic carbon exports are mostly linked to surface runoff fig 10a as most of the river organic carbon is exported during the annual freshet due to snow and ice melt the organic carbon fluxes are also spatially dependent on the permafrost type distribution within the catchment fig 11 the continuous and discontinuous permafrost area present low export of poc and doc while the more unfrozen zones fed the stream flow in organic carbon as our simulated results at the outlet are close to observations we could assume that the time and space distribution shown by our modeling is close to the reality and that surface runoff is the main pathway contribution to poc and doc river transports concerning the data quality the tss poc and doc datasets for the yenisei river present a lack as only few data are available on our period of study and only few years have been sampled at a high frequency regarding the difficulties to sample during the freshet period the access to a high frequency dataset of sediment and organic carbon on specific years at the outlet of the yenisei river is an important opportunity to better understand the fluxes exported during this ephemeral event the swat model is using the musle relation to estimate sediment yield in each hru this equation has already returned good results in various watersheds douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 but has never been tested in arctic watersheds sadeghi et al 2014 have proven that this equation should be used with caution other experiments should be done in other permafrost affected watersheds to confirm the validity of the musle equation in these areas the equation we used in this study to model poc adapted from boithias et al 2014 has produced relatively accurate results fig 7 in previous works the poc export has been explained by empirical relations based on statistical fitting with suspended solids ludwig et al 1996 or discharge mcclelland et al 2016 ludwig et al 1996 equation has been designed for a global scale analysis and has not been able to represent precisely the poc exports at a daily time step for each catchment the relation published by mcclelland et al 2016 for arctic watersheds allow to calculate poc fluxes at a daily time step but has been unable to estimate the percentage of poc in suspended solids the equation we used here is based on physical basis with asymptotes linked to parameters corresponding to the in stream organic matter with high organic carbon content in tss phytoplankton and residuals and to tss with the lowest organic carbon content corresponding to organic carbon concentration in the deepest soil layers it allows the user to adapt the parameters depending on the study case the spatialized resulting exports in each subbasin for the poc fluxes calculated with the equation adapted from boithias et al 2014 reveals limits in the validity of the equation figs 7 and 9 the equation is firstly designed to express a result at the outlet of the watershed as the asymptotes evoked before are defined on the basis of observed data at the outlet of the basin thus the export distribution shown in this paper is based only on the amount of sediment exports in the subbasins as the asymptotes are fixed equal in all the subbasins but the equation could be influenced by chemical parameters such as the organic carbon content in soils which is really variable in arctic watersheds improvements could be performed with more spatialized observed data of poc to see if the asymptotes of the equation are dependent on environmental or climatic variables and have to be adapted in the different parts of the watershed the equation used firstly in a french catchment is after all transposable in watersheds with other hydro pedo climatic conditions only the parameters a and b have to be adapted to the watershed the other parameter i e the constant 9 40 representing the shape of the curve seems to be stable independently to the watershed more studies are needed in watersheds with different climatic or anthropogenic influences such as tropical and equatorial catchments or really urbanized watersheds to validate this hypothesis concerning doc modeling the adapted model from michaelis menten equation based only on discharge could be limited the equation underestimates low and high doc fluxes but overestimates middle fluxes figs 8 and 9 for now the parameters α and β are determined statistically based on the dataset available a focus on these parameters is needed to better understand their link with environmental variables such as organic carbon content in soils and slopes ludwig et al 1996 or the percentage of peatlands and wetlands areas within the catchment hope et al 1994 gergel et al 1999 ågren et al 2008 again this equation needs to be tested in different subbasins to assess the existence of different α and β values at a catchment scale and in other catchments with different hydro pedo climatic conditions to evaluate its replicability at global scale 4 2 predicted exports of sediment and organic carbon concerning tss we found a specific flux at the outlet in the range of previous studies with an average of 2 97 t km 2 yr 1 regarding the specific poc and doc fluxes the annual fluxes are in the range of other studies on the yenisei river with respectively 0 13 t km 2 yr 1 and 1 14 t km 2 yr 1 this study outputs 1 2 to 2 times lower fluxes of doc 1 6 times higher to 26 times lower exports of sediment compared to previous studies see table 3 while it returns poc fluxes in the same range for sediment exports previous exports which are closer to 12 14 tg yr 1 are estimated based on data from pre dam period the dams influences have reduced drastically the export and post dam researches have estimated the sediment export between 4 and 6 tg yr 1 while our estimate of 7 5 tg yr 1 is above average these past studies have estimated the fluxes based on sporadic data often on a period inferior to the 10 years of this study by integrating the high water discharges at a daily time step in this modeling the fluxes given in this paper should be closer to real fluxes than past studies as previous works could have underestimated or overestimated the influence of the freshets on the exports it has already been demonstrated that daily time step modeling is essential in the study of arctic systems water flows fabre et al 2017 as sediment and organic carbon are strongly correlated with water flows a daily time step study is also primordial in this case besides our modeling returns peaks of tss poc and doc in the range of observations but fig 9 reveals that an offset in high flow periods remains and a focus on the detection of the peaks could be done to improve the modeling a better consideration on sampling protocols is encouraged in arctic systems as most of the hydrological and biogeochemical processes are happening on a short time period during low flow periods sampling each month could be possible especially between november and march where precipitations fall as snow and accumulate which strongly limits the number of water pathways in the basin a focus should be provided on high flow periods as proposed by the tomcar permafrost initiative this study has revealed that poc and doc are mostly exported during the freshet with respectively 59 and 65 of the yearly exports on the months of may and june of the 2003 2016 period studying the organic carbon behavior during the freshet is a main concern for this type of watersheds as the ice break up is hard and dangerous to prospect new improvements are necessary to facilitate sampling in arctic watersheds and assess the impact of the break up on the organic carbon exports a daily to weekly sampling protocol would be necessary in the period of transition especially at the end of may and the beginning of june as the flux peaks do not persist more than 3 days fig 10a we have explained that around 60 of the organic carbon exports happen during the high flow periods as in this paper most of the previous studies based their modeling or estimations on sporadic data without data during the peak of discharge which leave uncertainty on the behavior of organic carbon in the critical period of the freshet they could have underestimated the peaks of tss and doc fluxes but could have overestimated the time of transition between low flows and high flows periods which have resulted in higher annual exports compared to other large watersheds arctic watersheds have a special behavior which influences the way to study them wang et al 2012 have compared two asian rivers the yangtze river with a close draining area to the yenisei river 1 940 000 km2 and the yellow river which is smaller 752 443 km2 even if the yenisei basin presents similar draining area characteristics as the yangtze river its hydrological and biogeochemical functioning is closer to smaller watersheds because of the flood events dynamic the snowmelt impact on the freshet gives high peaks on short time periods like on the yellow river the yangtze river has longer high flow periods which allow a less frequent sampling protocol to represent well the whole hydrological cycle the yellow river and the yenisei river with shorter high flows period need a high frequency sampling during the transition to take into account the strong influence of the freshet on the annual fluxes this catchment behavior could be also related to really small catchments functioning with flash floods oeurng et al 2011 where high flows could supply more than 60 of yearly sediment exports 4 3 future modeling opportunities a first step to improve the modeling of sediment and organic carbon exports in permafrost catchments is to adjust the parameters of the musle equation based on the permafrost type or to add a time dependent parameter in the equation to express the freezing percent of the soil as the yenisei river is polluted by tritium bondareva 2015 which is found in sediment zoobenthos fishes or plants and by mercury in frozen soils river sediment fluxes simulated by swat could be helpful to trace of these pollutants exports predict the origin and the transport of the sediment allows some considerations on the management of these pollutants in the river indeed they constitute a strong issue for humans living near the arctic ocean by potentially causing ecotoxicological disturbances in aquatic ecosystems while the sea is the main food resource for these populations another perspective of this paper is to better understand and quantify the final state of all the organic matter exported to the ocean the models for poc and doc are not taking into account the consumption by organisms in the river or in alluvial plains which could be important and could impact the final flux to the ocean by knowing the quantity interfering in the carbon and the nitrogen cycle predictions on climate change could be performed a first possible approach could be to use the biogeochemical oxygen demand bod to calculate the potential organic matter decomposition by microorganisms by incorporating global warming scenario this modeling could be used to explore reactions of permafrost affected watersheds to climate change permafrost extent should be affected by climate change and thus the final exports of sediment and organic carbon could increase ciais et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 the main contributive areas to the poc and doc exports are the unfrozen zones even if tss and organic carbon transport are also dependent on other variables such as land use and soil types higher exports of organic carbon could be possible as a reduction of the permafrost areas and a complete redistribution of different permafrost types is expected with global warming mcguire et al 2018 tss and poc exports transported by surface runoff should not be significantly affected by a deeper active layer but only by an increasing erodibility factor due to the unfreezing doc fluxes should be much more affected by permafrost thawing as the contribution to total flux is mostly driven by the unfrozen zones fig 11 this rise in organic carbon fluxes to the ocean could accelerate the permafrost carbon feedback schuur et al 2015 this hypothesis is putting forward the amplification of surface warming due to carbon dioxide co2 emissions from thawing permafrost schuur et al 2015 as labile poc and doc are consumed by organisms resulting in the production of co2 the increase in the organic carbon fluxes could fit with this concept with global warming an increase of 15 6 of water discharge in the yenisei river is expected by 2100 with a stronger effect on the peaks of discharge peterson et al 2002 nohara et al 2006 this modification could again strongly disturb global carbon cycles by assuming that climate change will have the same impacts on sediment poc and doc exports these fluxes will reach 3 13 0 12 and 1 19 t km2 yr 1 these increases are only calculated based on the discharge effect but other changes mentioned above should be taken into consideration such as the permafrost degradability and its probable feedback on global climate change prokushkin et al 2011 macdougall et al 2012 schuur et al 2015 abbott et al 2016 which could accelerate the permafrost unfreezing and could liberate more organic carbon in freshwater frey and mcclleland 2009 testing the introduction of a feedback loop effect of permafrost degradation on global warming in modeling tools could lead to better estimates of future sediment and organic carbon exports to the arctic ocean 5 conclusion this study has allowed us to understand model and quantify sediment poc and doc fluxes at the outlet of the biggest doc provider of the arctic ocean the yenisei river and to outline carbon transfer processes with a spatialization of the study this is the first study trying to model tss and poc fluxes in an arctic watershed with a spatial and temporal variability and the first study trying to model spatially doc fluxes in a watershed the fluxes estimated in this study could be considered with a better interest than those proposed in prior researches on sediment and organic carbon in arctic rivers as our study integrates the contribution of high flow periods in the modeling while previous studies have generally extrapolated these periods using samples collected during low flow periods finally the main conclusions of this paper are essential in a context of climate change it underlines the contribution of each permafrost type to the total export of organic carbon by the yenisei river by integrating all the periods of the hydrological cycle this paper could lead to a better quantification of future sediment and organic carbon exports in a thawing permafrost scenario acknowledgements this project

18813,the export of organic carbon export by the rivers to the oceans either as particulate organic carbon poc or dissolved organic carbon doc is very sensitive to climate change especially in permafrost affected catchments where soils are very rich in organic carbon with global warming organic carbon export in both forms is expected to increase in arctic regions it should affect contemporary biogeochemical cycles in rivers and oceans and therefore modify the whole food web this study tries to understand complex processes involved in sediment poc and doc riverine transport in the yenisei river basin and to quantify their respective fluxes at the river outlet the swat soil and water assessment tool hydrological model is used in this study to simulate water and suspended sediment transfers in the largest arctic river poc and doc export have been quantified with empirical models adapted from literature for the study case first the hydrological model has been calibrated and validated at a daily time step for the 2003 2008 and the 2009 2016 periods respectively and its output has been compared with field data for water and sediment fluxes based on conceptualization of transfer processes calibration on climate and soil properties has been performed in order to correctly represent hydrology and sediment transfer in permafrost basins second calibration of empirical models for doc poc transport have been performed by comparing their output with field data available from 2003 to 2016 our study reveals that swat is capable of correctly representing hydrology sediment transfer poc and doc fluxes and their spatial distribution at a daily timescale and outlines the links between these fluxes and permafrost features our simulation effort results in specific sediment poc and doc fluxes of 2 97 t km 2 yr 1 0 13 t km 2 yr 1 and 1 14 t km 2 yr 1 for the period 2003 2016 which are in the range of previous estimates about 60 of the total fluxes of sediment doc and poc to the arctic ocean are exported during the two months of the freshet spatial analysis show that permafrost free areas have returned higher daily organic carbon export than permafrost affected zones highlighting the thawing permafrost effect on carbon cycle in climate change feedback keywords organic carbon sediment modeling swat permafrost yenisei river 1 introduction the arctic is already affected by climate change which is advancing faster than in mid latitudes serreze and barry 2011 ciais et al 2013 and this tendency is expected to continue in the future arctic surface temperatures have never been higher than during the 3 past centuries moritz et al 2002 johannessen et al 2004 chapin et al 2005 kaufman et al 2009 cohen et al 2012 after a relative stability in the temperature anomalies from 1900 to 1980 an increase of ca 2 c of annual surface air temperature in the arctic region from 1980 to 2010 has been observed overland et al 2017 mean annual ground temperatures have been rising for several decades romanovsky et al 2010 resulting in the deepening of the active layer e g anisimov et al 1997 and intensification of geomorphological processes knight and harrison 2012 air temperature rise may drive increased sediment input to the arctic ocean through higher rates of fluvial thermal erosion increased sediment supplies from thaw slumps and other mass movement processes syvitski 2002 goudie 2006 costard et al 2007 suspended sediment fluxes to the arctic ocean are estimated from 0 23 gt at the lower end ludwig and probst 1998 gordeev 2006 to 0 35 gt overeem and syvitski 2008 and 0 33 0 89 gt at the upper end of which no more than 63 can be considered as observed hasholt et al 2006 the largest arctic rivers have relatively low sediment load but its overall increase of 32 is expected for each 2 c of basin warming runoff and sediment transport effects combined syvitski 2002 the latter may involve into fluvial turnover and geochemical cycling a significant quantity of eroded material including carbon stored in permafrost soils koven et al 2011 permafrost stores an enormous pool of approx 1030 gt of ancient soil organic carbon in the first 3 m kuhry et al 2013 hugelius et al 2014 preferentially consumed by bacteria to produce climate relevant gases when released to streams mann et al 2015 permafrost degradation has the potential to significantly influence terrestrial carbon exports to global rivers olefeld and roulet 2014 therefore potential release of ancient carbon from frozen soils constitutes a major concern riverine organic carbon is commonly subdivided into three categories based on its origin hope et al 1994 an allochthonous pool derived from terrestrial organic matter soil leaching and physical erosion an autochthonous pool derived from in situ biological production phytoplankton and an anthropogenic pool derived from agricultural domestic and industrial activities diffuse pollution and waste effluents organic carbon oc in stream waters is present in both dissolved doc and particulate poc forms poc and doc originate from either catchment surface bank and channel erosion from 10 to 50 of poc and from 3 to 35 of doc is labile which means it is subjected to various processes in the fluvial estuarine and coastal marine environment like assimilation mineralization or sedimentation ittekkot and laane 1991 søndergaard and middelboe 1995 cole et al 2007 holmes et al 2008 on the one hand poc concentrations vary with total suspended solids tss the poc percent in the tss is decreasing when the concentration of tss is rising in the river as it has already been shown at a global scale in ludwig et al 1996 when the tss concentration is low in the river the riverine poc is linked to the autochthonous pool detailed before the rise of tss is generally due to erosion which implies a substitution of the main source of poc from the autochthonous to the allochthonous part on the other hand doc concentrations increase with discharge ludwig et al 1996 due to its transport by surface and subsurface water flows global organic carbon flux to the ocean is estimated to be 300 tgc yr 1 with a contribution of 140 tgc yr 1 and 160 tgc yr 1 for poc and doc respectively seitzinger et al 2010 previous estimates range between 370 and 380 tgc yr 1 meybeck 1988 ludwig et al 1996 in the arctic ocean basin doc fluxes exceed those of poc with 18 28 tgc yr 1 against 4 7 tgc yr 1 ludwig et al 1996 dittmar and kattner 2003 mcclelland et al 2016 the difference in the poc doc ratio is related to soil properties with the presence of permafrost restricting surface erosion better understanding of organic carbon origin and pathways in permafrost affected catchments will allow more accurate evaluations of potential impact of deeper active layers on sediment and organic carbon exports prokushkin et al 2011 organic carbon concentrations in arctic rivers follow the discharge with maximum values in spring during the high flows period dittmar and kattner 2003 indeed melting water percolates to join the river and is strongly enriched in organic compounds annual average doc concentrations in arctic rivers range between 2 8 and 12 mgc l 1 lobbes et al 2000 köhler et al 2010 amon et al 2012 they are 1 3 28 times higher than poc concentrations lobbes et al 2000 except for the mackenzie river where poc and doc concentrations are comparable the yenisei river presents the biggest flux of doc to the arctic ocean this flux represents 4 64 4 69 tgc yr 1 raymond et al 2007 holmes et al 2012 while the poc export reaches only 0 17 tgc yr 1 lobbes et al 2000 the poc fraction is found to be consistently older than doc in major arctic rivers guo et al 2007 gustafsson et al 2011 carbon transfer in periglacial fluvial systems is complex because of freeze thaw processes only the seasonally thawed part of permafrost soil or active layer i e from first tens to several meters is exposed to biogeochemical activity zhang et al 2005 schuur et al 2008 the doc transfer in soils is mainly possible through the thawed layer while poc may originate from older stocks of glacial or floodplain sediment in permafrost regions 20 60 of the organic carbon is stored in peatlands while 1 20 is stored in mineral soils and its stock totals 472 27 pgc hugelius et al 2014 in the first meter of soil numerous models have been used in past researches to simulate permafrost hydrology fabre et al 2017 the topmodel a surface runoff model has shown its limits for small to the largest arctic watersheds by omitting lateral and groundwater flow stieglitz et al 2003 finney et al 2012 the topoflow model is especially developed for arctic catchments and has shown correct modeling for arctic systems but it seems hard to use for the largest arctic catchments as it requires a lot of data for calibration and does not take into account soil properties at different depths schramm et al 2007 the hydrograph model has been used at small and very large scale in numerous studies vinogradov et al 2011 this model estimates the heat fluxes and permafrost hydrology with good accuracy at a stand scale gusev et al 2010 but its applicability is limited by a randomization of the spatial distribution of model parameters which complicate large scale studies the rithm model which is an adaptation of the modcou model has returned a modeled permafrost hydrology estimated with low accuracy ducharne et al 2003 nohara et al 2006 have performed a simulation on different catchments in the world including some arctic watersheds with the trip tool a model which uses the velocity of water for major calculations this model does not integrate human impacts on the water cycle e g dams and does not include essential parameters for arctic systems studies such as evaporation and sublimation module the lmdz model has been applied to some of the northernmost basins in the world including the yenisei river alkama et al 2006 this model handles snowmelt but does not consider percolation processes which inhibit the conceptualization of permafrost soils in a same way the sdgvm tool has been used in a multi model analysis on various watersheds yang et al 2015 this model has been developed for plant growth optimization but is able to calculate runoff it has returned same difficulties to model permafrost hydrology in this way most of these models have returned bad detections of the freshets after ice melting and does not include tss export simulations which are essential for our study for those which include tss export they generally need a lot of inputs uneasy to measure or to calculate and they often do not integrate a spatial and a temporal variability in the outputs which is imperative for this study and more widely in large scale studies de vente and poesen 2005 concerning modeling efforts on sediment and organic carbon transfers only few models have been performed in arctic watersheds since the processes involved are relatively poorly documented parmentier et al 2017 several models have been previously used in suspended sediment transfer modeling in arctic regions either simple rating curve models chikita et al 2007 or climate based empirical equations syvitski 2002 a recent simulation effort has been employed a coupled swat usle model to show a significant sediment load increase across the northeast china region zhou et al 2017 the relation between suspended load and poc has been modeled on a global scale by ludwig et al 1996 for large rivers at global scale by mcclleland et al 2016 for big arctic rivers by martins and probst 1991 for major african rivers and by boithias et al 2014 for specific agricultural watersheds the data on sediment loads and its poc fraction in arctic streams are scarce and almost no data are available for the ice free period when the organic carbon fluxes are the greatest dittmar and kattner 2003 similarly the doc modeling efforts are mostly based on previous observations and imply regression analysis e g loadest estimator stubbins et al 2015 tank et al 2016 or physiography driven models ludwig et al 1996 in place of complex integrated models hence there is an enormous knowledge gap in the modeling of sediment and poc doc fluxes in high latitude catchments using physically based dynamic models at daily timestep the soil and water assessment tool swat has allowed us to cross all the obstacles revealed by the previous modeling efforts its capability to simulate water and sediment fluxes at a daily time step douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 is an important advantage to detect the freshets in arctic systems fabre et al 2017 and it has already shown its potential to study daily organic carbon exports oeurng et al 2011 this work aims to understand quantify and model the contemporary fluxes of suspended sediment and organic carbon in both dissolved and particulate forms at the scale

regime phases i e ice free vs ice covered channel periods b quantifying daily suspended sediment poc and doc fluxes at the yenisei river outlet and finally c assessing swat capabilities to capture permafrost variability across subcatchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the yenisei river basin is the seventh largest watershed on earth and the largest in the basins drained by the arctic ocean with a catchment area of 2 540 000 km2 amon et al 2012 it is the fifth longest river in the world 4803 km amon et al 2012 with the sixth biggest discharge at the outlet ludwig et al 1996 raymond

fig 1 amon et al 2012 its largest tributary the angara river comes from mongolia and is fed by the lake baikal the biggest fresh water reserve on earth lake baikal unesco it plays the role of an enormous reservoir sustaining water flows during the frozen period with an average discharge of 3000 m3 s 1 by the irkutsk hydropower station downstream the average discharge at the outlet approaches 20 000 m3 s 1 with peaks higher than 100 000 m3 s 1 and with low flows around 6000 m3 s 1 mainly sustained by releases of dams fig 1 holmes et al 2012 the yenisei river watershed is typically divided in three geographically distinct regions mountainous headwater area at the southern limit of the watershed a relatively plain area of boreal forest in its central and northern parts and the central siberian plateau in its northernmost large tributary basin the nizhnyaya tunguska river fig 1 the mean elevation is 670 m and the average slope is 0 2 amon et al 2012 regarding the soil distribution the southern and central parts of the yenisei watershed are dominated by podzoluvisols cambisols and podzols while cryosols and gleysols cover the largest area in the northern parts fig 2 a amon et al 2012 concerning land use the boreal forest mostly represented by coniferous called taiga is dominant along the watershed fig 2b a lag time for snowmelt due to the forest dominance should be taken into account in the conceptual model as in these hydrosystems the melting processes are slowed by the snowpack density around 90 of the yenisei river watershed is covered by permafrost fig 2c zhang et al 1999 distributed as follows 34 of continuous permafrost 11 of discontinuous permafrost and 45 of sporadic and isolated permafrost fig 2c mcclelland et al 2004 the watershed outlet in the modeling has

independent from krasnoyarsk authorities than with igarka hydrologists daily discharges as well as samples of sediment and organic carbon from the tomcar permafrost project have been measured upstream at igarka 67 27 55 n 86 36 09 e fig 1 several physiographical and hydraulic characteristics of this watershed have made our modeling more difficult firstly uneven permafrost distribution across the watershed forces to implement different modeling strategies for the sub basins depending on permafrost types secondly hydropower generation is an important activity in the yenisei river related to metallurgy which is highly energy consumptive seven large dams have been constructed on the yenisei and the angara rivers in the 1960s and 1970s 2 2 model choice swat is a hydro agro climatological model developed by usda agricultural research service usda ars temple tx usa and texas a m agrilife research college station tx usa arnold et al 1998 swat is firstly designed to predict impacts of human activities management on water sediment and agricultural chemical yields in ungauged catchments and can provide continuous simulations for dissolved and particulate elements arnold et al 1998 its performance has already been tested at multiple catchment scales in various climatic and soil conditions on hydrology but also on water chemistry especially tss and nitrogen exports schuol et al 2008 douglas mankin et al 2010 kuzin et al 2010 faramarzi et al 2013 krysanova and white 2015 and references therein importantly both the swat model and the arcswat interface are open source and free allowing reproducibility of the results once the input data are well documented olivera et al 2006 the swat model has already been tested in arctic systems krysanova and white 2015 hülsmann et al 2015 and revealed its capability to accurately represent permafrost hydrology fabre et al 2017 theory and details of hydrological processes integrated in swat model are available online in the swat documentation http swatmodel tamu edu this study uses the swat model to simulate hydrology sediment and organic carbon export of a permafrost watershed including hydropower stations swat uses small calculating units called hydrological response units hrus homogeneous in terms of land use and soil properties flügel 1995 the swat system coupled with a geographical information system gis engine integrates various spatial environmental data including soil land cover climate and topographical features the swat model allows the management soils types and properties it decomposes the water cycle and returns the water pathways and other information on the water cycle in the studied watershed 2 3 swat data inputs an overview of the inputs data is given in table 1 the arcswat software has been used in the arcgis 10 2 2 interface http www esri com to compile the swat input files coarse dem resolution has been judged sufficient because of the large watershed size the global soil map containing initially 6000 categories has been simplified into 36 categories by averaging their initial soil properties the soils have been aggregated on their common structural properties 20 soils categories have been covering the watershed the meteorological inputs for swat precipitation temperature average wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity essential for evapotranspiration calculation have been extracted from 20 stations unevenly distributed in the watershed see fig 1 for station locations and compared to a reanalyzed dataset climate forecast system reanalysis http rda ucar edu pub cfsr html the two datasets have been found in good agreement with each other except for precipitations hence this study used reanalyzed data for all meteorological parameters apart from precipitations where observation records have been kept 2 4 observed data daily discharge data at the igarka gauging station from arctic gro shiklomanov et al 2017 and at the exits of two reservoirs have been used roshydromet one on the yenisei river at krasnoyarsk and one on the angara river at ust illimsk fig 1 concerning sediment and organic carbon samples have been collected at dudinka in the scope of partners and arctic gro i ii projects from 2003 to 2013 holmes et al 2017 and have been completed by other samples at igarka from 2014 to 2016 with the collaboration of the tomcar permafrost project herrault et al 2016 le dantec 2018 all of the databases and publications of the arctic gro projects as well as the details on the sampling protocols are freely available online table 1 https arcticgreatrivers org the tomcar permafrost project has followed the same protocols as the arctic gro projects a low number of data is available during the break up as the sampling is dangerous and difficult in these regions most of the sampling have been done during the ice free and the freezing periods from june to december but the tomcar permafrost project has filled the gap on the exports of sediment and organic carbon during the freshet of the yenisei river 2 5 conceptualization the conceptual model used in this study is based on snow and freeze thaw soil behavior depending on the season as shown in fabre et al 2017 during winter the stability of the snowpack and the soil freezing sustain low fluxes of organic carbon an increase in temperature induces a rapid snowmelt leading to a strong surface runoff and a freshet during few days a subsurface flow comes with the surface flow due to a first unfreezing of the superficial soil layers sediment and organic carbon fluxes follow the freshet dynamic in a third time during the recession the thawed layer reaches its maximal depth called active layer resulting in a balance between surface and subsurface flows the last period shows the thawed layer freezing from both the top and the bottom while the snow starts to accumulate only lateral flow is possible by a piston effect which could engender doc fluxes but tss and poc fluxes should be reduced accordingly the catchment has been discretized into 257 sub basins these sub basins have been further divided into 3158 hrus from a combination of 14 land uses 20 soils and three slopes classes 0 1 1 2 and 2 the discharge peak occurring in may is mostly due to the snowpack melt snowfall must be aggregated and should stay in the subbasin until the snowmelt period so the snowpack can be modeled big enough to sustain the spring freshet it is assumed that the annual average ratio rainfall snowfall is 60 40 su et al 2006 the low number of available meteorological stations for precipitations data should be taken into account to respect this ratio indeed the highest station is at 1100 m above sea level whereas the highest point in the yenisei watershed is near 3500 m fig 1 an elevation gradient should be integrated in the modeling to compensate the lack of data evapotranspiration based on hargreaves and samani 1985 equation and sublimation have also been calibrated based on past studies su et al 2006 gusev et al 2010 fukutomi et al 2003 because of their influence in the water balance of arctic catchments ranging respectively between 36 and 50 of precipitations and between 4 and 20 of snowfall suzuki et al 2015 a very low groundwater contribution to streamflow should be considered in watersheds presenting permafrost soils groundwater flows are assumed to be low due to frozen soil conditions but have not been well studied in arctic watersheds yet woo 2012 the surface subsurface flows ratio is depending on the variation of the thawed depth permafrost behavior in the watershed has been conceptualized following an approach from hülsmann et al 2015 an impermeable boundary has been considered in the soil profile which should represent the active layer limiting by this way percolation in permafrost environments woo 2012 more details about the conceptualization of the yenisei river basin water balance can be found in fabre et al 2017 2 6 equations used to model organic carbon release to better understand the poc exports the method used by the swat model to model sediment yield is detailed hereafter the riverine sediment produced by physical soil erosion for each hru is calculated in swat using the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 the musle equation is calculating a sediment yield as followed t s s 11 8 q s u r f q p e a k a r e a h r u 0 56 k u s l e c u s l e p u s l e l s u s l e c f r g where tss represents the sediment yield per day in tons ha 1 qsurf is the surface runoff volume mm ha 1 qpeak is the peak runoff rate m3 s 1 areahru is the hru area in ha kusle is the usle soil erodibility factor cusle is the usle cover and management factor pusle is the usle support practice factor lsusle is the usle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor the equation is based on the runoff in a hru and on specific factors dependent on the soil and land use properties details of the usle equation factors can be found in neitsch et al 2005 the tss concentration is obtained from the river sediment yield the fluvial transport of sediment in the channel is controlled by two simultaneous processes deposition sedimentation and re suspension erosion the musle equation has already shown its capability to predict sediment yield in various watersheds douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 the advantages of using this equation integrated in swat are that it allows spatial and temporal variability in the resulting sediment yields by using few inputs data and without any measures on the field merritt et al 2003 de vente and poesen 2005 here we assume that the musle equation is working in permafrost affected areas as it has never been tested in this type of watershed however the kusle parameter should allow the user to integrate the freezing effect in the erodibility to model the poc the following relation with tss is used as proposed by boithias et al 2014 p o c 9 40 t s s a b where poc is the part of poc in the tss tss is in mg l 1 a and b two parameters which have to be defined depending on the watershed see details in fig 3 in the end a specific poc flux fpoc is calculated thus sediment exports have to be predicted correctly to model poc with accuracy the reliability of this equation in another type of watershed has been statistically checked as shown in fig 3 concerning doc modeling we have adapted the michaelis menten equation in this study johnson and goody 2011 to predict the doc concentration doc in milligrams per liter mg l 1 by correlating it with discharge q as followed and as shown in fig 4 doc α q β q with q in millimeters per day mm d 1 this equation underlines the need to well model discharge in order to obtain good results for doc concentrations α in mg l 1 represent the potential of the maximum doc concentration we could find at the outlet of the watershed and β in mm d 1 the specific discharge at which the doc concentration is half of α they have been estimated based on observed data from the arctic gro sampling projects the equation is calculating a daily average concentration and has for now been tested only at the basin outlet we have made the hypothesis that the relation is valuable at the subbasin scale to see the spatialization of doc concentrations in the watershed the whole area the subbasin is draining is included in the calculation in order to obtain a hydrological unit similar to a watershed 2 7 from concepts to modeling the impervious boundary depth has been assigned as a function of permafrost type in each sub basin based on active layer depth estimates zhang et al 2005 by using remote sensing the different average active layers depths have been estimated with the annual thawing index the conceptualized maximal depth of the active layer has been set to 800 mm 1500 mm 1750 mm and 2000 mm respectively for continuous discontinuous sporadic and isolated permafrost the maximal depth to impervious layer parameter depimp has been used to represent this concept the approach used neglects the temporal variations of the thawed depth parameters controlling the snow behavior smtmp sftmp smfmn smfmx timp sno50cov snocovmx see details of parameters role in table 2 and depending on temperature have been calibrated with literature for snocovmx yang et al 2007 and by expertise and auto calibration for the others to separate rainfall and snowfall and to contain the snowpack on the lands before the massive snowmelt as there is no meteorological station in high altitude the precipitation lapse rate plaps parameter has been used to adapt precipitation to mountainous zones evapotranspiration has been calibrated using measures from past studies with parameters that influence soil evaporation esco and water extracted from soils by the vegetation canmx the parameters slsoil lat ttime and surlag have been used in order to model the water volume flowing via surface and subsurface flows and the time lag they need to join the hru outlet for sediment exports the parameter prf bsn has been used to reduce the impact of discharge peaks on erosion and hence on sediment exports while the usle k parameter kusle in the equation above has been calibrated gradually depending on the permafrost type to slow down erosion in the most frozen zones 2 8 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of the hydrology and the different components of the water balance have already been discussed in fabre et al 2017 the simulation has been performed from january 2003 to december 2016 excluding a 4 yr warm up from january 1999 to december 2002 in this study the calibration has been done manually based on fabre et al 2017 and expertise by comparison to observed data sediment and organic carbon exports have been calibrated at a daily time step compared to sparse data from january 2003 to december 2008 and validated from january 2009 to december 2016 table 2 gives calibrated and validated parameters values 2 9 model evaluation the performance of the models has been evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index the coefficient of determination r2 the percent of bias p bias and the root mean square error rmse the nse is a normalized statistic usually used in hydrological modeling which determines the relative magnitude of the

hydrology and water balance the water balance has been calibrated based on results found in fabre et al 2017 the total simulated water yield has been checked at the igarka gauging station upstream of the outlet fig 5 as in this previous work the model shows a good representation of the freshets during the period of study and it reaches an annual mean specific discharge of 188 mm yr 1 for a standard deviation of 21 mm yr 1 on the whole period of study this result is close to the observations with an underestimation of only 45 mm yr 1 it reveals that around 47 of the yearly water is exported during the freshet in may and june concerning meteorological simulations the model returns 477 mm yr 1 of total annual precipitations with 299 mm yr 1 and 178 mm yr 1 respectively for rainfall and snowfall corresponding to a ratio of 63 37 snowmelt amounts to 142 mm yr 1 which equals to 80 of total snowfall and sublimation is returned as 37 mm yr 1 or 21 of total snowfall evapotranspiration is high in these regions with the dominative presence of forest and is returned as 276 mm yr 1 with a potential evapotranspiration of 550 mm yr 1 the average subbasin flow components distribution is as follows 36 164 and 11 mm yr 1 respectively for surface subsurface lateral and groundwater flows corresponding to 17 78 and 5 of total river discharge the ratio between surface and subsurface flows is different from what have been observed in another permafrost affected watershed in canada 60 40 carey and woo 1999 but this difference could be due to the distribution of permafrost soils in the yenisei basin with more than half of the watershed with sporadic isolated or no permafrost fig 2c mcclelland et al 2004 for more details on hydrology modeling and calibration validation details see fabre et al 2017 3 2 simulations of daily tss poc and doc fluxes the model has predicted correctly the specific flow of sediment at the outlet during the calibration and validation periods fig 6 the dynamic is following the freshets the statistical performance is satisfactory for the calibration and validation periods compared to previous studies with nse of 0 74 and 0 26 and r2 of 0 98 and 0 55 for a daily time step modeling our results can be considered as accurate regarding difficulties to calibrate tss fluxes and to catch the freshets without offsets for poc the measures and the simulations are following the equation from boithias et al 2014 with the coefficients a and b statistically determined and fixed respectively to 0 95 and 3 9 for the yenisei river fig 3 daily poc specific fluxes have been correctly predicted fig 7 the same problems are found with the low number of data during high flow periods the statistical performance has returned low nse of 0 27 and 0 16 and satisfactory r2 of 0 91 and 0 54 for the calibration and the validation periods which could be judged as accurate regarding the number of observed data regarding doc simulated concentrations the best fitting for the α and β parameters have been found as 15 0 and 1 29 as shown in fig 4 the model used is estimating with accuracy the doc concentration in the stream at the outlet as shown in fig 8 a the nse reveals some troubles with the validation period but is satisfactory during the calibration period while the r2 is very satisfactory during both of the periods in the same way the predicted doc fluxes exported at the outlet show a good tendency but return a low nse in the validation period fig 8b our results have shown that the predictions are really good during low flows for any export studied on the calibration and the validation period but have revealed underestimations during high flows period for the three variables fig 9 nevertheless the returned p values for each period are good and reveal strong evidence of correlations between observations and predictions 3 3 temporal and spatial distribution of tss poc and doc fluxes as expected permafrost thaw triggers the poc and doc transfers fig 10 a poc and doc exports rise drastically with the spring freshet due to snowmelt and follows the surface runoff dynamic this study reveals that poc and doc are mostly exported during the freshet as 57 and 65 of the yearly fluxes are transported in may and june 2013 fig 10a while these exports reach respectively 60 and 68 of the yearly fluxes over the whole simulation in order to outline processes involved in organic carbon transfer we have focused on the year 2013 as this year returned the best statistical responses to study the spatial distribution of poc and doc fluxes in each subbasin fig 10b first a link with the main stream near the outlet is relevant for the poc flux another variable is influencing both poc and doc transfer which is the permafrost type the unfrozen zones present higher fluxes than the most frozen soils during the increase in the exports a disturbance in the subbasins close to the outlet due to the discharge rising is clear some other subbasins have returned significant fluxes due to precipitation events the flux of particles is partially dependent on the permafrost type fig 11 for poc it is mainly driven by the subbasins presenting sporadic permafrost isolated permafrost or without permafrost and it reveals a really low contribution of discontinuous permafrost to the total fluxes regarding doc the contributions are more distributed along the basin with still a dominant contribution from no permafrost zones 4 discussion 4 1 conceptualization of the water sediment and organic carbon river transport in the yenisei river watershed this paper mentions new strengths in modeling permafrost sediment and organic carbon behavior in river this is the first study modeling fluvial sediment and riverine organic carbon behavior in an arctic watershed presenting all the types of permafrost at a daily time step by providing equations to predict organic carbon exports and used it coupled to a daily time step hydrological modeling this paper reveals the possibilities of precise modeling of organic carbon in a permafrost dominated arctic catchment concerning hydrology this paper brings new opportunities as the whole basin of the yenisei river is modeled unlike in fabre et al 2017 where the modeling has been dependent on 2 reservoirs this modeling could represent the flow distribution upstream of the reservoirs and also show the impact of the elevation gradient on the water balance in the higher zones of the basin that have been excluded from the previous work the discharge has been checked at the exits of the reservoirs and at the outlet of the different main tributaries with observed data available for the period 2008 2016 fig 1 for stations location these five gauging stations are not representative of a permafrost type as they integrate more than one this constraint has disturbed the calibration of soil properties for each permafrost type but the two tributary stations are mostly integrating continuous permafrost on one hand and sporadic and isolated permafrost on the other hand which has allowed us to approach soil properties based on these stations the other soils properties have been deduced accordingly concerning precipitations data the lack of data is a problem in this study with 20 stations for the fifth biggest watershed in the world some peaks modeled in summer and not present in reality could be linked to an accumulation of rainfall in the various subbasins linked to a station predicting a strong rainfall event swat transfers the climate data to a subbasin from the closest meteorological station input at this scale with 20 stations and 257 subbasins an accumulation of meteorological events is possible especially in the middle of the basin where we find a low number of stations fig 1 to simulate river sediment yields at a daily step is really rough oeurng et al 2011 using the swat model is an adapted choice to the results expected as this model allows spatial and temporal predictions of river discharge and sediment fluxes in a very large arctic watershed some other models could return more precise results but they need a larger number of measured variables which unlike the variables used in swat are quite difficult to collect moreover swat is one of the model validated for river sediment transport studies moriasi et al 2012 and has already been used to study organic carbon transport oeurng et al 2011 this study includes 20 soil types the good results obtained at the outlets of the reservoirs of the tributaries and of the whole yenisei watershed lead to the conclusion that this resolution is sufficient at this scale to represent the processes in the basin but as the exports of tss poc and doc are mainly driven by soil characteristics the spatial distribution of tss poc and doc fluxes would be more precise by integrating another soil dataset with better distribution and resolution of soil types still the quantification of organic carbon content in permafrost soils remain uncertain as shown in kuhry et al 2013 hugelius et al 2014 or schuur et al 2015 considerations on the databases available should be done to better model organic carbon yields because organic carbon content is much more linked to the permafrost type than to the soil type taking into account a freezing degree in the soil characteristics and adding this parameter to the soil data could be a first good improve to fill this data gap and better predict the transfers in that kind of watersheds without too important calibrations in the same way the parametrization of soil properties has allowed a discretization of permafrost types the soils parameters have been calibrated to limit the erosion and sediment supply in the most frozen zones this paper is the first study trying to explain the permafrost impact on physical erosion of soils and the subsequent river sediment transports by doing other investigations in various watersheds impacted by permafrost with the same size such as the ob the lena or the mackenzie which are the other main contributors of organic carbon to the arctic ocean dittmar and kattner 2003 we could check and refine the calibration suggested here our conceptualization of the processes in permafrost affected watersheds seems quite accurate regarding the results obtained the returned statistical performances have showed the difficulties for the modeling to fit the observations in the validation period this problem is due to offsets of few days between the observed and the predicted freshets this is revealed by fig 9 where the model has returned equally higher or lower fluxes than observed ones more researches are still needed in snowmelt processes to better model the discharge peaks in this type of watersheds these offsets could be due to the lack of meteorological stations with observed precipitations mentioned previously a better spatialization of these data coupled with a spatial study on the order of the subbasins contributions to the snowmelt should provide interesting information to improve the hydrological modeling by better representing the peaks of discharge and removing the offsets then the modeling should be able to reproduce the observed exports of sediment poc and doc however a focus on modeled specific fluxes of sediment on the year 2016 has revealed some troubles to represent the observed peak this year is presenting a low amount of precipitations and a lower discharge peak than the two previous years still the maximal observed sediment concentrations are in the range of the ones observed in 2014 and 2015 with this in mind we could assume that an unknown process is explaining these concentrations or that there have been problems in the sampling for this specific year moreover the influence of the reservoirs is strong field experiments must be performed in different parts of the watershed in order to check the contribution of each stream and each permafrost type on the organic carbon transfer by sampling water chemistry at the reservoirs outlets and doing isotopic studies on river waters at the basin outlet this work could be validated during the freezing period as the soil is inaccessible for water and as the snow accumulates the river sediment and organic carbon exports are really low and mainly dependent to the dams releases as in past researches table 3 the spring freshet is the main factor controlling sediment and organic carbon exports this study provides new information of spatial hotspots of organic carbon exports these spatial outputs are driven by precipitation intensity snow thawing and permafrost type permafrost free areas deliver higher fluxes of organic carbon which has already been demonstrated by comparing different arctic watersheds frey and mcclleland 2009 the spatial study leaves to interesting and solid conclusions on the behavior of river organic carbon in arctic watersheds riverine organic carbon transfer processes are variable in time and space organic carbon exports are mostly linked to surface runoff fig 10a as most of the river organic carbon is exported during the annual freshet due to snow and ice melt the organic carbon fluxes are also spatially dependent on the permafrost type distribution within the catchment fig 11 the continuous and discontinuous permafrost area present low export of poc and doc while the more unfrozen zones fed the stream flow in organic carbon as our simulated results at the outlet are close to observations we could assume that the time and space distribution shown by our modeling is close to the reality and that surface runoff is the main pathway contribution to poc and doc river transports concerning the data quality the tss poc and doc datasets for the yenisei river present a lack as only few data are available on our period of study and only few years have been sampled at a high frequency regarding the difficulties to sample during the freshet period the access to a high frequency dataset of sediment and organic carbon on specific years at the outlet of the yenisei river is an important opportunity to better understand the fluxes exported during this ephemeral event the swat model is using the musle relation to estimate sediment yield in each hru this equation has already returned good results in various watersheds douglas mankin et al 2010 krysanova and white 2015 but has never been tested in arctic watersheds sadeghi et al 2014 have proven that this equation should be used with caution other experiments should be done in other permafrost affected watersheds to confirm the validity of the musle equation in these areas the equation we used in this study to model poc adapted from boithias et al 2014 has produced relatively accurate results fig 7 in previous works the poc export has been explained by empirical relations based on statistical fitting with suspended solids ludwig et al 1996 or discharge mcclelland et al 2016 ludwig et al 1996 equation has been designed for a global scale analysis and has not been able to represent precisely the poc exports at a daily time step for each catchment the relation published by mcclelland et al 2016 for arctic watersheds allow to calculate poc fluxes at a daily time step but has been unable to estimate the percentage of poc in suspended solids the equation we used here is based on physical basis with asymptotes linked to parameters corresponding to the in stream organic matter with high organic carbon content in tss phytoplankton and residuals and to tss with the lowest organic carbon content corresponding to organic carbon concentration in the deepest soil layers it allows the user to adapt the parameters depending on the study case the spatialized resulting exports in each subbasin for the poc fluxes calculated with the equation adapted from boithias et al 2014 reveals limits in the validity of the equation figs 7 and 9 the equation is firstly designed to express a result at the outlet of the watershed as the asymptotes evoked before are defined on the basis of observed data at the outlet of the basin thus the export distribution shown in this paper is based only on the amount of sediment exports in the subbasins as the asymptotes are fixed equal in all the subbasins but the equation could be influenced by chemical parameters such as the organic carbon content in soils which is really variable in arctic watersheds improvements could be performed with more spatialized observed data of poc to see if the asymptotes of the equation are dependent on environmental or climatic variables and have to be adapted in the different parts of the watershed the equation used firstly in a french catchment is after all transposable in watersheds with other hydro pedo climatic conditions only the parameters a and b have to be adapted to the watershed the other parameter i e the constant 9 40 representing the shape of the curve seems to be stable independently to the watershed more studies are needed in watersheds with different climatic or anthropogenic influences such as tropical and equatorial catchments or really urbanized watersheds to validate this hypothesis concerning doc modeling the adapted model from michaelis menten equation based only on discharge could be limited the equation underestimates low and high doc fluxes but overestimates middle fluxes figs 8 and 9 for now the parameters α and β are determined statistically based on the dataset available a focus on these parameters is needed to better understand their link with environmental variables such as organic carbon content in soils and slopes ludwig et al 1996 or the percentage of peatlands and wetlands areas within the catchment hope et al 1994 gergel et al 1999 ågren et al 2008 again this equation needs to be tested in different subbasins to assess the existence of different α and β values at a catchment scale and in other catchments with different hydro pedo climatic conditions to evaluate its replicability at global scale 4 2 predicted exports of sediment and organic carbon concerning tss we found a specific flux at the outlet in the range of previous studies with an average of 2 97 t km 2 yr 1 regarding the specific poc and doc fluxes the annual fluxes are in the range of other studies on the yenisei river with respectively 0 13 t km 2 yr 1 and 1 14 t km 2 yr 1 this study outputs 1 2 to 2 times lower fluxes of doc 1 6 times higher to 26 times lower exports of sediment compared to previous studies see table 3 while it returns poc fluxes in the same range for sediment exports previous exports which are closer to 12 14 tg yr 1 are estimated based on data from pre dam period the dams influences have reduced drastically the export and post dam researches have estimated the sediment export between 4 and 6 tg yr 1 while our estimate of 7 5 tg yr 1 is above average these past studies have estimated the fluxes based on sporadic data often on a period inferior to the 10 years of this study by integrating the high water discharges at a daily time step in this modeling the fluxes given in this paper should be closer to real fluxes than past studies as previous works could have underestimated or overestimated the influence of the freshets on the exports it has already been demonstrated that daily time step modeling is essential in the study of arctic systems water flows fabre et al 2017 as sediment and organic carbon are strongly correlated with water flows a daily time step study is also primordial in this case besides our modeling returns peaks of tss poc and doc in the range of observations but fig 9 reveals that an offset in high flow periods remains and a focus on the detection of the peaks could be done to improve the modeling a better consideration on sampling protocols is encouraged in arctic systems as most of the hydrological and biogeochemical processes are happening on a short time period during low flow periods sampling each month could be possible especially between november and march where precipitations fall as snow and accumulate which strongly limits the number of water pathways in the basin a focus should be provided on high flow periods as proposed by the tomcar permafrost initiative this study has revealed that poc and doc are mostly exported during the freshet with respectively 59 and 65 of the yearly exports on the months of may and june of the 2003 2016 period studying the organic carbon behavior during the freshet is a main concern for this type of watersheds as the ice break up is hard and dangerous to prospect new improvements are necessary to facilitate sampling in arctic watersheds and assess the impact of the break up on the organic carbon exports a daily to weekly sampling protocol would be necessary in the period of transition especially at the end of may and the beginning of june as the flux peaks do not persist more than 3 days fig 10a we have explained that around 60 of the organic carbon exports happen during the high flow periods as in this paper most of the previous studies based their modeling or estimations on sporadic data without data during the peak of discharge which leave uncertainty on the behavior of organic carbon in the critical period of the freshet they could have underestimated the peaks of tss and doc fluxes but could have overestimated the time of transition between low flows and high flows periods which have resulted in higher annual exports compared to other large watersheds arctic watersheds have a special behavior which influences the way to study them wang et al 2012 have compared two asian rivers the yangtze river with a close draining area to the yenisei river 1 940 000 km2 and the yellow river which is smaller 752 443 km2 even if the yenisei basin presents similar draining area characteristics as the yangtze river its hydrological and biogeochemical functioning is closer to smaller watersheds because of the flood events dynamic the snowmelt impact on the freshet gives high peaks on short time periods like on the yellow river the yangtze river has longer high flow periods which allow a less frequent sampling protocol to represent well the whole hydrological cycle the yellow river and the yenisei river with shorter high flows period need a high frequency sampling during the transition to take into account the strong influence of the freshet on the annual fluxes this catchment behavior could be also related to really small catchments functioning with flash floods oeurng et al 2011 where high flows could supply more than 60 of yearly sediment exports 4 3 future modeling opportunities a first step to improve the modeling of sediment and organic carbon exports in permafrost catchments is to adjust the parameters of the musle equation based on the permafrost type or to add a time dependent parameter in the equation to express the freezing percent of the soil as the yenisei river is polluted by tritium bondareva 2015 which is found in sediment zoobenthos fishes or plants and by mercury in frozen soils river sediment fluxes simulated by swat could be helpful to trace of these pollutants exports predict the origin and the transport of the sediment allows some considerations on the management of these pollutants in the river indeed they constitute a strong issue for humans living near the arctic ocean by potentially causing ecotoxicological disturbances in aquatic ecosystems while the sea is the main food resource for these populations another perspective of this paper is to better understand and quantify the final state of all the organic matter exported to the ocean the models for poc and doc are not taking into account the consumption by organisms in the river or in alluvial plains which could be important and could impact the final flux to the ocean by knowing the quantity interfering in the carbon and the nitrogen cycle predictions on climate change could be performed a first possible approach could be to use the biogeochemical oxygen demand bod to calculate the potential organic matter decomposition by microorganisms by incorporating global warming scenario this modeling could be used to explore reactions of permafrost affected watersheds to climate change permafrost extent should be affected by climate change and thus the final exports of sediment and organic carbon could increase ciais et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 the main contributive areas to the poc and doc exports are the unfrozen zones even if tss and organic carbon transport are also dependent on other variables such as land use and soil types higher exports of organic carbon could be possible as a reduction of the permafrost areas and a complete redistribution of different permafrost types is expected with global warming mcguire et al 2018 tss and poc exports transported by surface runoff should not be significantly affected by a deeper active layer but only by an increasing erodibility factor due to the unfreezing doc fluxes should be much more affected by permafrost thawing as the contribution to total flux is mostly driven by the unfrozen zones fig 11 this rise in organic carbon fluxes to the ocean could accelerate the permafrost carbon feedback schuur et al 2015 this hypothesis is putting forward the amplification of surface warming due to carbon dioxide co2 emissions from thawing permafrost schuur et al 2015 as labile poc and doc are consumed by organisms resulting in the production of co2 the increase in the organic carbon fluxes could fit with this concept with global warming an increase of 15 6 of water discharge in the yenisei river is expected by 2100 with a stronger effect on the peaks of discharge peterson et al 2002 nohara et al 2006 this modification could again strongly disturb global carbon cycles by assuming that climate change will have the same impacts on sediment poc and doc exports these fluxes will reach 3 13 0 12 and 1 19 t km2 yr 1 these increases are only calculated based on the discharge effect but other changes mentioned above should be taken into consideration such as the permafrost degradability and its probable feedback on global climate change prokushkin et al 2011 macdougall et al 2012 schuur et al 2015 abbott et al 2016 which could accelerate the permafrost unfreezing and could liberate more organic carbon in freshwater frey and mcclleland 2009 testing the introduction of a feedback loop effect of permafrost degradation on global warming in modeling tools could lead to better estimates of future sediment and organic carbon exports to the arctic ocean 5 conclusion this study has allowed us to understand model and quantify sediment poc and doc fluxes at the outlet of the biggest doc provider of the arctic ocean the yenisei river and to outline carbon transfer processes with a spatialization of the study this is the first study trying to model tss and poc fluxes in an arctic watershed with a spatial and temporal variability and the first study trying to model spatially doc fluxes in a watershed the fluxes estimated in this study could be considered with a better interest than those proposed in prior researches on sediment and organic carbon in arctic rivers as our study integrates the contribution of high flow periods in the modeling while previous studies have generally extrapolated these periods using samples collected during low flow periods finally the main conclusions of this paper are essential in a context of climate change it underlines the contribution of each permafrost type to the total export of organic carbon by the yenisei river by integrating all the periods of the hydrological cycle this paper could lead to a better quantification of future sediment and organic carbon exports in a thawing permafrost scenario acknowledgements this project

18814,increased loading of algal organic matter aom during harmful algal blooms not only burdens water treatment processes but also challenges safe drinking water delivery while organic constituents promote biofilm growth in drinking water distribution systems dwds the effects of aom on biofilm formation in dwds are not well understood herein three parallel biofilm reactors were used to assess and compare how treated aom and humic substance hs impacted bulk water and r2a medium a control affect biofilm development for 168 days the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial communities in biofilms were clustered with the organic matter types in bulk water where family comamonadaceae was the most dominant but showed different temporal dynamics depending on the organic matter characteristics in bulk water higher diversity was observed in the biofilms grown in aom impacted bulk water bfaom than biofilms grown in hs impacted bfhs and r2a impacted bulk water bfr2a as the biofilms matured in addition some taxa e g rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were enriched in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a the biofilm image analysis results indicated that compared to bfhs bfaom and bfr2a had relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures with lower amounts of cell biomass extracellular polymeric substances eps and higher eps protein polysaccharide ratios overall this study revealed how aom and hs impacted bulk water shape the physiochemical and community structures of biofilms which can provide insights into assessing biofilm associated risks and optimizing disinfection practices for biofilm control in dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter humic substance biofilm development physiochemical and community structure drinking water 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs by cyanobacteria poses adverse effects to drinking water supplies worldwide pivokonsky et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 preoxidation e g potassium permanganate ozone etc coupled with coagulation and sedimentation has been broadly used to address the suddenly increased load of algal cells and algal organic matter aom during hab outbreaks xie et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 however these physiochemical treatments can also result in the release of intracellular aom from disrupted algal cells which can additionally contribute to aom pools ma et al 2012 aom contains a high fraction of hydrophilic and small molecular compounds that as a whole are difficult to be completely removed by water treatment processes even with an advanced treatment method like ozonation joh et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 thus those unremoved aom can still exist in the finished water and subsequently enter drinking water distribution systems dwds causing taste and odor issues and the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps pivokonsky et al 2016 furthermore as organic substrates aom could promote the growth of microbial biofilms in oligotrophic dwds liu et al 2016 controlling biofilm formation is one of the most difficult tasks for delivering microbially stable drinking water in dwds about 90 of bacteria tend to attach to the interior surface of pipes and form biofilms flemming et al 2002 biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells embedded in self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps which are primarily composed of polysaccharides and proteins flemming et al 2002 biofilm characteristics are highly associated with critical issues in dwds it has been reported that the physical structures of biofilms affect biofilm inactivation xu et al 2018 xue et al 2014 and initial adhesion of pathogens e g escherichia coli and legionella pneumophila within biofilms janjaroen et al 2013 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2012 impacting biofilm proliferation and the biofilm mediated fate and transport of pathogens in dwds the biomolecular compositions of biofilms eps compositions can impact disinfectant reactions and transports in biofilm matrices subsequently influencing both biofilm disinfection e g preferential reaction of monochloramine with protein components than polysaccharides in eps xue et al 2012 2014 and biofilm derived dbp formation and speciation wang et al 2013 furthermore studies also indicated that the microbial community structures of biofilms are strongly related to the disinfection efficacy since some key microorganisms play an important role in the resistance of biofilms against disinfectants bridier et al 2011 simoes et al 2010 therefore an understanding of biofilm structures specifically their physiochemical and microbial community compositions is crucial for maintaining the biological stability in dwds as the primary nutrient source the characteristics of organic matter in bulk water are among the most critical factors associated with biofilm formation and development in dwds camper 2004 however considerably less information is available to understand the interactions between mixed species biofilms and commonly available complex nutrient mixtures in dwds being mostly limited to humic substances hs camper 2004 hs are a primary source of terrestrially derived organic matter found in dwds volk and lechevallier 2000 it was reported that hs could be effectively utilized by biofilms having biomass yields within the same order of magnitude with more easily biodegradable organic molecules camper 2004 on the other hand besides hs aom is also another possible source of organic matter in dwds as many water utilities recently face great challenges in managing aom in contrast to hs aom includes more nitrogenous components which mainly consist of amino acids polysaccharides lipids and other small molecules zhou et al 2015 however to our best knowledge no research has been conducted to study the impacts of aom on biofilm growth furthermore in depth knowledge of how hs and aom impacted bulk water differently affect the physical chemical and microbial community structure in biofilm succession is also missing although these biofilm properties are known to affect disinfectant efficacy and biofilm associated risks in dwds given the fact that biofilms are widely present in dwds and significantly influence the safe drinking water distribution a comprehensive understanding of how biofilms develop and respond to complex nutrient sources in dwds is imperative accordingly this study aims to investigate the effects of treated aom and hs impacted bulk water on biofilm development under unchlorinated dwds conditions biofilm reactors were used and operated for 168 days the formation development physiochemical characteristics and community structures of biofilms exposed to aom hs or r2a medium control were continuously monitored and compared using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and reactor operation biofilms were grown in centers for disease control and prevention cdc biofilm reactors biosurface technologies mt usa fig s1 to simulate biofilm formation in dwds the reactors were operated at room temperature 24 2 c under dark conditions revetta et al 2016 each reactor contained 24 removable pvc coupons and biofilms were grown in both sides of coupons growth area 1 25 2 cm2 the cylinder rotation speed of all the reactors was set at 100 rpm to simulate the shear stress exerted on pipe surfaces in dwds 30 5 cm s flow through 10 2 cm pipes a disinfectant was not applied to the reactors considering biofilm development under very low or no disinfectant residuals found at different locations in dwds and building plumbing abokifa et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 initially a mixed species bacterial inoculum 2 105 cfu ml was collected from local water utilities filter effluents and dwds and inoculated into three parallel cdc reactors the aom stock solutions were prepared using cyanobacteria laden water samples from lake erie according to the usepa method 545 hs stock solutions were prepared using a commercial product sigma aldrich mo usa a granular activated carbon filter gac calgon carbon pa usa was applied to remove residual disinfectants dbps and the remaining total organic carbon toc in tap water after gac filtration the filtered tap water was used to dilute the aom or hs stock solutions and treated by coagulation flocculation sedimentation and ozonation to obtain the final toc concentration of 1 5 mg l ozonation was added to the conventional treatment train as many water utilities affected by habs already installed or are planning to install ozone to handle aom granular filtration was not used after ozonation to eliminate other uncertainties e g bacteria growth releases and soluble microbial products smp from filters and maintain similar treated water quality more details for the preparation of hs or aom impacted bulk waters are described in text s1 prepared hs and aom impacted bulk waters reactor influents were stored in sealed tanks with air filters and were directly delivered to hs or aom reactors using a multichannel peristaltic pump cole parmer il usa the flow rate was 0 5 ml min and the hydraulic retention time was 12 h for comparison oligotrophic r2a medium teknova ca usa which is normally used to enumerate bacteria in drinking water reasoner and geldreich 1985 was used as a control sterilized r2a stock solutions were directly injected to the r2a reactor using a syringe pump kd scientific ma usa to prevent any potential contaminations meanwhile for diluting the r2a stock solutions the ozonated tap water after gac filtration was also delivered to the r2a reactor using a peristaltic pump the final toc concentration within this reactor was also maintained at around 1 5 mg l the toc level was selected because it is the common toc concentration found in many dwds in the united states baribeau 2006 at this particular toc level the assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations of hs aom and r2a impacted bulk water were 137 27 9 29 139 27 12 25 and 140 37 16 23 μg l respectively which were within the range of common aoc values 18 214 μg l in dwds volk and lechevallier 2000 for this study biofilms grown in different reactors supplemented with hs aom and r2a are identified as bfhs bfaom and bfr2a respectively 2 2 water chemistry and organic matter composition of bulk water during reactor operations turbidity ph toc total nitrogen tn and phosphate po4 3 of bulk water were monitored additionally aoc was measured according to a previously established method and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was recorded to compare the aromatic carbon contents in different bulk waters hammes et al 2007 weishaar et al 2003 fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac was applied to characterize the organic matter composition in bulk water additional details of the relevant analyses are provided in text s2 2 3 biofilm physiochemical structure analyses three biofilm grown coupons were taken out from each reactor every 21 days for 168 days and the clean coupons were installed again to provide the same surface area for biofilms to grow for biofilm imaging at least eight locations in a coupon were randomly selected for image acquisitions additional details of the biofilm staining and clsm settings are provided in text s3 the collected clsm images were further analyzed using the comstat program heydorn et al 2000 to determine biofilm parameters 1 cell biomass cell biovolume 2 average thickness 3 roughness coefficient 4 surface area to volume ratio 5 total eps and 6 protein polysaccharide ratio the roughness coefficient r a can be calculated by the following equation according to heydorn et al 2000 1 r a 1 n i 1 n l f i l f l f where l f i the ith individual thickness measurement l f the mean thickness and n the number of thickness measurements 2 4 bacterial community analyses 2 4 1 sample collection dna extraction and high throughput sequencing for bacterial community analyses two collected coupons from each reactor were transferred to 50 ml falcon tubes and resuspended in 10 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline biofilms were detached from the coupons using mechanical scraping coupled with high speed vortexing for 15 min and then mixed by a tissue homogenizer to have sufficient biomass the homogenized biofilm solutions from two coupons were mixed together and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min after discarding the supernatant the pellets were collected and used for dna extractions according to the manufacturer s instructions powersoil dna isolation kits mobio ca usa bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified from the dna extracts of 24 biofilm samples and 1 initial inoculum using 515f and 806r bacterial universal primers caporaso et al 2012 the illumina miseq and pe250 kits were used to generate the metabarcoded sequence libraries detailed elsewhere kapoor et al 2016 bulk water influent samples were not processed for molecular analyses as no colonies were detected in the heterotrophic media plates for ozonated bulk water stored in sealed influent tanks xu et al 2002 2 4 2 sequencing data analyses the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime program version 1 91 caporaso et al 2010 briefly the paired end sequence reads were trimmed and merged using the usearch 10 edgar 2010 an open reference operational taxonomic unit otu picking method was applied in qiime at similarity cutoff of 97 using greengenes 16s rrna gene database v13 8 after removing singleton otus the otus appeared only once across the full otu table the sequencing depth of the 21 samples ranged from 52 276 to 16 902 all samples were subsequently rarefied to the smallest sequencing depth of 16 902 which translated into 13 144 otus in total before other downstream analyses alpha diversity indices and beta diversity were calculated by using qiime compute core microbiome py in qiime was applied to determine the core otus among sampling groups the core otu is often defined as the shared otus above a certain threshold the threshold value was set at 100 in this study which means otus appeared in all samples within defined categories shade and handelsman 2012 the core otus were further categorized into three groups 1 universal core shared among all biofilm samples from three categories of bulk water 2 transient core shared between all biofilm samples from two categories of bulk water e g shared between bfhs and bfaom 3 unique core shared among all the biofilm samples within a specific bulk water category but excluded the universal and transient core the remaining otus are termed as peripheral otus 2 5 statistical analyses shapiro wilks normality test was conducted for water chemistry parameters biofilm physiochemical structure parameters and sequencing data the students t test 2 tail or non parametric mann whitney u test was subsequently performed to determine statistical differences between samples principal coordinate analysis pcoa analysis of similarity anosim test and similarity percentage analysis simper were also used to further characterize the sequencing data non parametric spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to explore the correlations between structural parameters of biofilms more details are described in text s4 3 results 3 1 chemical characteristics of bulk water table 1 shows water quality analysis results for different bulk waters ph po4 3 aoc and toc were similar to each other the highest turbidity suva254 and toc tn ratio were found in the hs impacted bulk water while higher tn levels were observed in the aom tn 2 08 0 11 and r2a impacted water tn 2 51 0 22 in addition five eem parafac components tyrosine like materials smp like materials tryptophan like materials low molecular weight lmw humic like substances and high molecular weight hmw humic like substances were identified to characterize the organic matter composition of bulk water fig s2 table s1 both tyrosine and tryptophan like materials are mixtures of aromatic proteins chen et al 2003 smp like materials are also mixtures of proteins associated with biological processes ni et al 2011 compared to lmw humic like substances hmw humic like substances are commonly terrestrial derived fellman et al 2010 the five detected eem parafac components were clustered tightly according to the bulk water categories principal component analysis which demonstrated the differences of organic matter compositions in hs aom and r2a impacted bulk water fig s3 as expected hs impacted bulk water was characterized by the highest amount of humic like substances which again besides suva254 values indicated that it contained higher aromatic carbon fractions compared to aom and r2a impacted bulk water weishaar et al 2003 moreover aom impacted bulk water was also dominated by humic like substances but possessed higher proportions of smp and tryptophan like materials than hs impacted bulk water for r2a impacted bulk water tyrosine tryptophan and smp like materials were the most abundant 3 2 physiochemical structures of biofilms 3 2 1 physical structural parameters after 21 days there were no differences in cell biomass among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a however more cell biomass was found in bfhs than those of the other two types of biofilms from day 42 on p 0 05 fig 1 a on the other hand bfaom had larger amounts of cell biomass than those of bfr2a from day 105 on p 0 05 fig 1a the cell biomass for bfhs bfaom and bfr2a at the end of the study was 7 69 0 40 μm3 μm2 4 13 0 47 μm3 μm2 and 3 48 0 34 μm3 μm2 respectively the average thickness of bfhs gradually increased reaching 20 47 2 13 μm after 168 days which was significantly higher than those of bfaom 11 00 1 42 μm and bfr2a 10 19 0 84 μm respectively p 0 01 fig 1b bfaom and bfr2a showed significantly lower average thickness than bfhs from day 42 on p 0 05 fig 1b however there were no significant differences between bfaom and bfr2a during the entire study and the average thickness of bfaom and bfr2a seemed to reach a steady state after 126 days ranging from 10 64 1 26 μm to 11 00 1 15 μm and from 9 65 1 19 μm to 10 19 0 84 μm respectively roughness coefficient is a physical structural parameter of biofilms describing how biofilm thickness varies lower roughness coefficients indicate a more homogeneous biofilm surface during the operations the roughness coefficients of biofilms decreased over time where the roughness coefficients of bfhs were statistically lower than bfaom and bfr2a at day 21 and from day 126 168 p 0 05 fig 1c in addition the roughness coefficients of bfaom were significantly lower than bfr2a during the same period p 0 05 fig 1c surface area to volume ratio reflects how much of biofilm is exposed to the bulk flows the surface area to volume ratios of bfhs were significantly lower than those of bfaom and bfr2a from day 126 on p 0 05 fig 1d this result may be due to the higher cell biomass accumulation in bfhs which reduced the void area between adjacent cells however no significant differences in surface area to volume ratio were observed for bfaom and bfr2a during the entire study p 0 05 fig 1d 3 2 2 eps accumulation and chemical composition during the early stages of biofilm development up to 42 days there were no significant differences in total eps accumulation among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a p 0 05 fig 2 a the total eps for bfhs were higher than those of bfaom and bfr2a from day 63 on p 0 05 fig 2a however there were no significant differences in total eps between bfaom and bfr2a throughout the entire study p 0 05 fig 2a the protein polysaccharide ratio of eps formed by bfaom and bfr2a increased continuously after 21 days fig 2b the protein polysaccharide ratio in eps of bfr2a was significantly higher than bfaom after 126 days p 0 05 fig 2b while the ratio of eps produced by bfhs was mostly constant during the entire study ranging from 1 07 to 1 31 3 3 bacterial community analysis 3 3 1 temporal variation in diversity three diversity indices richness faith s phylogenetic diversity pd and pielou s evenness pe were selected to compare the alpha diversity of biofilm communities fig 3 a decrease in pe for bfhs and pd for bfr2a was observed at day 63 and 105 respectively but started to recover after that increasing trends were also observed for the richness and pd of bfaom from day 105 168 these results were consistent with previous findings that bacterial communities of biofilms tend to become diverse towards a more mature status although temporary reductions of diversity could happen at the initial development stage possibly due to certain species outcompeting others douterelo et al 2018 finally higher diversity richness pd and pe were noted for bfaom than bfhs and bfr2a from day 126 168 pcoa based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix was selected to evaluate the dissimilarities among the bacterial communities of inoculum bfhs bfaom and bfr2a since it provided the highest explanatory values fig 4 the anosim test r 0 59 p 0 001 further confirmed that samples from inoculum bfhs bfaom and bfr2a formed distinctive clusters except for the ph po4 3 aoc toc and toc tn ratio other bulk water characteristics showed significant influences in shaping bacterial community structures of biofilms especially for the organic matter composition table s2 pcoa1 was mainly correlated to hmw humic like substances r2 0 54 p 0 01 while pcoa2 was strongly associated with tyrosine like materials r2 0 82 p 0 001 followed by smp like materials r2 0 81 p 0 001 3 3 2 taxonomic profiling overall the relative abundance of individual taxa highly varied over time for different samples figs 5 and 6 at phylum level proteobacteria 92 52 57 53 actinobacteria 9 62 0 52 bacteroidetes 34 43 0 74 and acidobacteria 11 12 0 33 were dominant in biofilm samples and inoculum fig 5a within the proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria 42 02 was the most abundant in the inoculum while in the bfhs samples betaproteobacteria predominated from day 42 168 fig 5b maintaining an average abundance of 69 53 9 83 in bfaom betaproteobacteria was highly abundant on day 21 67 32 but decreased to 23 32 by day 168 while the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria increased from 12 73 to 36 42 during the same period conversely in bfr2a the initially abundant alphaproteobacteria had decreasing trends while betaproteobacteria increased to an average of 50 23 5 46 between day 126 and 168 at the family level pseudomonadaceae was the most dominant 25 30 in the original inoculum while comamonadaceae was consistently abundant after 21 days across all the biofilm samples fig 6 members of this group belong to the major taxa affiliated to the universal core of all biofilms see material and methods section for definition table s3 and explained the largest differences of bacterial communities 16 47 out of 80 97 among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a table s4 besides comamonadaceae other dominant families also occurred but showed differences among biofilm samples for example in bfhs pseudomonadaceae and several unassigned families were predominant at different sampling days in bfaom rhodobacteraceae 5 50 12 51 an unassigned family affiliated to order rhizobiales 3 40 7 73 and sphingomonadaceae 2 72 11 31 were dominant from day 84 168 in bfr2a rhodobacteraceae 26 25 was dominant in day 21 but dominant families shifted after day 63 e g rhodocyclaceae 4 45 23 5 chitinophagaceae 4 24 13 24 rhodospirillaceae 9 11 23 83 3 3 3 core otu analyses twelve universal cores fig s4 were found in all biofilm samples accounting for 31 9 of the total sequences these universal cores e g family comamonadaceae and rhodospirillaceae and genus methyloversatilis and nitrospira table s3 have also been found in other drinking water related biofilms e g dwds and building plumbing systems ji et al 2015 ling et al 2016 fig 7 shows the dynamics in the relative abundance of the universal core transient core unique core and peripheral otus the proportions of universal core for bfhs were generally larger than bfaom and bfr2a which suggested that hs impacted bulk water was more suitable to support the growth of ubiquitous bacteria however the proportions of unique core for both bfaom and bfr2a were significantly higher than bfhs p 0 05 no significant differences were observed between bfaom and bfr2a for the proportions of universal core p 0 05 as well as unique core p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of biofilm communities under the effects of different bulk water although the relative abundance of most individual taxa strongly varied over time throughout the entire study except for bfhs from day 126 on family comamonadaceae was the most abundant taxa in all biofilm samples figs 5 and 6 members of comamonadaceae have been found in a broad range of dwds conditions e g low temperature fast flowing and oligotrophic ling et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 it was also suggested that comamonadaceae is vital to the initial cell adhesion leading to the formation of biofilms di gregorio et al 2017 however the temporal dynamics of comamonadaceae varied among biofilm groups in this study in bfhs the relative abundance of comamonadaceae increased from 33 82 day 21 to 65 62 2 85 day 126 168 while in bfaom comamonadaceae decreased from 66 13 day 21 to 17 95 day 168 the higher amounts of available aromatic carbon compounds in hs impacted bulk water compared to aom or r2a impacted bulk water table 1 can be a possible reason to explain the consistent enrichment of commaonadaceae in bfhs because members belonging to this family are well known to utilize aromatic carbons for their growth vinas et al 2005 besides comamonadaceae other prevalent taxa also appeared but behaved differently among bulk water categories fig 6 since all the reactors were operated under the same conditions except for the feed solutions reactor influents the different temporal dynamic patterns and the presence of feed solution specific dominant taxa suggested that the organic matter composition of bulk water influenced the bacterial communities of biofilms the continuous accumulation of members of phylum armatimonadetes and family rhodobacteraceae over time was observed in bfaom but not in bfhs and bfr2a armatimonadetes is a group of gram negative bacteria thus far no information is available to describe the interactions between armatimonadetes and aom rhodobacteraceae related members are known as the primary colonizers of surfaces that promote initial biofilm formation elifantz et al 2013 more importantly rhodobacteraceae was able to grow together with algae by utilizing the algal exudates such as glycolate taurine and polyamines williams et al 2013 it was also reported that rhodobacteraceae was the most abundant taxa associated with phytoplankton blooms buchan et al 2005 thus it is not surprising that rhodobacteraceae which were dominant in bfr2a 26 24 on day 21 quickly became rare most likely due to a lack of appropriate nutrients or interspecies interactions however the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae gradually increased and the group became the second most dominant family in bfaom from day 147 on followed by comamonadaceae in addition phylum planctomycetes 0 64 4 43 and family sphingomonadaceae 2 60 11 32 were also predominant and displayed significantly higher relative abundance in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a p 0 05 planctomycetes could degrade algal derived compounds erbilgin et al 2014 jeske et al 2013 while sphingomonadaceae was found to be one of the most dominant taxa in biofilms of photobioreactors with microalgae krohn molt et al 2013 accordingly these results again reinforced that the organic matter composition in bulk water is a strong external factor capable of impacting the compositions of biofilm communities in dwds several full scale dwds studies reported that seasonality is the key contributor to shape biofilm community structures where the authors proposed that the variation of seasonal water temperature was the major factor ling et al 2016 potgieter et al 2018 when we consider the observations in this study fig 4 the fluctuations in natural organic matter nom composition in different seasons may be another factor that plays a role in the seasonal variations of biofilm communities in dwds it was reported that allochthonous nom e g hs enters freshwater systems during the spring runoff while autochthonous nom e g aom is mainly produced in the summer and early fall crump et al 2003 applying the same water treatment processes the removal efficiency of different nom may not be the same which can subsequently result in different fractions of organic matter entering dwds therefore the variation of nom composition in dwds could affect biofilm communities in different seasons in agreement with our speculations crump et al 2003 indicated that seasonal shifts of microbial communities in lakes were related to changes in organic matter types e g terrestrial versus phytoplankton another study also reported that the community structures of bacterial biofilm were shaped by source water characteristics within metropolitan dwds revetta et al 2016 4 2 dynamics of biofilm physicochemical structures under the influence of different bulk water to understand the changes in the physicochemical structures of biofilms under the influence of different bulk water clsm image analyses were conducted overall the most differences were observed between bfhs and bfaom or bfr2a highest cell biomass was accumulated in bfhs compared to bfaom and bfr2a from day 42 on fig 1a a recent study revealed that the trends for the cell biomass quantity in different biofilms were correlated to whether available nutrients support the development of the universal bacterial core or not higher cell biomass productions were observed in the biofilms containing higher proportions of the universal core proctor et al 2016 the universal core usually represents the bacteria with fast growth and high colonization rates stress tolerance and overall adaptation thus leading to the formation of more cell biomass ji et al 2015 martiny et al 2006 proctor et al 2016 in this study similar trends were found in bfhs which had a larger proportion of universal core than bfaom and bfr2a accordingly possessing more cell biomass figs 1a and 7 apart from the differences in cell biomass the amounts of total eps also varied among biofilm samples fig 2a at the given points higher amounts of total eps were observed in bfhs which contained higher cell biomass than bfaom and bfr2a correlation analyses results indicated that their cell biomass and the amounts of total eps were all positively correlated spearman rank correlation spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ 0 96 for bfhs ρ 0 94 for bfaom and ρ 0 88 for bfr2a p 0 05 which potentially can imply that more cell biomass results in higher amounts of total eps accumulation in biofilms moreover in terms of the bacterial communities as discussed before although comamonadaceae was the most dominant family in all biofilm samples its relative abundance only showed an increasing trend in bfhs up to 68 86 in day 168 but not in bfaom and bfr2a in addition to being important initial colonizers in biofilms members belonging to family comamonadaceae are known to produce large amounts of eps gao et al 2013 therefore it can be inferred that the higher total eps contents in bfhs may also be closely associated with the continuous predominance and increased presence of comamonadaceae in bfhs to closely examine the chemical composition of biofilm eps the protein polysaccharide ratios were calculated fig 2b the proportions of protein to polysaccharide in bfhs ranged from 1 to 1 3 which were similar to previously reported ratios 0 92 1 2 for biofilms grown in undisinfected dwds shen et al 2016 on the other hand the protein polysaccharide ratios in bfaom and bfr2a increased over time and reached to 2 19 0 10 and 2 52 0 24 respectively at day 168 it has been reported that the chemical composition of bacterial eps depends on the c and n content of feeding substrates of which protein production of eps can be promoted when c n ratios were low durmaz and sanin 2001 heldal et al 1996 thus the results with higher protein polysaccharide ratios in bfaom and bfr2a than bfhs can be explained by the higher tn levels observed in aom and r2a impacted bulk water table 1 besides the direct effects posed by the nutrient composition in bulk water the differences in eps chemical composition can also be explained by the distinctive bacterial community compositions among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a fig 4 generally via various biosynthesis pathways bacterial species even at the same genus level can produce different types of eps e g protein based or polysaccharide based schmid et al 2015 xue et al 2014 while 16s rrna gene sequencing provided the bacterial compositions of biofilms further studies are needed using other advanced techniques e g proteomics metagenomics and transcriptomics to fully map the eps synthesis pathway of individual taxa and correlate with the chemical composition of eps in these complex biofilm communities mason et al 2012 valenzuela et al 2006 in addition to the differences in biofilm eps characteristics other structural parameters of bfhs bfaom and bfr2a were distinctively different fig 1 overall bfhs showed a tendency to form thick compact and homogenous physical structures over time while bfaom and bfr2a had thinner and relatively heterogeneous physical structures these observations were supported by the biofilm images where bfaom and bfr2a had more porous biofilm structures with large channels and voids particularly in bfr2a fig s5 the correlation analysis results showed that the roughness coefficients of bfhs bfaom and bfr2a correlated well with their eps protein polysaccharide ratios spearman rank correlation ρ 0 75 for bfhs ρ 0 98 for bfaom and ρ 0 99 for bfr2a p 0 05 the values of spearman s rank correlation coefficient closed to 1 or 1 indicated that the physical properties of biofilms are strongly associated with its eps protein polysaccharide ratios moreover when the biofilms became mature from day 126 168 at given points the biofilm eps bfaom and bfr2a which contained higher protein proportions tended to have higher heterogeneity figs 1c and 2b in other words bfhs which possessed higher eps polysaccharide proportions compared to bfaom and bfr2a had relatively homogeneous physical structures these observed patterns could be explained by the close ranged electrostatic interactions among the functional groups of polysaccharides which are known to enhance the bridging effects therefore resulting in the formation of more homogenous physical structures of bfhs desmond et al 2018 in summary the data indicates that there are complex interactions among the organic matter characteristics in bulk water bacterial community compositions of biofilms and their physiochemical structures specifically organic matter can cause direct impacts on biofilm development more importantly the responded bacterial communities can also affect the eps production and the chemical composition of the entire biofilm matrix therefore eventually leading to the development of biofilms with unique structures to better elucidate the mechanisms behind these interactions future research is needed to understand the individual or cross link metabolomic profiling of biofilms in response to the different organic matter 4 3 practical implications the dwds management requires a comprehensive understanding of many aspects of water supply and distribution as well as water chemistry and microbiology liu et al 2016 biofilms are ubiquitous in dwds especially in locations with very low or no disinfectant residuals due to the high water age the presence of disinfectant demanding substances or prolonged water stagnation if there are biofilm and or pathogen outbreaks in dwds like the flint water crisis in the united states the common strategy for water utilities to control microbial contaminants is to increase the disinfectant dose to maintain disinfectant residuals throughout the dwds masten et al 2016 the results of this study on biofilm development under the influence of different drinking water related organic matter can provide insights into managing and improving dwds operations specifically the direct impacts of organic matter on the physiochemical and bacterial community structures of biofilms suggest that 1 insufficient treatments of hs compared to aom impacted source water may result in more biofilm formation with higher biofilm thickness cell biomass and total eps which may lead to fast disinfectant decay and high disinfectant demand in dwds xu et al 2018 2 different disinfectant reaction transport and decay are expected in bfhs and bfaom as they hold different physical structures and biomolecular compositions which can subsequently affect the biofilm disinfection efficacy and dbp formation and speciation from biofilms upon disinfectant exposure wang et al 2013 xu et al 2018 xue et al 2012 2014 3 compared to bfhs enhanced pathogen entrapment in bfaom is expected as they have distinctive physical structures with higher surface roughness which may increase initial adhesion of pathogens in biofilm matrices janjaroen et al 2013 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2012 accordingly understanding the organic matter characteristics of source water should be considered as an indispensable step to assess the biofilm associated risks and develop biofilm disinfection strategies in dwds operations in the future the impacts of other dwds conditions on biofilms e g pipe materials temperature disinfectant types etc and biofilm interaction with pathogens need to be further explored under long term exposure to hs or aom impacted water 5 conclusions this study examined the dynamic changes of biofilms in response to aom hs and r2a impacted bulk water at similar toc aoc levels for 168 days the major findings were the taxa comamonadaceae associated with biofilm formation and eps production was the most dominant in all biofilm samples but showed different dynamic patterns depending on the organic matter characteristics of bulk water besides comamonadaceae other taxa phylum planctomycetes and family rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were also enriched and predominated in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a as biofilms matured higher diversity with more relative abundance of unique core was observed in bfaom than bfhs which contained higher relative abundance of universal core aom and r2a impacted bulk water supported the growth of biofilms with relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures that contained less cell biomass and total eps but higher amounts of proteins than polysaccharides in their eps contents in contrast hs impacted bulk water supported the growth of biofilms with thicker and more homogeneous physical structures that contained higher cell biomass and total eps but lower amounts of proteins than polysaccharides in their eps contents organic matter characteristics of source water should be considered as an essential factor to assess biofilm associated risks and develop disinfection protocols for biofilm control in dwds operations declaration of interests the authors

18814,increased loading of algal organic matter aom during harmful algal blooms not only burdens water treatment processes but also challenges safe drinking water delivery while organic constituents promote biofilm growth in drinking water distribution systems dwds the effects of aom on biofilm formation in dwds are not well understood herein three parallel biofilm reactors were used to assess and compare how treated aom and humic substance hs impacted bulk water and r2a medium a control affect biofilm development for 168 days the 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis revealed that the bacterial communities in biofilms were clustered with the organic matter types in bulk water where family comamonadaceae was the most dominant but showed different temporal dynamics depending on the organic matter characteristics in bulk water higher diversity was observed in the biofilms grown in aom impacted bulk water bfaom than biofilms grown in hs impacted bfhs and r2a impacted bulk water bfr2a as the biofilms matured in addition some taxa e g rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were enriched in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a the biofilm image analysis results indicated that compared to bfhs bfaom and bfr2a had relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures with lower amounts of cell biomass extracellular polymeric substances eps and higher eps protein polysaccharide ratios overall this study revealed how aom and hs impacted bulk water shape the physiochemical and community structures of biofilms which can provide insights into assessing biofilm associated risks and optimizing disinfection practices for biofilm control in dwds graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal organic matter humic substance biofilm development physiochemical and community structure drinking water 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of harmful algal blooms habs by cyanobacteria poses adverse effects to drinking water supplies worldwide pivokonsky et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 preoxidation e g potassium permanganate ozone etc coupled with coagulation and sedimentation has been broadly used to address the suddenly increased load of algal cells and algal organic matter aom during hab outbreaks xie et al 2013 zhou et al 2015 however these physiochemical treatments can also result in the release of intracellular aom from disrupted algal cells which can additionally contribute to aom pools ma et al 2012 aom contains a high fraction of hydrophilic and small molecular compounds that as a whole are difficult to be completely removed by water treatment processes even with an advanced treatment method like ozonation joh et al 2011 zhou et al 2015 thus those unremoved aom can still exist in the finished water and subsequently enter drinking water distribution systems dwds causing taste and odor issues and the formation of toxic disinfection by products dbps pivokonsky et al 2016 furthermore as organic substrates aom could promote the growth of microbial biofilms in oligotrophic dwds liu et al 2016 controlling biofilm formation is one of the most difficult tasks for delivering microbially stable drinking water in dwds about 90 of bacteria tend to attach to the interior surface of pipes and form biofilms flemming et al 2002 biofilm is an assemblage of microbial cells embedded in self produced extracellular polymeric substances eps which are primarily composed of polysaccharides and proteins flemming et al 2002 biofilm characteristics are highly associated with critical issues in dwds it has been reported that the physical structures of biofilms affect biofilm inactivation xu et al 2018 xue et al 2014 and initial adhesion of pathogens e g escherichia coli and legionella pneumophila within biofilms janjaroen et al 2013 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2012 impacting biofilm proliferation and the biofilm mediated fate and transport of pathogens in dwds the biomolecular compositions of biofilms eps compositions can impact disinfectant reactions and transports in biofilm matrices subsequently influencing both biofilm disinfection e g preferential reaction of monochloramine with protein components than polysaccharides in eps xue et al 2012 2014 and biofilm derived dbp formation and speciation wang et al 2013 furthermore studies also indicated that the microbial community structures of biofilms are strongly related to the disinfection efficacy since some key microorganisms play an important role in the resistance of biofilms against disinfectants bridier et al 2011 simoes et al 2010 therefore an understanding of biofilm structures specifically their physiochemical and microbial community compositions is crucial for maintaining the biological stability in dwds as the primary nutrient source the characteristics of organic matter in bulk water are among the most critical factors associated with biofilm formation and development in dwds camper 2004 however considerably less information is available to understand the interactions between mixed species biofilms and commonly available complex nutrient mixtures in dwds being mostly limited to humic substances hs camper 2004 hs are a primary source of terrestrially derived organic matter found in dwds volk and lechevallier 2000 it was reported that hs could be effectively utilized by biofilms having biomass yields within the same order of magnitude with more easily biodegradable organic molecules camper 2004 on the other hand besides hs aom is also another possible source of organic matter in dwds as many water utilities recently face great challenges in managing aom in contrast to hs aom includes more nitrogenous components which mainly consist of amino acids polysaccharides lipids and other small molecules zhou et al 2015 however to our best knowledge no research has been conducted to study the impacts of aom on biofilm growth furthermore in depth knowledge of how hs and aom impacted bulk water differently affect the physical chemical and microbial community structure in biofilm succession is also missing although these biofilm properties are known to affect disinfectant efficacy and biofilm associated risks in dwds given the fact that biofilms are widely present in dwds and significantly influence the safe drinking water distribution a comprehensive understanding of how biofilms develop and respond to complex nutrient sources in dwds is imperative accordingly this study aims to investigate the effects of treated aom and hs impacted bulk water on biofilm development under unchlorinated dwds conditions biofilm reactors were used and operated for 168 days the formation development physiochemical characteristics and community structures of biofilms exposed to aom hs or r2a medium control were continuously monitored and compared using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm and 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design and reactor operation biofilms were grown in centers for disease control and prevention cdc biofilm reactors biosurface technologies mt usa fig s1 to simulate biofilm formation in dwds the reactors were operated at room temperature 24 2 c under dark conditions revetta et al 2016 each reactor contained 24 removable pvc coupons and biofilms were grown in both sides of coupons growth area 1 25 2 cm2 the cylinder rotation speed of all the reactors was set at 100 rpm to simulate the shear stress exerted on pipe surfaces in dwds 30 5 cm s flow through 10 2 cm pipes a disinfectant was not applied to the reactors considering biofilm development under very low or no disinfectant residuals found at different locations in dwds and building plumbing abokifa et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 initially a mixed species bacterial inoculum 2 105 cfu ml was collected from local water utilities filter effluents and dwds and inoculated into three parallel cdc reactors the aom stock solutions were prepared using cyanobacteria laden water samples from lake erie according to the usepa method 545 hs stock solutions were prepared using a commercial product sigma aldrich mo usa a granular activated carbon filter gac calgon carbon pa usa was applied to remove residual disinfectants dbps and the remaining total organic carbon toc in tap water after gac filtration the filtered tap water was used to dilute the aom or hs stock solutions and treated by coagulation flocculation sedimentation and ozonation to obtain the final toc concentration of 1 5 mg l ozonation was added to the conventional treatment train as many water utilities affected by habs already installed or are planning to install ozone to handle aom granular filtration was not used after ozonation to eliminate other uncertainties e g bacteria growth releases and soluble microbial products smp from filters and maintain similar treated water quality more details for the preparation of hs or aom impacted bulk waters are described in text s1 prepared hs and aom impacted bulk waters reactor influents were stored in sealed tanks with air filters and were directly delivered to hs or aom reactors using a multichannel peristaltic pump cole parmer il usa the flow rate was 0 5 ml min and the hydraulic retention time was 12 h for comparison oligotrophic r2a medium teknova ca usa which is normally used to enumerate bacteria in drinking water reasoner and geldreich 1985 was used as a control sterilized r2a stock solutions were directly injected to the r2a reactor using a syringe pump kd scientific ma usa to prevent any potential contaminations meanwhile for diluting the r2a stock solutions the ozonated tap water after gac filtration was also delivered to the r2a reactor using a peristaltic pump the final toc concentration within this reactor was also maintained at around 1 5 mg l the toc level was selected because it is the common toc concentration found in many dwds in the united states baribeau 2006 at this particular toc level the assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations of hs aom and r2a impacted bulk water were 137 27 9 29 139 27 12 25 and 140 37 16 23 μg l respectively which were within the range of common aoc values 18 214 μg l in dwds volk and lechevallier 2000 for this study biofilms grown in different reactors supplemented with hs aom and r2a are identified as bfhs bfaom and bfr2a respectively 2 2 water chemistry and organic matter composition of bulk water during reactor operations turbidity ph toc total nitrogen tn and phosphate po4 3 of bulk water were monitored additionally aoc was measured according to a previously established method and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was recorded to compare the aromatic carbon contents in different bulk waters hammes et al 2007 weishaar et al 2003 fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac was applied to characterize the organic matter composition in bulk water additional details of the relevant analyses are provided in text s2 2 3 biofilm physiochemical structure analyses three biofilm grown coupons were taken out from each reactor every 21 days for 168 days and the clean coupons were installed again to provide the same surface area for biofilms to grow for biofilm imaging at least eight locations in a coupon were randomly selected for image acquisitions additional details of the biofilm staining and clsm settings are provided in text s3 the collected clsm images were further analyzed using the comstat program heydorn et al 2000 to determine biofilm parameters 1 cell biomass cell biovolume 2 average thickness 3 roughness coefficient 4 surface area to volume ratio 5 total eps and 6 protein polysaccharide ratio the roughness coefficient r a can be calculated by the following equation according to heydorn et al 2000 1 r a 1 n i 1 n l f i l f l f where l f i the ith individual thickness measurement l f the mean thickness and n the number of thickness measurements 2 4 bacterial community analyses 2 4 1 sample collection dna extraction and high throughput sequencing for bacterial community analyses two collected coupons from each reactor were transferred to 50 ml falcon tubes and resuspended in 10 ml sterile phosphate buffered saline biofilms were detached from the coupons using mechanical scraping coupled with high speed vortexing for 15 min and then mixed by a tissue homogenizer to have sufficient biomass the homogenized biofilm solutions from two coupons were mixed together and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min after discarding the supernatant the pellets were collected and used for dna extractions according to the manufacturer s instructions powersoil dna isolation kits mobio ca usa bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified from the dna extracts of 24 biofilm samples and 1 initial inoculum using 515f and 806r bacterial universal primers caporaso et al 2012 the illumina miseq and pe250 kits were used to generate the metabarcoded sequence libraries detailed elsewhere kapoor et al 2016 bulk water influent samples were not processed for molecular analyses as no colonies were detected in the heterotrophic media plates for ozonated bulk water stored in sealed influent tanks xu et al 2002 2 4 2 sequencing data analyses the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries were analyzed using the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime program version 1 91 caporaso et al 2010 briefly the paired end sequence reads were trimmed and merged using the usearch 10 edgar 2010 an open reference operational taxonomic unit otu picking method was applied in qiime at similarity cutoff of 97 using greengenes 16s rrna gene database v13 8 after removing singleton otus the otus appeared only once across the full otu table the sequencing depth of the 21 samples ranged from 52 276 to 16 902 all samples were subsequently rarefied to the smallest sequencing depth of 16 902 which translated into 13 144 otus in total before other downstream analyses alpha diversity indices and beta diversity were calculated by using qiime compute core microbiome py in qiime was applied to determine the core otus among sampling groups the core otu is often defined as the shared otus above a certain threshold the threshold value was set at 100 in this study which means otus appeared in all samples within defined categories shade and handelsman 2012 the core otus were further categorized into three groups 1 universal core shared among all biofilm samples from three categories of bulk water 2 transient core shared between all biofilm samples from two categories of bulk water e g shared between bfhs and bfaom 3 unique core shared among all the biofilm samples within a specific bulk water category but excluded the universal and transient core the remaining otus are termed as peripheral otus 2 5 statistical analyses shapiro wilks normality test was conducted for water chemistry parameters biofilm physiochemical structure parameters and sequencing data the students t test 2 tail or non parametric mann whitney u test was subsequently performed to determine statistical differences between samples principal coordinate analysis pcoa analysis of similarity anosim test and similarity percentage analysis simper were also used to further characterize the sequencing data non parametric spearman s rank correlation analysis was applied to explore the correlations between structural parameters of biofilms more details are described in text s4 3 results 3 1 chemical characteristics of bulk water table 1 shows water quality analysis results for different bulk waters ph po4 3 aoc and toc were similar to each other the highest turbidity suva254 and toc tn ratio were found in the hs impacted bulk water while higher tn levels were observed in the aom tn 2 08 0 11 and r2a impacted water tn 2 51 0 22 in addition five eem parafac components tyrosine like materials smp like materials tryptophan like materials low molecular weight lmw humic like substances and high molecular weight hmw humic like substances were identified to characterize the organic matter composition of bulk water fig s2 table s1 both tyrosine and tryptophan like materials are mixtures of aromatic proteins chen et al 2003 smp like materials are also mixtures of proteins associated with biological processes ni et al 2011 compared to lmw humic like substances hmw humic like substances are commonly terrestrial derived fellman et al 2010 the five detected eem parafac components were clustered tightly according to the bulk water categories principal component analysis which demonstrated the differences of organic matter compositions in hs aom and r2a impacted bulk water fig s3 as expected hs impacted bulk water was characterized by the highest amount of humic like substances which again besides suva254 values indicated that it contained higher aromatic carbon fractions compared to aom and r2a impacted bulk water weishaar et al 2003 moreover aom impacted bulk water was also dominated by humic like substances but possessed higher proportions of smp and tryptophan like materials than hs impacted bulk water for r2a impacted bulk water tyrosine tryptophan and smp like materials were the most abundant 3 2 physiochemical structures of biofilms 3 2 1 physical structural parameters after 21 days there were no differences in cell biomass among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a however more cell biomass was found in bfhs than those of the other two types of biofilms from day 42 on p 0 05 fig 1 a on the other hand bfaom had larger amounts of cell biomass than those of bfr2a from day 105 on p 0 05 fig 1a the cell biomass for bfhs bfaom and bfr2a at the end of the study was 7 69 0 40 μm3 μm2 4 13 0 47 μm3 μm2 and 3 48 0 34 μm3 μm2 respectively the average thickness of bfhs gradually increased reaching 20 47 2 13 μm after 168 days which was significantly higher than those of bfaom 11 00 1 42 μm and bfr2a 10 19 0 84 μm respectively p 0 01 fig 1b bfaom and bfr2a showed significantly lower average thickness than bfhs from day 42 on p 0 05 fig 1b however there were no significant differences between bfaom and bfr2a during the entire study and the average thickness of bfaom and bfr2a seemed to reach a steady state after 126 days ranging from 10 64 1 26 μm to 11 00 1 15 μm and from 9 65 1 19 μm to 10 19 0 84 μm respectively roughness coefficient is a physical structural parameter of biofilms describing how biofilm thickness varies lower roughness coefficients indicate a more homogeneous biofilm surface during the operations the roughness coefficients of biofilms decreased over time where the roughness coefficients of bfhs were statistically lower than bfaom and bfr2a at day 21 and from day 126 168 p 0 05 fig 1c in addition the roughness coefficients of bfaom were significantly lower than bfr2a during the same period p 0 05 fig 1c surface area to volume ratio reflects how much of biofilm is exposed to the bulk flows the surface area to volume ratios of bfhs were significantly lower than those of bfaom and bfr2a from day 126 on p 0 05 fig 1d this result may be due to the higher cell biomass accumulation in bfhs which reduced the void area between adjacent cells however no significant differences in surface area to volume ratio were observed for bfaom and bfr2a during the entire study p 0 05 fig 1d 3 2 2 eps accumulation and chemical composition during the early stages of biofilm development up to 42 days there were no significant differences in total eps accumulation among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a p 0 05 fig 2 a the total eps for bfhs were higher than those of bfaom and bfr2a from day 63 on p 0 05 fig 2a however there were no significant differences in total eps between bfaom and bfr2a throughout the entire study p 0 05 fig 2a the protein polysaccharide ratio of eps formed by bfaom and bfr2a increased continuously after 21 days fig 2b the protein polysaccharide ratio in eps of bfr2a was significantly higher than bfaom after 126 days p 0 05 fig 2b while the ratio of eps produced by bfhs was mostly constant during the entire study ranging from 1 07 to 1 31 3 3 bacterial community analysis 3 3 1 temporal variation in diversity three diversity indices richness faith s phylogenetic diversity pd and pielou s evenness pe were selected to compare the alpha diversity of biofilm communities fig 3 a decrease in pe for bfhs and pd for bfr2a was observed at day 63 and 105 respectively but started to recover after that increasing trends were also observed for the richness and pd of bfaom from day 105 168 these results were consistent with previous findings that bacterial communities of biofilms tend to become diverse towards a more mature status although temporary reductions of diversity could happen at the initial development stage possibly due to certain species outcompeting others douterelo et al 2018 finally higher diversity richness pd and pe were noted for bfaom than bfhs and bfr2a from day 126 168 pcoa based on the weighted unifrac distance matrix was selected to evaluate the dissimilarities among the bacterial communities of inoculum bfhs bfaom and bfr2a since it provided the highest explanatory values fig 4 the anosim test r 0 59 p 0 001 further confirmed that samples from inoculum bfhs bfaom and bfr2a formed distinctive clusters except for the ph po4 3 aoc toc and toc tn ratio other bulk water characteristics showed significant influences in shaping bacterial community structures of biofilms especially for the organic matter composition table s2 pcoa1 was mainly correlated to hmw humic like substances r2 0 54 p 0 01 while pcoa2 was strongly associated with tyrosine like materials r2 0 82 p 0 001 followed by smp like materials r2 0 81 p 0 001 3 3 2 taxonomic profiling overall the relative abundance of individual taxa highly varied over time for different samples figs 5 and 6 at phylum level proteobacteria 92 52 57 53 actinobacteria 9 62 0 52 bacteroidetes 34 43 0 74 and acidobacteria 11 12 0 33 were dominant in biofilm samples and inoculum fig 5a within the proteobacteria gammaproteobacteria 42 02 was the most abundant in the inoculum while in the bfhs samples betaproteobacteria predominated from day 42 168 fig 5b maintaining an average abundance of 69 53 9 83 in bfaom betaproteobacteria was highly abundant on day 21 67 32 but decreased to 23 32 by day 168 while the relative abundance of alphaproteobacteria increased from 12 73 to 36 42 during the same period conversely in bfr2a the initially abundant alphaproteobacteria had decreasing trends while betaproteobacteria increased to an average of 50 23 5 46 between day 126 and 168 at the family level pseudomonadaceae was the most dominant 25 30 in the original inoculum while comamonadaceae was consistently abundant after 21 days across all the biofilm samples fig 6 members of this group belong to the major taxa affiliated to the universal core of all biofilms see material and methods section for definition table s3 and explained the largest differences of bacterial communities 16 47 out of 80 97 among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a table s4 besides comamonadaceae other dominant families also occurred but showed differences among biofilm samples for example in bfhs pseudomonadaceae and several unassigned families were predominant at different sampling days in bfaom rhodobacteraceae 5 50 12 51 an unassigned family affiliated to order rhizobiales 3 40 7 73 and sphingomonadaceae 2 72 11 31 were dominant from day 84 168 in bfr2a rhodobacteraceae 26 25 was dominant in day 21 but dominant families shifted after day 63 e g rhodocyclaceae 4 45 23 5 chitinophagaceae 4 24 13 24 rhodospirillaceae 9 11 23 83 3 3 3 core otu analyses twelve universal cores fig s4 were found in all biofilm samples accounting for 31 9 of the total sequences these universal cores e g family comamonadaceae and rhodospirillaceae and genus methyloversatilis and nitrospira table s3 have also been found in other drinking water related biofilms e g dwds and building plumbing systems ji et al 2015 ling et al 2016 fig 7 shows the dynamics in the relative abundance of the universal core transient core unique core and peripheral otus the proportions of universal core for bfhs were generally larger than bfaom and bfr2a which suggested that hs impacted bulk water was more suitable to support the growth of ubiquitous bacteria however the proportions of unique core for both bfaom and bfr2a were significantly higher than bfhs p 0 05 no significant differences were observed between bfaom and bfr2a for the proportions of universal core p 0 05 as well as unique core p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 dynamics of biofilm communities under the effects of different bulk water although the relative abundance of most individual taxa strongly varied over time throughout the entire study except for bfhs from day 126 on family comamonadaceae was the most abundant taxa in all biofilm samples figs 5 and 6 members of comamonadaceae have been found in a broad range of dwds conditions e g low temperature fast flowing and oligotrophic ling et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 it was also suggested that comamonadaceae is vital to the initial cell adhesion leading to the formation of biofilms di gregorio et al 2017 however the temporal dynamics of comamonadaceae varied among biofilm groups in this study in bfhs the relative abundance of comamonadaceae increased from 33 82 day 21 to 65 62 2 85 day 126 168 while in bfaom comamonadaceae decreased from 66 13 day 21 to 17 95 day 168 the higher amounts of available aromatic carbon compounds in hs impacted bulk water compared to aom or r2a impacted bulk water table 1 can be a possible reason to explain the consistent enrichment of commaonadaceae in bfhs because members belonging to this family are well known to utilize aromatic carbons for their growth vinas et al 2005 besides comamonadaceae other prevalent taxa also appeared but behaved differently among bulk water categories fig 6 since all the reactors were operated under the same conditions except for the feed solutions reactor influents the different temporal dynamic patterns and the presence of feed solution specific dominant taxa suggested that the organic matter composition of bulk water influenced the bacterial communities of biofilms the continuous accumulation of members of phylum armatimonadetes and family rhodobacteraceae over time was observed in bfaom but not in bfhs and bfr2a armatimonadetes is a group of gram negative bacteria thus far no information is available to describe the interactions between armatimonadetes and aom rhodobacteraceae related members are known as the primary colonizers of surfaces that promote initial biofilm formation elifantz et al 2013 more importantly rhodobacteraceae was able to grow together with algae by utilizing the algal exudates such as glycolate taurine and polyamines williams et al 2013 it was also reported that rhodobacteraceae was the most abundant taxa associated with phytoplankton blooms buchan et al 2005 thus it is not surprising that rhodobacteraceae which were dominant in bfr2a 26 24 on day 21 quickly became rare most likely due to a lack of appropriate nutrients or interspecies interactions however the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae gradually increased and the group became the second most dominant family in bfaom from day 147 on followed by comamonadaceae in addition phylum planctomycetes 0 64 4 43 and family sphingomonadaceae 2 60 11 32 were also predominant and displayed significantly higher relative abundance in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a p 0 05 planctomycetes could degrade algal derived compounds erbilgin et al 2014 jeske et al 2013 while sphingomonadaceae was found to be one of the most dominant taxa in biofilms of photobioreactors with microalgae krohn molt et al 2013 accordingly these results again reinforced that the organic matter composition in bulk water is a strong external factor capable of impacting the compositions of biofilm communities in dwds several full scale dwds studies reported that seasonality is the key contributor to shape biofilm community structures where the authors proposed that the variation of seasonal water temperature was the major factor ling et al 2016 potgieter et al 2018 when we consider the observations in this study fig 4 the fluctuations in natural organic matter nom composition in different seasons may be another factor that plays a role in the seasonal variations of biofilm communities in dwds it was reported that allochthonous nom e g hs enters freshwater systems during the spring runoff while autochthonous nom e g aom is mainly produced in the summer and early fall crump et al 2003 applying the same water treatment processes the removal efficiency of different nom may not be the same which can subsequently result in different fractions of organic matter entering dwds therefore the variation of nom composition in dwds could affect biofilm communities in different seasons in agreement with our speculations crump et al 2003 indicated that seasonal shifts of microbial communities in lakes were related to changes in organic matter types e g terrestrial versus phytoplankton another study also reported that the community structures of bacterial biofilm were shaped by source water characteristics within metropolitan dwds revetta et al 2016 4 2 dynamics of biofilm physicochemical structures under the influence of different bulk water to understand the changes in the physicochemical structures of biofilms under the influence of different bulk water clsm image analyses were conducted overall the most differences were observed between bfhs and bfaom or bfr2a highest cell biomass was accumulated in bfhs compared to bfaom and bfr2a from day 42 on fig 1a a recent study revealed that the trends for the cell biomass quantity in different biofilms were correlated to whether available nutrients support the development of the universal bacterial core or not higher cell biomass productions were observed in the biofilms containing higher proportions of the universal core proctor et al 2016 the universal core usually represents the bacteria with fast growth and high colonization rates stress tolerance and overall adaptation thus leading to the formation of more cell biomass ji et al 2015 martiny et al 2006 proctor et al 2016 in this study similar trends were found in bfhs which had a larger proportion of universal core than bfaom and bfr2a accordingly possessing more cell biomass figs 1a and 7 apart from the differences in cell biomass the amounts of total eps also varied among biofilm samples fig 2a at the given points higher amounts of total eps were observed in bfhs which contained higher cell biomass than bfaom and bfr2a correlation analyses results indicated that their cell biomass and the amounts of total eps were all positively correlated spearman rank correlation spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ 0 96 for bfhs ρ 0 94 for bfaom and ρ 0 88 for bfr2a p 0 05 which potentially can imply that more cell biomass results in higher amounts of total eps accumulation in biofilms moreover in terms of the bacterial communities as discussed before although comamonadaceae was the most dominant family in all biofilm samples its relative abundance only showed an increasing trend in bfhs up to 68 86 in day 168 but not in bfaom and bfr2a in addition to being important initial colonizers in biofilms members belonging to family comamonadaceae are known to produce large amounts of eps gao et al 2013 therefore it can be inferred that the higher total eps contents in bfhs may also be closely associated with the continuous predominance and increased presence of comamonadaceae in bfhs to closely examine the chemical composition of biofilm eps the protein polysaccharide ratios were calculated fig 2b the proportions of protein to polysaccharide in bfhs ranged from 1 to 1 3 which were similar to previously reported ratios 0 92 1 2 for biofilms grown in undisinfected dwds shen et al 2016 on the other hand the protein polysaccharide ratios in bfaom and bfr2a increased over time and reached to 2 19 0 10 and 2 52 0 24 respectively at day 168 it has been reported that the chemical composition of bacterial eps depends on the c and n content of feeding substrates of which protein production of eps can be promoted when c n ratios were low durmaz and sanin 2001 heldal et al 1996 thus the results with higher protein polysaccharide ratios in bfaom and bfr2a than bfhs can be explained by the higher tn levels observed in aom and r2a impacted bulk water table 1 besides the direct effects posed by the nutrient composition in bulk water the differences in eps chemical composition can also be explained by the distinctive bacterial community compositions among bfhs bfaom and bfr2a fig 4 generally via various biosynthesis pathways bacterial species even at the same genus level can produce different types of eps e g protein based or polysaccharide based schmid et al 2015 xue et al 2014 while 16s rrna gene sequencing provided the bacterial compositions of biofilms further studies are needed using other advanced techniques e g proteomics metagenomics and transcriptomics to fully map the eps synthesis pathway of individual taxa and correlate with the chemical composition of eps in these complex biofilm communities mason et al 2012 valenzuela et al 2006 in addition to the differences in biofilm eps characteristics other structural parameters of bfhs bfaom and bfr2a were distinctively different fig 1 overall bfhs showed a tendency to form thick compact and homogenous physical structures over time while bfaom and bfr2a had thinner and relatively heterogeneous physical structures these observations were supported by the biofilm images where bfaom and bfr2a had more porous biofilm structures with large channels and voids particularly in bfr2a fig s5 the correlation analysis results showed that the roughness coefficients of bfhs bfaom and bfr2a correlated well with their eps protein polysaccharide ratios spearman rank correlation ρ 0 75 for bfhs ρ 0 98 for bfaom and ρ 0 99 for bfr2a p 0 05 the values of spearman s rank correlation coefficient closed to 1 or 1 indicated that the physical properties of biofilms are strongly associated with its eps protein polysaccharide ratios moreover when the biofilms became mature from day 126 168 at given points the biofilm eps bfaom and bfr2a which contained higher protein proportions tended to have higher heterogeneity figs 1c and 2b in other words bfhs which possessed higher eps polysaccharide proportions compared to bfaom and bfr2a had relatively homogeneous physical structures these observed patterns could be explained by the close ranged electrostatic interactions among the functional groups of polysaccharides which are known to enhance the bridging effects therefore resulting in the formation of more homogenous physical structures of bfhs desmond et al 2018 in summary the data indicates that there are complex interactions among the organic matter characteristics in bulk water bacterial community compositions of biofilms and their physiochemical structures specifically organic matter can cause direct impacts on biofilm development more importantly the responded bacterial communities can also affect the eps production and the chemical composition of the entire biofilm matrix therefore eventually leading to the development of biofilms with unique structures to better elucidate the mechanisms behind these interactions future research is needed to understand the individual or cross link metabolomic profiling of biofilms in response to the different organic matter 4 3 practical implications the dwds management requires a comprehensive understanding of many aspects of water supply and distribution as well as water chemistry and microbiology liu et al 2016 biofilms are ubiquitous in dwds especially in locations with very low or no disinfectant residuals due to the high water age the presence of disinfectant demanding substances or prolonged water stagnation if there are biofilm and or pathogen outbreaks in dwds like the flint water crisis in the united states the common strategy for water utilities to control microbial contaminants is to increase the disinfectant dose to maintain disinfectant residuals throughout the dwds masten et al 2016 the results of this study on biofilm development under the influence of different drinking water related organic matter can provide insights into managing and improving dwds operations specifically the direct impacts of organic matter on the physiochemical and bacterial community structures of biofilms suggest that 1 insufficient treatments of hs compared to aom impacted source water may result in more biofilm formation with higher biofilm thickness cell biomass and total eps which may lead to fast disinfectant decay and high disinfectant demand in dwds xu et al 2018 2 different disinfectant reaction transport and decay are expected in bfhs and bfaom as they hold different physical structures and biomolecular compositions which can subsequently affect the biofilm disinfection efficacy and dbp formation and speciation from biofilms upon disinfectant exposure wang et al 2013 xu et al 2018 xue et al 2012 2014 3 compared to bfhs enhanced pathogen entrapment in bfaom is expected as they have distinctive physical structures with higher surface roughness which may increase initial adhesion of pathogens in biofilm matrices janjaroen et al 2013 shen et al 2015 wu et al 2012 accordingly understanding the organic matter characteristics of source water should be considered as an indispensable step to assess the biofilm associated risks and develop biofilm disinfection strategies in dwds operations in the future the impacts of other dwds conditions on biofilms e g pipe materials temperature disinfectant types etc and biofilm interaction with pathogens need to be further explored under long term exposure to hs or aom impacted water 5 conclusions this study examined the dynamic changes of biofilms in response to aom hs and r2a impacted bulk water at similar toc aoc levels for 168 days the major findings were the taxa comamonadaceae associated with biofilm formation and eps production was the most dominant in all biofilm samples but showed different dynamic patterns depending on the organic matter characteristics of bulk water besides comamonadaceae other taxa phylum planctomycetes and family rhodobacteraceae and sphingomonadaceae were also enriched and predominated in bfaom compared to bfhs and bfr2a as biofilms matured higher diversity with more relative abundance of unique core was observed in bfaom than bfhs which contained higher relative abundance of universal core aom and r2a impacted bulk water supported the growth of biofilms with relatively thinner and heterogeneous physical structures that contained less cell biomass and total eps but higher amounts of proteins than polysaccharides in their eps contents in contrast hs impacted bulk water supported the growth of biofilms with thicker and more homogeneous physical structures that contained higher cell biomass and total eps but lower amounts of proteins than polysaccharides in their eps contents organic matter characteristics of source water should be considered as an essential factor to assess biofilm associated risks and develop disinfection protocols for biofilm control in dwds operations declaration of interests the authors
