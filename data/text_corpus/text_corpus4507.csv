22535,in this paper eigenvalue problems of bloch waves over an infinite array of equally spaced parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars in shallow water are respectively studied both band expressions in closed form for the two eigenvalue problems are derived which depend upon the dimensionless bar height with respect to water depth and the dimensionless bar width and spacing with respect to incident wavelength it is found that the band gap center associated with an infinite array of bars coincides well with the peak phase of bragg resonance by any finite array of bars for any fixed dimensionless bar height a gap map as a bivariate function of the dimensionless bar width and spacing can be given when both the dimensionless bar height and width are fixed the band gap occurs periodically when the dimensionless bar height is fixed there exists a particular dimensionless bar width such that the band gap achieves its maximal width based on the gap maps the well known phenomenon of phase downshift can be visually and quantitatively explained and the peak phase of bragg resonant reflection by a finite array of bars can be well predicted which is much more accurate than that predicted by bragg s law keywords parabolic bars rectified cosinoidal bars bloch band gap gap map bragg resonance bragg s law 1 introduction the bragg resonant reflection was discovered by bragg and bragg 1913 for x ray reflection in crystallography who established the well known bragg s law that the maximal reflection occurs when the spacing of two parallel crystals is half of the wavelength of the normally incident x ray seventy years later by checking the reflection coefficient versus the dimensionless spacing of sinusoidal ripples with respect to incident wavelength bragg resonance between water surface waves and sinusoidal ripples was captured experimentally by heathershaw 1982 and theoretically by davies 1982a b however davies perturbation solution breaks down when the size of ripples becomes large later the deficiency of davies solution was fixed by mei 1985 by using the multiscale perturbation miles 1998 derived a solution in the form of an expansion which is also valid at resonance both solutions of mei 1985 and miles 1998 agree well with the measurements of heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 up to date these early studies have triggered a number of papers on bragg resonance caused by sinusoidal ripples such as kirby 1988 guazzelli et al 1992 and ardhuin and magne 2007 it is now widely recognized that bragg resonance can be not only used to explain the formation of multiple longshore sandbars on gently sloping and erodible beaches yu and mei 2000 hanes et al 2001 dronkers 2017 but also provides a mechanism of coastal protection by a finite array of artificial bars jeon and cho 2006 wang et al 2006 liu et al 2015a b the concept of artificial bars was originally proposed by mei et al 1988 in general artificial bars are parallel to the shoreline and have small sizes with low bar heights so they have the merits of not affecting coastal visual aesthetics allowing water circulation and fish passage and not interfering with navigation particularly when the bar spacing is about half of the surface wavelength bragg resonance occurs and a large portion of waves at frequencies within resonance bands may be reflected back to the sea however unlike x rays which are non mechanical waves water waves are mechanical so that their motion depends upon the propagation medium i e the water body thus their propagation velocity depends not only upon both the bar spacing and the incident wavelength but also upon the water depth which involves the bar height width and configuration it is noted that in bragg s law only the dimensionless bar spacing with respect to the incident wavelength is involved this tells us that bragg s law employed from crystallography is too simple to be accurate to describe the bragg resonance in water wave scattering indeed the peak phase of the primary bragg resonance caused by periodic bars always occurs at a frequency lower than that predicted by bragg s law see kirby and anton 1990 hsu et al 2002 chang and liou 2007 liu et al 2015a b and liu et al 2016 besides the water scattering by finite periodic structures the existence of water waves over an infinite array of periodic structures has been also extensively studied by employing bloch band theory joannopoulos et al 1995 see an and ye 2004 huang et al 2005 tang et al 2006 and zhang et al 2012 for two dimensional structures and chou 1998 mciver 2001 chen et al 2004 jeong et al 2004 and yang et al 2016 for three dimensional structures it has been shown that water waves over infinite periodic structures can produce many interesting phenomena such as bloch waves over a periodically drilled bottom torres et al 1999 superlensings due to negative refraction hu et al 2004 refractions hu and chan 2005 self collimations shen et al 2005a band gaps hu et al 2003b shen et al 2005b complete band gaps hu et al 2003a negative effective gravities in water waves hu et al 2011 2013 and topological phenomena of water waves yang et al 2016 among them the most significant phenomenon is the band gap forbidden band or stop band firstly according to the bloch band theory any surface wave propagating over infinite periodic structures will be modulated into a bloch wave that is it can be expressed into a product of a plane wave and a periodic function which has the same periodicity of the periodic structures secondly the propagation of bloch waves is characterized by their band structures between pass bands or allowed bands there are some band gaps within which bloch waves cannot exist the two problems above are different in mathematics the resonance behavior associated with wave scattering by finite periodic seabeds is a boundary value problem and the existence of bloch waves over a periodic bed of infinite extent is an eigenvalue problem however it is very interesting that these two problems are very closely related as pointed out by porter and porter 2003 p 162 lines 7 10 bragg resonance bands caused by a finite periodic array correspond to those band gaps caused by the corresponding infinite counterpart also as pointed out by linton 2011 p 505 lines 16 18 from the bottom if an infinite periodic array has a band gap then one would expect that this would lead to bragg resonance when a plane wave is incident on any corresponding finite counterpart at a frequency within such a band gap as a result the bragg resonance frequency of water waves over finite periodic structures can be determined by checking the band gap of bloch waves over infinite periodic structures hopefully this may lead to a new method which is more accurate than the simple and rough bragg s law however it is worth indicating that due to the difficulty in solving wave equations analytically most of the previous studies on bloch band structure over an infinite array are limited to vertical structures with piecewise constant depths such as rectangular steps an and ye 2004 huang et al 2005 rectangular trenches huang et al 2005 water piercing cylinders hu et al 2004 jeong et al 2004 drilled cylindrical holes torres et al 1999 shen et al 2005a b and submerged cylinders chen et al 2004 except for a few periodic structures with continuous depth variation such as sinusoidal ripples porter and porter 2003 submerged horizontal circular cylinders in deep water linton 2011 and trapezoidal and triangular bars liu 2017 in this paper we study the band structure of shallow water waves over infinite periodic parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars where the water depth in the bar region varies continuously analytical solutions in closed forms of the band expression for both the parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars are derived based on the two analytical band expressions for a fixed dimensionless bar height a gap map as a bivariate function of both the dimensionless bar width and spacing is presented and the influences of the dimensionless bar height width and spacing on band gaps are analyzed 2 band structure of bloch waves over parabolic bars 2 1 the band expression we first study an infinite array of parabolic bars which are parallel with each other and located at a horizontal bed see fig 1 where h 0 is the global water depth b is the bar height w is the bar width and d is the spacing between two adjacent bars which is also the period of the seabed profile according to the bloch theorem surface waves over an infinite array of parabolic bars will exhibit the bloch state so that the wave elevation η x can be expressed as the product of a periodic function u x and a plane wave e i k x as follows 1 η x u x e i k x where k is the bloch wave number and u x has the same periodicity d of the bottom undulation i e u x d u x it is clear that by using the bloch theorem the study of the wave propagation over an infinite periodic bottom can be simplified into the study within one period specifically by using eq 1 we only need to find out the expression of η x within one period d w 2 w 2 for convenience we divide the interval d w 2 w 2 into three subintervals i 1 d w 2 w 2 i 2 w 2 0 and i 3 0 w 2 in addition we denote i 4 w 2 d w 2 see fig 1 suppose that the angular frequency of the waves over the parabolic bars is ω according to the linear shallow water wave theory mei 1989 the surface elevation η x satisfies the shallow water wave equation as follows 2 h x η x h x η x ω 2 g η x 0 where h x is the water depth and g the gravitational acceleration for x i 1 where the water depth is constant h 0 eq 2 degenerates into the helmholtz equation and its general solution to eq 2 is trivial as follows 3 η x a 1 e i k 0 x w 2 a 2 e i k 0 x w 2 where i 1 is the imaginary unit k 0 ω g h 0 is the wavenumber related to the water depth h 0 and a 1 and a 2 are constants to be determined for x i 2 the water depth is variable as follows 4 h x h 0 b 4 b w 2 x 2 according to liu et al 2015b the general solution to eq 2 is 5 η x a 3 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 p 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 a 4 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 q 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 where r 1 b 4 b w 2 μ μ b k 0 w 1 2 1 k 0 w 2 b with dimensionless quantities b b h 0 w w h 0 k 0 k 0 h 0 and p 1 2 μ t and q 1 2 μ t are the associated legendre functions of the first kind and the second kind respectively while a 3 and a 4 are constants to be determined for x i 3 according to liu et al 2015b the general solution to eq 2 is 6 η x a 5 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 p 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 a 6 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 q 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 where a 5 and a 6 are constants to be determined in the interval i 4 w 2 d w 2 according to the bloch theorem 1 η x can be expressed as 7 η x b x e i k x a 1 e i k 0 x h 0 d w 2 a 2 e i k 0 x h 0 d w 2 e i k d where d d h 0 is the dimensionless spacing with respect to the water depth h 0 to determine all the coefficients a j j 1 6 matching conditions must be applied at x w 2 0 and w 2 which lead to the following system 8 g a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 t 0 where g is a matrix defined as eq 9 given in box i where 10 α p α p b k 0 w 1 b 1 4 p 1 2 μ b 11 α q α q b k 0 w 1 b 1 4 q 1 2 μ b 12 β p β p b k 0 w 1 2 μ 1 b 1 4 b k 0 w p 3 2 μ b 13 β q β q b k 0 w 1 2 μ 1 b 1 4 b k 0 w q 3 2 μ b 14 γ p γ p b k 0 w 2 p 1 2 μ 0 p 1 2 μ 0 15 γ q γ q b k 0 w 2 q 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 16 γ p q γ p q b k 0 w p 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 p 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 it is clear that the bloch wave with nonzero amplitude exists if and only if a 1 a 6 t is a nonzero vector while eq 9 shows that a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero vector a 1 a 6 t is that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero which leads to the following closed form band expression or dispersion relationship 17 cos k d 1 2 k 0 w b 1 b γ 1 2 μ γ 1 2 μ 2 e 2 i μ π γ p α q β q γ q α p β p α p β q α q β p γ p q cos k 0 d k 0 w 1 2 γ p β q 2 α q 2 1 2 γ q β p 2 α p 2 γ p q β p β q α p α q sin k 0 d k 0 w where the identity 18 p 1 2 μ x q 1 2 μ x p 1 2 μ x q 1 2 μ x 1 1 x 2 γ 1 2 μ γ 1 2 μ e i μ π is used it can be seen from eq 17 that the band expression cos k d totally depends upon three composite dimensionless quantities b k 0 w π 2 w λ and k 0 d π 2 d λ although it is involved with four independent dimensionless quantities b w d and k 0 where λ is the wavelength of incident waves over the water depth h 0 based on the analytical band expression 17 the band gap if it exists with cos k d 1 can be immediately found out and then we know that those waves at frequencies within the band gap cannot exist over infinite periodic parabolic bars for example the bloch band structure over parabolic bars with b 0 375 w 5 π 2 and d 5 π is calculated and the band gap is shown in fig 2 a b which shows that those waves in the range of 0 17323 k 0 0 19600 cannot exist over the infinite parabolic bars in addition if we rearrange infinite periodic bars with b 0 5 w 12 5 and d 25 then there exist two band gaps i 1 0 10201 0 12178 and i 2 0 21835 0 23052 see fig 2 c d thus those waves with k 0 i 1 i 2 cannot exist over these new infinite bars 2 2 relationship between bragg resonance and bloch band gap as we mentioned in the introduction the bragg resonance associated with wave scattering by a finite array of periodic structures and the existence of bloch waves over an infinite array are very closely related in this subsection we show this relationship for a finite and an infinite array of parabolic bars for b 0 375 w 5 π 2 d 5 π and n 2 4 8 16 32 64 all the wave reflection coefficients against k 0 d π 2 d λ for 0 05 k 0 d π 1 5708 which is just in the range of shallow water waves are calculated by using the analytical model based on the shallow water equation liu et al 2015b and the computational results together with the band gap of bloch waves i e the red interval over the infinite array of bars are shown in fig 3 a f it is shown that for n 2 4 8 16 32 64 bragg resonant reflection occurs at k 0 d π 0 95741 0 93206 0 92699 0 92699 0 92446 0 92446 respectively as we can see the midpoint of bloch band gap i e k 0 d π 0 923075 coincides quite well with these six resonance phases which is much more accurate than the prediction of k 0 d π 1 given by bragg s law in addition with increasing the bar number n not only the peak phase of the bragg resonance approaches to the midpoint of bloch band gap but the bragg resonance band also approaches to the bloch band gap this implies that the study of the bragg resonance condition by a finite array of bars can be transferred into the study of the band gap of bloch waves over an infinite array of bars the latter is hopefully much more accurate than bragg s law 2 3 influence of the bar height on band gaps at first we investigate the influence of the dimensionless bar height b on band gaps let w 12 5 and d 25 and b 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 and 0 625 the band expression cos k d is calculated by using eq 17 and the results are shown in fig 4 a e as expected with increasing the dimensionless bar height the first and the second band gaps become wider and wider from 0 12101 0 12494 and 0 24428 0 24664 in fig 4 a to 0 09353 0 12023 and 0 20738 0 22151 in fig 4 e respectively to see the full view of the influence of the dimensionless bar height on the band gap following hu et al 2003a b we plot a gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and b which is shown in fig 4 f where the red patch represents the band gap with cos k d 1 and the blue patch represents the pass band with cos k d 1 as we can see from the gap map when b further increases from 0 65 not only the width of the band gap increases but the number of band gaps also increases actually the number of band gaps becomes three for 0 65 b 0 95 and even four for b 0 95 this means that surface waves within a broader frequency range can be completely blocked by an infinite array of higher parabolic bars due to stronger bragg scattering effect 2 4 influence of the bar width on band gaps for a given dimensionless bar height b and a given dimensionless bar distance d we investigate the influence of the dimensionless bar width w on band gaps first for fixed b 0 5 and d 16 five values of w are considered i e w 5 7 9 11 13 the corresponding cos k d is calculated against k 0 for k 0 ranging from 0 to 0 31416 by using eq 17 and the computational results are shown in fig 5 a e it is shown that when w increases from 5 to 9 the unique band gap changes from 0 16906 0 19411 with the width being 0 02505 to 0 15654 0 18890 with the width being 0 03236 however when w further increases from 9 to 13 the unique band gap changes to 0 15027 0 17741 with the width being 0 02714 this means that when w takes some particular value near w 9 the width of the unique band gap will achieve its maximal value the gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w presented in fig 5 f clearly shows that there is a unique band gap in the range 0 146 k 0 0 197 and the width of this band gap is influenced by the bar width second for b 0 5 and d 20 five values of the dimensionless bar width are considered i e w 3 6 9 12 15 the computational results of cos k d are shown in fig 6 a e similarly when the dimensionless bar width w increases from 3 to 12 the band gap 1 changes from 0 14505 0 15654 with the width being 0 01149 to 0 12418 0 14923 with the width being 0 02505 however when the dimensionless bar width w further increases from 12 to 15 the band gap 1 changes to 0 12104 0 14401 with the width being 0 02297 in addition when the dimensionless bar width increases from 3 to 6 the band gap 2 changes from 0 29224 0 31312 with the width being 0 02088 to 0 27971 0 30581 with the width being 0 02610 however when the dimensionless bar width w further increases from 6 to 15 the band gap 2 changes to 0 26405 0 26719 with the width being 0 00314 the gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w presented in fig 6 f shows that there exist two band gaps one is in the range 0 118 k 0 0 157 and the other is in the range 0 249 k 0 0 314 the gap map helps us to see the full view of the influence of the bar width on the two band gaps 2 5 influence of the dimensionless bar spacing on band gaps it is noted that eq 17 tells us that cos k d is not a standard periodic function of k 0 but is a periodic oscillation function of k 0 with the oscillation period being 2 π d w the larger the difference between the dimensionless bar spacing and width the higher the oscillation frequency is predicted for example if we take b 0 5 w π and let d w take three values 11 π 21 π 31 π i e d takes five values 12 π 22 π 32 π then the corresponding oscillation periods of cos k d are approximately 2 11 2 21 and 2 31 respectively hence cos k d oscillates more and more frequently as a result when d w increases more and more band gaps are produced though the width of those band gaps becomes thinner and thinner see fig 7 a c the full view of the influence of d on band gaps can be seen in fig 7 d which looks like the path of the stars in somehow 2 6 gap maps for shallow water waves over parabolic bars in this subsection for any given value of the dimensionless bar height b we investigate the range of possible values of k 0 d and k 0 w to form band gaps of bloch waves we take six values of the dimensionless bar height b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 for each of these six values the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 d π and k 0 w π is plotted for both k 0 d π and k 0 w π ranging from 0 001 to 4 these six gap maps are shown in fig 8 a f they consist of several red patches in which each red patch corresponds to one band gap which can be obtained by cutting the red patch by a horizontal line it is noted that w d hence the domain of definition k 0 d π k 0 w π of the function cos k d is the region 0 k 0 w π k 0 d π rather than the entire first quadrant 0 k 0 w π and 0 k 0 d π firstly as shown in fig 8 a f when b and k 0 w π are fixed band gaps occur periodically with the period being unit with respect to k 0 d π this periodicity can be deduced from the right hand side of the band expression 17 which is a linear combination of two periodic functions sin k 0 d k 0 w and cos k 0 d k 0 w due to this periodicity we need only consider a single period 0 k 0 d π 1 which together with 0 w d yields that 0 k 0 w π k 0 d π 1 secondly as we can see in fig 8 a f with increasing the dimensionless bar height b not only the total number of the band gaps i e the red patches but also the width of each band gap i e the secant cut from each red patch by any horizontal line increases thirdly each red patch in the gap map in fig 8 a f takes an olive shape which is small at both ends but large in the middle this means that the band gap cut by a horizontal line from each red patch achieves its maximal width when k 0 w π takes some particular value see band gap ef in fig 8 f for example hence in each red patch there exists an optimal dimensionless bar width to produce a band gap with the widest width fourthly for bloch shallow water waves over an infinite array of parabolic bars all band gaps occur when k 0 d π 1 rather than exactly at k 0 d π 1 accordingly this means that for wave scattering by a finite array of parabolic bars bragg resonance actually occurs when k 0 d π 1 rather than exactly at k 0 d π 1 as predicted by bragg s law this phenomenon was called phase shift phase downshift or phase downward shift and reported by mattioli 1990 belzons et al 1991 guazzelli et al 1992 rey et al 1992 liu and yue 1998 madsen et al 2006 ardhuin and magne 2007 and liu et al 2019 for wave scattering by sinusoidal ripples and also reported by kirby and anton 1990 hsu et al 2002 chang and liou 2007 and liu et al 2015a b for wave scattering by artificial bars the occurrence mechanism of this downshift phenomenon was attributed to evanescent wave modes guazzelli et al 1992 surface nonlinearity and nonlinear effects associated with the bottom variations liu and yue 1998 and the decline in the phase velocity of reflected waves due to the presence of bars chang and liou 2007 however up to date the changing rule of the phase downshift has not been understood and all the previous conclusions are just at the qualitative stage more than the quantitative stage here the gap maps presented in fig 8 a f visually reveal the quantitative influence of the dimensionless bar height width and spacing on the bloch band gaps thus equivalently reveal the influence of these three bar parameters on the peak phase of bragg resonance in wave scattering by finite parabolic bars actually as shown in fig 8 a f with increasing b or k 0 w each red patch deviates farther and farther away from the bragg s law k 0 d π 1 this is equivalent to that with increasing b or k 0 w the phase downshift of bragg resonance in wave scattering by a finite array of bars becomes larger and larger in other words the error caused from bragg s law becomes severer and severer this quantitative conclusion coincides with chang and liou s 2007 qualitative conclusion it is worth emphasizing that based on the band gaps in fig 8 a f we can precisely predict the peak phase of bragg resonant reflection for example for b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 we can see that the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 12 15 k 0 d π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 5 i e the shallow water wave range 0 k 0 π 10 and the gap map corresponding to b 0 6 i e fig 8 e is the secant ac we now seek a point on the secant ac such that this point is exactly in the middle of the band gap cut from the gap map by the horizontal line that goes through this point by checking the gap map this point is located at e 0 8 0 64 and the band gap is the interval 0 685 0 915 see fig 9 a because the band gap is known we can predict that bragg resonance by finite parabolic bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 will occur at k 0 d π 0 8 and the limit resonance band for large bar size n is also 0 685 0 915 to confirm our prediction for n 8 16 32 the reflection coefficients are calculated by using the analytical model liu et al 2015b and the results are shown in fig 9 b d as we expected the bragg resonant reflections occur at k 0 d π 0 78977 0 78977 0 79724 respectively which are really very close to k 0 d π 0 8 and with increasing the bar number n the resonance band approaches the band gap 0 685 0 915 the success of this precise prediction reflects the superiority of the gap map over bragg s law 3 band structure of bloch waves over rectified cosinoidal bars in this section we consider bloch waves over an infinite array of submerged periodic rectified cosinoidal bars as shown in fig 10 where the water depth is defined as follows 19 h x h 0 1 b cos π x w x i 2 i 3 h 0 x i 1 i 4 in which i 1 d w 2 w 2 i 2 w 2 0 i 3 0 w 2 and i 4 w 2 d w 2 3 1 the band expression similar to the case of parabolic bars we have 20 η x c 1 e i k 0 x w 2 c 2 e i k 0 x w 2 x i 1 c 1 e i k 0 x d w 2 c 2 e i k 0 x d w 2 e i k d x i 4 where c 1 and c 2 are constants to be determined for x i 2 eq 2 becomes 21 1 b cos π x w d 2 η x d x 2 b π w sin π x w d η x d x k 0 2 η x 0 following liu et al 2015a by introducing the following transforms 22 τ τ x b 1 cos π x w 1 b cos π x w x w π arccos τ b b τ 1 and denoting 23 η x η w π arccos τ b b τ 1 η τ the physical domain of interest i 2 is now mapped into 0 τ b and eq 21 becomes 24 d 2 η d τ 2 1 2 τ 0 τ 1 1 2 τ 2 b 1 b d η d τ k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b τ τ 1 τ 2 b 1 b η 0 0 τ b which is a canonical form of heun s general equation arscott 1995 with the singular points being located at τ 0 2 b 1 b 1 and the general solution to eq 24 can be written in a closed form as follows 25 η τ c 3 h 1 τ c 4 h 2 τ where c 3 and c 4 are constants to be determined and 26 h 1 τ heung 2 b 1 b k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b 0 0 1 2 0 τ m 0 a m τ m 27 h 2 τ τ heung 2 b 1 b 1 4 k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b 1 2 1 2 3 2 0 τ τ m 0 b m τ m where the coefficients a i and b i are determined by the following recursive formulas 28 a 0 1 29 a 1 k 0 w 2 π 2 b 30 a m m 1 3 b m m 4 b 1 k 0 w 2 π 2 m 2 m 1 b a m 1 1 b m 2 2 m 2 m 1 b a m 2 m 2 3 and 31 b 0 1 32 b 1 π 2 1 b 4 k 0 w 2 12 π 2 b 33 b m m 1 2 m 1 3 b 5 2 b 1 2 k 0 w 2 π 2 m 2 m 1 b b m 1 1 b m 3 2 2 m 2 m 1 b b m 2 m 2 3 as we can see the heun general function heung a q α β γ δ τ is a frobenius series centered at the regular singular point τ 0 associated with the index c 0 according to frobenius theory heung a q α β γ δ τ and its derivatives converge for all complex τ in the complex disk τ min a 1 hence the two heun general functions in eqs 26 and 27 and their derivatives converge in the complex disk τ 2 b 1 b which includes the mapped interval of interest 0 τ b as its subdomain it is good that in practical calculation heung a q α β γ δ τ can be directly invoked in the software maple 2015 thus we can ignore the two recursive formulas finally by returning to the original variable we have 34 η x η τ x c 3 h 1 τ x c 4 h 2 τ x x i 2 similarly for x i 3 the surface elevation of water waves can be expressed as 35 η x c 5 h 1 τ x c 6 h 2 τ x x i 3 where c 5 and c 6 are constants to be determined at the common boundaries x w 2 0 and w 2 matching conditions must be satisfied which lead to the following system 36 c 1 c 2 h 1 b c 3 h 2 b c 4 i c 1 i c 2 ν h 1 b c 3 ν h 2 b c 4 c 3 c 5 c 4 c 6 e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 1 e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 2 h 1 b c 5 h 2 b c 6 i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 1 i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 2 ν h 1 b c 5 ν h 2 b c 6 where ν ν b k 0 w π b 1 b k 0 w clearly this system can be simplified and rewritten into the following matrix form 37 1 1 h 1 b h 2 b i i ν h 1 b ν h 2 b e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w h 1 b h 2 b i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w ν h 1 b ν h 2 b c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 0 since the bloch wave with nonzero amplitude exists if and only if c 1 c 4 t is not a zero vector while eq 37 tells us that a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero vector c 1 c 4 t is that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero which leads to the following closed form band expression of band structures 38 cos k d h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b cos k 0 d k 0 w ν h 1 b h 2 b 1 ν h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b sin k 0 d k 0 w it is noted that all the quantities ν h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b are bivariate functions of b and k 0 w meaning that the above band expression of bloch waves over an infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars totally depends upon three independent dimensionless quantities b k 0 d and k 0 w 3 2 relationship between bragg resonance and bloch band gap again in this subsection we show the relationship between bragg resonance by a finite array of rectified cosinoidal bars and bloch band gap by an infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars for b 0 5 w 12 5 d 15 and n 2 4 8 16 32 64 all the wave reflection coefficients against k 0 d π for 0 000796 k 0 d π 1 5 i e 0 0001 k 0 0 31415926 which is in the range of shallow water waves are calculated by using the analytical model based on the shallow water equation liu et al 2015a and the computational results together with the band gap of bloch waves i e the red interval over the infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars are shown in fig 11 a f it is shown that for n 2 4 8 16 32 64 the unique bragg resonance occurs at k 0 d π 0 79522 0 82521 0 83521 0 83521 0 83521 0 83521 respectively as we can see the midpoint of bloch band gap 0 76523 0 91019 i e k 0 d π 0 83771 coincides quite well with the six resonance phases which is much more accurate than the prediction of k 0 d π 1 given by bragg s law in addition similar to the case of parabolic bars with increasing the number n of the rectified cosinoidal bars not only the peak phase of the bragg resonance approaches to the midpoint of bloch band gap but the bragg resonance band also exactly overlaps with the bloch band gap 3 3 influence of the bar height width and spacing on band gaps first same to the values of w and d chosen in fig 4 f for parabolic bars the dimensionless bar width and spacing of the rectified cosinoidal bars are also taken to be w 12 5 and d 25 the corresponding gap map as a function of k 0 and b is shown in fig 12 a which is quite similar to the gap map in fig 4 f with a little bit difference near b 1 it is shown again that with increasing the dimensionless bar height b not only the width of the band gap increases but the number of band gaps may also increases see fig 12 a for b 0 7 second for convenience of comparison with the gap map for parabolic bars presented in fig 5 f the values of the dimensionless bar height and spacing of the rectified cosinoidal bars are also taken to be b 0 5 and d 16 the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w for w varying from 0 001 to 16 is plotted and the result is shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that there is almost no difference about the pattern and size of the two gap maps in fig 5 f and in fig 12 b when w increases from 1 to 9 the width of the unique band gap increases however when w further increases from 9 to 16 the width of the unique band gap conversely decreases where the widest band gap when w 9 is the interval 0 15818 0 18958 this property tells us that there exist an optimal bar width to produce the widest band gap third following what we have done in fig 6 f here we also take b 0 5 and d 20 the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w for w varying from 0 001 to 20 is plotted and the result is shown in fig 12 c it can be seen that for this case there are two band gaps respectively in the ranges of 0 117 k 0 0 158 and 0 252 k 0 0 31416 when w increases from 0 001 to 12 the width of the first band gap increases however when w further increases the width of the first band gap conversely decreases where the widest band gap when w 12 is the interval 0 12572 0 15085 in addition the second band gap is widest at w 5 5 which is the interval 0 28171 0 30892 fourth the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and d for d varying from 1 to 44 is shown in fig 12 d where b 0 5 and w π which are same to the evaluations of b and w in fig 7 f it can be seen that fig 12 d is almost identical with fig 7 f 3 4 gap maps for waves over rectified cosinoidal bars in this subsection similar to what we have done in fig 8 six gap maps of shallow water waves over rectified cosinoidal bars related to b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 are also plotted for both k 0 d π and k 0 w π ranging from 0 001 to 4 these six gap maps are shown in fig 13 a f on one hand the gap maps in fig 13 and those in fig 8 with same b look quite similar due to the similar configurations of both parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars although they are slightly different on the other hand both the gap maps in figs 8 and 13 are quite different from the gap maps in figures 3 7 in liu 2017 for shallow water waves over trapezoidal bars due to the evident difference of the bar configurations especially this difference for those cases with w t 0 99 w b are much more significant see figures 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 d and 7 d in liu 2017 since those trapezoidal bars nearly degenerate into rectangular bars under the condition of w t 0 99 w b where w b and w t are respectively the dimensionless widths of the bottom and of the top plane of the trapezoidal bars in addition a significant difference between any of the gap maps in fig 8 or fig 13 and its counterpart in figure 9 in liu 2017 with same b for shallow water waves over triangular bars can be also observed to show the slight difference between the two gap maps in fig 8 e and in fig 13 e we also use the gap map in fig 13 e to predict the peak phase of bragg resonance by finite rectified cosinoidal bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 first the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 12 15 k 0 d π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 5 and the gap map in fig 13 e is the secant fg see fig 14 a second the point h 0 808 0 6464 on the secant fg is in the middle of the band gap 0 692 0 924 which is cut from the gap map in fig 14 a by the horizontal line k 0 w π 0 6464 we thus predict that bragg resonance by finite rectified cosinoidal bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 will occur at k 0 d π 0 808 and the limit resonance band for large bar size n is also 0 692 0 924 for n 8 16 32 the corresponding reflection coefficients are calculated by using the analytical model liu et al 2015a and the results are shown in fig 14 b d which show that the bragg resonances do occur at k 0 d π 0 79146 0 79884 0 80130 respectively very close to our prediction k 0 d π 0 808 and with increasing the bar size n the resonance band does approach the band gap 0 692 0 924 4 comparison between the reflection effects by two types of bars as shown in sections 2 6 and 3 4 under the bar conditions b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 the band gap produced by infinite parabolic bars is k 0 d π 0 685 0 915 i e k 0 0 143466 0 191637 and the band gap produced by infinite rectified cosinoidal bars is k 0 d π 0 692 0 924 i e k 0 0 144932 0 193522 it is clear that the difference between these two band gaps is quite small in addition under the same dimensionless bar conditions b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 the peak value of bragg resonance produced by 8 arrays of parabolic bars is 0 99458 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 65520 0 92434 i e k 0 0 137225 0 193593 see fig 9 b and the peak value of bragg resonance produced by 8 arrays of rectified cosinoidal bars is 0 99477 the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 66353 0 93907 i e k 0 0 138969 0 196678 see fig 14 b again the difference between the two peak values of bragg resonance or the two bragg resonance bands is also quite small for a further confirmation we change the bar conditions into b 0 6 w 8 and d 10 it is noted that we still have w d 0 8 the intersection of a shorter line segment k 0 w π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 and the gap map in fig 9 a is still the secant ac hence the band gap produced by infinite parabolic bars is still k 0 d π 0 685 0 915 i e k 0 4 303981 5 749114 similarly the band gap produced by infinite rectified cosinoidal bars is still k 0 d π 0 692 0 924 i e k 0 4 347964 5 805663 on the other hand the reflection coefficients by 8 arrays of two types of bars are calculated by using analytical models liu et al 2015a b and the results are shown in fig 15 a and b respectively it is shown that the peak value of bragg resonance produced by parabolic bars is 0 99458 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 65610 0 93022 i e k 0 0 206120 0 292237 see fig 15 a the peak value of bragg resonance produced by rectified cosinoidal bars is 0 99477 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 66607 0 94019 i e k 0 0 209252 0 295369 see fig 15 b these comparisons still show that the reflection effects produced by the two types of bars are almost identical it is worth indicating that if the bar width or the bar spacing is quite small for example w 3 and d 5 then the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 3 5 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 0 5 i e the long wave range 0 k 0 π 10 and the gap map in fig 9 a or fig 14 a is an empty set hence there is neither bloch band gap nor bragg resonance in the shallow water wave range 5 conclusion the band expression of bloch shallow water waves over infinite periodic parabolic bars is derived firstly which is in a closed form in terms of the associated legendre functions secondly the band expression of bloch shallow water waves over infinite periodic rectified cosinoidal bars is also derived which is in a closed form involving with the heun general function it is shown that the two band expressions depend upon three bar parameters which are the dimensionless bar height with respect to water depth the dimensionless bar width and spacing with respect to incident wavelength when the dimensionless bar height is fixed the gap map as a bivariate function of the dimensionless bar width and spacing can be obtained which consists of many periodic olive patterns when both the dimensionless bar height and width are fixed band gaps cut from the gap map by horizontal lines occur periodically when the dimensionless bar height is fixed there exists a particular dimensionless bar width corresponding to the widest band gap it is shown that not only the gap map can be used to quantitatively explain the phase downshift of bragg resonance but can also be used to predict the peak phase of resonance the latter is much more accurate than that predicted by bragg s law in addition it is found that the bragg resonances and the resonance bands produced by the two types of bars with same geometrical parameters are almost identical acknowledgments this work is supported by

22535,in this paper eigenvalue problems of bloch waves over an infinite array of equally spaced parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars in shallow water are respectively studied both band expressions in closed form for the two eigenvalue problems are derived which depend upon the dimensionless bar height with respect to water depth and the dimensionless bar width and spacing with respect to incident wavelength it is found that the band gap center associated with an infinite array of bars coincides well with the peak phase of bragg resonance by any finite array of bars for any fixed dimensionless bar height a gap map as a bivariate function of the dimensionless bar width and spacing can be given when both the dimensionless bar height and width are fixed the band gap occurs periodically when the dimensionless bar height is fixed there exists a particular dimensionless bar width such that the band gap achieves its maximal width based on the gap maps the well known phenomenon of phase downshift can be visually and quantitatively explained and the peak phase of bragg resonant reflection by a finite array of bars can be well predicted which is much more accurate than that predicted by bragg s law keywords parabolic bars rectified cosinoidal bars bloch band gap gap map bragg resonance bragg s law 1 introduction the bragg resonant reflection was discovered by bragg and bragg 1913 for x ray reflection in crystallography who established the well known bragg s law that the maximal reflection occurs when the spacing of two parallel crystals is half of the wavelength of the normally incident x ray seventy years later by checking the reflection coefficient versus the dimensionless spacing of sinusoidal ripples with respect to incident wavelength bragg resonance between water surface waves and sinusoidal ripples was captured experimentally by heathershaw 1982 and theoretically by davies 1982a b however davies perturbation solution breaks down when the size of ripples becomes large later the deficiency of davies solution was fixed by mei 1985 by using the multiscale perturbation miles 1998 derived a solution in the form of an expansion which is also valid at resonance both solutions of mei 1985 and miles 1998 agree well with the measurements of heathershaw 1982 and davies and heathershaw 1984 up to date these early studies have triggered a number of papers on bragg resonance caused by sinusoidal ripples such as kirby 1988 guazzelli et al 1992 and ardhuin and magne 2007 it is now widely recognized that bragg resonance can be not only used to explain the formation of multiple longshore sandbars on gently sloping and erodible beaches yu and mei 2000 hanes et al 2001 dronkers 2017 but also provides a mechanism of coastal protection by a finite array of artificial bars jeon and cho 2006 wang et al 2006 liu et al 2015a b the concept of artificial bars was originally proposed by mei et al 1988 in general artificial bars are parallel to the shoreline and have small sizes with low bar heights so they have the merits of not affecting coastal visual aesthetics allowing water circulation and fish passage and not interfering with navigation particularly when the bar spacing is about half of the surface wavelength bragg resonance occurs and a large portion of waves at frequencies within resonance bands may be reflected back to the sea however unlike x rays which are non mechanical waves water waves are mechanical so that their motion depends upon the propagation medium i e the water body thus their propagation velocity depends not only upon both the bar spacing and the incident wavelength but also upon the water depth which involves the bar height width and configuration it is noted that in bragg s law only the dimensionless bar spacing with respect to the incident wavelength is involved this tells us that bragg s law employed from crystallography is too simple to be accurate to describe the bragg resonance in water wave scattering indeed the peak phase of the primary bragg resonance caused by periodic bars always occurs at a frequency lower than that predicted by bragg s law see kirby and anton 1990 hsu et al 2002 chang and liou 2007 liu et al 2015a b and liu et al 2016 besides the water scattering by finite periodic structures the existence of water waves over an infinite array of periodic structures has been also extensively studied by employing bloch band theory joannopoulos et al 1995 see an and ye 2004 huang et al 2005 tang et al 2006 and zhang et al 2012 for two dimensional structures and chou 1998 mciver 2001 chen et al 2004 jeong et al 2004 and yang et al 2016 for three dimensional structures it has been shown that water waves over infinite periodic structures can produce many interesting phenomena such as bloch waves over a periodically drilled bottom torres et al 1999 superlensings due to negative refraction hu et al 2004 refractions hu and chan 2005 self collimations shen et al 2005a band gaps hu et al 2003b shen et al 2005b complete band gaps hu et al 2003a negative effective gravities in water waves hu et al 2011 2013 and topological phenomena of water waves yang et al 2016 among them the most significant phenomenon is the band gap forbidden band or stop band firstly according to the bloch band theory any surface wave propagating over infinite periodic structures will be modulated into a bloch wave that is it can be expressed into a product of a plane wave and a periodic function which has the same periodicity of the periodic structures secondly the propagation of bloch waves is characterized by their band structures between pass bands or allowed bands there are some band gaps within which bloch waves cannot exist the two problems above are different in mathematics the resonance behavior associated with wave scattering by finite periodic seabeds is a boundary value problem and the existence of bloch waves over a periodic bed of infinite extent is an eigenvalue problem however it is very interesting that these two problems are very closely related as pointed out by porter and porter 2003 p 162 lines 7 10 bragg resonance bands caused by a finite periodic array correspond to those band gaps caused by the corresponding infinite counterpart also as pointed out by linton 2011 p 505 lines 16 18 from the bottom if an infinite periodic array has a band gap then one would expect that this would lead to bragg resonance when a plane wave is incident on any corresponding finite counterpart at a frequency within such a band gap as a result the bragg resonance frequency of water waves over finite periodic structures can be determined by checking the band gap of bloch waves over infinite periodic structures hopefully this may lead to a new method which is more accurate than the simple and rough bragg s law however it is worth indicating that due to the difficulty in solving wave equations analytically most of the previous studies on bloch band structure over an infinite array are limited to vertical structures with piecewise constant depths such as rectangular steps an and ye 2004 huang et al 2005 rectangular trenches huang et al 2005 water piercing cylinders hu et al 2004 jeong et al 2004 drilled cylindrical holes torres et al 1999 shen et al 2005a b and submerged cylinders chen et al 2004 except for a few periodic structures with continuous depth variation such as sinusoidal ripples porter and porter 2003 submerged horizontal circular cylinders in deep water linton 2011 and trapezoidal and triangular bars liu 2017 in this paper we study the band structure of shallow water waves over infinite periodic parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars where the water depth in the bar region varies continuously analytical solutions in closed forms of the band expression for both the parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars are derived based on the two analytical band expressions for a fixed dimensionless bar height a gap map as a bivariate function of both the dimensionless bar width and spacing is presented and the influences of the dimensionless bar height width and spacing on band gaps are analyzed 2 band structure of bloch waves over parabolic bars 2 1 the band expression we first study an infinite array of parabolic bars which are parallel with each other and located at a horizontal bed see fig 1 where h 0 is the global water depth b is the bar height w is the bar width and d is the spacing between two adjacent bars which is also the period of the seabed profile according to the bloch theorem surface waves over an infinite array of parabolic bars will exhibit the bloch state so that the wave elevation η x can be expressed as the product of a periodic function u x and a plane wave e i k x as follows 1 η x u x e i k x where k is the bloch wave number and u x has the same periodicity d of the bottom undulation i e u x d u x it is clear that by using the bloch theorem the study of the wave propagation over an infinite periodic bottom can be simplified into the study within one period specifically by using eq 1 we only need to find out the expression of η x within one period d w 2 w 2 for convenience we divide the interval d w 2 w 2 into three subintervals i 1 d w 2 w 2 i 2 w 2 0 and i 3 0 w 2 in addition we denote i 4 w 2 d w 2 see fig 1 suppose that the angular frequency of the waves over the parabolic bars is ω according to the linear shallow water wave theory mei 1989 the surface elevation η x satisfies the shallow water wave equation as follows 2 h x η x h x η x ω 2 g η x 0 where h x is the water depth and g the gravitational acceleration for x i 1 where the water depth is constant h 0 eq 2 degenerates into the helmholtz equation and its general solution to eq 2 is trivial as follows 3 η x a 1 e i k 0 x w 2 a 2 e i k 0 x w 2 where i 1 is the imaginary unit k 0 ω g h 0 is the wavenumber related to the water depth h 0 and a 1 and a 2 are constants to be determined for x i 2 the water depth is variable as follows 4 h x h 0 b 4 b w 2 x 2 according to liu et al 2015b the general solution to eq 2 is 5 η x a 3 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 p 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 a 4 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 q 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 where r 1 b 4 b w 2 μ μ b k 0 w 1 2 1 k 0 w 2 b with dimensionless quantities b b h 0 w w h 0 k 0 k 0 h 0 and p 1 2 μ t and q 1 2 μ t are the associated legendre functions of the first kind and the second kind respectively while a 3 and a 4 are constants to be determined for x i 3 according to liu et al 2015b the general solution to eq 2 is 6 η x a 5 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 p 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 a 6 r r x 2 h 0 2 1 4 q 1 2 μ x h 0 r x 2 h 0 2 where a 5 and a 6 are constants to be determined in the interval i 4 w 2 d w 2 according to the bloch theorem 1 η x can be expressed as 7 η x b x e i k x a 1 e i k 0 x h 0 d w 2 a 2 e i k 0 x h 0 d w 2 e i k d where d d h 0 is the dimensionless spacing with respect to the water depth h 0 to determine all the coefficients a j j 1 6 matching conditions must be applied at x w 2 0 and w 2 which lead to the following system 8 g a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 t 0 where g is a matrix defined as eq 9 given in box i where 10 α p α p b k 0 w 1 b 1 4 p 1 2 μ b 11 α q α q b k 0 w 1 b 1 4 q 1 2 μ b 12 β p β p b k 0 w 1 2 μ 1 b 1 4 b k 0 w p 3 2 μ b 13 β q β q b k 0 w 1 2 μ 1 b 1 4 b k 0 w q 3 2 μ b 14 γ p γ p b k 0 w 2 p 1 2 μ 0 p 1 2 μ 0 15 γ q γ q b k 0 w 2 q 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 16 γ p q γ p q b k 0 w p 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 p 1 2 μ 0 q 1 2 μ 0 it is clear that the bloch wave with nonzero amplitude exists if and only if a 1 a 6 t is a nonzero vector while eq 9 shows that a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero vector a 1 a 6 t is that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero which leads to the following closed form band expression or dispersion relationship 17 cos k d 1 2 k 0 w b 1 b γ 1 2 μ γ 1 2 μ 2 e 2 i μ π γ p α q β q γ q α p β p α p β q α q β p γ p q cos k 0 d k 0 w 1 2 γ p β q 2 α q 2 1 2 γ q β p 2 α p 2 γ p q β p β q α p α q sin k 0 d k 0 w where the identity 18 p 1 2 μ x q 1 2 μ x p 1 2 μ x q 1 2 μ x 1 1 x 2 γ 1 2 μ γ 1 2 μ e i μ π is used it can be seen from eq 17 that the band expression cos k d totally depends upon three composite dimensionless quantities b k 0 w π 2 w λ and k 0 d π 2 d λ although it is involved with four independent dimensionless quantities b w d and k 0 where λ is the wavelength of incident waves over the water depth h 0 based on the analytical band expression 17 the band gap if it exists with cos k d 1 can be immediately found out and then we know that those waves at frequencies within the band gap cannot exist over infinite periodic parabolic bars for example the bloch band structure over parabolic bars with b 0 375 w 5 π 2 and d 5 π is calculated and the band gap is shown in fig 2 a b which shows that those waves in the range of 0 17323 k 0 0 19600 cannot exist over the infinite parabolic bars in addition if we rearrange infinite periodic bars with b 0 5 w 12 5 and d 25 then there exist two band gaps i 1 0 10201 0 12178 and i 2 0 21835 0 23052 see fig 2 c d thus those waves with k 0 i 1 i 2 cannot exist over these new infinite bars 2 2 relationship between bragg resonance and bloch band gap as we mentioned in the introduction the bragg resonance associated with wave scattering by a finite array of periodic structures and the existence of bloch waves over an infinite array are very closely related in this subsection we show this relationship for a finite and an infinite array of parabolic bars for b 0 375 w 5 π 2 d 5 π and n 2 4 8 16 32 64 all the wave reflection coefficients against k 0 d π 2 d λ for 0 05 k 0 d π 1 5708 which is just in the range of shallow water waves are calculated by using the analytical model based on the shallow water equation liu et al 2015b and the computational results together with the band gap of bloch waves i e the red interval over the infinite array of bars are shown in fig 3 a f it is shown that for n 2 4 8 16 32 64 bragg resonant reflection occurs at k 0 d π 0 95741 0 93206 0 92699 0 92699 0 92446 0 92446 respectively as we can see the midpoint of bloch band gap i e k 0 d π 0 923075 coincides quite well with these six resonance phases which is much more accurate than the prediction of k 0 d π 1 given by bragg s law in addition with increasing the bar number n not only the peak phase of the bragg resonance approaches to the midpoint of bloch band gap but the bragg resonance band also approaches to the bloch band gap this implies that the study of the bragg resonance condition by a finite array of bars can be transferred into the study of the band gap of bloch waves over an infinite array of bars the latter is hopefully much more accurate than bragg s law 2 3 influence of the bar height on band gaps at first we investigate the influence of the dimensionless bar height b on band gaps let w 12 5 and d 25 and b 0 125 0 25 0 375 0 5 and 0 625 the band expression cos k d is calculated by using eq 17 and the results are shown in fig 4 a e as expected with increasing the dimensionless bar height the first and the second band gaps become wider and wider from 0 12101 0 12494 and 0 24428 0 24664 in fig 4 a to 0 09353 0 12023 and 0 20738 0 22151 in fig 4 e respectively to see the full view of the influence of the dimensionless bar height on the band gap following hu et al 2003a b we plot a gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and b which is shown in fig 4 f where the red patch represents the band gap with cos k d 1 and the blue patch represents the pass band with cos k d 1 as we can see from the gap map when b further increases from 0 65 not only the width of the band gap increases but the number of band gaps also increases actually the number of band gaps becomes three for 0 65 b 0 95 and even four for b 0 95 this means that surface waves within a broader frequency range can be completely blocked by an infinite array of higher parabolic bars due to stronger bragg scattering effect 2 4 influence of the bar width on band gaps for a given dimensionless bar height b and a given dimensionless bar distance d we investigate the influence of the dimensionless bar width w on band gaps first for fixed b 0 5 and d 16 five values of w are considered i e w 5 7 9 11 13 the corresponding cos k d is calculated against k 0 for k 0 ranging from 0 to 0 31416 by using eq 17 and the computational results are shown in fig 5 a e it is shown that when w increases from 5 to 9 the unique band gap changes from 0 16906 0 19411 with the width being 0 02505 to 0 15654 0 18890 with the width being 0 03236 however when w further increases from 9 to 13 the unique band gap changes to 0 15027 0 17741 with the width being 0 02714 this means that when w takes some particular value near w 9 the width of the unique band gap will achieve its maximal value the gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w presented in fig 5 f clearly shows that there is a unique band gap in the range 0 146 k 0 0 197 and the width of this band gap is influenced by the bar width second for b 0 5 and d 20 five values of the dimensionless bar width are considered i e w 3 6 9 12 15 the computational results of cos k d are shown in fig 6 a e similarly when the dimensionless bar width w increases from 3 to 12 the band gap 1 changes from 0 14505 0 15654 with the width being 0 01149 to 0 12418 0 14923 with the width being 0 02505 however when the dimensionless bar width w further increases from 12 to 15 the band gap 1 changes to 0 12104 0 14401 with the width being 0 02297 in addition when the dimensionless bar width increases from 3 to 6 the band gap 2 changes from 0 29224 0 31312 with the width being 0 02088 to 0 27971 0 30581 with the width being 0 02610 however when the dimensionless bar width w further increases from 6 to 15 the band gap 2 changes to 0 26405 0 26719 with the width being 0 00314 the gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w presented in fig 6 f shows that there exist two band gaps one is in the range 0 118 k 0 0 157 and the other is in the range 0 249 k 0 0 314 the gap map helps us to see the full view of the influence of the bar width on the two band gaps 2 5 influence of the dimensionless bar spacing on band gaps it is noted that eq 17 tells us that cos k d is not a standard periodic function of k 0 but is a periodic oscillation function of k 0 with the oscillation period being 2 π d w the larger the difference between the dimensionless bar spacing and width the higher the oscillation frequency is predicted for example if we take b 0 5 w π and let d w take three values 11 π 21 π 31 π i e d takes five values 12 π 22 π 32 π then the corresponding oscillation periods of cos k d are approximately 2 11 2 21 and 2 31 respectively hence cos k d oscillates more and more frequently as a result when d w increases more and more band gaps are produced though the width of those band gaps becomes thinner and thinner see fig 7 a c the full view of the influence of d on band gaps can be seen in fig 7 d which looks like the path of the stars in somehow 2 6 gap maps for shallow water waves over parabolic bars in this subsection for any given value of the dimensionless bar height b we investigate the range of possible values of k 0 d and k 0 w to form band gaps of bloch waves we take six values of the dimensionless bar height b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 for each of these six values the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 d π and k 0 w π is plotted for both k 0 d π and k 0 w π ranging from 0 001 to 4 these six gap maps are shown in fig 8 a f they consist of several red patches in which each red patch corresponds to one band gap which can be obtained by cutting the red patch by a horizontal line it is noted that w d hence the domain of definition k 0 d π k 0 w π of the function cos k d is the region 0 k 0 w π k 0 d π rather than the entire first quadrant 0 k 0 w π and 0 k 0 d π firstly as shown in fig 8 a f when b and k 0 w π are fixed band gaps occur periodically with the period being unit with respect to k 0 d π this periodicity can be deduced from the right hand side of the band expression 17 which is a linear combination of two periodic functions sin k 0 d k 0 w and cos k 0 d k 0 w due to this periodicity we need only consider a single period 0 k 0 d π 1 which together with 0 w d yields that 0 k 0 w π k 0 d π 1 secondly as we can see in fig 8 a f with increasing the dimensionless bar height b not only the total number of the band gaps i e the red patches but also the width of each band gap i e the secant cut from each red patch by any horizontal line increases thirdly each red patch in the gap map in fig 8 a f takes an olive shape which is small at both ends but large in the middle this means that the band gap cut by a horizontal line from each red patch achieves its maximal width when k 0 w π takes some particular value see band gap ef in fig 8 f for example hence in each red patch there exists an optimal dimensionless bar width to produce a band gap with the widest width fourthly for bloch shallow water waves over an infinite array of parabolic bars all band gaps occur when k 0 d π 1 rather than exactly at k 0 d π 1 accordingly this means that for wave scattering by a finite array of parabolic bars bragg resonance actually occurs when k 0 d π 1 rather than exactly at k 0 d π 1 as predicted by bragg s law this phenomenon was called phase shift phase downshift or phase downward shift and reported by mattioli 1990 belzons et al 1991 guazzelli et al 1992 rey et al 1992 liu and yue 1998 madsen et al 2006 ardhuin and magne 2007 and liu et al 2019 for wave scattering by sinusoidal ripples and also reported by kirby and anton 1990 hsu et al 2002 chang and liou 2007 and liu et al 2015a b for wave scattering by artificial bars the occurrence mechanism of this downshift phenomenon was attributed to evanescent wave modes guazzelli et al 1992 surface nonlinearity and nonlinear effects associated with the bottom variations liu and yue 1998 and the decline in the phase velocity of reflected waves due to the presence of bars chang and liou 2007 however up to date the changing rule of the phase downshift has not been understood and all the previous conclusions are just at the qualitative stage more than the quantitative stage here the gap maps presented in fig 8 a f visually reveal the quantitative influence of the dimensionless bar height width and spacing on the bloch band gaps thus equivalently reveal the influence of these three bar parameters on the peak phase of bragg resonance in wave scattering by finite parabolic bars actually as shown in fig 8 a f with increasing b or k 0 w each red patch deviates farther and farther away from the bragg s law k 0 d π 1 this is equivalent to that with increasing b or k 0 w the phase downshift of bragg resonance in wave scattering by a finite array of bars becomes larger and larger in other words the error caused from bragg s law becomes severer and severer this quantitative conclusion coincides with chang and liou s 2007 qualitative conclusion it is worth emphasizing that based on the band gaps in fig 8 a f we can precisely predict the peak phase of bragg resonant reflection for example for b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 we can see that the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 12 15 k 0 d π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 5 i e the shallow water wave range 0 k 0 π 10 and the gap map corresponding to b 0 6 i e fig 8 e is the secant ac we now seek a point on the secant ac such that this point is exactly in the middle of the band gap cut from the gap map by the horizontal line that goes through this point by checking the gap map this point is located at e 0 8 0 64 and the band gap is the interval 0 685 0 915 see fig 9 a because the band gap is known we can predict that bragg resonance by finite parabolic bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 will occur at k 0 d π 0 8 and the limit resonance band for large bar size n is also 0 685 0 915 to confirm our prediction for n 8 16 32 the reflection coefficients are calculated by using the analytical model liu et al 2015b and the results are shown in fig 9 b d as we expected the bragg resonant reflections occur at k 0 d π 0 78977 0 78977 0 79724 respectively which are really very close to k 0 d π 0 8 and with increasing the bar number n the resonance band approaches the band gap 0 685 0 915 the success of this precise prediction reflects the superiority of the gap map over bragg s law 3 band structure of bloch waves over rectified cosinoidal bars in this section we consider bloch waves over an infinite array of submerged periodic rectified cosinoidal bars as shown in fig 10 where the water depth is defined as follows 19 h x h 0 1 b cos π x w x i 2 i 3 h 0 x i 1 i 4 in which i 1 d w 2 w 2 i 2 w 2 0 i 3 0 w 2 and i 4 w 2 d w 2 3 1 the band expression similar to the case of parabolic bars we have 20 η x c 1 e i k 0 x w 2 c 2 e i k 0 x w 2 x i 1 c 1 e i k 0 x d w 2 c 2 e i k 0 x d w 2 e i k d x i 4 where c 1 and c 2 are constants to be determined for x i 2 eq 2 becomes 21 1 b cos π x w d 2 η x d x 2 b π w sin π x w d η x d x k 0 2 η x 0 following liu et al 2015a by introducing the following transforms 22 τ τ x b 1 cos π x w 1 b cos π x w x w π arccos τ b b τ 1 and denoting 23 η x η w π arccos τ b b τ 1 η τ the physical domain of interest i 2 is now mapped into 0 τ b and eq 21 becomes 24 d 2 η d τ 2 1 2 τ 0 τ 1 1 2 τ 2 b 1 b d η d τ k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b τ τ 1 τ 2 b 1 b η 0 0 τ b which is a canonical form of heun s general equation arscott 1995 with the singular points being located at τ 0 2 b 1 b 1 and the general solution to eq 24 can be written in a closed form as follows 25 η τ c 3 h 1 τ c 4 h 2 τ where c 3 and c 4 are constants to be determined and 26 h 1 τ heung 2 b 1 b k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b 0 0 1 2 0 τ m 0 a m τ m 27 h 2 τ τ heung 2 b 1 b 1 4 k 0 w 2 π 2 1 b 1 2 1 2 3 2 0 τ τ m 0 b m τ m where the coefficients a i and b i are determined by the following recursive formulas 28 a 0 1 29 a 1 k 0 w 2 π 2 b 30 a m m 1 3 b m m 4 b 1 k 0 w 2 π 2 m 2 m 1 b a m 1 1 b m 2 2 m 2 m 1 b a m 2 m 2 3 and 31 b 0 1 32 b 1 π 2 1 b 4 k 0 w 2 12 π 2 b 33 b m m 1 2 m 1 3 b 5 2 b 1 2 k 0 w 2 π 2 m 2 m 1 b b m 1 1 b m 3 2 2 m 2 m 1 b b m 2 m 2 3 as we can see the heun general function heung a q α β γ δ τ is a frobenius series centered at the regular singular point τ 0 associated with the index c 0 according to frobenius theory heung a q α β γ δ τ and its derivatives converge for all complex τ in the complex disk τ min a 1 hence the two heun general functions in eqs 26 and 27 and their derivatives converge in the complex disk τ 2 b 1 b which includes the mapped interval of interest 0 τ b as its subdomain it is good that in practical calculation heung a q α β γ δ τ can be directly invoked in the software maple 2015 thus we can ignore the two recursive formulas finally by returning to the original variable we have 34 η x η τ x c 3 h 1 τ x c 4 h 2 τ x x i 2 similarly for x i 3 the surface elevation of water waves can be expressed as 35 η x c 5 h 1 τ x c 6 h 2 τ x x i 3 where c 5 and c 6 are constants to be determined at the common boundaries x w 2 0 and w 2 matching conditions must be satisfied which lead to the following system 36 c 1 c 2 h 1 b c 3 h 2 b c 4 i c 1 i c 2 ν h 1 b c 3 ν h 2 b c 4 c 3 c 5 c 4 c 6 e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 1 e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 2 h 1 b c 5 h 2 b c 6 i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 1 i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w c 2 ν h 1 b c 5 ν h 2 b c 6 where ν ν b k 0 w π b 1 b k 0 w clearly this system can be simplified and rewritten into the following matrix form 37 1 1 h 1 b h 2 b i i ν h 1 b ν h 2 b e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w h 1 b h 2 b i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w i e i k d i k 0 d k 0 w ν h 1 b ν h 2 b c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 0 since the bloch wave with nonzero amplitude exists if and only if c 1 c 4 t is not a zero vector while eq 37 tells us that a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of a nonzero vector c 1 c 4 t is that the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero which leads to the following closed form band expression of band structures 38 cos k d h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b cos k 0 d k 0 w ν h 1 b h 2 b 1 ν h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b sin k 0 d k 0 w it is noted that all the quantities ν h 1 b h 2 b h 1 b h 2 b are bivariate functions of b and k 0 w meaning that the above band expression of bloch waves over an infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars totally depends upon three independent dimensionless quantities b k 0 d and k 0 w 3 2 relationship between bragg resonance and bloch band gap again in this subsection we show the relationship between bragg resonance by a finite array of rectified cosinoidal bars and bloch band gap by an infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars for b 0 5 w 12 5 d 15 and n 2 4 8 16 32 64 all the wave reflection coefficients against k 0 d π for 0 000796 k 0 d π 1 5 i e 0 0001 k 0 0 31415926 which is in the range of shallow water waves are calculated by using the analytical model based on the shallow water equation liu et al 2015a and the computational results together with the band gap of bloch waves i e the red interval over the infinite array of rectified cosinoidal bars are shown in fig 11 a f it is shown that for n 2 4 8 16 32 64 the unique bragg resonance occurs at k 0 d π 0 79522 0 82521 0 83521 0 83521 0 83521 0 83521 respectively as we can see the midpoint of bloch band gap 0 76523 0 91019 i e k 0 d π 0 83771 coincides quite well with the six resonance phases which is much more accurate than the prediction of k 0 d π 1 given by bragg s law in addition similar to the case of parabolic bars with increasing the number n of the rectified cosinoidal bars not only the peak phase of the bragg resonance approaches to the midpoint of bloch band gap but the bragg resonance band also exactly overlaps with the bloch band gap 3 3 influence of the bar height width and spacing on band gaps first same to the values of w and d chosen in fig 4 f for parabolic bars the dimensionless bar width and spacing of the rectified cosinoidal bars are also taken to be w 12 5 and d 25 the corresponding gap map as a function of k 0 and b is shown in fig 12 a which is quite similar to the gap map in fig 4 f with a little bit difference near b 1 it is shown again that with increasing the dimensionless bar height b not only the width of the band gap increases but the number of band gaps may also increases see fig 12 a for b 0 7 second for convenience of comparison with the gap map for parabolic bars presented in fig 5 f the values of the dimensionless bar height and spacing of the rectified cosinoidal bars are also taken to be b 0 5 and d 16 the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w for w varying from 0 001 to 16 is plotted and the result is shown in fig 12 b it can be seen that there is almost no difference about the pattern and size of the two gap maps in fig 5 f and in fig 12 b when w increases from 1 to 9 the width of the unique band gap increases however when w further increases from 9 to 16 the width of the unique band gap conversely decreases where the widest band gap when w 9 is the interval 0 15818 0 18958 this property tells us that there exist an optimal bar width to produce the widest band gap third following what we have done in fig 6 f here we also take b 0 5 and d 20 the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and w for w varying from 0 001 to 20 is plotted and the result is shown in fig 12 c it can be seen that for this case there are two band gaps respectively in the ranges of 0 117 k 0 0 158 and 0 252 k 0 0 31416 when w increases from 0 001 to 12 the width of the first band gap increases however when w further increases the width of the first band gap conversely decreases where the widest band gap when w 12 is the interval 0 12572 0 15085 in addition the second band gap is widest at w 5 5 which is the interval 0 28171 0 30892 fourth the corresponding gap map as a bivariate function of k 0 and d for d varying from 1 to 44 is shown in fig 12 d where b 0 5 and w π which are same to the evaluations of b and w in fig 7 f it can be seen that fig 12 d is almost identical with fig 7 f 3 4 gap maps for waves over rectified cosinoidal bars in this subsection similar to what we have done in fig 8 six gap maps of shallow water waves over rectified cosinoidal bars related to b 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 are also plotted for both k 0 d π and k 0 w π ranging from 0 001 to 4 these six gap maps are shown in fig 13 a f on one hand the gap maps in fig 13 and those in fig 8 with same b look quite similar due to the similar configurations of both parabolic bars and rectified cosinoidal bars although they are slightly different on the other hand both the gap maps in figs 8 and 13 are quite different from the gap maps in figures 3 7 in liu 2017 for shallow water waves over trapezoidal bars due to the evident difference of the bar configurations especially this difference for those cases with w t 0 99 w b are much more significant see figures 3 d 4 d 5 d 6 d and 7 d in liu 2017 since those trapezoidal bars nearly degenerate into rectangular bars under the condition of w t 0 99 w b where w b and w t are respectively the dimensionless widths of the bottom and of the top plane of the trapezoidal bars in addition a significant difference between any of the gap maps in fig 8 or fig 13 and its counterpart in figure 9 in liu 2017 with same b for shallow water waves over triangular bars can be also observed to show the slight difference between the two gap maps in fig 8 e and in fig 13 e we also use the gap map in fig 13 e to predict the peak phase of bragg resonance by finite rectified cosinoidal bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 first the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 12 15 k 0 d π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 5 and the gap map in fig 13 e is the secant fg see fig 14 a second the point h 0 808 0 6464 on the secant fg is in the middle of the band gap 0 692 0 924 which is cut from the gap map in fig 14 a by the horizontal line k 0 w π 0 6464 we thus predict that bragg resonance by finite rectified cosinoidal bars with b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 will occur at k 0 d π 0 808 and the limit resonance band for large bar size n is also 0 692 0 924 for n 8 16 32 the corresponding reflection coefficients are calculated by using the analytical model liu et al 2015a and the results are shown in fig 14 b d which show that the bragg resonances do occur at k 0 d π 0 79146 0 79884 0 80130 respectively very close to our prediction k 0 d π 0 808 and with increasing the bar size n the resonance band does approach the band gap 0 692 0 924 4 comparison between the reflection effects by two types of bars as shown in sections 2 6 and 3 4 under the bar conditions b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 the band gap produced by infinite parabolic bars is k 0 d π 0 685 0 915 i e k 0 0 143466 0 191637 and the band gap produced by infinite rectified cosinoidal bars is k 0 d π 0 692 0 924 i e k 0 0 144932 0 193522 it is clear that the difference between these two band gaps is quite small in addition under the same dimensionless bar conditions b 0 6 w 12 and d 15 the peak value of bragg resonance produced by 8 arrays of parabolic bars is 0 99458 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 65520 0 92434 i e k 0 0 137225 0 193593 see fig 9 b and the peak value of bragg resonance produced by 8 arrays of rectified cosinoidal bars is 0 99477 the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 66353 0 93907 i e k 0 0 138969 0 196678 see fig 14 b again the difference between the two peak values of bragg resonance or the two bragg resonance bands is also quite small for a further confirmation we change the bar conditions into b 0 6 w 8 and d 10 it is noted that we still have w d 0 8 the intersection of a shorter line segment k 0 w π 0 8 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 1 and the gap map in fig 9 a is still the secant ac hence the band gap produced by infinite parabolic bars is still k 0 d π 0 685 0 915 i e k 0 4 303981 5 749114 similarly the band gap produced by infinite rectified cosinoidal bars is still k 0 d π 0 692 0 924 i e k 0 4 347964 5 805663 on the other hand the reflection coefficients by 8 arrays of two types of bars are calculated by using analytical models liu et al 2015a b and the results are shown in fig 15 a and b respectively it is shown that the peak value of bragg resonance produced by parabolic bars is 0 99458 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 65610 0 93022 i e k 0 0 206120 0 292237 see fig 15 a the peak value of bragg resonance produced by rectified cosinoidal bars is 0 99477 and the bragg resonance band is k 0 d π 0 66607 0 94019 i e k 0 0 209252 0 295369 see fig 15 b these comparisons still show that the reflection effects produced by the two types of bars are almost identical it is worth indicating that if the bar width or the bar spacing is quite small for example w 3 and d 5 then the intersection of the line segment k 0 w π 3 5 k 0 d π with k 0 d π 0 0 5 i e the long wave range 0 k 0 π 10 and the gap map in fig 9 a or fig 14 a is an empty set hence there is neither bloch band gap nor bragg resonance in the shallow water wave range 5 conclusion the band expression of bloch shallow water waves over infinite periodic parabolic bars is derived firstly which is in a closed form in terms of the associated legendre functions secondly the band expression of bloch shallow water waves over infinite periodic rectified cosinoidal bars is also derived which is in a closed form involving with the heun general function it is shown that the two band expressions depend upon three bar parameters which are the dimensionless bar height with respect to water depth the dimensionless bar width and spacing with respect to incident wavelength when the dimensionless bar height is fixed the gap map as a bivariate function of the dimensionless bar width and spacing can be obtained which consists of many periodic olive patterns when both the dimensionless bar height and width are fixed band gaps cut from the gap map by horizontal lines occur periodically when the dimensionless bar height is fixed there exists a particular dimensionless bar width corresponding to the widest band gap it is shown that not only the gap map can be used to quantitatively explain the phase downshift of bragg resonance but can also be used to predict the peak phase of resonance the latter is much more accurate than that predicted by bragg s law in addition it is found that the bragg resonances and the resonance bands produced by the two types of bars with same geometrical parameters are almost identical acknowledgments this work is supported by

22536,a multiphase cavitation solver which is capable of dealing with multiple phase change processes is developed based on openfoam platform the solver is first applied to a high speed projectile near the free surface good agreement is observed for the free surface elevation and the cavitation development process with the experimental data then simulations are carried out for a newly designed surface piercing body which is composed of a cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater axisymmetric body the flow field and hydrodynamics is investigated for the vertical surface piercing hydrofoil with different wet depth and inflow vapor cavitation number the wave patterns downstream of the hydrofoil and the splash jet shape on the hydrofoil surface are obtained furthermore the interaction between phases and the hydrodynamic curves are analyzed in detail finally the combined body effect on the free surface elevation and the hydrofoil dynamics is investigated the obtained result gives valuable insight into the optimum design for the surface piercing body keywords free surface cavitation multiphase solver openfoam 1 introduction supercavitation which has been successfully applied for underwater torpedoes and projectiles to reduce drag dramatically has shown great potential for high speed surface vehicles such as ghost ship proposed by juliet marine company which used a dual pontoon supercavitating hull to achieve high speed cavitation has also been frequently encountered in the other near free surface components such as surface piercing hydrofoils brizzolara 2015 and supercaviting propellers however the dynamic mechanism of near free surface cavitation is significantly different from that of supercavitation in unbounded environment which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects 1 the coupling of the cavity interface evolution with the free surface wave will result in the variation of the cavity shedding and the stability mechanisms 2 the air above the free interface could be entrained into the cavity forming a multi component multiphase flow affecting the mass and energy transfer along the gas liquid interface therefore it is urgent to carry out research on the dynamic mechanism of near free surface cavitating flows most cavitation experiments were carried out in high speed water tunnels and towing pool ji et al 2019 however the model size and the flow speed is limited in comparison with the aerodynamic equipment it is a difficulty for doing experiments on cavitating flows near the free surface and only a few research was reported dawson 1959 studied the cavitating flow of the wedge shaped hydrofoil near the free interface and obtained the variation law of cavity shape and hydrodynamics with attack angle cavitation number froude number and immersion depth it concluded that air is easily trapped into the vacuole to form supercavitation when near the free interface harwood et al 2016 performed a series of towing tank experiments on a vertically cantilevered hydrofoil with an immersed free tip under low to moderate froude and reynolds number conditions the air ventilation of the surface piercing hydrofoil is examined results suggest that the stability of different flow regions is related to the angle of the re entrant jet a set of criteria for identifying flow regimes and ventilation transition mechanisms are also presented in their work young et al 2017 pointed out that natural ventilation often happens when the flow around a body forms a cavity that is open to the free surface they reviewed the steady flow regimes hydrodynamic loads and unsteady transition mechanism of naturally ventilated flows and investigated the fundamental physics driving ventilation furthermore they also discussed the scaling relations and its implications on the design and interpretation of reduced scale studies kozlowska and steen 2017 performed an experimental test on the marine propellers working near the free surface in a large towing tank the focus was put on the boundary between vortex forming non vortex forming and the free surface ventilation of marine propellers conditions under which ventilation would happen and the actual physical mechanism of the ventilation were discussed in the article wei et al 2011 wang et al 2016 2017 developed a high speed ejection device and carried out experiments for cavitating cylindrical projectiles at different depths in the water the mutual interference between the projectile cavitation and the free surface has been analyzed xu et al 2018 carried out a launch experiment of axisymmetric projectiles with various headforms the upper side of the projectile coincides with the free surface causing a stable supercavity around the projectiles supercavity formation mechanism gas entrainment phenomena and the drag reduction efficiency are carefully examined in their study results indicate that the near free surface supercavitation might be a new efficient approach for high speed cruising in the future in terms of numerical simulation initially most research was implemented based on the potential theory faltinsen semenov 2008 proposed a nonlinear analytical solution of the cavitating flow beneath the free surface which employed an improved cavity wake model simulation has been carried out in a wide range of depths of submergence and froude numbers it was concluded that both the free surface and the gravitational field resulted in a shortened cavitation length the hydrofoil lift coefficient was inversely proportional to the immersion depth and proportional to the froude number bal 2007b a used the interactive boundary element method ibem to predict the wave pattern and hydrodynamic coefficients of surface piercing hydrofoils the effects of froude number on wave pattern as well as lift and drag values of a rectangular cavitating hydrofoil are discussed young and savander 2011 developed a fast potential based boundary element method bem to analyze the performance of the large scale surface piercing propellers the results turned out to compare well with rans predictions besides the finite element method was coupled with the bem to resolve the hydroelastic of the propeller recently numerical methods based on the navier stokes equations and multiphase modes are quickly developed which have shown a great advantage in viscosity consideration and turbulence prediction for cavitating flows several cavitation models have been proposed to describe the thermodynamic process between liquid and vapor among which the transport equation based models tem were most commonly used merkle 1998 kunz et al 2003 singhal et al 2002 wei et al 2011 wang et al 2016 2017 coupled vof model zwart cavitation model and les turbulence model together to simulate the unsteady cavitation evolution for two kinds of elongated cylinder below free surface based on fluent platform the generation development and collapse process for the cavity on the cylinder surface was carefully investigated it indicated that when the cavity is too close to the free surface so that the air is entrained inside the cavity it will increase the cavity size and increase its stability jin et al 2013 established a multiphase flow simulation program based on the mixture multiphase model and the merkle cavitation model simulation has been carried out for the ventilating naca0012 hydrofoil near the free surface obtaining the variation of the free interface height with the ventilation rate brizzolara and villa 2012 designed a new supercavitating cross media hydrofoil for the high speed swath configuration of the surface vehicle and analyze the flow field structure near the three dimensional hydrofoil based on star ccm the simple algorithm is combined with the amg linear solver to solve the momentum equation and the continuity equation wu and chen 2016 proposed a new numerical strategy for the simulation of cavitation flows near the free surface the cavity shape and free surface were updated iteratively during the numerical procedure which could achieve fast convergence the tested cases suggest that the proposed method is quite good in the computation of the free surface to analyze the attached cavity evolution and the re entrant jet behavior in detail cheng et al 2016 2018 long et al 2018a developed a 3 d lagrangian technology combining with the traditional eulerian viewpoint method on cfx platform it demonstrated that the 3 d lagrangian technology is a promising tool in the investigation of complex cavitating flows pelanti and shyue 2019 proposed a numerical model for multiphase liquid vapor gas flows with interfaces and cavitation the model includes stiff mechanical thermal relaxation source terms for all phases and chemical relaxation terms for liquid and vapour phases numerical results show the efficiency of the numerical method in modelling complex wave patterns shocks and interfaces in problems with thermal and mass transfer processes as the authors mentioned the extension of the model to more complex and general equations of state are still worth studying matveev et al 2019 adopted the star ccm solver to model the air ventilation phenomena on an inclined surface piercing hydrofoils numerical results showed that hydrodynamic characteristics of the inclined surface piercing hydrofoil were degraded at high attack angles and high froude numbers due to the air ventilation to overcome this a small fence was placed on the suction side of the hydrofoil near the nominal water level which turned out to be useful for suppressing both downward air ventilation and upward water spray zhou et al 2019 investigated the interaction between the natural and ventilated cavitation based on openfoam where a multiphase solver with phase change was used studies have shown that the interface sharpening factor directly affects the simulation of the multi component gas mixture and re entrained jet phenomena in conclusion cavitating flow near free surface involves complex phenomena such as interface fluctuation multi component gas mixing and entrainment high turbulence et al which introduces great difficulty in predicting this flow accurately in this paper a multiphase cavitation solver which couples various kinds of cavitation models and turbulence models is developed based on openfoam platform the solver uses an extendable multiphase framework which is capable of dealing with multiple phase change processes simultaneously the solver will be applied to the projectile below the surface to validate the numerical model then simulations will be carried out for a newly proposed surface vehicle which includes a cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater body the free surface effect on the sub bodies will be investigated in detail in order to give some insight into the design of the high speed surface vehicle 2 mathematical models 2 1 governing equations cavitating flow near free surface involves the interaction between different phases including the gas liquid and vapor in this paper mechanical and thermal equilibrium is assumed between different phases which mean that the phases share the same velocity pressure and temperature field considering there is a tiny temperature variation in the flow the energy equation is not solved in this paper the governing equations for the incompressible mixture are used as follows 1 ρ m t ρ m u 0 2 ρ m u t ρ m u u τ p f where ρ p and u represents the density pressure and velocity of the flow respectively the subscript m represent the mixture phase τ represents the newtonian viscous stress tensor f is the momentum source terms due to surface tension and gravity 3 f f σ ρ m g considering the mass transfer between different phases the continuity equation for each phase is given as 4 α l t α l u m ρ l α v t α v u m ρ v α g t α g u 0 the subscript l v g represent the liquid vapor and non condensable gas respectively m on the rhs of the equations donates the mass transfer rate per unit volume per second caused by cavitation between the liquid and vapor phase addition of all equations of eq 4 leads to the divergence of the velocity 5 u 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m adding and substracting a α u term to the rhs of eq 4 for each phase and utilizing eq 5 the final form of the volume fraction equations can be expressed as 6 α l t α l u α l u 1 ρ l α l 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α v t α v u α v u 1 ρ v α v 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α g t α g u α g u α g 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m given that the interface dispersion due to numerical diffusion might appear a good approach to limit or reverse this effect would be to include a diffusion operator into the phase fraction equation with a negative diffusion coefficient this approach would be conservative however it would also be unbounded and unstable a negative diffusion is always problematic an alternative method is to apply some kind of additional convection based term which compresses the interface maintains boundness and reduces to zero at least the integrated effect of it reduces to zero as the mesh is refined a counter gradient term which is clearly conservative and maintains boundedness has a general form of u r α β where α β stands for volume fraction of different phases and u r is the relative velocity between the two phases across the interface the final form of the volume fraction equations is given in eq 7 where the compressive term is active only within the interface region 7 α l t α l u i v g α l α i u l u i α l u 1 ρ l α l 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α v t α v u i l g α v α i u v u i α v u 1 ρ v α v 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α g t α g u i l v α g α i u g u i α g u α g 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m in this study the homogeneous multiphase model which adopts incompressible navier stokes equations and phases in the multiphase system share the velocity and pressure fields so the relative velocity term should be reconstructed here we just adopt the following form which is also used by some other multiphase solver in openfoam weller 2008 8 u r min c α u max u α α where c α is a compressive factor the expression max u returns the largest value of u anywhere in the domain actually the momentum equation is used to construct the velocity equation in openfoam an additional poisson s equation for the pressure is needed according to jasak 1996 and demirdžić et al 1993 the semi discretized form of the momentum equation could be written as 9 u h u a p 1 a p p where the h u term consists of two parts one is matrix coefficients for all neighbors multiplied by corresponding velocities and the other part is the source part including the source part of the transient term and all other source terms apart from the pressure gradient combining with the velocity divergence term in eq 5 the final form of the pressure equation is given as 10 h u a p 1 a p p 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m finally the p u coupling is solved by the pimple loop in the current study the volume fraction transport equation of the multiphase system is solved by an optimized mules tool kit damián 2013 lin et al 2018 2 2 schnerr sauer cavitation model cavitation model represents the mass transfer rate between gas and liquid in order to solve multiple phase change processes a new cavitation model framework is designed which employs a number of object oriented programming and openfoam library features such as the design pattern of runtime type identification and virtual function dispatch this approach allows the addition of new runtime selectable derived class implementations without any modification of the base class or application code the schnerr sauer cavitation model based on the transport equation is selected for the cavitating flow near the free surface the mass transfer rate is calculated by the following equation 11 m c c ρ v ρ l ρ α v 1 α v 3 r sgn p p v 2 3 p p v ρ l m c v ρ v ρ l ρ α v 1 α v 3 r sgn p p v 2 3 p p v ρ l where p v is the vaporization pressure r is the radius of a nucleation site and u is the free stream velocity c c and c v are the two empirical constants both values are 1 by default and s g n is the sign function 2 3 k ω sst turbulence model since cavitation is generally considered as a high reynolds number phenomenon it therefore experiences highly turbulent characteristic scales turbulence modeling plays a key role and must be addressed adequately in addition to the cavitation model in this study the k ω sst turbulence model which has better performance for boundary layer flow and cavitation flow with a reverse pressure gradient is employed the openfoam variant is based on the 2001 model menter and esch 2001 with updated coefficients from model 2003 menter et al 2003 the transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation ω are presented in the following equations 12 ρ m k t ρ m k u p k β ρ m ω k μ σ k μ t k 13 ρ m ω t ρ m ω u γ ρ m s 2 β ρ m ω 2 μ σ ω μ t ω 1 f 1 cd k ω where

where a 1 0 31 is a model constant s 2 s i j s i j is the invariant measure of strain rate with 16 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the expression of the blending function f is based on the closest distance

10 3 model validation in order to validate the numerical model simulations are firstly carried out for the underwater projectile which was investigated by wang et al 2016 the total length of the projectile is 246 mm the diameter is 37 mm and the conical angle is 90 the flow velocity is set as 17 8 m s and the initial distance between the free surface and the upper side of the projectile is 17 mm the free surface and cavity evolution process is used to compare with the experimental data aiming at reducing the amount of calculation half of the axisymmetric projectile is taken for simulation the total cell number of the computational mesh is about 4 million as shown in fig 1 fig 2 presents an iso surface for the solved cavity and free surface shape at moment of t 0 004s furthermore the free surface profile at t 0 004 s is compared with the experimental data wang et al 2016 where a maximum relative error of 3 is observed as shown in fig 3 furthermore the cavity length varying with time on the projectile is presented in fig 4 the resolution process can be divided into three stages including the developing stage where the cavity length increases rapidly the transition stage with a much slower expanding rate and the steady stage when the cavity length reaches a stable level in comparison with the experimental data the three stage was correctly predicted the cavity length at the developing stage and the steady stage agrees well with the experimental data while a relatively larger error is observed in the transition stage due to the cavity vibration in this stage it is validated that the solver is capable of dealing with the multiphase cavitating flows 4 case setup 4 1 geometry description in this research a new designed surface piercing body which composes of a surface piercing cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater axisymmetric body as shown in fig 5 is investigated the hydrofoil acts both as the lift generating component and the strut unit a combined foil shape is adopted as shown in fig 6 where the leading and trailing edge region comes from naca66 mod airfoil brockett 1966 and the middle part is a flat airfoil the maximum relative thickness is 9 at 45 chord length and the maximum camber is 2 located at 50 chord length in order to improve the lift of the hydrofoil under zero attack angle the trailing edge is rotated by 5 the underwater body uses a cavitator in front of a streamlined part to stabilize the cavity the head and tail shape for the underwater body is taken from the following formula by myring 1976 the cavitator diameter d n equals 1 3 d b which refers to the main body diameter 4 2 computational mesh and boundary conditions the simulations will be carried out both for the separate vertical hydrofoil and the combined body with different wet depth the calculation domain size is shown in fig 7 where the maximum chord length c is taken as the reference length boundary conditions are defined at the six sides of the domain and on the hydrofoil surface on the left side a velocity inlet condition is set with values of free stream velocity components and turbulence quantities the inflow speed u varies from 20 m s to 50 m s the corresponding vapor cavitation number σ 2 p p v ρ l u 2 varies from 0 489 to 0 078 on the right exit side of the domain a pressure outlet condition with a fixed static pressure is imposed the top of the computational domain is set as a composite boundary condition for which when the fluid flows out the zero pressure gradient is defined automatically otherwise the normal component of the internal grid is taken as the boundary velocity moving wall boundaries are imposed on the bottom and side walls of the computational domain according to cheng et al 2016 long et al 2017 2018b it is worth evaluating the accuracy and reliability of a numerical simulation grid convergence index gci is one of the most widely used method for verification and validation asnaghi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 long et al 2019 in the current study the grid convergence test for the hydrofoil case is conducted on four grids with different resolution the total cell numbers for the fairly coarse m1 coarse m2 middle m3 and fine m4 grids are about 523k 1009k 1643k and 2833k respectively grid distributions in the middle span cut plane view as shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the calculated pressure distribution in the middle section of the four different grids for an angle of attack of 0 the results suggest that there show little difference in the pressure coefficient distributions when the grids are sufficient fine in view of computational consumption the middle mesh with 1643k cells in total is chosen for the simulations finally as shown in fig 10 due to complex geometry configuration and topology an unstructured mesh with local refinement is generated for the new designed surface piercing body the near wall grid treatments are similar to those in the separate hydrofoil case mesh convergence check is also carried out on four grids i e fairly coarse g1 1853k cells coarse g2 2294k cells middle g3 2626k cells fine grid g4 3813k cells the pressure coefficients along the generatrix of the body calculated by different grids are shown in fig 11 there shows little difference when the computational grid is fine enough therefore the middle grid is chosen for simulation finally which is shown in fig 12 5 results and discussions 5 1 flow field and hydrodynamics analysis for the hydrofoil 5 1 1 free surface elevation analysis firstly simulation is carried out for the vertical surface piercing hydrofoil separately figs 13 15 show the contours for the relative free surface height y under the effect of surface piercing hydrofoil where α l 0 1 is taken as the free surface according to the simulation results when σ 0 489 an upward splashing jet is generated both on the suction and pressure sides of the hydrofoil starting from the leading edge there are two crests on the pressure side while there is only one on the suction side the jet height reaches a maximum value near the middle of the airfoil chord and then falls back a thicker jet is observed on the pressure side with a peak height of 0 4 c while the relatively thin jet is formed on the suction side with a peak of about 0 5 c a long divergent like wave is formed downstream the hydrofoil which extends as far as 2 5 c downstream the rising of the free surface mainly connects with the splashing jet on the pressure side and the local peaks gradually decrease as it developing downstream on the contrary a sinking region is observed downstream of the suction side due to the low pressure in this region generating a steep wall between the rising and the sinking zone as the decreasing of the incoming flow cavitation number the splash height on both sides of the hydrofoil increases and the impact region extends further away when the cavitation number decreases to σ 0 16 the wake region extends as far as 4 c the centre for the sinking region moves further away from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil while the valley height remains stable at 0 2 c when the cavitation number approaches σ 0 078 70 of the hydrofoil surface is covered by the splash jet the disturbance by the hydrofoil develops to 6 c downstream a splashing wall is observed downstream of the pressure side the sinking region centre continues to move downstream with the expanding area and the stable sinking height 5 1 2 air entrainment and hydrodynamics analysis fig 16 shows the contours of the pressure distribution on the hydrofoil surface where the blue iso surface refers to α a 0 2 and the purple iso surface refers to α v 0 1 for the immersed part low pressure is observed both at the leading and the trailing edge regions the three dimensional effect is observed on the hydrofoil surface in the span wise direction the low pressure region extends longest in the middle part while it is depressed near the free surface and the tip region on the pressure side the entire leading edge is also covered by the low pressure zone the cavity shape is indicated by the purple iso surface in the figure only a tiny cavity is observed on the low pressure region which indicates that only cavitation inception occurs on the hydrofoil surface as shown in the figure the air is entrained into the wake of the trailing edge region which will give rise to the increasing of the local pressure and depress the natural cavitation in comparison with the 2d result cavitation is dramatically suppressed and most of the vapor concentrates near the free surface due to the buoyancy force the lift coefficients c l 2 l ρ u 2 s w and drag coefficients c d 2 d ρ u 2 s w of the hydrofoil are also investigated in this part where l and d represent the lift and drag forces respectively u is the inflow velocity and s w is the wet area variation of the hydrodynamic drag and lift coefficients are presented in fig 17 as the decreasing of the cavitation number both the lift and the drag coefficient show a descending trend the lift coefficient declines less under non cavitation condition σ 0 313 and small submersion depth while the lift coefficient declines rapidly with the decrease cavitation number especially when σ 0 21 which indicates that cavitation inception occurs on the hydrofoil surface for the drag coefficient the curves start to decline quickly when the cavitation number decreases to 0 217 due to the entrainment of the air at the trailing edge which will reduce the pressure drag furthermore totally speaking the lift to drag coefficient decreases dramatically when cavitation number decreases to 0 217 which illustrates that the cavitation at the trailing edge is not beneficial for the hydrofoil hydrodynamics a higher lift to drag coefficient is observed for the hydrofoil with deeper immersion height which implies that larger chord to aspect underwater ratio is preferred for better hydrodynamic performance 5 2 flow field analysis for the combined surface piercing body the same as in the last section take the iso surface of α l 0 1 as the location of the free surface the y coordinate contours of the free interface at different viewing side are also shown in fig 18 in comparison with the vertical surface piercing hydrofoil the wave magnitude for the free surface and the height for the splash jet are all reduced with a 45 inclined hydrofoil the jet on the suction side rises only about 0 1 c with respect to the fluid level the presence of the body has caused the water surface to rise about 0 025 c upstream of the hydrofoil enhancing the hydrofoil wet area to some extent similar to the three dimensional hydrofoil that cuts the water surface vertically there is a sinking area downstream the suction side where the maximum sinking depth is about 0 075 c slightly larger than the vertical three dimensional hydrofoil the sinking of the liquid level will cause a problem for the underwater propulsion system resulting in loss of propulsion efficiency for the propeller or jet engine fig 19 presents the pressure distribution on the whole body surface where the iso surface of α v 0 1 is also given in comparison with the vertical hydrofoil cavitation mainly concentrates on the leading edge of the hydrofoil suction near the water surface shown by the dotted line in the figure and extends downstream to the middle of the hydrofoil while the trailing edge of the suction surface is almost out of cavitation as shown in fig 19 b there is a low pressure zone in the leading edge of the hydrofoil and there is a very small amount of vapor bubbles indicating that the overall cavitation is weak it can be concluded that under the integrated influence of the underwater body and the free interface cavitation at the leading edge of the suction side near the water surface is greatly enhanced while cavitation at the other location is weakened 6 conclusions a multiphase cavitation solver which uses an extendable framework and couples various kinds of cavitation modes is developed based on the openfoam platform the solver is capable of dealing with multiple phase change processes simultaneously in order to validate the numerical model the solver is first applied to the high speed projectile near the free surface the correctness and accuracy of the model are validated by comparing the free surface elevation and the cavity length with the experimental data the solver is then applied for a newly designed surface piercing body which is composed of a cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater body the focus is put on understanding the interaction between different phases and the free surface the following conclusions are obtained 1 for the separate vertical surface piercing hydrofoil the splash jet is generated on the hydrofoil and a long divergent like wave is formed downstream of the hydrofoil as the decreasing of the cavitation number both the jet height and the rising wave magnitude is enhanced however the valley for the sinking region remains stable 2 cavitation on the hydrofoil surface is dramatically suppressed due to the three dimensional effect and most of the vapor concentrates near the free surface due to the buoyancy force only cavitation inception is observed on the hydrofoil surface when the cavitation number is larger than 0 078 furthermore the air is entrained into the wake of the trailing edge region which gives rise to the increase of the local pressure and depresses the natural cavitation 3 under the effect of the combined body with a 45 degree inclined hydrofoil the rising wave magnitude is reduced and the sinking depth is slightly larger when compared with the vertical hydrofoil this will result in low propulsion efficiency for the propeller or jet engines under the influence of the underwater body cavitation at the leading edge of the suction side near the free surface is enhanced while cavitation at the trailing edge is weakened acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge support by the national nature science foundation of china nsfc grant no 51776221 national university of

les turbulence model together to simulate the unsteady cavitation evolution for two kinds of elongated cylinder below free surface based on fluent platform the generation development and collapse process for the cavity on the cylinder surface was carefully investigated it indicated that when the cavity is too close to the free surface so that the air is entrained inside the cavity it will increase the cavity size and increase its stability jin et al 2013 established a multiphase flow simulation program based on the mixture multiphase model and the merkle cavitation model simulation has been carried out for the ventilating naca0012 hydrofoil near the free surface obtaining the variation of the free interface height with the ventilation rate brizzolara and villa 2012 designed a new supercavitating cross media hydrofoil for the high speed swath configuration of the surface vehicle and analyze the flow field structure near the three dimensional hydrofoil based on star ccm the simple algorithm is combined with the amg linear solver to solve the momentum equation and the continuity equation wu and chen 2016 proposed a new numerical strategy for the simulation of cavitation flows near the free surface the cavity shape and free surface were updated iteratively during the numerical procedure which could achieve fast convergence the tested cases suggest that the proposed method is quite good in the computation of the free surface to analyze the attached cavity evolution and the re entrant jet behavior in detail cheng et al 2016 2018 long et al 2018a developed a 3 d lagrangian technology combining with the traditional eulerian viewpoint method on cfx platform it demonstrated that the 3 d lagrangian technology is a promising tool in the investigation of complex cavitating flows pelanti and shyue 2019 proposed a numerical model for multiphase liquid vapor gas flows with interfaces and cavitation the model includes stiff mechanical thermal relaxation source terms for all phases and chemical relaxation terms for liquid and vapour phases numerical results show the efficiency of the numerical method in modelling complex wave patterns shocks and interfaces in problems with thermal and mass transfer processes as the authors mentioned the extension of the model to more complex and general equations of state are still worth studying matveev et al 2019 adopted the star ccm solver to model the air ventilation phenomena on an inclined surface piercing hydrofoils numerical results showed that hydrodynamic characteristics of the inclined surface piercing hydrofoil were degraded at high attack angles and high froude numbers due to the air ventilation to overcome this a small fence was placed on the suction side of the hydrofoil near the nominal water level which turned out to be useful for suppressing both downward air ventilation and upward water spray zhou et al 2019 investigated the interaction between the natural and ventilated cavitation based on openfoam where a multiphase solver with phase change was used studies have shown that the interface sharpening factor directly affects the simulation of the multi component gas mixture and re entrained jet phenomena in conclusion cavitating flow near free surface involves complex phenomena such as interface fluctuation multi component gas mixing and entrainment high turbulence et al which introduces great difficulty in predicting this flow accurately in this paper a multiphase cavitation solver which couples various kinds of cavitation models and turbulence models is developed based on openfoam platform the solver uses an extendable multiphase framework which is capable of dealing with multiple phase change processes simultaneously the solver will be applied to the projectile below the surface to validate the numerical model then simulations will be carried out for a newly proposed surface vehicle which includes a cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater body the free surface effect on the sub bodies will be investigated in detail in order to give some insight into the design of the high speed surface vehicle 2 mathematical models 2 1 governing equations cavitating flow near free surface involves the interaction between different phases including the gas liquid and vapor in this paper mechanical and thermal equilibrium is assumed between different phases which mean that the phases share the same velocity pressure and temperature field considering there is a tiny temperature variation in the flow the energy equation is not solved in this paper the governing equations for the incompressible mixture are used as follows 1 ρ m t ρ m u 0 2 ρ m u t ρ m u u τ p f where ρ p and u represents the density pressure and velocity of the flow respectively the subscript m represent the mixture phase τ represents the newtonian viscous stress tensor f is the momentum source terms due to surface tension and gravity 3 f f σ ρ m g considering the mass transfer between different phases the continuity equation for each phase is given as 4 α l t α l u m ρ l α v t α v u m ρ v α g t α g u 0 the subscript l v g represent the liquid vapor and non condensable gas respectively m on the rhs of the equations donates the mass transfer rate per unit volume per second caused by cavitation between the liquid and vapor phase addition of all equations of eq 4 leads to the divergence of the velocity 5 u 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m adding and substracting a α u term to the rhs of eq 4 for each phase and utilizing eq 5 the final form of the volume fraction equations can be expressed as 6 α l t α l u α l u 1 ρ l α l 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α v t α v u α v u 1 ρ v α v 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m α g t α g u α g u α g 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m given that the interface dispersion due to numerical diffusion might appear a good approach to limit or reverse this effect would be to include a diffusion operator into the phase fraction equation with a negative diffusion coefficient this approach would be conservative however it would also be unbounded and unstable a negative diffusion is always problematic an alternative method is to apply some kind of additional convection based term which compresses the interface maintains boundness and reduces to zero at least the integrated effect of it reduces to zero as the mesh is refined a counter gradient term which is clearly conservative and maintains boundedness has a general form of u r α β where α β stands for volume fraction of different phases and u r is the relative velocity between the two phases across the interface the final form of the volume fraction equations is given in eq 7 where the compressive term is active only within the interface region 7 α l t α l u i v g α l α i u l u i α l u 1 ρ l α l 1 ρ

incompressible navier stokes equations and phases in the multiphase system share the velocity and pressure fields so the relative velocity term should be reconstructed here we just adopt the following form which is also used by some other multiphase solver in openfoam weller 2008 8 u r min c α u max u α α where c α is a compressive factor the expression max u returns the largest value of u anywhere in the domain actually the momentum equation is used to construct the velocity equation in openfoam an additional poisson s equation for the pressure is needed according to jasak 1996 and demirdžić et al 1993 the semi discretized form of the momentum equation could be written as 9 u h u a p 1 a p p where the h u term consists of two parts one is matrix coefficients for all neighbors multiplied by corresponding velocities and the other part is the source part including the source part of the transient term and all other source terms apart from the pressure gradient combining with the velocity divergence term in eq 5 the final form of the pressure equation is given as 10 h u a p 1 a p p 1 ρ l 1 ρ v m finally the p u coupling is solved by the pimple loop in the current study the volume fraction transport equation of the multiphase system is solved by an optimized mules tool kit damián 2013 lin et al 2018 2 2 schnerr sauer cavitation model cavitation model represents the mass transfer rate between gas and liquid in order to solve multiple phase change processes a new cavitation model framework is designed which employs a number of object oriented programming and openfoam library features such as the design pattern of runtime type identification and virtual function dispatch this approach allows the addition of new runtime selectable derived class implementations without any modification of the base class or application code the schnerr sauer cavitation model based on the transport equation is selected for the cavitating flow near the free surface the mass transfer rate is calculated by the following equation 11 m c c ρ v ρ l ρ α v 1 α v 3 r sgn p p v 2 3 p p v ρ l m c v ρ v ρ l ρ α v 1 α v 3 r sgn p p v 2 3 p p v ρ l where p v is the vaporization pressure r is the radius of a nucleation site and u is the free stream velocity c c and c v are the two empirical constants both values are 1 by default and s g n is the sign function 2 3 k ω sst turbulence model since cavitation is generally considered as a high reynolds number phenomenon it therefore experiences highly turbulent characteristic scales turbulence modeling plays a key role and must be addressed adequately in addition to the cavitation model in this study the k ω sst turbulence model which has better performance for boundary layer flow and cavitation flow with a reverse pressure gradient is employed the openfoam variant is based on the 2001 model menter and esch 2001 with updated coefficients from model 2003 menter et al 2003 the transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation ω are presented in the following equations 12 ρ m k t ρ m k u p k β ρ m ω k μ σ k μ t k 13 ρ m ω t ρ m ω u γ ρ m s 2 β ρ m ω 2 μ σ ω μ t ω 1 f 1 cd k ω where

where a 1 0 31 is a model constant s 2 s i j s i j is the invariant measure of strain rate with 16 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i the expression of the blending function f is based on the closest distance

10 3 model validation in order to validate the numerical model simulations are firstly carried out for the underwater projectile which was investigated by wang et al 2016 the total length of the projectile is 246 mm the diameter is 37 mm and the conical angle is 90 the flow velocity is set as 17 8 m s and the initial distance between the free surface and the upper side of the projectile is 17 mm the free surface and cavity evolution process is used to compare with the experimental data aiming at reducing the amount of calculation half of the axisymmetric projectile is taken for simulation the total cell number of the computational mesh is about 4 million as shown in fig 1 fig 2 presents an iso surface for the solved cavity and free surface shape at moment of t 0 004s furthermore the free surface profile at t 0 004 s is compared with the experimental data wang et al 2016 where a maximum relative error of 3 is observed as shown in fig 3 furthermore the cavity length varying with time on the projectile is presented in fig 4 the resolution process can be divided into three stages including the developing stage where the cavity length increases rapidly the transition stage with a much slower expanding rate and the steady stage when the cavity length reaches a stable level in comparison with the experimental data the three stage was correctly predicted the cavity length at the developing stage and the steady stage agrees well with the experimental data while a relatively larger error is observed in the transition stage due to the cavity vibration in this stage it is validated that the solver is capable of dealing with the multiphase cavitating flows 4 case setup 4 1 geometry description in this research a new designed surface piercing body which composes of a surface piercing cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater axisymmetric body as shown in fig 5 is investigated the hydrofoil acts both as the lift generating component and the strut unit a combined foil shape is adopted as shown in fig 6 where the leading and trailing edge region comes from naca66 mod airfoil brockett 1966 and the middle part is a flat airfoil the maximum relative thickness is 9 at 45 chord length and the maximum camber is 2 located at 50 chord length in order to improve the lift of the hydrofoil under zero attack angle the trailing edge is rotated by 5 the underwater body uses a cavitator in front of a streamlined part to stabilize the cavity the head and tail shape for the underwater body is taken from the following formula by myring 1976 the cavitator diameter d n equals 1 3 d b which refers to the main body diameter 4 2 computational mesh and boundary conditions the simulations will be carried out both for the separate vertical hydrofoil and the combined body with different wet depth the calculation domain size is shown in fig 7 where the maximum chord length c is taken as the reference length boundary conditions are defined at the six sides of the domain and on the hydrofoil surface on the left side a velocity inlet condition is set with values of free stream velocity components and turbulence quantities the inflow speed u varies from 20 m s to 50 m s the corresponding vapor cavitation number σ 2 p p v ρ l u 2 varies from 0 489 to 0 078 on the right exit side of the domain a pressure outlet condition with a fixed static pressure is imposed the top of the computational domain is set as a composite boundary condition for which when the fluid flows out the zero pressure gradient is defined automatically otherwise the normal component of the internal grid is taken as the boundary velocity moving wall boundaries are imposed on the bottom and side walls of the computational domain according to cheng et al 2016 long et al 2017 2018b it is worth evaluating the accuracy and reliability of a numerical simulation grid convergence index gci is one of the most widely used method for verification and validation asnaghi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 long et al 2019 in the current study the grid convergence test for the hydrofoil case is conducted on four grids with different resolution the total cell numbers for the fairly coarse m1 coarse m2 middle m3 and fine m4 grids are about 523k 1009k 1643k and 2833k respectively grid distributions in the middle span cut plane view as shown in fig 8 fig 9 shows the calculated pressure distribution in the middle section of the four different grids for an angle of attack of 0 the results suggest that there show little difference in the pressure coefficient distributions when the grids are sufficient fine in view of computational consumption the middle mesh with 1643k cells in total is chosen for the simulations finally as shown in fig 10 due to complex geometry configuration and topology an unstructured mesh with local refinement is generated for the new designed surface piercing body the near wall grid treatments are similar to those in the separate hydrofoil case mesh convergence check is also carried out on four grids i e fairly coarse g1 1853k cells coarse g2 2294k cells middle g3 2626k cells fine grid g4 3813k cells the pressure coefficients along the generatrix of the body calculated by different grids are shown in fig 11 there shows little difference when the computational grid is fine enough therefore the middle grid is chosen for simulation finally which is shown in fig 12 5 results and discussions 5 1 flow field and hydrodynamics analysis for the hydrofoil 5 1 1 free surface elevation analysis firstly simulation is carried out for the vertical surface piercing hydrofoil separately figs 13 15 show the contours for the relative free surface height y under the effect of surface piercing hydrofoil where α l 0 1 is taken as the free surface according to the simulation results when σ 0 489 an upward splashing jet is generated both on the suction and pressure sides of the hydrofoil starting from the leading edge there are two crests on the pressure side while there is only one on the suction side the jet height reaches a maximum value near the middle of the airfoil chord and then falls back a thicker jet is observed on the pressure side with a peak height of 0 4 c while the relatively thin jet is formed on the suction side with a peak of about 0 5 c a long divergent like wave is formed downstream the hydrofoil which extends as far as 2 5 c downstream the rising of the free surface mainly connects with the splashing jet on the pressure side and the local peaks gradually decrease as it developing downstream on the contrary a sinking region is observed downstream of the suction side due to the low pressure in this region generating a steep wall between the rising and the sinking zone as the decreasing of the incoming flow cavitation number the splash height on both sides of the hydrofoil increases and the impact region extends further away when the cavitation number decreases to σ 0 16 the wake region extends as far as 4 c the centre for the sinking region moves further away from the trailing edge of the hydrofoil while the valley height remains stable at 0 2 c when the cavitation number approaches σ 0 078 70 of the hydrofoil surface is covered by the splash jet the disturbance by the hydrofoil develops to 6 c downstream a splashing wall is observed downstream of the pressure side the sinking region centre continues to move downstream with the expanding area and the stable sinking height 5 1 2 air entrainment and hydrodynamics analysis fig 16 shows the contours of the pressure distribution on the hydrofoil surface where the blue iso surface refers to α a 0 2 and the purple iso surface refers to α v 0 1 for the immersed part low pressure is observed both at the leading and the trailing edge regions the three dimensional effect is observed on the hydrofoil surface in the span wise direction the low pressure region extends longest in the middle part while it is depressed near the free surface and the tip region on the pressure side the entire leading edge is also covered by the low pressure zone the cavity shape is indicated by the purple iso surface in the figure only a tiny cavity is observed on the low pressure region which indicates that only cavitation inception occurs on the hydrofoil surface as shown in the figure the air is entrained into the wake of the trailing edge region which will give rise to the increasing of the local pressure and depress the natural cavitation in comparison with the 2d result cavitation is dramatically suppressed and most of the vapor concentrates near the free surface due to the buoyancy force the lift coefficients c l 2 l ρ u 2 s w and drag coefficients c d 2 d ρ u 2 s w of the hydrofoil are also investigated in this part where l and d represent the lift and drag forces respectively u is the inflow velocity and s w is the wet area variation of the hydrodynamic drag and lift coefficients are presented in fig 17 as the decreasing of the cavitation number both the lift and the drag coefficient show a descending trend the lift coefficient declines less under non cavitation condition σ 0 313 and small submersion depth while the lift coefficient declines rapidly with the decrease cavitation number especially when σ 0 21 which indicates that cavitation inception occurs on the hydrofoil surface for the drag coefficient the curves start to decline quickly when the cavitation number decreases to 0 217 due to the entrainment of the air at the trailing edge which will reduce the pressure drag furthermore totally speaking the lift to drag coefficient decreases dramatically when cavitation number decreases to 0 217 which illustrates that the cavitation at the trailing edge is not beneficial for the hydrofoil hydrodynamics a higher lift to drag coefficient is observed for the hydrofoil with deeper immersion height which implies that larger chord to aspect underwater ratio is preferred for better hydrodynamic performance 5 2 flow field analysis for the combined surface piercing body the same as in the last section take the iso surface of α l 0 1 as the location of the free surface the y coordinate contours of the free interface at different viewing side are also shown in fig 18 in comparison with the vertical surface piercing hydrofoil the wave magnitude for the free surface and the height for the splash jet are all reduced with a 45 inclined hydrofoil the jet on the suction side rises only about 0 1 c with respect to the fluid level the presence of the body has caused the water surface to rise about 0 025 c upstream of the hydrofoil enhancing the hydrofoil wet area to some extent similar to the three dimensional hydrofoil that cuts the water surface vertically there is a sinking area downstream the suction side where the maximum sinking depth is about 0 075 c slightly larger than the vertical three dimensional hydrofoil the sinking of the liquid level will cause a problem for the underwater propulsion system resulting in loss of propulsion efficiency for the propeller or jet engine fig 19 presents the pressure distribution on the whole body surface where the iso surface of α v 0 1 is also given in comparison with the vertical hydrofoil cavitation mainly concentrates on the leading edge of the hydrofoil suction near the water surface shown by the dotted line in the figure and extends downstream to the middle of the hydrofoil while the trailing edge of the suction surface is almost out of cavitation as shown in fig 19 b there is a low pressure zone in the leading edge of the hydrofoil and there is a very small amount of vapor bubbles indicating that the overall cavitation is weak it can be concluded that under the integrated influence of the underwater body and the free interface cavitation at the leading edge of the suction side near the water surface is greatly enhanced while cavitation at the other location is weakened 6 conclusions a multiphase cavitation solver which uses an extendable framework and couples various kinds of cavitation modes is developed based on the openfoam platform the solver is capable of dealing with multiple phase change processes simultaneously in order to validate the numerical model the solver is first applied to the high speed projectile near the free surface the correctness and accuracy of the model are validated by comparing the free surface elevation and the cavity length with the experimental data the solver is then applied for a newly designed surface piercing body which is composed of a cavitating hydrofoil and an underwater body the focus is put on understanding the interaction between different phases and the free surface the following conclusions are obtained 1 for the separate vertical surface piercing hydrofoil the splash jet is generated on the hydrofoil and a long divergent like wave is formed downstream of the hydrofoil as the decreasing of the cavitation number both the jet height and the rising wave magnitude is enhanced however the valley for the sinking region remains stable 2 cavitation on the hydrofoil surface is dramatically suppressed due to the three dimensional effect and most of the vapor concentrates near the free surface due to the buoyancy force only cavitation inception is observed on the hydrofoil surface when the cavitation number is larger than 0 078 furthermore the air is entrained into the wake of the trailing edge region which gives rise to the increase of the local pressure and depresses the natural cavitation 3 under the effect of the combined body with a 45 degree inclined hydrofoil the rising wave magnitude is reduced and the sinking depth is slightly larger when compared with the vertical hydrofoil this will result in low propulsion efficiency for the propeller or jet engines under the influence of the underwater body cavitation at the leading edge of the suction side near the free surface is enhanced while cavitation at the trailing edge is weakened acknowledgment the authors gratefully acknowledge support by the national nature science foundation of china nsfc grant no 51776221 national university of

22537,the energy efficiency operation index eeoi one of schemes as a monitoring performance indicator related to seemp which is the mandatory regulation for ships in operation intending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in maritime transportation it is closely related to vessel speed and the waterway environment among other factors finding the optimal main engine speed is a basic way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the eeoi ships in ice areas are also affected by the impact of ice loads during navigation it is critical to consider uncertainties when reducing the eeoi of ships in ice areas to achieve energy savings and reduce emissions in this study the data mining of ice loads was realized through wavelet decomposition which proved that it is reasonable to take ice loads into account as random uncertainty random variables this research introduces uncertainty analysis and optimization theory when considering ice loads and other important stochastic factors the main engine speed of ships in ice areas was then taken as the design variable by solving the minimum eeoi optimization model a robust and reliable speed optimal result was obtained and the effectiveness and advancement of this method was verified using a comparative example keywords eeoi ice zone ship speed optimization uncertainty 1 introduction the energy efficiency operation index eeoi an important indicator of ship energy efficiency stipulated by the international maritime organization imo was enforced in 2011 marine environment protection committee 2011 from an operational perspective the speed of the main engine is directly related to the speed of the ship while vessel speed is closely related to navigation resistance fuel consumption operational efficiency and other energy efficiency indicators therefore searching for the optimal engine speed to achieve speed optimization is a significant way to reduce eeoi and achieve energy savings and emission reductions huo 2017 studied the energy savings of ships during voyages by optimizing their route segments and subsection speeds with the aim of ascertaining the lowest total fuel consumption chen chen et al 2014 considered the influence of flow velocity on fuel consumption a relationship model between fuel consumption and main engine speed was established using measured data and the speed optimization of inland ships based on the eeoi was studied from the point of view of hull form optimization hou 2017 proposed a ship hull design method to achieve a minimum eeoi with a focus on the influence of speed perturbation norlund and gribkovskaia 2013 considered the effects of speed schedule and fleet size on optimal energy efficiency and studied energy savings and emission reductions in supply vessels the above research shows that the eeoi is closely related to speed the main engine and the external environment as a system composed of objective factors beyond a ship s own condition the navigation environment will directly or indirectly affect the ship s motion state and thus change the ship s operational energy efficiency however existing methods take each parameter as a determined value without considering the uncertainty of parameter perturbation directly in the calculation as a special type of ship ice area ships are affected not only by conventional hydrodynamic forces but also by the constant impact of ice loads in the course of sailing normally forces on ships would show probability distribution regularity but they would also be subjected to unpredictable extreme loads thus presenting typical uncertainties guo guo et al 2015 conducted a comparative analysis of three methods of ship resistance prediction in ice areas an empirical formula method a numerical simulation method and a model test method then discussed the scope of their application and offered suggestions suyuthi suyuthi et al 2012 focused on the prediction of the short term extreme values of local ice loads on ship hulls based on the exact classical method and this asymptotic approach tended to give a similar level of extreme values meanwhile wei chai et al 2018 introduced the classic extreme value theory to estimate extreme ice loads and presented the average conditional exceedance rate method which is directly related to vessel reliability the above research shows that the uncertainty of ice loads on ships in ice areas needs to be described using appropriate probabilistic or non probabilistic models before being used in subsequent optimization design calculations in engineering design both robustness and reliability need to be taken into account when considering the perturbation of system input parameters the former refers to the characteristics of maintaining the excellent and stable performance of the system under external interference while the latter emphasizes the system s ability to resist perturbation not to break through its design constraints and to continue to achieve specific functions the uncertain optimization objective eeoi and the failure probability of the constraints involved in engineering design are very sensitive to external disturbances response fluctuations due to parameter perturbations and small variations in uncertainty in the process indices due to estimation errors can lead to steep increases and decreases in the eeoi and constraints failure thus both reliability and robustness need to be considered during engineering design given the uncertainty factors in engineering design some theoretical studies have been carried out in recent years the unified uncertainty analysis method was proposed by means of a probability analysis via the first order reliability analysis form method and interval analysis based on evidence theory du 2008 aiming to resolve the optimization problem under mixed uncertainty reliability based optimization methods under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties have been studied with a focus on how to transform the reliability based optimization problem into a quasi equivalent deterministic formulation based on the information obtained in the uncertainty analysis yao et al 2013 with respect to ship design diez team hediez and zouetc 2013 chen et al 2015 diez et al 2017 2019a 2019b introduced the uncertain optimization idea into ship optimization design systems and a series of studies were subsequently conducted the design objective was developed from the principal dimensions to the hull lines from a single uncertain parameter to multiple uncertain parameters and from speed disturbance to wave response which reflects the idea from coarse to fine from simple to complex the uncertainty information involved in the above studies was based on relatively simple empirical assumptions thus deep mining of actual navigation data and introducing the generated uncertainties into the optimization system may better reflect the real background characteristics of the perturbation parameters this research was based on a section of actual ship navigation data in an ice area the uncertainty information of the ice load was then mined via a statistical analysis and wavelet decomposition based on the eeoi model deduced in reference huo 2017 an optimization model with the objective of achieving a minimum eeoi was established with the main engine speed as the design variable a sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty analysis of the optimization model were then carried out using various methods to reveal the effects of the actual ice load perturbation information on the output response to improve the robustness and reliability of the results an uncertainty optimization design of the analysis results was developed and satisfactory and feasible uncertainty optimization solutions were obtained using an appropriate method 2 data mining of uncertain probabilistic information of ice load ship hull plates sailing in an ice area are subjected to continuous load impacts from all directions and the forces can show certainty and uncertainty probability distribution characteristics short term loads could be considered as describing a more or less stationary condition both with respect to prevailing ice conditions and ship operation characteristics which could applied to analyze the stochastic time series such as the statistical parameters correlation functions power spectrum statistical distributions and also extreme value statistics etc by comparison long term load is more focused on the gentle seasonal variation which could not reflect meticulous uncertain data characteristics to further study the action rules of ice loads it was necessary to select a section of an actual ship s ice load data as the analysis sample the experimental data used in this study were derived from an expedition voyage in the west part of the barents sea during march 2007 the data were obtained via instrumentation with fiber optic strain sensors at several locations along the hull eight frames at the bow area and one frame at the starboard side shown in fig 1 to measure the strain responses suyuthi et al 2012 by integrating the pre assumed shear stress distribution over the cross section of the frame the total ice loads are obtained by intercepting a relatively stable time range it was established that the data amount was 556 and the frequency was 1 hz the data time sequence and the main statistical indicators are shown in fig 2 also fourier transform is used to conduct frequency analysis of the ice loads shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 2 most of the data fluctuate in the range below 20 kn m while the local extreme distribution is irregular and the maximum extreme reaches 140 it is can be seen from the statistical indicators that skewness and kurtosis of the data are large which indicates that it is far from the normal distribution thus that the time series of the measured ice induced load looks like a sequence of spikes from fig 3 there s no obvious peak frequency in it thus the frequency distribution of time series is scattered and random because of the existence of many local extremes distribution of original time series data is scattered in order to study the influence of dispersion it is necessary to exclude some local extremes which deviate from the mean and explore the statistical rules a series of box figures are obtained by excluding the local extreme of the region 20 144 according to a certain percentage of the interval ε ε 0 50 70 90 100 as is shown in fig 4 as seen more than 90 of the local extremes are located outside the upper quartile namely far away from the main area of data distribution thus would inevitably interfere with the statistical modeling of the data when extreme values above 20 kn m are excluded completely ε 100 skewness and kurtosis are more in line with the formation conditions of normal distribution therefore the ice loads on ship can be considered as non stationary complex time sequence and most of local extremes occur in the high frequency region as a relatively new signal analysis tool wavelet analysis can use small time windows in high frequency part and relatively large time windows in low frequency part castillo et al 2018 meanwhile wavelet has the function of frequency band filtering which can effectively remove noisy signal information in signal leaving a smooth signal information in order to extract the disturbance information of each level in time sequence and find out essential basic signal source this research decomposes the above ice load signal by wavelet transform daubechies wavelet is selected with a width of 3 and performs five level decomposition the results are shown in figs 5 8 by processing detail signal of the ice load wavelet ignoring the approximation signal of low frequency can reflect the baseline drift interference and the signal can be observed step by step from rough to fine figs 5 and 6 are the signal components of different levels extracted by wavelet decomposition which can reflect the effective characteristics of the signal detail information of fig 7 corresponds to the high frequency part which exists a large fluctuation component namely noise component results of wavelet decomposition and detail description are shown in table 1 where level 1 and level 5 are listed as representatives only because statistical characteristics of each level of wavelet in detail are quite similar it can be seen that the average value of decomposition in each level is not much different from median value which shows wavelet decomposition can effectively retain the desired characteristics of data whereas the standard deviation and range of decomposition at each level show a decreasing change which means that with the deepening of decomposition level the range of low frequency change of data is more and more prominent that is the noise interference is more and more weakened according to the statistical analysis of the extracted smooth part it can be seen that the low frequency main body of the signal is concentrated in a specific interval which means that although there are many local extremes in ice load there is still a relatively stable interval range thus the intervals can be used as reference for next step of uncertainty analysis and optimization parameters selection 3 eeoi optimization model and sensitivity analysis 3 1 eeoi derivation and establishment of its optimization model eeoi is described by ratio of ship co2 emissions to cargo capacity which is related to fuel consumption

the normal load capacity of the hull therefore in order to ensure safe operation and operational efficiency of ship it is necessary to ensure that vessel speed v s is between the minimum speed v min

great influence on eeoi it s necessary to conduct the sensitivity analysis of each input variables on output and to extract main factors that influence majorly on the output response as a powerful design of experiments doe tool random latin hypercube rlh is adopted here for its ability of effective space filling and of nonlinear response fitting as a multidimensional stratified sampling method rlh has significant savings in the number of samples also compared to other doe methods it is loose in rlh for the classification of design level and times of experiments could be controlled artificially which provides the outstanding flexibility and freedom in engineering analysis as is shown in eq 10 there are many vessel s internal parameters and environmental factors that influence the output among them some have less variability and importance so that are not considered in this part of research for simplification of analysis the sensitivity analysis execution plan via rlh is shown in fig 9 under certain rules of rlh 5000 experiment points are generated main effect curve and pareto contributions of inputs are shown in fig 10 which can reflect the effect degree of each input on output as shown in fig 8 main engine speed n has the greatest impact on eeoi reaching more than 45 this shows that the change of main engine speed can have a greater impact on eeoi in operation process therefore it is reasonable to find the optimal n in design space to achieve the minimum eeoi in addition pareto contribution rates of other factors are almost the same all of them are around 10 they can be used as uncertain parameters to participate in subsequent analysis and optimization calculation which can prepare for the further elaboration of impact of uncertain indicators on output response 4 uncertainty analysis and optimization 4 1 uncertainty analysis of eeoi as can be seen from the above studies by means of wavelet decomposition the ice loads on ship sailing in ice area can be described as random variables with specific probability distribution and the selection of multiple distribution moments shows different characteristics of the uncertainty of ice loads to analyse the uncertain effects of multiple factors on eeoi four typical uncertainty analysis methods are introduced here 1 monte carlo simulation mcs in mcs the probability distribution of random variables is known through random sampling the probability distribution of system response can be estimated and the contribution of each random variable to the response results can also be obtained illustration of mcs is as shown in fig 11 there are two sampling techniques in mcs simple random sampling and descriptive sampling compared to the former descriptive sampling is a variance reduction technique aimed at reducing the variance of the statistical estimates derived from the population data on the other hand descriptive sampling can ensure the quality of statistical analysis with less sampling times and simulation so it becomes a representative method and is used in this study 2 mean value reliability method mvrm as a probabilistic method mvrm utilizes the taylor s series expansion of failure functions at mean values of the random variables mvrm is the most efficient of the reliability analysis methods in terms of the number of function evaluations or simulation program executions however unless the failure functions are linear or quadratic with normally distributed random variables mean value reliability index would lose accuracy illustration of mvrm is shown in fig 12 form takes advantage of the desirable properties of the standard normal probability distribution and reliability index is defined as the shortest distance from the origin of the standard normal space to a point on the failure surface mathematically determining the reliability index is a minimization problem with one equality constraint 4 second order reliability method sorm when failure function for mpp probable point most is nonlinear sorm can get more accurate in the surface failure curvature of the approximate evaluation than form model illustration of form and sorm is shown in fig 13 results of wavelet decomposition of ice loads from sec 2 are used as important references to study the uncertain effects of ice loads taking the results of wavelet decomposition level 2 level 5 as reference the probability models of four groups of c ice are established by choosing the ratio of different standard deviations to expectations at the same time uncertainties analysis model of eeoi can be established by taking fuel consumption rate b e ship propulsion efficiency η d c f η s and c ow as uncertainties with high sensitivity to eeoi as shown in table 2 because an accurate modeling of input distributions can be simply established or replaced from observed data normal distribution is assumed for all the random parameters including design variables uncertainty factor and the noises here furthermore assessing probability density functions from observed data is outside the scopes of the present work and therefore no further addressed the design objective eeoi is evaluated by the above four uncertainty analysis methods under the random disturbance of design variables and noises uncertainty analysis results are shown in table 3 as shown there are slight differences between the four methods analysis results for the same σ μ of c ice expectations μ of mvrm form and sorm are basically the same because the algorithm principle of mcs is different from others its analysis results show a slight difference from other algorithms for the different σ μ of c ice standard deviation σ increases with the increase of uncertainty of c ice and σ μ of eeoi changed from 3 to 10 this revealed that the uncertainty of ice load coefficient has an important and non negligible influence on eeoi through the uncertainty analysis probability distributions of different methods are shown in fig 14 because results of four analysis method have little difference only two typical results via mcs and form are shown form the vertical contrast of fig 11 the higher σ μ of c ice namely the higher the uncertainty of ice load the lower the probability of concentration of eeoi and the greater the dispersion whereas the expectations of eeoi nearly stay the same which also conforms to the above analysis rules probability distributions of different parameters are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that with the increase of σ μ of c ice the range of eeoi concentration probability is expanding and the analysis results of the four methods are nearly the same therefore in order to obtain design result with superior performance for parameter uncertainties it s necessary to conduct the uncertainty optimization design which would be researched in the following 4 2 uncertainty optimization of eeoi uncertainty optimization design uod is to find a robust and reliable result which has a superior performance under uncertainty influence and is far away from the failure surface in the case of uncertain parameters uod can effectively reduce infeasible probability thus to improve the design result s immunity to unpredictable uncertainties combining with the sensitivity calculation and uncertainty analysis flow process diagram of uod is shown in fig 16 this study focuses on the reliability of the results to uncertainties then mathematical model of uncertainty optimization problem can be expressed as in eq 11 11 m i n i m i z e f μ x σ x s u b j e c t t o g μ x σ x 0 x l s l δ x x x u s l δ x where x is random variables f and g is target function and constraints function of uod which are defined by expectation μ and standard deviation σ δx is

number n 13 g q μ n σ u p p e r l i m i t g q μ n σ l o w e r l i m i t considering the uncertainty of variables and uncertainty factors and aiming at finding the minimum μ and σ of eeoi uod is conducting as follows as its excellent accuracy evaluation performance and the effectiveness has been proved in the above study form order reliability method form is taken as the reliability analysis method uod model of minimum eeoi is shown in table 4 for comparison purposes a deterministic optimization design dod was also conducted in which the uncertainty factor and random noises were taken directly as the expected value in table 3 as an exploratory technique the adaptive simulated annealing asa algorithm junior et al 2012 which is very well suited to solving highly non linear problems with short running analysis codes was used in the dod and uod comparison of the two results is shown in table 5 as shown the eeoi results of the two methods dod and uod both showed improvements thus the effectiveness of the two can be verified however the optimization objective eeoi of the uod was slightly worse than the dod result which indicates that the uod has stronger immunity against disturbances by uncertain factors but at the cost of superior results meanwhile the standard deviation of the uod results increased with the increase in uncertainty of c ice thus the parameter uncertainty had a significant effect on the optimization results 5 conclusion with a focus on the energy efficiency of vessels in ice areas a minimum eeoi uncertainty optimization method was developed with the ice resistance coefficient as the uncertainty factor data mining of ice loads was studied via normal judgment and wavelet decomposition and the results were introduced in the subsequent uncertainty analysis and uncertainty optimization some conclusions can be drawn 1 although there are many local extremes of ice loads on ships sailing in ice areas there is still a relatively stable range of ice loads and this can be introduced as prior information into uncertainty analyses and optimization methods 2 an uncertainty analysis and optimization method based on fomr somr can obtain optimum results with an acceptable computing cost thus these methods are effective 3 under the same conditions both uod and dod can obtain better results than the initial scheme but the former considers unknown information so it can better reflect reality and thus be superior when the external environment has large uncertainties 4 with the deeper mining of uncertain data the uncertain information introduced into the uod will be more specific so the optimization results will be more satisfactory thus further research should be carried out to study the mining of other uncertain information and the management of data affecting ice area vessels energy efficiency acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 71831002

22537,the energy efficiency operation index eeoi one of schemes as a monitoring performance indicator related to seemp which is the mandatory regulation for ships in operation intending to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in maritime transportation it is closely related to vessel speed and the waterway environment among other factors finding the optimal main engine speed is a basic way to improve energy efficiency and reduce the eeoi ships in ice areas are also affected by the impact of ice loads during navigation it is critical to consider uncertainties when reducing the eeoi of ships in ice areas to achieve energy savings and reduce emissions in this study the data mining of ice loads was realized through wavelet decomposition which proved that it is reasonable to take ice loads into account as random uncertainty random variables this research introduces uncertainty analysis and optimization theory when considering ice loads and other important stochastic factors the main engine speed of ships in ice areas was then taken as the design variable by solving the minimum eeoi optimization model a robust and reliable speed optimal result was obtained and the effectiveness and advancement of this method was verified using a comparative example keywords eeoi ice zone ship speed optimization uncertainty 1 introduction the energy efficiency operation index eeoi an important indicator of ship energy efficiency stipulated by the international maritime organization imo was enforced in 2011 marine environment protection committee 2011 from an operational perspective the speed of the main engine is directly related to the speed of the ship while vessel speed is closely related to navigation resistance fuel consumption operational efficiency and other energy efficiency indicators therefore searching for the optimal engine speed to achieve speed optimization is a significant way to reduce eeoi and achieve energy savings and emission reductions huo 2017 studied the energy savings of ships during voyages by optimizing their route segments and subsection speeds with the aim of ascertaining the lowest total fuel consumption chen chen et al 2014 considered the influence of flow velocity on fuel consumption a relationship model between fuel consumption and main engine speed was established using measured data and the speed optimization of inland ships based on the eeoi was studied from the point of view of hull form optimization hou 2017 proposed a ship hull design method to achieve a minimum eeoi with a focus on the influence of speed perturbation norlund and gribkovskaia 2013 considered the effects of speed schedule and fleet size on optimal energy efficiency and studied energy savings and emission reductions in supply vessels the above research shows that the eeoi is closely related to speed the main engine and the external environment as a system composed of objective factors beyond a ship s own condition the navigation environment will directly or indirectly affect the ship s motion state and thus change the ship s operational energy efficiency however existing methods take each parameter as a determined value without considering the uncertainty of parameter perturbation directly in the calculation as a special type of ship ice area ships are affected not only by conventional hydrodynamic forces but also by the constant impact of ice loads in the course of sailing normally forces on ships would show probability distribution regularity but they would also be subjected to unpredictable extreme loads thus presenting typical uncertainties guo guo et al 2015 conducted a comparative analysis of three methods of ship resistance prediction in ice areas an empirical formula method a numerical simulation method and a model test method then discussed the scope of their application and offered suggestions suyuthi suyuthi et al 2012 focused on the prediction of the short term extreme values of local ice loads on ship hulls based on the exact classical method and this asymptotic approach tended to give a similar level of extreme values meanwhile wei chai et al 2018 introduced the classic extreme value theory to estimate extreme ice loads and presented the average conditional exceedance rate method which is directly related to vessel reliability the above research shows that the uncertainty of ice loads on ships in ice areas needs to be described using appropriate probabilistic or non probabilistic models before being used in subsequent optimization design calculations in engineering design both robustness and reliability need to be taken into account when considering the perturbation of system input parameters the former refers to the characteristics of maintaining the excellent and stable performance of the system under external interference while the latter emphasizes the system s ability to resist perturbation not to break through its design constraints and to continue to achieve specific functions the uncertain optimization objective eeoi and the failure probability of the constraints involved in engineering design are very sensitive to external disturbances response fluctuations due to parameter perturbations and small variations in uncertainty in the process indices due to estimation errors can lead to steep increases and decreases in the eeoi and constraints failure thus both reliability and robustness need to be considered during engineering design given the uncertainty factors in engineering design some theoretical studies have been carried out in recent years the unified uncertainty analysis method was proposed by means of a probability analysis via the first order reliability analysis form method and interval analysis based on evidence theory du 2008 aiming to resolve the optimization problem under mixed uncertainty reliability based optimization methods under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties have been studied with a focus on how to transform the reliability based optimization problem into a quasi equivalent deterministic formulation based on the information obtained in the uncertainty analysis yao et al 2013 with respect to ship design diez team hediez and zouetc 2013 chen et al 2015 diez et al 2017 2019a 2019b introduced the uncertain optimization idea into ship optimization design systems and a series of studies were subsequently conducted the design objective was developed from the principal dimensions to the hull lines from a single uncertain parameter to multiple uncertain parameters and from speed disturbance to wave response which reflects the idea from coarse to fine from simple to complex the uncertainty information involved in the above studies was based on relatively simple empirical assumptions thus deep mining of actual navigation data and introducing the generated uncertainties into the optimization system may better reflect the real background characteristics of the perturbation parameters this research was based on a section of actual ship navigation data in an ice area the uncertainty information of the ice load was then mined via a statistical analysis and wavelet decomposition based on the eeoi model deduced in reference huo 2017 an optimization model with the objective of achieving a minimum eeoi was established with the main engine speed as the design variable a sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty analysis of the optimization model were then carried out using various methods to reveal the effects of the actual ice load perturbation information on the output response to improve the robustness and reliability of the results an uncertainty optimization design of the analysis results was developed and satisfactory and feasible uncertainty optimization solutions were obtained using an appropriate method 2 data mining of uncertain probabilistic information of ice load ship hull plates sailing in an ice area are subjected to continuous load impacts from all directions and the forces can show certainty and uncertainty probability distribution characteristics short term loads could be considered as describing a more or less stationary condition both with respect to prevailing ice conditions and ship operation characteristics which could applied to analyze the stochastic time series such as the statistical parameters correlation functions power spectrum statistical distributions and also extreme value statistics etc by comparison long term load is more focused on the gentle seasonal variation which could not reflect meticulous uncertain data characteristics to further study the action rules of ice loads it was necessary to select a section of an actual ship s ice load data as the analysis sample the experimental data used in this study were derived from an expedition voyage in the west part of the barents sea during march 2007 the data were obtained via instrumentation with fiber optic strain sensors at several locations along the hull eight frames at the bow area and one frame at the starboard side shown in fig 1 to measure the strain responses suyuthi et al 2012 by integrating the pre assumed shear stress distribution over the cross section of the frame the total ice loads are obtained by intercepting a relatively stable time range it was established that the data amount was 556 and the frequency was 1 hz the data time sequence and the main statistical indicators are shown in fig 2 also fourier transform is used to conduct frequency analysis of the ice loads shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 2 most of the data fluctuate in the range below 20 kn m while the local extreme distribution is irregular and the maximum extreme reaches 140 it is can be seen from the statistical indicators that skewness and kurtosis of the data are large which indicates that it is far from the normal distribution thus that the time series of the measured ice induced load looks like a sequence of spikes from fig 3 there s no obvious peak frequency in it thus the frequency distribution of time series is scattered and random because of the existence of many local extremes distribution of original time series data is scattered in order to study the influence of dispersion it is necessary to exclude some local extremes which deviate from the mean and explore the statistical rules a series of box figures are obtained by excluding the local extreme of the region 20 144 according to a certain percentage of the interval ε ε 0 50 70 90 100 as is shown in fig 4 as seen more than 90 of the local extremes are located outside the upper quartile namely far away from the main area of data distribution thus would inevitably interfere with the statistical modeling of the data when extreme values above 20 kn m are excluded completely ε 100 skewness and kurtosis are more in line with the formation conditions of normal distribution therefore the ice loads on ship can be considered as non stationary complex time sequence and most of local extremes occur in the high frequency region as a relatively new signal analysis tool wavelet analysis can use small time windows in high frequency part and relatively large time windows in low frequency part castillo et al 2018 meanwhile wavelet has the function of frequency band filtering which can effectively remove noisy signal information in signal leaving a smooth signal information in order to extract the disturbance information of each level in time sequence and find out essential basic signal source this research decomposes the above ice load signal by wavelet transform daubechies wavelet is selected with a width of 3 and performs five level decomposition the results are shown in figs 5 8 by processing detail signal of the ice load wavelet ignoring the approximation signal of low frequency can reflect the baseline drift interference and the signal can be observed step by step from rough to fine figs 5 and 6 are the signal components of different levels extracted by wavelet decomposition which can reflect the effective characteristics of the signal detail information of fig 7 corresponds to the high frequency part which exists a large fluctuation component namely noise component results of wavelet decomposition and detail description are shown in table 1 where level 1 and level 5 are listed as representatives only because statistical characteristics of each level of wavelet in detail are quite similar it can be seen that the average value of decomposition in each level is not much different from median value which shows wavelet decomposition can effectively retain the desired characteristics of data whereas the standard deviation and range of decomposition at each level show a decreasing change which means that with the deepening of decomposition level the range of low frequency change of data is more and more prominent that is the noise interference is more and more weakened according to the statistical analysis of the extracted smooth part it can be seen that the low frequency main body of the signal is concentrated in a specific interval which means that although there are many local extremes in ice load there is still a relatively stable interval range thus the intervals can be used as reference for next step of uncertainty analysis and optimization parameters selection 3 eeoi optimization

probability thus to improve the design result s immunity to unpredictable uncertainties combining with the sensitivity calculation and uncertainty analysis flow process diagram of uod is shown in fig 16 this study focuses on the reliability of the results to uncertainties then mathematical model of uncertainty optimization problem can be expressed as in eq 11 11 m i n i m i z e f μ x σ x s u b j e c t t o g μ x σ x 0 x l s l δ x x x u s l δ x where x is random variables f and g is target function and constraints function of uod which are defined by expectation μ and standard deviation σ δx is

conducting as follows as its excellent accuracy evaluation performance and the effectiveness has been proved in the above study form order reliability method form is taken as the reliability analysis method uod model of minimum eeoi is shown in table 4 for comparison purposes a deterministic optimization design dod was also conducted in which the uncertainty factor and random noises were taken directly as the expected value in table 3 as an exploratory technique the adaptive simulated annealing asa algorithm junior et al 2012 which is very well suited to solving highly non linear problems with short running analysis codes was used in the dod and uod comparison of the two results is shown in table 5 as shown the eeoi results of the two methods dod and uod both showed improvements thus the effectiveness of the two can be verified however the optimization objective eeoi of the uod was slightly worse than the dod result which indicates that the uod has stronger immunity against disturbances by uncertain factors but at the cost of superior results meanwhile the standard deviation of the uod results increased with the increase in uncertainty of c ice thus the parameter uncertainty had a significant effect on the optimization results 5 conclusion with a focus on the energy efficiency of vessels in ice areas a minimum eeoi uncertainty optimization method was developed with the ice resistance coefficient as the uncertainty factor data mining of ice loads was studied via normal judgment and wavelet decomposition and the results were introduced in the subsequent uncertainty analysis and uncertainty optimization some conclusions can be drawn 1 although there are many local extremes of ice loads on ships sailing in ice areas there is still a relatively stable range of ice loads and this can be introduced as prior information into uncertainty analyses and optimization methods 2 an uncertainty analysis and optimization method based on fomr somr can obtain optimum results with an acceptable computing cost thus these methods are effective 3 under the same conditions both uod and dod can obtain better results than the initial scheme but the former considers unknown information so it can better reflect reality and thus be superior when the external environment has large uncertainties 4 with the deeper mining of uncertain data the uncertain information introduced into the uod will be more specific so the optimization results will be more satisfactory thus further research should be carried out to study the mining of other uncertain information and the management of data affecting ice area vessels energy efficiency acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant no 71831002

22538,in this study a commercial cfd code starccm is used to analyze the performance of a passive ocean plastic collector under rough sea conditions the cfd code was first validated by comparing with data from a scaled model experiment conducted in the towing water tank in national cheng kung university and it was proven to return accurate catch rate then thirty eight test cases were setup to investigate the effects of four different parameters namely ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density on the plastic collector s catch rate which is the percentage of incoming plastic debris intercepted by the plastic collector it was found that the parameters of wave length and plastic density posed very little effect on catch rate in contrast the effects of the other two parameters were significant two important thresholds were found and they were ocean current speed of 2 5 ms 1 and wave height of 0 4 m the catch rate remained at high level until these thresholds were reached the information found in this study is invaluable for the design of a practical passive ocean plastic collector keywords ocean plastic collection cfd turbulence model current speed wave height

an essential material for modern societies and our ways of life cannot go on without it it has been used far and wide in almost every aspect of our activities thanks to its many advantages such as very light and durable strong very cheap to make etc as a result the production of plastic has been sky rocketing especially during the past few decades today we produce more than 400 million tons of plastic every year which is about the same weight as the entire human population plastic europe 2013 and staedter 2017 although plastic waste is recycled a portion of which has entered and accumulated in our seas and oceans and ocean plastic junk has increasingly become a very serious problem especially for the marine ecosystem perkin 2015 some of these plastic debris are caught by giant ocean currents called gyres and have concentrated at some specified regions around the world one of such regions the most famous one is called great pacific garbage patch located between hawaii and california parker 2014 lebreton et al 2018 every year millions of sea birds and hundreds of thousands of marine animals die because of the ocean plastic pollution a good example showing how much plastic debris have poisoned our oceans is henderson island which is a very remote island located between new zealand and chile the island used to be reputed as the last pristine piece of land on earth but now its shore has become one of the most plastic polluted coasts in the world the plastic density is about 671 6 pieces per square meter which is much higher than the world average value of 239 4 piece per square meter lavers and bond 2017 ocean plastic debris can also produce hazards to our health through food chain small pieces of plastic debris can easily be mistakenly eaten by fish resulting in harmful chemical being transferred through the food chain which ends up consumed by human and causes damage to our health derraik 2002 hence this problem concerns not just the lives of millions of marine animals but also the welfare of ourselves in addition these plastic debris also cause staggering economic losses in fishing industry and damages to ocean vessels it is estimated that such economic loss is 1 27 billion in apec region alone annually in many developed countries after years of industrialization countless tons of debris including metal plastic glass clothes etc have been dump into seas and oceans among these different kinds of debris plastic debris is the majority fig 1 shows tons of plastic junk littered on a stretch of coast of peng hu island which is located at latitude 22 33 north and longitude 119 35 east such huge amount of debris is now suffocating fragile marine ecosystem and poisoning fishing products as fish is an important part in our diet everyone s health is at risk the ocean plastic problem has become so serious today we can no longer turn a blind eye on this problem some clean up acts must be planned and executed to significantly reduce the amount of ocean plastic debris conventional ocean plastic debris clean up techniques are based on vessels or divers with nets which simply fish plastic debris out of the ocean however in north pacific gyre alone plastic debris spread over an area covering millions of square kilometers conventional techniques will take thousands of years and spending billions of dollars to clean up moore and phillips 2011 furthermore conventional techniques also create by catch and co2 emission problems which can largely offset the benefit of cleaning the ocean an innovative cleanup concept is why moves through the oceans if the oceans can move thorough you this concept was first proposed by boyan slat who is the ceo of the ocean cleanup foundation under the framework of this concept a passive cleanup idea has been proposed which features an array of floating barriers anchored on ocean floor to capture plastic debris as it carried by natural ocean currents slat 2014 fig 2 illustrates the proposed cleanup system by the ocean cleanup foundation which consists of several collection stations and some floating barriers stretching over 100 km long a floating barrier in this case is basically a floating boom with a skirt extending some depth under water surface fig 2 b the system will intercept and concentrate floating plastic debris towards the collection stations where plastic debris is extracted out of the ocean and temporarily stored a collection vessel will be scheduled to visit these collection stations to collect all the debris and transport it back to land to be further processed it is estimated that the plastic debris at north pacific gyre will be cleaned in a short period of 5 years by this method a number of small scale trials have been conducted and gained some success this method can be deployed in any sea or ocean with strong ocean current for example in taiwan there is strong kuroshio current passing the portion of pacific ocean offshore the eastern coast and southern china sea current passing taiwan strait both of which can be explored to clean up ocean plastic debris surrounding taiwan the main advantages of passive ocean array collection method are 1 operation cost will be drastically reduced compared with conventional vessel and net methods making the plan more viable 2 the collected plastic can be converted into energy oil or new materials to partially offset the operational cost of the ocean array 3 since there is no net there will be no by catch problem and no harm will be done to the marine ecosystem computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely used to study problems associated with free surface and ocean flows such as marine engineering wave energy conversion marine pollution etc gaur and deo 2008 developed a computational tool for forecasting real time waves in the ocean wave information is vital for the operation of any ocean activity hence the technology developed by this study is very important atan et al 2019 employed cfd to study the impact on nearshore wave climate imposed by arrays of wave energy converters it was concluded that arrays of wave energy converters only reduced wave power by less than 1 at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shore and the reduction was even much less at level of 0 1 0 2 at a distance of 100 300 m from the shore this study implied using wave energy converters for renewable energy poses little effect of nearshore wave climate hamza et al 2015 used cfd to investigate the dispersion of water pollution by a point source discharged into the coast of tunisia they found the damage of such pollution on ecosystems is very serious the cfd study helped them to plan some measures to limit the degree of degradation of the environment the above studies demonstrate the usefulness of employing cfd for studying various marine engineering problems the ocean cleanup foundation have conducted some cfd studies and performed some experiments to prove the effectiveness of an ocean cleanup array slat 2014 although many parameters such as diameter and density of debris release depth speed of ocean current boom angle tilt angle have been investigated in these cfd studies many important factors have not been considered yet for example these studies ignore the effects of winds and waves all plastic particles are assumed to be spherical only low current speeds up to 0 15 ms 1 have been examined that is only calm sea conditions have been investigated in some ocean conditions high waves and winds can drive plastic debris to flow across the floating boom and seriously compromise the catch rate of debris furthermore a plastic debris is rarely spherical in shape and its geometry is usually irregular hence an ocean cleanup array designed based on the results of these studies could perform not as well as expected more elaborated cfd modeling is needed to help design a cleanup array that can perform in both calm and rough sea conditions in this study we employed a cfd method which considers wind and wave effects and simulated the behaviors of irregular plastic debris both calm and rough sea conditions were investigated an ocean plastic collector was designed and its performance was investigated through the cfd method the goal is to obtain useful information for designing an ocean cleanup array which can perform well in real sea conditions 2 mathematical model the ocean cleanup collector problem involves multiple mediums water and air and multiple phases gas liquid and solid some free surface model must be incorporated to simulate waves and their interaction with the collector s solid structure namely boom skirt and ballast moreover the interactions between plastic particles and fluid medium plastic particles themselves and plastic particles and collector structure need be considered to accurately estimate plastic particles trajectories and the trajectories of all plastic particles must be traced to calculate how many particles are captured by the array and how many have escaped since the scale of an ocean cleanup collector is very large the fluid flow is turbulent hence turbulence modeling is required with so many different mediums and physical mechanisms at play the physical model is highly complicated in this study the fluid flow is governed by reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and sst k ω model menter 1994 which has been proven to perform well in many industrial flows menter et al 2003 has been adopted for turbulence modeling the plastic collector is assumed to be rigid and is firmly anchored on the ocean floor so that it cannot move with the waves transport equation of volume of fluid vof is solved to simulate free surface hence the fluid governing equations can be expressed as continuity equation 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 momentum equation 2 ρ u i t x i ρ u j u i p x i x i μ μ t u i x i vof equation 3 ρ α t x i ρ u i α α d ρ d t where α v w a t e r v t o t a l is volume fraction of water a cell with α 0 means complete air cell and a cell with α 1 means complete water cell location of free surface is marked by the iso surface of α 0 5 all fluid properties are calculated using weighting based on α for example density is calculated by ρ ρ α w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α w a t e r the k ω sst models incorporates a blending factor allowing the model to utilize the original k ω model of wilcox 1988 in the inner region of the boundary layer and to switch to the standard k ε model in the outer region the k and ω equations are turbulence kinetic energy equation 4 ρ

following general formula 6 φ f 1 φ 1 1 f 1 φ 2 the above equation shows how the constants σ k σ ω γ β in the sst k ω model are derived φ 1 stands for the constants in the k ω model φ 2 represents the constants in the k ε model and φ represents the corresponding constants of the sst k ω model plastic debris are treated as a group of solid particles with different geometries and material properties and the motion of each particle is calculated by lagrange based discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 in this method the interactions among particles themselves and with solid boundaries are considered hence it can simulate the behaviors of plastic particles more accurately the momentum balance equation of a dem particle is 7 m p d v p d t f s f g f c where m p v p f s f g and f c are respectively particle s mass velocity surface force gravity force and contact force particle s surface force includes drag force pressure gradient force and virtual mass force 8 f s f d f p f v m these three forces are expressed as 9 f d 1 2 c d ρ a p v s v s f p v p p s f v m c v m ρ v p d v d t d v p d t where c d ρ a p v s v p p s c vm are respectively drag coefficient density of fluid

friction coefficient and angular velocity 3 experimental setup the cfd code used in this study is starccm a scaled model experiment has been conducted using the towing water tank in national cheng kung university to obtain data for validating the cfd code fig 3 shows the towing water tank this tank is 8 m in width 4 m in depth and 176 m in length a schematic of experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the main components of the setup are a scaled collector model a towing platform a wave height meter two cameras scaled model rigs and elevator a plastic particle release device and light bulbs the scaled model was fixed underneath a towing platform and was towed along the towing water tank to simulate the flow of ocean current meanwhile a wave machine produced a series of waves to simulate ocean waves a schematic of the scaled collector model is illustrated in fig 5 the model consists of a main body and two booms on either side of the body the main body is a hexagon with width length and depth of 0 285 m 0 285 and 0 315 m respectively there is a rectangular hole with 0 07 m in width and 0 14 m in height in the middle of the main body to serve as the collection hole for plastic particles once a plastic particle has passed this hole the particle is regarded as been successfully collected each of the two booms is a cylinder with a metal sheet which is to simulate collection skirt attached underneath and the boom angle is 35 the diameter and the length of the cylinder are 0 072 m and 0 9 m respectively and the length and width of the metal sheet are 0 9 m and 0 12 m respectively the metal sheet is tilted 10 backwards to simulate the effect of water pressure on collection skirt there is a support bar connecting the two booms to maintain their relative positions under the force of water current and waves during the experiment during an experiment the towing platform towed the scaled model until a constant speed is reached then plastic particles were released and their tracks were recorded until they either passed the scaled model s collection hole or escaped under the scaled model between two experiments there was a 30 min calming period allowing water waves to die down the experimental conditions are as follows towing platform speed was 0 4 ms 1 wave height was 0 05 m wave period was 1 6 s and the draft on the boom cylinder was 0 036 m under these conditions some waves can flow over the collector s arms to simulate the effects of rough sea conditions encountered by a real ocean collector consistent wave height is very important for this experiment hence a wave height meter was installed to monitor the variation of wave height a fragment of wave height reading is given in fig 6 the averaged heights of hill and valley are 0 0270 m and 0 0266 m respectively and the mean derivations of these two quantities are 8 13 and 6 60 respectively as the derivations are less than 10 the wave height can be considered as reasonably consistent the plastic particles in this experiment are spheres with a diameter of 0 03 m and density of 900 kgm 3 there were 4 release positions termed position 1 2 3 and 4 and they are located at the centerline of the model 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 65 m deviations from the centerline respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 cfd code validation fig 7 shows the computation domain of the scaled model the front surface is the inlet the rear surface is the outlet the bottom and lateral surfaces are walls the water depth is 3 5 m which is the same as the experiment a cross section of the computational mesh is given in fig 8 finer mesh density is concentrated towards the free surface and the plastic collector before the numerical results can be compared with experimental data grid and time step interval independence tests were conducted to find a proper mesh and time step interval for the cfd simulation on this problem five different meshes with time step interval fixed at 0 01 s and cell numbers of 2 400 000 3 500 000 5 700 000 14 000 000 and 22 000 000 respectively have been tested fig 9 a illustrates the tracks of a plastic particle released at the same position by these meshes three it can be noted that all tracks are very close especially the tracks by 5 700 000 14 000 000 and 22 000 000 cells this indicates that particle track is not very sensitive to mesh density and the mesh of 5 700 000 cells is fine enough to return grid independent solutions this mesh was then subjected to time step interval independence test using time step intervals of 0 02 s 0 01 s and 0 005 s and the results are given in fig 9 b in the test wave and current conditions and particle released position were so selected that the particle would escape underneath the plastic collector a situation suitable for testing sensitivity on time step interval the results show that there were very little different in particle tracks until the particle hit the skirt of plastic collector downstream the skirt the tracks returned by 0 01 s and 0 005 s were still very close to each other while that of 0 02 s veered away this indicates that the time step interval of 0 01 s is good enough to achieve time step interval independence solutions therefore the results obtained by the mesh of 5 700 000 cells with time step interval of 0 01 s were used to compare with the experimental data fig 10 show the comparison of the tracks of particles released respectively from the four release positions between experiment and numerical simulation the plot indicates that all particles experimental and numerical eventually entered the central collection hole proving the accuracy in prediction of particle catch rate by the numerical simulation it is also noticeable that the numerical tracks originated from release positions 1 and 2 are close to the experimental tracks the deviation of the track path between experiment and numerical simulation is generally larger near the boom where particles tracks were observed to be winding while particles were traveling alone the boom towards the central hole both experimental and numerical tracks exhibit such behavior this behavior is due to the stronger reflection waves near the boom that can temporarily push particles away from the boom the reason for the deviation in the particle tracks by the experiment and the numerical simulation could be rooted in the unsteadiness of experimental waves whose variations in wave height can be as high as 8 in contrast all the characteristics of numerical waves were steady and perfectly equal since the present flow is a highly transient problem a small deviation caused by the unsteadiness in waves at an upstream location can result in much larger differences in tracks at downstream locations overall the numerical tracks agree reasonably well with the experimental tracks and the predicted particle catch rate is the same as the experiment thus the correctness of the current numerical approach especially in predicting catch rate has been validated 4 2 full scale ocean plastic collector once the correctness of the numerical approach has been verified attention was directed towards full scale simulation to assess the performance of the present collector design fig 11 a illustrates the geometry of the full scale ocean plastic collector model its geometry is similar to the scaled model but is 33 times larger in size the boom has been extended and is 40 m in length the length of the open front of the collector that is from one boom s end to the other s end is 70 m the diameter of the boom is 1 m the width of the skirt is 2 4 m and it is tilted 10 backwards just like the scaled model as shown in fig 11 b the central hole is shaped like a race track and is 1 m in width and 2 m in height the ocean waves adopted in the simulation were fifth order waves which are closer to real ocean waves fenton 1985 there are many parameters that can affect the catch rate of an ocean plastic collector for example wind speed ocean current speed wave length wave height ocean depth collector boom angle or even the density of the plastic debris given the current problem is a transient problem with a typical solution time scale of 100 s and a time step of 0 01 s to investigate the effects of so many different parameters would require very huge computer resources therefore some simplification measures were implemented to reduce the number of parameters first wind speed and ocean current speed were assumed identical hence there is only one variable for the two parameters second the collector was assumed to be deployed off shore in deep water the water depth was kept constant third the boom angle was fixed at 35 in summary only the effects of four parameters have been investigated here namely wind ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density table 1 lists the conditions of all test cases of the full scale model there are 38 test cases and the ranges of wind ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density in these cases are 0 5 ms 1 to 4 0 ms 1 0 1 m 1 2 m and 2 m 10 m 800 kgm 3 to 980 kgm 3 respectively among these cases cases 1 6 are in calm sea conditions with small current speed and wave height cases 7 11 are designated to investigate the effect of wave length cases 12 14 are for examining the effect of plastic density and the rest of cases are for testing rougher sea conditions with larger current speed and wave height the mesh used for the full scale study consists of 4 099 421 cells this mesh has been determined after another grid independence test on the full scale model fig 12 shows plastic particles geometry and their release positions as shown in fig 12 a a single plastic particle consists of 36 spheres in different diameters collectively forming an irregular shape with a width of 0 1 m across in fig 12 b there are 100 release positions and they are evenly distributed along a line located 27 m in front of the central collection hole plastic particles were released 20 s after the start of simulation allowing the flow field to be well developed and being free of initial condition effect in each test case a total number of 100 plastic particles were released in a period of 1 s a simulation would continue until all particles either passed the central hole or escaped over or underneath the collector unit since plastic particle catch rate is the most important quantity to assess the collector s performance the conditions listed in table 1 can be classified into high catch rate and low catch rate conditions in high catch rate conditions the first 14 cases ocean current speed is generally slow and wave height is small fig 13 illustrates plastic particles distributions at three moments in case 3 which is a typical case in the high catch rate category in these cases the waves wouldn t flow over the top of the booms and plastic particles were floating on water surface most of the time since plastic particles were moving slowly due to low current speed they carried less momentum and their flow path was strongly influenced by water surface flow it is observable in fig 13 b that the booms of the collector forced the water surface flow to converge towards the central collection hole and there went with the plastic particles which also converged towards the collection hole as they were drifted forwards eventually they all passed the collection hole in an orderly way that those particles originated from the center of release line went in first and those near the edges of the release line went in last see fig 13 c it is also worth noting that the catch rates of cases 7 14 are all 100 indicating that the parameters of wave length and plastic density only play minor roles on catch rate hence the following discussion will be focused on the influence imposed by ocean current speed and wave height figs 14 and 15 respectively depict particle distributions in case 38 and case 36 both of which are in the low catch rate category in this category the ocean current speed is generally high and wave height is also large as the current speed increased both water and plastic particles were moving at higher speed hence they carried larger momentum which can easily overwhelm the barrier presented by the booms fig 14 b and c indicate that surface water and most of the plastic particles simply flew across the top of the booms furthermore as demonstrated in fig 15 b and c strong current and large wave height could result in another scenario that particles flew underneath the skirts of the booms in this scenario the large wave height drove the particles to move up and down in larger magnitude these particles thus possessed higher vertical momentum and could momentarily dive into water meanwhile as the current flow reached the boom it tended to split into two streams one flowing over the top of the boom and the other flowing underneath the boom skirt if the diving of a particle happened just before it approached a boom the particle could be carried by the underneath stream and escaped the boom barrier by going underneath the boom skirt the two cases demonstrate how unstable and complicated the flow field near the collector was such transient and highly unstable flow plus higher particle momentum makes a particle s flow path very unstable and unpredictable suggesting that the catch rate is also difficult to predict fig 16 a and b respectively show the effects of wave height and current speed on catch rate a general tendency concluded from the plots is that catch rate tends to drop as wave height or current speed increases however the red lines in both plots suggest that under very low current speed or wave height conditions catch rate can remain at high level until some thresholds the lowest lines in the two plots show that these thresholds are wave height of 1 2 m and current speed of 4 0 ms 1 it is also noticeable that the catch rate is a highly non linear function of wave height and current speed especially the green and black lines in fig 16 a and the blue line in fig 16 b fluctuate up and down as wave height or current speed increases nevertheless some operation conditions that yield high catch rate can be found these conditions are wave height is less than 0 4 m and current speed is lower than 2 5 ms 1 5 conclusions a passive ocean plastic debris collector has been designed and its performance under rough sea conditions was investigated by using a cfd method a scaled model experiment was conducted to provide data for validating the correctness of the cfd method compared with the experimental results the cfd method was proven to predict plastic particle tracks with reasonable accuracy and be able to return accurate prediction on catch rate then the cfd method was used to study the performance of the full scale ocean plastic collector a total of 38 cases were setup to investigate the effects of four parameters namely ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density on the collector s catch rate it was found that wave length and plastic density only exert little influence on catch rate hence the attention was focused on the parameters of ocean current speed and wave height some conclusions regarding their effects on catch rate can be drawn as follows 1 under low current speed and small wave height conditions the catch rate is 100 2 catch rate remains at high level until thresholds of wave height equal 0 4 m and current speed equal 2 5 ms 1 are reached 3 when wave height is 1 2 m or current speed is 4 0 ms 1 the catch rate is less than 10 given ocean current speed is normally much less than 2 5 ms 1 statnikov 2002 the results indicate that the present collector can perform well under high current speed conditions however the results seem to suggest that it cannot cope with large wave height in the present ocean plastic collector the booms are rigid and the entire device is assumed to be anchored firmly so it doesn t heave up and down with the waves in a real situation the booms are flexible and will heave up and down with the wave hence the relative wave height between the booms and ocean waves is much smaller than the absolute wave height adopted in the present study in the future the performance of the ocean plastic collector will be investigated by a cfd method that takes the movement of the booms into account acknowledgement this work was supported by the ministry of science and technology republic of china under the grant

an essential material for modern societies and our ways of life cannot go on without it it has been used far and wide in almost every aspect of our activities thanks to its many advantages such as very light and durable strong very cheap to make etc as a result the production of plastic has been sky rocketing especially during the past few decades today we produce more than 400 million tons of plastic every year which is about the same weight as the entire human population plastic europe 2013 and staedter 2017 although plastic waste is recycled a portion of which has entered and accumulated in our seas and oceans and ocean plastic junk has increasingly become a very serious problem especially for the marine ecosystem perkin 2015 some of these plastic debris are caught by giant ocean currents called gyres and have concentrated at some specified regions around the world one of such regions the most famous one is called great pacific garbage patch located between hawaii and california parker 2014 lebreton et al 2018 every year millions of sea birds and hundreds of thousands of marine animals die because of the ocean plastic pollution a good example showing how much plastic debris have poisoned our oceans is henderson island which is a very remote island located between new zealand and chile the island used to be reputed as the last pristine piece of land on earth but now its shore has become one of the most plastic polluted coasts in the world the plastic density is about 671 6 pieces per square meter which is much higher than the world average value of 239 4 piece per square meter lavers and bond 2017 ocean plastic debris can also produce hazards to our health through food chain small pieces of plastic debris can easily be mistakenly eaten by fish resulting in harmful chemical being transferred through the food chain which ends up consumed by human and causes damage to our health derraik 2002 hence this problem concerns not just the lives of millions of marine animals but also the welfare of ourselves in addition these plastic debris also cause staggering economic losses in fishing industry and damages to ocean vessels it is estimated that such economic loss is 1 27 billion in apec region alone annually in many developed countries after years of industrialization countless tons of debris including metal plastic glass clothes etc have been dump into seas and oceans among these different kinds of debris plastic debris is the majority fig 1 shows tons of plastic junk littered on a stretch of coast of peng hu island which is located at latitude 22 33 north and longitude 119 35 east such huge amount of debris is now suffocating fragile marine ecosystem and poisoning fishing products as fish is an important part in our diet everyone s health is at risk the ocean plastic problem has become so serious today we can no longer turn a blind eye on this problem some clean up acts must be planned and executed to significantly reduce the amount of ocean plastic debris conventional ocean plastic debris clean up techniques are based on vessels or divers with nets which simply fish plastic debris out of the ocean however in north pacific gyre alone plastic debris spread over an area covering millions of square kilometers conventional techniques will take thousands of years and spending billions of dollars to clean up moore and phillips 2011 furthermore conventional techniques also create by catch and co2 emission problems which can largely offset the benefit of cleaning the ocean an innovative cleanup concept is why moves through the oceans if the oceans can move thorough you this concept was first proposed by boyan slat who is the ceo of the ocean cleanup foundation under the framework of this concept a passive cleanup idea has been proposed which features an array of floating barriers anchored on ocean floor to capture plastic debris as it carried by natural ocean currents slat 2014 fig 2 illustrates the proposed cleanup system by the ocean cleanup foundation which consists of several collection stations and some floating barriers stretching over 100 km long a floating barrier in this case is basically a floating boom with a skirt extending some depth under water surface fig 2 b the system will intercept and concentrate floating plastic debris towards the collection stations where plastic debris is extracted out of the ocean and temporarily stored a collection vessel will be scheduled to visit these collection stations to collect all the debris and transport it back to land to be further processed it is estimated that the plastic debris at north pacific gyre will be cleaned in a short period of 5 years by this method a number of small scale trials have been conducted and gained some success this method can be deployed in any sea or ocean with strong ocean current for example in taiwan there is strong kuroshio current passing the portion of pacific ocean offshore the eastern coast and southern china sea current passing taiwan strait both of which can be explored to clean up ocean plastic debris surrounding taiwan the main advantages of passive ocean array collection method are 1 operation cost will be drastically reduced compared with conventional vessel and net methods making the plan more viable 2 the collected plastic can be converted into energy oil or new materials to partially offset the operational cost of the ocean array 3 since there is no net there will be no by catch problem and no harm will be done to the marine ecosystem computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely used to study problems associated with free surface and ocean flows such as marine engineering wave energy conversion marine pollution etc gaur and deo 2008 developed a computational tool for forecasting real time waves in the ocean wave information is vital for the operation of any ocean activity hence the technology developed by this study is very important atan et al 2019 employed cfd to study the impact on nearshore wave climate imposed by arrays of wave energy converters it was concluded that arrays of wave energy converters only reduced wave power by less than 1 at a distance between 1 and 3 km from the shore and the reduction was even much less at level of 0 1 0 2 at a distance of 100 300 m from the shore this study implied using wave energy converters for renewable energy poses little effect of nearshore wave climate hamza et al 2015 used cfd to investigate the dispersion of water pollution by a point source discharged into the coast of tunisia they found the damage of such pollution on ecosystems is very serious the cfd study helped them to plan some measures to limit the degree of degradation of the environment the above studies demonstrate the usefulness of employing cfd for studying various marine engineering problems the ocean cleanup foundation have conducted some cfd studies and performed some experiments to prove the effectiveness of an ocean cleanup array slat 2014 although many parameters such as diameter and density of debris release depth speed of ocean current boom angle tilt angle have been investigated in these cfd studies many important factors have not been considered yet for example these studies ignore the effects of winds and waves all plastic particles are assumed to be spherical only low current speeds up to 0 15 ms 1 have been examined that is only calm sea conditions have been investigated in some ocean conditions high waves and winds can drive plastic debris to flow across the floating boom and seriously compromise the catch rate of debris furthermore a plastic debris is rarely spherical in shape and its geometry is usually irregular hence an ocean cleanup array designed based on the results of these studies could perform not as well as expected more elaborated cfd modeling is needed to help design a cleanup array that can perform in both calm and rough sea conditions in this study we employed a cfd method which considers wind and wave effects and simulated the behaviors of irregular plastic debris both calm and rough sea conditions were investigated an ocean plastic collector was designed and its performance was investigated through the cfd method the goal is to obtain useful information for designing an ocean cleanup array which can perform well in real sea conditions 2 mathematical model the ocean cleanup collector problem involves multiple mediums water and air and multiple phases gas liquid and solid some free surface model must be incorporated to simulate waves and their interaction with the collector s solid structure namely boom skirt and ballast moreover the interactions between plastic particles and fluid medium plastic particles themselves and plastic particles and collector structure need be considered to accurately estimate plastic particles trajectories and the trajectories of all plastic particles must be traced to calculate how many particles are captured by the array and how many have escaped since the scale of an ocean cleanup collector is very large the fluid flow is turbulent hence turbulence modeling is required with so many different mediums and physical mechanisms at play the physical model is highly complicated in this study the fluid flow is governed by reynolds averaged navier stokes equations and sst k ω model menter 1994 which has been proven to perform well in many industrial flows menter et al 2003 has been adopted for turbulence modeling the plastic collector is assumed to be rigid and is firmly anchored on the ocean floor so that it cannot move with the waves transport equation of volume of fluid vof is solved to simulate free surface hence the fluid governing equations can be expressed as continuity equation 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 momentum equation 2 ρ u i t x i ρ u j u i p x i x i μ μ t u i x i vof equation 3 ρ α t x i ρ u i α α d ρ d t where α v w a t e r v t o t a l is volume fraction of water a cell with α 0 means complete air cell and a cell with α 1 means complete water cell location of free surface is marked by the iso surface of α 0 5 all fluid properties are calculated using weighting based on α for example density is calculated by ρ ρ α w a t e r ρ a i r 1 α w a t e r the k ω sst models incorporates a blending factor allowing the model to utilize the original k ω model of wilcox 1988 in the inner region of the boundary layer and to switch to the standard k ε model in the outer region the k and ω equations are turbulence kinetic energy equation 4 ρ

following general formula 6 φ f 1 φ 1 1 f 1 φ 2 the above equation shows how the constants σ k σ ω γ β in the sst k ω model are derived φ 1 stands for the constants in the k ω model φ 2 represents the constants in the k ε model and φ represents the corresponding constants of the sst k ω model plastic debris are treated as a group of solid particles with different geometries and material properties and the motion of each particle is calculated by lagrange based discrete element method dem cundall and strack 1979 in this method the interactions among particles themselves and with solid boundaries are considered hence it can simulate the behaviors of plastic particles more accurately the momentum balance equation of a dem particle is 7 m p d v p d t f s f g f c where m p v p f s f g and f c are respectively particle s mass velocity surface force gravity force and contact force particle s surface force includes drag force pressure gradient force and virtual mass force 8 f s f d f p f v m these three forces are expressed as 9 f d 1 2 c d ρ a p v s v s f p v p p s f v m c v m ρ v p d v d t d v p d t where c d ρ a p v s v p p s c vm are respectively drag coefficient density of fluid

friction coefficient and angular velocity 3 experimental setup the cfd code used in this study is starccm a scaled model experiment has been conducted using the towing water tank in national cheng kung university to obtain data for validating the cfd code fig 3 shows the towing water tank this tank is 8 m in width 4 m in depth and 176 m in length a schematic of experimental setup is shown in fig 4 the main components of the setup are a scaled collector model a towing platform a wave height meter two cameras scaled model rigs and elevator a plastic particle release device and light bulbs the scaled model was fixed underneath a towing platform and was towed along the towing water tank to simulate the flow of ocean current meanwhile a wave machine produced a series of waves to simulate ocean waves a schematic of the scaled collector model is illustrated in fig 5 the model consists of a main body and two booms on either side of the body the main body is a hexagon with width length and depth of 0 285 m 0 285 and 0 315 m respectively there is a rectangular hole with 0 07 m in width and 0 14 m in height in the middle of the main body to serve as the collection hole for plastic particles once a plastic particle has passed this hole the particle is regarded as been successfully collected each of the two booms is a cylinder with a metal sheet which is to simulate collection skirt attached underneath and the boom angle is 35 the diameter and the length of the cylinder are 0 072 m and 0 9 m respectively and the length and width of the metal sheet are 0 9 m and 0 12 m respectively the metal sheet is tilted 10 backwards to simulate the effect of water pressure on collection skirt there is a support bar connecting the two booms to maintain their relative positions under the force of water current and waves during the experiment during an experiment the towing platform towed the scaled model until a constant speed is reached then plastic particles were released and their tracks were recorded until they either passed the scaled model s collection hole or escaped under the scaled model between two experiments there was a 30 min calming period allowing water waves to die down the experimental conditions are as follows towing platform speed was 0 4 ms 1 wave height was 0 05 m wave period was 1 6 s and the draft on the boom cylinder was 0 036 m under these conditions some waves can flow over the collector s arms to simulate the effects of rough sea conditions encountered by a real ocean collector consistent wave height is very important for this experiment hence a wave height meter was installed to monitor the variation of wave height a fragment of wave height reading is given in fig 6 the averaged heights of hill and valley are 0 0270 m and 0 0266 m respectively and the mean derivations of these two quantities are 8 13 and 6 60 respectively as the derivations are less than 10 the wave height can be considered as reasonably consistent the plastic particles in this experiment are spheres with a diameter of 0 03 m and density of 900 kgm 3 there were 4 release positions termed position 1 2 3 and 4 and they are located at the centerline of the model 0 2 m 0 4 m and 0 65 m deviations from the centerline respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 cfd code validation fig 7 shows the computation domain of the scaled model the front surface is the inlet the rear surface is the outlet the bottom and lateral surfaces are walls the water depth is 3 5 m which is the same as the experiment a cross section of the computational mesh is given in fig 8 finer mesh density is concentrated towards the free surface and the plastic collector before the numerical results can be compared with experimental data grid and time step interval independence tests were conducted to find a proper mesh and time step interval for the cfd simulation on this problem five different meshes with time step interval fixed at 0 01 s and cell numbers of 2 400 000 3 500 000 5 700 000 14 000 000 and 22 000 000 respectively have been tested fig 9 a illustrates the tracks of a plastic particle released at the same position by these meshes three it can be noted that all tracks are very close especially the tracks by 5 700 000 14 000 000 and 22 000 000 cells this indicates that particle track is not very sensitive to mesh density and the mesh of 5 700 000 cells is fine enough to return grid independent solutions this mesh was then subjected to time step interval independence test using time step intervals of 0 02 s 0 01 s and 0 005 s and the results are given in fig 9 b in the test wave and current conditions and particle released position were so selected that the particle would escape underneath the plastic collector a situation suitable for testing sensitivity on time step interval the results show that there were very little different in particle tracks until the particle hit the skirt of plastic collector downstream the skirt the tracks returned by 0 01 s and 0 005 s were still very close to each other while that of 0 02 s veered away this indicates that the time step interval of 0 01 s is good enough to achieve time step interval independence solutions therefore the results obtained by the mesh of 5 700 000 cells with time step interval of 0 01 s were used to compare with the experimental data fig 10 show the comparison of the tracks of particles released respectively from the four release positions between experiment and numerical simulation the plot indicates that all particles experimental and numerical eventually entered the central collection hole proving the accuracy in prediction of particle catch rate by the numerical simulation it is also noticeable that the numerical tracks originated from release positions 1 and 2 are close to the experimental tracks the deviation of the track path between experiment and numerical simulation is generally larger near the boom where particles tracks were observed to be winding while particles were traveling alone the boom towards the central hole both experimental and numerical tracks exhibit such behavior this behavior is due to the stronger reflection waves near the boom that can temporarily push particles away from the boom the reason for the deviation in the particle tracks by the experiment and the numerical simulation could be rooted in the unsteadiness of experimental waves whose variations in wave height can be as high as 8 in contrast all the characteristics of numerical waves were steady and perfectly equal since the present flow is a highly transient problem a small deviation caused by the unsteadiness in waves at an upstream location can result in much larger differences in tracks at downstream locations overall the numerical tracks agree reasonably well with the experimental tracks and the predicted particle catch rate is the same as the experiment thus the correctness of the current numerical approach especially in predicting catch rate has been validated 4 2 full scale ocean plastic collector once the correctness of the numerical approach has been verified attention was directed towards full scale simulation to assess the performance of the present collector design fig 11 a illustrates the geometry of the full scale ocean plastic collector model its geometry is similar to the scaled model but is 33 times larger in size the boom has been extended and is 40 m in length the length of the open front of the collector that is from one boom s end to the other s end is 70 m the diameter of the boom is 1 m the width of the skirt is 2 4 m and it is tilted 10 backwards just like the scaled model as shown in fig 11 b the central hole is shaped like a race track and is 1 m in width and 2 m in height the ocean waves adopted in the simulation were fifth order waves which are closer to real ocean waves fenton 1985 there are many parameters that can affect the catch rate of an ocean plastic collector for example wind speed ocean current speed wave length wave height ocean depth collector boom angle or even the density of the plastic debris given the current problem is a transient problem with a typical solution time scale of 100 s and a time step of 0 01 s to investigate the effects of so many different parameters would require very huge computer resources therefore some simplification measures were implemented to reduce the number of parameters first wind speed and ocean current speed were assumed identical hence there is only one variable for the two parameters second the collector was assumed to be deployed off shore in deep water the water depth was kept constant third the boom angle was fixed at 35 in summary only the effects of four parameters have been investigated here namely wind ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density table 1 lists the conditions of all test cases of the full scale model there are 38 test cases and the ranges of wind ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density in these cases are 0 5 ms 1 to 4 0 ms 1 0 1 m 1 2 m and 2 m 10 m 800 kgm 3 to 980 kgm 3 respectively among these cases cases 1 6 are in calm sea conditions with small current speed and wave height cases 7 11 are designated to investigate the effect of wave length cases 12 14 are for examining the effect of plastic density and the rest of cases are for testing rougher sea conditions with larger current speed and wave height the mesh used for the full scale study consists of 4 099 421 cells this mesh has been determined after another grid independence test on the full scale model fig 12 shows plastic particles geometry and their release positions as shown in fig 12 a a single plastic particle consists of 36 spheres in different diameters collectively forming an irregular shape with a width of 0 1 m across in fig 12 b there are 100 release positions and they are evenly distributed along a line located 27 m in front of the central collection hole plastic particles were released 20 s after the start of simulation allowing the flow field to be well developed and being free of initial condition effect in each test case a total number of 100 plastic particles were released in a period of 1 s a simulation would continue until all particles either passed the central hole or escaped over or underneath the collector unit since plastic particle catch rate is the most important quantity to assess the collector s performance the conditions listed in table 1 can be classified into high catch rate and low catch rate conditions in high catch rate conditions the first 14 cases ocean current speed is generally slow and wave height is small fig 13 illustrates plastic particles distributions at three moments in case 3 which is a typical case in the high catch rate category in these cases the waves wouldn t flow over the top of the booms and plastic particles were floating on water surface most of the time since plastic particles were moving slowly due to low current speed they carried less momentum and their flow path was strongly influenced by water surface flow it is observable in fig 13 b that the booms of the collector forced the water surface flow to converge towards the central collection hole and there went with the plastic particles which also converged towards the collection hole as they were drifted forwards eventually they all passed the collection hole in an orderly way that those particles originated from the center of release line went in first and those near the edges of the release line went in last see fig 13 c it is also worth noting that the catch rates of cases 7 14 are all 100 indicating that the parameters of wave length and plastic density only play minor roles on catch rate hence the following discussion will be focused on the influence imposed by ocean current speed and wave height figs 14 and 15 respectively depict particle distributions in case 38 and case 36 both of which are in the low catch rate category in this category the ocean current speed is generally high and wave height is also large as the current speed increased both water and plastic particles were moving at higher speed hence they carried larger momentum which can easily overwhelm the barrier presented by the booms fig 14 b and c indicate that surface water and most of the plastic particles simply flew across the top of the booms furthermore as demonstrated in fig 15 b and c strong current and large wave height could result in another scenario that particles flew underneath the skirts of the booms in this scenario the large wave height drove the particles to move up and down in larger magnitude these particles thus possessed higher vertical momentum and could momentarily dive into water meanwhile as the current flow reached the boom it tended to split into two streams one flowing over the top of the boom and the other flowing underneath the boom skirt if the diving of a particle happened just before it approached a boom the particle could be carried by the underneath stream and escaped the boom barrier by going underneath the boom skirt the two cases demonstrate how unstable and complicated the flow field near the collector was such transient and highly unstable flow plus higher particle momentum makes a particle s flow path very unstable and unpredictable suggesting that the catch rate is also difficult to predict fig 16 a and b respectively show the effects of wave height and current speed on catch rate a general tendency concluded from the plots is that catch rate tends to drop as wave height or current speed increases however the red lines in both plots suggest that under very low current speed or wave height conditions catch rate can remain at high level until some thresholds the lowest lines in the two plots show that these thresholds are wave height of 1 2 m and current speed of 4 0 ms 1 it is also noticeable that the catch rate is a highly non linear function of wave height and current speed especially the green and black lines in fig 16 a and the blue line in fig 16 b fluctuate up and down as wave height or current speed increases nevertheless some operation conditions that yield high catch rate can be found these conditions are wave height is less than 0 4 m and current speed is lower than 2 5 ms 1 5 conclusions a passive ocean plastic debris collector has been designed and its performance under rough sea conditions was investigated by using a cfd method a scaled model experiment was conducted to provide data for validating the correctness of the cfd method compared with the experimental results the cfd method was proven to predict plastic particle tracks with reasonable accuracy and be able to return accurate prediction on catch rate then the cfd method was used to study the performance of the full scale ocean plastic collector a total of 38 cases were setup to investigate the effects of four parameters namely ocean current speed wave height wave length and plastic density on the collector s catch rate it was found that wave length and plastic density only exert little influence on catch rate hence the attention was focused on the parameters of ocean current speed and wave height some conclusions regarding their effects on catch rate can be drawn as follows 1 under low current speed and small wave height conditions the catch rate is 100 2 catch rate remains at high level until thresholds of wave height equal 0 4 m and current speed equal 2 5 ms 1 are reached 3 when wave height is 1 2 m or current speed is 4 0 ms 1 the catch rate is less than 10 given ocean current speed is normally much less than 2 5 ms 1 statnikov 2002 the results indicate that the present collector can perform well under high current speed conditions however the results seem to suggest that it cannot cope with large wave height in the present ocean plastic collector the booms are rigid and the entire device is assumed to be anchored firmly so it doesn t heave up and down with the waves in a real situation the booms are flexible and will heave up and down with the wave hence the relative wave height between the booms and ocean waves is much smaller than the absolute wave height adopted in the present study in the future the performance of the ocean plastic collector will be investigated by a cfd method that takes the movement of the booms into account acknowledgement this work was supported by the ministry of science and technology republic of china under the grant

22539,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model was conducted to determine the effects of boundary condition and aspect ratio on the vortex induced vibration viv response performance of a circular cylinder the structural displacement structural frequency phase portrait standing waves travelling waves and lift force coefficient for five different boundary conditions and four aspect ratios were compared the results showed that when the aspect ratio is small there are obvious differences between the viv displacements of the cylinder with different boundary conditions as the aspect ratio increases the differences become smaller for a small aspect ratio the viv displacements are dominated by the standing wave patterns along the total span of the cylinder however for a large aspect ratio the viv displacements are dominated by the standing wave and travelling wave patterns near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively the viv displacements vary with time and can be divided into three types periodic vibration with only one peak frequency quasi periodic vibration with two peak frequencies and chaotic vibration with many peak frequencies the phase portraits can also be split into three types an ellipse two elliptical rings and many ellipses keywords vortex induced vibration boundary condition aspect ratio wake oscillator model phase portrait lift force coefficient 1 introduction when vortices are shed in fluid flowing past a circular cylinder the cylinder will be subjected to periodic hydrodynamic forces over a certain reynolds number range if the cylinder is flexibly mounted the forces may result in structural vibration which is called vortex induced vibration viv blevins 2001 viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to many branches of ocean engineering for example viv influences the dynamics of petroleum production risers pipelines and mooring cables the viv of a structure is one of the key issues of the structural design because viv increases the dynamic load exerted on the structure and may cause fatigue damage the viv problems of cylindrical structures have led to a large number of experimental and numerical studies in recent decades research using experimental methods is very abundant vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 2017 kang and jia 2013 gao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however physical experiments are usually very expensive comparatively the costs of numerical methods are much lower two widely used numerical methods are based on the determination of the hydrodynamics forces acting on the structure one is the computational fluid dynamics cfd method which calculates the hydrodynamic forces directly using navier stokes equations gao et al 2018 the other is the wake oscillator method which determines the hydrodynamic forces empirically using a nonlinear oscillator compared with the cfd method the obvious advantage of the wake oscillator method is its small computational cost violette et al 2007 gao et al 2018 2019a thus the wake oscillator method has been widely used to predict the viv response of circular cylinders especially long flexible cylinders bishop and hassan 1964 first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van der pol equation to simulate the lift force exerted on a structure in viv then hartlen and currie 1970 developed the first wake oscillator model in which the structural vibration velocity was coupled with the van der pol equation since then the wake oscillator model has been used widely by many researchers to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders facchinetti et al 2004a farshidianfar and zanganeh 2010 xu et al 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 jin and dong 2016 postnikov et al 2017 kang et al 2018 srinil et al 2018 these studies can be divided into two types according to the directions of structural vibrations those that examine vibration only in the cross flow direction and those that examine vibration in both the cross flow and in line directions simultaneously in recent years as the use of long flexible cylinders in ocean engineering has accelerated the wake oscillator model has been further developed to predict the viv response performances of long flexible structures facchinetti et al 2004b mathelin and de langre 2005 violette et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ge et al 2009 doan and nishi 2015 low and srinil 2016 gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b the simplified flexible cylinder models can be divided into two types one type is an infinite tensioned cable model that mainly considers the contribution of the tension and neglects the bending stiffness contribution the other type is a finite tensioned beam model that considers the contributions of tension and bending stiffness simultaneously most previous studies using finite tensioned beam models focused on a flexible cylinder with pinned pinned ends however an actual flexible cylinder such as a production riser sometimes is not pinned but rather clamped or free the viv characteristics of a tensioned beam model with clamped or free ends are still not well understood and further research is necessary for example as the boundary conditions change how do the viv characteristics of a clamped or free ended cylinder vary furthermore how does the aspect ratio influence the effect of boundary conditions on viv responses in the study reported in this paper based on our earlier researches gao et al 2019a 2019b we evaluate a tensioned beam model with five different boundary conditions and four different aspect ratios although the viv responses of actual cylinders always take place in both the cross flow and in line directions for simplicity the analysis in this study was restricted to only vibrations in the cross flow direction the paper is split into five sections brief descriptions of the structural and wake oscillator models are given in section 2 in section 3 the numerical method for solving the coupled equations is introduced in detail in section 4 the viv responses of a circular cylinder with different boundary conditions and aspect ratios are systematically studied finally in section 5 conclusions based on the study results are presented 2 model description fig 1 shows a circular cylinder with length l and diameter d constrained to oscillate transversely in response to a stationary linear shear flow the origin o of the coordinate system is taken as the bottom end of the cylinder x is the flow direction z is the upward direction and y is the transverse vibration direction the tension and the bending stiffness are θ and ei respectively the shear parameter β which is defined as β u max u min u max is selected as a constant typical value of 0 7 where u max and u min are the maximum and minimum flow velocity respectively in this study as shown in fig 1 five different boundary conditions were considered pinned at both ends top end pinned and bottom end clamped top end clamped and bottom end pinned clamped at both ends and top end clamped and bottom end free considering the circular cylinder shown in fig 1 as a tensioned beam model the dimensional cross flow displacement y is described as ge et

a red solid circle in fig 2 is calculated using the values of y n m y n m 1 y n m 2 y n m 1 y n m 2 and y n 1 m which are denoted as six blue hollow circles in fig 2 as initial conditions the displacement y and the velocity y t along the span are all zero a one wavenumber excitation with amplitude of order o 10 3 is applied to the fluid variable q and the first time derivative q t is also set to zero the values of y 0 m and q 0 m when 0 m m can be directly determined from the initial conditions however when determining the values of y 1 m and q 1 m at n 0 and 0 m m the initial conditions y t 0 and q t 0 should be used combined with the expressions of y t and q t in eq 5 from y t 0 and q t 0 we have 7 y 1 m y 1 m q 1 m q 1 m substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the values of y 1 m

fig 2 and eq 6 for n 2 the values of y n m 2 m m 2 can be directly obtained without boundary conditions however to determine the four values of y n m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder the boundary conditions must be used five different boundary conditions were evaluated in this study introduced as follows a boundary condition i the cylinder is pinned at both ends meaning that the displacements and the bending moments at the top and bottom ends are always zero expressed as 9 y 0 t 2 y 0 t z 2 0 y l d t 2 y l d t z 2 0 combined with the expression of 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 10 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 b boundary condition ii the cylinder is pinned at the top end and clamped at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the bending moment at the top end are zero and the displacement and the rotational angle at the bottom end are zero expressed as 11 y 0 t y 0 t z 0 y l d t 2 y l d t z 2 0 combined with the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 12 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 c boundary condition iii the cylinder is clamped at the top end and pinned at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the rotational angle at the top end are zero and the displacement and the bending moment at the bottom end are zero expressed as 13 y 0 t 2 y 0 t z 2 0 y l d t y l d t z 0 combined with the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 14 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 d boundary condition iv the cylinder is clamped at both ends meaning that the displacements and rotational angles at both the top and bottom ends are zero expressed as 15 y 0 t y 0 t z 0 y l d t y l d t z 0 combined with the expression of y z in eq 5 we have 16 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 e boundary condition v the cylinder is clamped at the top end and free at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the rotational angle at the top end are zero and the bending moment and the shear force at the bottom end are zero expressed as 17 y l d t y l d t z 0 2 y 0 t z 2 3 y 0 t z 3 0 in boundary condition v the expression 3 y z 3 of second order should be used and can be formulated as 18 3 y z 3 t t n z z m y n m 2 2 y n m 1 2 y n m 1 y n m 2 2 δ z 3 combined with eq 18 and the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 19 y n 1 2 y n 0 y n 1 y n 2 y n 2 4 y n 1 4 y n 0 y n m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 substituting eqs 10 12 14 16 and 19 into the first expression of eq 6 the four values of y n 1 m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder can be obtained then the values of q n 1 m can be evaluated based on the second expression of eq 6 to simplify the presentation of results and discussion in section 4 we refer to boundary conditions as i ii iii iv and v to represent pinned at both ends top end pinned while bottom end clamped top end clamped while bottom end pinned clamped at both ends and top end clamped while bottom end free respectively the numerical method used in the present work had been validated in the previous researches violette et al 2007 gao et al 2019a furthermore in order to assure the robustness of the method the independency tests of the step sizes in both time and space domains as well as the initial excitation condition were also conducted gao et al 2019b therefore no additional validation and independency tests were performed here 4 results and discussion the work presented in this paper is a continuation of our earlier researches gao et al 2019a in the previous studies we focused on the effect of the flow profile on the viv characteristics of a long cylinder however in this study we concentrated on the effect of boundary condition and aspect ratio on the viv characteristics of a circular cylinder thus we used a constant stationary linear shear flow profile β 0 7 as described in section 3 five different boundary conditions were used to analyze the effects of boundary condition on viv likewise four different aspect ratios l d 100 200 500 and 2000 were used to study the effects of aspect ratio although the values of c d c l0 and st are dependent on reynolds number re it is common practice to assume c d 1 2 c l0 0 3 and st 0 20 in the sub critical range 300 re 1 5 105 facchinetti et al 2004a the other parameters used in this study had the same values as those used in our earlier research gao et al 2019a i e μ 2 785 c 23 6 and b 303 the values of empirical parameters a and ε were selected as a 12 and ε 0 3 as suggested by facchinetti et al 2004a furthermore δz 1 and δt 0 001 were used to discretize the space and time domains respectively an overview of the main performances of the structural displacement is given in section 4 1 the spectral analysis of the structural displacement is described in section 4 2 finally in section 4 3 the main performance of fluid forces is investigated the selected time intervals in the analyses represented stable vibration time after the initial transient vibration had stopped 4 1 space time evolutions of viv displacement fig 3 shows the root mean square rms values of the dimensionless displacements along the span for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios for the cylinder with small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv responses are dominated by the first mode for the five different boundary conditions the maximum rms displacement of the cylinder with boundary condition i is the largest and the maximum rms displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions ii and iii are intermediate compared with those resulting from boundary conditions i ii and iii the maximum rms displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions iv and v have a smaller order of magnitude the first top row in fig 3 clearly shows that for small aspect ratio l d 100 the curvature for pinned ends and the slope for clamped ends of the rms displacements are zero the largest rms values occur near the midpoint of the cylinder for boundary conditions i ii iii and iv however for boundary condition v the largest rms value occurs at the free end as shown in the second row of fig 3 when the aspect ratio is increased to l d 200 as the boundary condition changes from i to v the maximum rms displacement of the cylinder tends to decrease and the values change in the same order there exist one wave trough and two wave peaks along the span indicating that the viv responses are dominated by the second mode the locations corresponding to wave trough and wave peak are named node and anti node respectively the obvious different rms displacements between nodes and anti nodes show that the viv responses are dominated by the standing wave behavior however the rms displacements at the nodes are not zero instead they are a little larger than zero illustrating that the viv responses also have a slight travelling wave behavior in other words the viv responses are mixtures of standing wave and travelling wave patterns when the aspect ratio is l d 500 for all five boundary conditions the viv responses are dominated by the fifth mode and the maximum values of the rms displacements are very near each other the viv responses are a combination of standing waves and travelling waves as for l d 200 and dominated by the standing wave behavior along the total length of the cylinder however compared with l d 200 the travelling wave behavior for l d 500 is more obvious as the aspect ratio is further increased to l d 2000 the maximum rms displacements for the five different boundary conditions are very close to each other and similar to those for l d 500 however for l d 2000 the viv responses that are dominated by the standing waves only occur near the ends of the cylinder in contrast at locations near the midpoint the responses are dominated by the travelling waves fig 4 shows the structural displacements versus time and span location for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios the same characteristics of the viv displacements shown in fig 3 are also detected again in fig 4 for l d 200 500 and 2000 all the viv displacements are comprised of standing wave and travelling wave patterns for l d 200 and 500 along the total length of the cylinder compared with the standing wave behaviors the traveling wave behaviors are much less pronounced for l d 2000 the standing waves and travelling waves dominate the viv response near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively the directions of the travelling waves for l d 2000 are obvious from the wave forms presented in the fourth row of fig 4 and they are oriented from the high velocity zone to the low velocity zone i e negative z direction because the travelling wave directions are always from a power in region to a power out region a logical conclusion is that the power in region is located at the high velocity zone while the power out region is located at the low velocity zone 4 2 spectral analysis of the structural response fig 5 8 show the time series the amplitude spectra and the phase portraits for l d 100 200 500 and 2000 respectively it was notable that the horizontal coordinate y in the phase portrait is the dimensionless vibration displacement and the vertical coordinate y t is the corresponding dimensionless vibration velocity four typical locations i e z l d 0 5 0 25 0 1 and 0 5 were selected for studying the response characteristics of the viv displacement for l d 100 200 500 and 2000 respectively a stable time from t 2000 to t 2500 was selected to study how the characteristics of the displacements varied with time the fast fourier transform analysis was conducted for this stable time period to study the vibration frequency characteristics the phase portraits given in the third column of fig 5 8 illustrate the displacement characteristics vividly fig 5 shows that when l d 100 for boundary conditions i ii and iii the viv displacements are very periodic with respect to time and display mono frequency characteristics the distribution of the viv response frequencies are very concentrated indicating narrow band characteristics as the boundary condition is changed from iii to iv and v the vibration amplitudes are significantly decreased and the viv displacements are chaotic over time displaying multi frequency characteristics the distributions of the viv frequencies are spread widely presenting broad band characteristics the periodic and chaotic characteristics of the viv displacements are also reflected very well in the phase portraits as shown in the third column of fig 5 for periodic vibrations the phase portraits are regularly repeatable and appear as an ellipse however for chaotic vibrations the phase portraits become unrepeatable and display very chaotic characteristics comprised of many ellipses when l d is increased to 200 for boundary conditions i ii iii and iv the viv displacements are all very periodic with time and have only one peak frequency however for condition v the viv displacement changes to quasi periodic and has two peak frequencies the distribution of each frequency displays narrow band characteristics compared with the amplitude at the dominant peak frequency the amplitude at the subordinate peak frequency is much smaller and can be ignored the phase portraits for conditions i ii iii and iv all appear as a regular ellipse in contrast for condition v the phase portrait shows as an elliptical ring with a small bandwidth from the comparison of the viv responses for five different boundary conditions both the vibration amplitude and the vibration frequency are not sensitive to the boundary condition when l d 500 for conditions i ii and iii the viv displacement characteristics are all periodic with one single peak frequency and the corresponding phase portraits appear as an ellipse as the boundary condition is changed to iv and v the viv amplitudes decrease a little and the viv frequencies become quasi periodic characteristics with two obvious peak frequencies furthermore the phase portraits are mainly comprised of two wide band elliptical rings as l d is further increased to 2000 for all five boundary conditions the viv displacements are all chaotic over time and the response frequencies are widely spread with many peak frequencies the phase portraits for all conditions are composed of many ellipses from the third column of fig 8 as the boundary condition changes the vibration amplitudes for conditions ii and iii are a little smaller than those for conditions i iv and v although the subordinate peak frequencies are distributed differently the dominant frequencies and the frequency bands remain stable when the boundary condition changes from the above analysis it can be seen that the viv response characteristics have three types periodic characteristics with only one peak frequency quasi periodic characteristics with two peak frequencies and chaotic characteristics with many peak frequencies furthermore these three different types of viv response characteristics have also been reflected very well from the phase portraits an ellipse two elliptical rings and many ellipses correspond to the periodic quasi periodic and chaotic characteristics respectively except for the very small aspect ratio 100 among the other three aspect ratios 200 500 and 2000 the vibration amplitude the dominant frequency and the frequency band are all not very sensitive to the boundary condition 4 3 space time evolutions of lift force we also studied the lift force coefficient acting on the structure the instantaneous lift force coefficient c l z t exerted on the cylinder can be written as 20 c l z t c l 0 q z t 2 after obtaining the lift force coefficient during the stable vibration time the rms values of the lift force coefficient can be expressed as follows 21 c l 1 n i 1 i n c l i c l rms 1 n i 1 i n c l i c l 2 where n denotes the number of samples taken fig 9 presents the rms values of the lift force coefficients along the cylinder span for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios the first row of fig 9 shows that when l d 100 the maximum rms value of the lift force coefficient for boundary condition i is largest and those for boundary conditions ii and iii are intermediate while those for boundary conditions iv and iv are the smallest it is worth noticing that for boundary condition v the rms values of the lift force remain almost constant along the total cylinder span comparing the second third and fourth rows of fig 9 with the corresponding rows of fig 3 shows clearly that the characteristics of the lift force coefficient along the span are very similar to the characteristics of the vibration displacement along the span illustrating that the lift force coefficient is closely related to the viv displacement strictly speaking the lift force coefficient is the dimensionless force component in phase with the vibration velocity so that the instantaneous energy transferred from the fluid to the structure can be expressed as the lift force coefficient multiplied by the corresponding vibration velocity newman and karniadakis 1997 there also exist several troughs and peaks for the lift force coefficient along the cylinder span the wave peak value and wave trough value of the lift force coefficients are located near the anti node and node of the viv displacement respectively fig 10 presents the variation of the lift force coefficient versus time and span location over a selected time interval t 2000 2020 for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios an overview of fig 10 shows that for l d 200 500 and 2000 the lift force coefficients have very similar patterns to the viv displacements illustrated in fig 4 the lift force coefficients are also obviously comprised of standing wave patterns and travelling wave patterns however for the small aspect ratio l d 100 and boundary conditions i ii and iii the lift force coefficients display slight travelling wave patterns while the viv displacement shows absolute standing wave patterns for boundary conditions iv and v the patterns of the lift force coefficient are much more chaotic compared with the viv displacements 5 conclusions the effect of five different boundary conditions of a circular cylinder pinned at both ends top end pinned while bottom end clamped top end clamped while bottom end pinned clamped at both ends and top end clamped while bottom end free and four aspect ratios l d 100 200 500 and 2000 on the viv responses of the cylinder were studied numerically a standard central finite difference method of the second order was used to solve the coupling equations of a structural model and wake oscillator model the viv response characteristics including structural displacement structural frequency phase portrait standing wave and travelling wave patterns of the displacement and lift force coefficient were determined and systematically evaluated based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 there are obvious differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions compared with those for boundary conditions i ii and iii the viv displacements for condition iv and v are much smaller as the aspect ratio is increased to 200 the differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions decrease when the aspect ratio is further increased to 500 and 2000 the differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions become even smaller and can be considered negligible 2 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv displacement has absolute standing wave patterns caused by the domination of the first mode when the aspect ratio has other larger values l d 200 500 and 2000 the viv displacements are dominated by higher modes and composed of standing wave and travelling wave patterns the direction of the travelling wave is preferentially oriented from the high velocity zone to the low velocity zone among these three aspect ratios the viv displacements for l d 200 and 500 are dominated by the standing waves along the entire span of the cylinder however for l d 2000 the viv displacements are dominated by the standing waves and travelling waves near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively furthermore the standing wave and travelling wave behaviors are not sensitive to the boundary condition 3 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions i ii and iii are very periodic and have only one peak frequency however the displacements become very chaotic and have many peak frequencies for conditions iv and v when the aspect ratio is 200 and 500 the viv displacements can be divided into two types one that is very periodic with one peak frequency and one that is quasi periodic with two peak frequencies when the aspect ratio is further increased to 2000 the viv displacements for all five boundary conditions are chaotic and have many peak frequencies 4 from the comparison of the vibration responses for different boundary conditions except for the small aspect ratio l d 100 the main vibration characteristics the vibration amplitude the dominant frequency and the frequency band for the other aspect ratios l d 200 500 and 2000 are all not very sensitive to the boundary condition based on this important finding as to a flexible cylinder l d 200 in sake of the simplicity we can use the viv characteristics for a cylinder with boundary condition i pinned pinned ends to approximately represent the viv characteristics for a cylinder with all other boundary conditions which can significantly reduce the cost of the study especially when the study is conducted using the experimental method acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation

22539,a numerical study based on a wake oscillator model was conducted to determine the effects of boundary condition and aspect ratio on the vortex induced vibration viv response performance of a circular cylinder the structural displacement structural frequency phase portrait standing waves travelling waves and lift force coefficient for five different boundary conditions and four aspect ratios were compared the results showed that when the aspect ratio is small there are obvious differences between the viv displacements of the cylinder with different boundary conditions as the aspect ratio increases the differences become smaller for a small aspect ratio the viv displacements are dominated by the standing wave patterns along the total span of the cylinder however for a large aspect ratio the viv displacements are dominated by the standing wave and travelling wave patterns near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively the viv displacements vary with time and can be divided into three types periodic vibration with only one peak frequency quasi periodic vibration with two peak frequencies and chaotic vibration with many peak frequencies the phase portraits can also be split into three types an ellipse two elliptical rings and many ellipses keywords vortex induced vibration boundary condition aspect ratio wake oscillator model phase portrait lift force coefficient 1 introduction when vortices are shed in fluid flowing past a circular cylinder the cylinder will be subjected to periodic hydrodynamic forces over a certain reynolds number range if the cylinder is flexibly mounted the forces may result in structural vibration which is called vortex induced vibration viv blevins 2001 viv of cylindrical structures is of practical interest to many branches of ocean engineering for example viv influences the dynamics of petroleum production risers pipelines and mooring cables the viv of a structure is one of the key issues of the structural design because viv increases the dynamic load exerted on the structure and may cause fatigue damage the viv problems of cylindrical structures have led to a large number of experimental and numerical studies in recent decades research using experimental methods is very abundant vandiver et al 2009 song et al 2011 2017 kang and jia 2013 gao et al 2015 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 however physical experiments are usually very expensive comparatively the costs of numerical methods are much lower two widely used numerical methods are based on the determination of the hydrodynamics forces acting on the structure one is the computational fluid dynamics cfd method which calculates the hydrodynamic forces directly using navier stokes equations gao et al 2018 the other is the wake oscillator method which determines the hydrodynamic forces empirically using a nonlinear oscillator compared with the cfd method the obvious advantage of the wake oscillator method is its small computational cost violette et al 2007 gao et al 2018 2019a thus the wake oscillator method has been widely used to predict the viv response of circular cylinders especially long flexible cylinders bishop and hassan 1964 first proposed a self exciting and self limiting van der pol equation to simulate the lift force exerted on a structure in viv then hartlen and currie 1970 developed the first wake oscillator model in which the structural vibration velocity was coupled with the van der pol equation since then the wake oscillator model has been used widely by many researchers to predict the viv responses of rigid cylinders facchinetti et al 2004a farshidianfar and zanganeh 2010 xu et al 2010 srinil and zanganeh 2012 jin and dong 2016 postnikov et al 2017 kang et al 2018 srinil et al 2018 these studies can be divided into two types according to the directions of structural vibrations those that examine vibration only in the cross flow direction and those that examine vibration in both the cross flow and in line directions simultaneously in recent years as the use of long flexible cylinders in ocean engineering has accelerated the wake oscillator model has been further developed to predict the viv response performances of long flexible structures facchinetti et al 2004b mathelin and de langre 2005 violette et al 2007 xu et al 2008 ge et al 2009 doan and nishi 2015 low and srinil 2016 gao et al 2018 2019a 2019b the simplified flexible cylinder models can be divided into two types one type is an infinite tensioned cable model that mainly considers the contribution of the tension and neglects the bending stiffness contribution the other type is a finite tensioned beam model that considers the contributions of tension and bending stiffness simultaneously most previous studies using finite tensioned beam models focused on a flexible cylinder with pinned pinned ends however an actual flexible cylinder such as a production riser sometimes is not pinned but rather clamped or free the viv characteristics of a tensioned beam model with clamped or free ends are still not well understood and further research is necessary for example as the boundary conditions change how do the viv characteristics of a clamped or free ended cylinder vary furthermore how does the aspect ratio influence the effect of boundary conditions on viv responses in the study reported in this paper based on our earlier researches gao et al 2019a 2019b we evaluate a tensioned beam model with five different boundary conditions and four different aspect ratios although the viv responses of actual cylinders always take place in both the cross flow and in line directions for simplicity the analysis in this study was restricted to only vibrations in the cross flow direction the paper is split into five sections brief descriptions of the structural and wake oscillator models are given in section 2 in section 3 the numerical method for solving the coupled equations is introduced in detail in section 4 the viv responses of a circular cylinder with different boundary conditions and aspect ratios are systematically studied finally in section 5 conclusions based on the study results are presented 2 model description fig 1 shows a circular cylinder with length l and diameter d constrained to oscillate transversely in response to a stationary linear shear flow the origin o of the coordinate system is taken as the bottom end of the cylinder x is the flow direction z is the upward direction and y is the transverse vibration direction the tension and the bending stiffness are θ and ei respectively the shear parameter β which is defined as β u max u min u max is selected as a constant typical value of 0 7 where u max and u min are the maximum and minimum flow

profile and is expressed as ω f z u z u ref as introduced before u max is chosen as the reference velocity u ref thus ω f z at the top end of the cylinder is 1 and ω f z at a random location z of the cylinder can be expressed as ω f z 1 β βz l d in eq 4 μ is the mass ratio μ m ρd 2 m is the mass number m c l0 16π2 st 2 μ facchinetti et al 2004a and c and b are the dimensionless tension and

method of the second order in both the time and space domains supposing the total calculated time t total can be divided into n segments and space length l d can be divided into m segments each time

dimensionless parameters y and q at location z m with time t n are denoted as y n m and q n m respectively the related partial derivatives of the second order with respect to y and q in eq 4 can be expressed as 5 y t t t n z z m y n 1 m y n 1 m 2 δ t 2 y t 2 t t n z z m y n 1 m y n 1 m 2 y n m δ t 2 q t t t n z z m q n 1 m q n 1 m 2 δ t 2 q t 2 t t n z z m q n 1 m q n 1 m 2 q n m δ t 2 2 y z 2 t

a red solid circle in fig 2 is calculated using the values of y n m y n m 1 y n m 2 y n m 1 y n m 2 and y n 1 m which are denoted as six blue hollow circles in fig 2 as initial conditions the displacement y and the velocity y t along the span are all zero a one wavenumber excitation with amplitude of order o 10 3 is applied to the fluid variable q and the first time derivative q t is also set to zero the values of y 0 m and q 0 m when 0 m m can be directly determined from the initial conditions however when determining the values of y 1 m and q 1 m at n 0 and 0 m m the initial conditions y t 0 and q t 0 should be used combined with the expressions of y t and q t in eq 5 from y t 0 and q t 0 we have 7 y 1 m y 1 m q 1 m q 1 m substituting eq 7 into eq 6 the values of y 1 m

fig 2 and eq 6 for n 2 the values of y n m 2 m m 2 can be directly obtained without boundary conditions however to determine the four values of y n m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder the boundary conditions must be used five different boundary conditions were evaluated in this study introduced as follows a boundary condition i the cylinder is pinned at both ends meaning that the displacements and the bending moments at the top and bottom ends are always zero expressed as 9 y 0 t 2 y 0 t z 2 0 y l d t 2 y l d t z 2 0 combined with the expression of 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 10 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 b boundary condition ii the cylinder is pinned at the top end and clamped at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the bending moment at the top end are zero and the displacement and the rotational angle at the bottom end are zero expressed as 11 y 0 t y 0 t z 0 y l d t 2 y l d t z 2 0 combined with the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 12 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 c boundary condition iii the cylinder is clamped at the top end and pinned at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the rotational angle at the top end are zero and the displacement and the bending moment at the bottom end are zero expressed as 13 y 0 t 2 y 0 t z 2 0 y l d t y l d t z 0 combined with the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 14 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 d boundary condition iv the cylinder is clamped at both ends meaning that the displacements and rotational angles at both the top and bottom ends are zero expressed as 15 y 0 t y 0 t z 0 y l d t y l d t z 0 combined with the expression of y z in eq 5 we have 16 y n 1 0 0 y n 1 y n 1 y n 1 m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 e boundary condition v the cylinder is clamped at the top end and free at the bottom end meaning that the displacement and the rotational angle at the top end are zero and the bending moment and the shear force at the bottom end are zero expressed as 17 y l d t y l d t z 0 2 y 0 t z 2 3 y 0 t z 3 0 in boundary condition v the expression 3 y z 3 of second order should be used and can be formulated as 18 3 y z 3 t t n z z m y n m 2 2 y n m 1 2 y n m 1 y n m 2 2 δ z 3 combined with eq 18 and the expressions of y z and 2 y z 2 in eq 5 we have 19 y n 1 2 y n 0 y n 1 y n 2 y n 2 4 y n 1 4 y n 0 y n m 0 y n m 1 y n m 1 substituting eqs 10 12 14 16 and 19 into the first expression of eq 6 the four values of y n 1 m m 0 1 m 1 and m near the two ends of the cylinder can be obtained then the values of q n 1 m can be evaluated based on the second expression of eq 6 to simplify the presentation of results and discussion in section 4 we refer to boundary conditions as i ii iii iv and v to represent pinned at both ends top end pinned while bottom end clamped top end clamped while bottom end pinned clamped at both ends and top end clamped while bottom end free respectively the numerical method used in the present work had been validated in the previous researches violette et al 2007 gao et al 2019a furthermore in order to assure the robustness of the method the independency tests of the step sizes in both time and space domains as well as the initial excitation condition were also conducted gao et al 2019b therefore no additional validation and independency tests were performed here 4 results and discussion the work presented in this paper is a continuation of our earlier researches gao et al 2019a in the previous studies we focused on the effect of the flow profile on the viv characteristics of a long cylinder however in this study we concentrated on the effect of boundary condition and aspect ratio on the viv characteristics of a circular cylinder thus we used a constant stationary linear shear flow profile β 0 7 as described in section 3 five different boundary conditions were used to analyze the effects of boundary condition on viv likewise four different aspect ratios l d 100 200 500 and 2000 were used to study the effects of aspect ratio although the values of c d c l0 and st are dependent on reynolds number re it is common practice to assume c d 1 2 c l0 0 3 and st 0 20 in the sub critical range 300 re 1 5 105 facchinetti et al 2004a the other parameters used in this study had the same values as those used in our earlier research gao et al 2019a i e μ 2 785 c 23 6 and b 303 the values of empirical parameters a and ε were selected as a 12 and ε 0 3 as suggested by facchinetti et al 2004a furthermore δz 1 and δt 0 001 were used to discretize the space and time domains respectively an overview of the main performances of the structural displacement is given in section 4 1 the spectral analysis of the structural displacement is described in section 4 2 finally in section 4 3 the main performance of fluid forces is investigated the selected time intervals in the analyses represented stable vibration time after the initial transient vibration had stopped 4 1 space time evolutions of viv displacement fig 3 shows the root mean square rms values of the dimensionless displacements along the span for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios for the cylinder with small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv responses are dominated by the first mode for the five different boundary conditions the maximum rms displacement of the cylinder with boundary condition i is the largest and the maximum rms displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions ii and iii are intermediate compared with those resulting from boundary conditions i ii and iii the maximum rms displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions iv and v have a smaller order of magnitude the first top row in fig 3 clearly shows that for small aspect ratio l d 100 the curvature for pinned ends and the slope for clamped ends of the rms displacements are zero the largest rms values occur near the midpoint of the cylinder for boundary conditions i ii iii and iv however for boundary condition v the largest rms value occurs at the free end as shown in the second row of fig 3 when the aspect ratio is increased to l d 200 as the boundary condition changes from i to v the maximum rms displacement of the cylinder tends to decrease and the values change in the same order there exist one wave trough and two wave peaks along the span indicating that the viv responses are dominated by the second mode the locations corresponding to wave trough and wave peak are named node and anti node respectively the obvious different rms displacements between nodes and anti nodes show that the viv responses are dominated by the standing wave behavior however the rms displacements at the nodes are not zero instead they are a little larger than zero illustrating that the viv responses also have a slight travelling wave behavior in other words the viv responses are mixtures of standing wave and travelling wave patterns when the aspect ratio is l d 500 for all five boundary conditions the viv responses are dominated by the fifth mode and the maximum values of the rms displacements are very near each other the viv responses are a combination of standing waves and travelling waves as for l d 200 and dominated by the standing wave behavior along the total length of the cylinder however compared with l d 200 the travelling wave behavior for l d 500 is more obvious as the aspect ratio is further increased to l d 2000 the maximum rms displacements for the five different boundary conditions are very close to each other and similar to those for l d 500 however for l d 2000 the viv responses that are dominated by the standing waves only occur near the ends of the cylinder in contrast at locations near the midpoint the responses are dominated by the travelling waves fig 4 shows the structural displacements versus time and span location for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios the same characteristics of the viv displacements shown in fig 3 are also detected again in fig 4 for l d 200 500 and 2000 all the viv displacements are comprised of standing wave and travelling wave patterns for l d 200 and 500 along the total length of the cylinder compared with the standing wave behaviors the traveling wave behaviors are much less pronounced for l d 2000 the standing waves and travelling waves dominate the viv response near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively the directions of the travelling waves for l d 2000 are obvious from the wave forms presented in the fourth row of fig 4 and they are oriented from the high velocity zone to the low velocity zone i e negative z direction because the travelling wave directions are always from a power in region to a power out region a logical conclusion is that the power in region is located at the high velocity zone while the power out region is located at the low velocity zone 4 2 spectral analysis of the structural response fig 5 8 show the time series the amplitude spectra and the phase portraits for l d 100 200 500 and 2000 respectively it was notable that the horizontal coordinate y in the phase portrait is the dimensionless vibration displacement and the vertical coordinate y t is the corresponding dimensionless vibration velocity four typical locations i e z l d 0 5 0 25 0 1 and 0 5 were selected for studying the response characteristics of the viv displacement for l d 100 200 500 and 2000 respectively a stable time from t 2000 to t 2500 was selected to study how the characteristics of the displacements varied with time the fast fourier transform analysis was conducted for this stable time period to study the vibration frequency characteristics the phase portraits given in the third column of fig 5 8 illustrate the displacement characteristics vividly fig 5 shows that when l d 100 for boundary conditions i ii and iii the viv displacements are very periodic with respect to time and display mono frequency characteristics the distribution of the viv response frequencies are very concentrated indicating narrow band characteristics as the boundary condition is changed from iii to iv and v the vibration amplitudes are significantly decreased and the viv displacements are chaotic over time displaying multi frequency characteristics the distributions of the viv frequencies are spread widely presenting broad band characteristics the periodic and chaotic characteristics of the viv displacements are also reflected very well in the phase portraits as shown in the third column of fig 5 for periodic vibrations the phase portraits are regularly repeatable and appear as an ellipse however for chaotic vibrations the phase portraits become unrepeatable and display very chaotic characteristics comprised of many ellipses when l d is increased to 200 for boundary conditions i ii iii and iv the viv displacements are all very periodic with time and have only one peak frequency however for condition v the viv displacement changes to quasi periodic and has two peak frequencies the distribution of each frequency displays narrow band characteristics compared with the amplitude at the dominant peak frequency the amplitude at the subordinate peak frequency is much smaller and can be ignored the phase portraits for conditions i ii iii and iv all appear as a regular ellipse in contrast for condition v the phase portrait shows as an elliptical ring with a small bandwidth from the comparison of the viv responses for five different boundary conditions both the vibration amplitude and the vibration frequency are not sensitive to the boundary condition when l d 500 for conditions i ii and iii the viv displacement characteristics are all periodic with one single peak frequency and the corresponding phase portraits appear as an ellipse as the boundary condition is changed to iv and v the viv amplitudes decrease a little and the viv frequencies become quasi periodic characteristics with two obvious peak frequencies furthermore the phase portraits are mainly comprised of two wide band elliptical rings as l d is further increased to 2000 for all five boundary conditions the viv displacements are all chaotic over time and the response frequencies are widely spread with many peak frequencies the phase portraits for all conditions are composed of many ellipses from the third column of fig 8 as the boundary condition changes the vibration amplitudes for conditions ii and iii are a little smaller than those for conditions i iv and v although the subordinate peak frequencies are distributed differently the dominant frequencies and the frequency bands remain stable when the boundary condition changes from the above analysis it can be seen that the viv response characteristics have three types periodic characteristics with only one peak frequency quasi periodic characteristics with two peak frequencies and chaotic characteristics with many peak frequencies furthermore these three different types of viv response characteristics have also been reflected very well from the phase portraits an ellipse two elliptical rings and many ellipses correspond to the periodic quasi periodic and chaotic characteristics respectively except for the very small aspect ratio 100 among the other three aspect ratios 200 500 and 2000 the vibration amplitude the dominant frequency and the frequency band are all not very sensitive to the boundary condition 4 3 space time evolutions of lift force we also studied the lift force coefficient acting on the structure the instantaneous lift force coefficient c l z t exerted on the cylinder can be written as 20 c l z t c l 0 q z t 2 after obtaining the lift force coefficient during the stable vibration time the rms values of the lift force coefficient can be expressed as follows 21 c l 1 n i 1 i n c l i c l rms 1 n i 1 i n c l i c l 2 where n denotes the number of samples taken fig 9 presents the rms values of the lift force coefficients along the cylinder span for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios the first row of fig 9 shows that when l d 100 the maximum rms value of the lift force coefficient for boundary condition i is largest and those for boundary conditions ii and iii are intermediate while those for boundary conditions iv and iv are the smallest it is worth noticing that for boundary condition v the rms values of the lift force remain almost constant along the total cylinder span comparing the second third and fourth rows of fig 9 with the corresponding rows of fig 3 shows clearly that the characteristics of the lift force coefficient along the span are very similar to the characteristics of the vibration displacement along the span illustrating that the lift force coefficient is closely related to the viv displacement strictly speaking the lift force coefficient is the dimensionless force component in phase with the vibration velocity so that the instantaneous energy transferred from the fluid to the structure can be expressed as the lift force coefficient multiplied by the corresponding vibration velocity newman and karniadakis 1997 there also exist several troughs and peaks for the lift force coefficient along the cylinder span the wave peak value and wave trough value of the lift force coefficients are located near the anti node and node of the viv displacement respectively fig 10 presents the variation of the lift force coefficient versus time and span location over a selected time interval t 2000 2020 for different boundary conditions and different aspect ratios an overview of fig 10 shows that for l d 200 500 and 2000 the lift force coefficients have very similar patterns to the viv displacements illustrated in fig 4 the lift force coefficients are also obviously comprised of standing wave patterns and travelling wave patterns however for the small aspect ratio l d 100 and boundary conditions i ii and iii the lift force coefficients display slight travelling wave patterns while the viv displacement shows absolute standing wave patterns for boundary conditions iv and v the patterns of the lift force coefficient are much more chaotic compared with the viv displacements 5 conclusions the effect of five different boundary conditions of a circular cylinder pinned at both ends top end pinned while bottom end clamped top end clamped while bottom end pinned clamped at both ends and top end clamped while bottom end free and four aspect ratios l d 100 200 500 and 2000 on the viv responses of the cylinder were studied numerically a standard central finite difference method of the second order was used to solve the coupling equations of a structural model and wake oscillator model the viv response characteristics including structural displacement structural frequency phase portrait standing wave and travelling wave patterns of the displacement and lift force coefficient were determined and systematically evaluated based upon these results the following conclusions are justified 1 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 there are obvious differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions compared with those for boundary conditions i ii and iii the viv displacements for condition iv and v are much smaller as the aspect ratio is increased to 200 the differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions decrease when the aspect ratio is further increased to 500 and 2000 the differences of the viv displacements for different boundary conditions become even smaller and can be considered negligible 2 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv displacement has absolute standing wave patterns caused by the domination of the first mode when the aspect ratio has other larger values l d 200 500 and 2000 the viv displacements are dominated by higher modes and composed of standing wave and travelling wave patterns the direction of the travelling wave is preferentially oriented from the high velocity zone to the low velocity zone among these three aspect ratios the viv displacements for l d 200 and 500 are dominated by the standing waves along the entire span of the cylinder however for l d 2000 the viv displacements are dominated by the standing waves and travelling waves near the cylinder ends and midpoint respectively furthermore the standing wave and travelling wave behaviors are not sensitive to the boundary condition 3 for a cylinder with a small aspect ratio l d 100 the viv displacements of the cylinder with boundary conditions i ii and iii are very periodic and have only one peak frequency however the displacements become very chaotic and have many peak frequencies for conditions iv and v when the aspect ratio is 200 and 500 the viv displacements can be divided into two types one that is very periodic with one peak frequency and one that is quasi periodic with two peak frequencies when the aspect ratio is further increased to 2000 the viv displacements for all five boundary conditions are chaotic and have many peak frequencies 4 from the comparison of the vibration responses for different boundary conditions except for the small aspect ratio l d 100 the main vibration characteristics the vibration amplitude the dominant frequency and the frequency band for the other aspect ratios l d 200 500 and 2000 are all not very sensitive to the boundary condition based on this important finding as to a flexible cylinder l d 200 in sake of the simplicity we can use the viv characteristics for a cylinder with boundary condition i pinned pinned ends to approximately represent the viv characteristics for a cylinder with all other boundary conditions which can significantly reduce the cost of the study especially when the study is conducted using the experimental method acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation
