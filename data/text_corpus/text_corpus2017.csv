10085,multiple inlet rice irrigation miri reduces water use and production costs for arkansas rice producers while the water savings from miri have been analyzed experimentally the overall holistic benefits of miri rice have yet to be quantified compared to cascade flooded rice as such this study evaluates the economic and environmental benefits of miri resulting from publicly funded research in this case the rice checkoff to continue improvements in agricultural sustainability miri acreage associated with public funding from the rice checkoff for 2002 2018 were identified by county using producer surveys based on miri acreage we estimate cost savings the future value of water conserved and reductions in environmental impacts comparing cascade and miri rice irrigation cost savings range from a low of 138 230 in 2002 to a high of 825 535 in 2008 with a total of 8 655 687 for all years we estimated the total in situ value of conserved water from miri adoption associated with the rice checkoff to be 11 133 069 if future funding decisions for miri were only made based on cost savings it would underestimate the average total yearly benefits by 128 additionally a life cycle assessment was used to compare single score ecosystem impacts for cascade versus miri flooded rice based on 1 kg of rice produced the single score calculated as the externalized environmental cost for producing one kg of rice using cascade versus miri flooded rice was estimated at 0 4066 and 0 3814 respectively a reduction of 0 0252 per kg of miri produced rice finally a benefit cost ratio of 79 1 was calculated after accounting for savings in situ value and reduced environmental impacts provided by miri adoption due to the rice checkoff this study provides stakeholders a holistic picture of the economic impacts and environmental benefits provided by water conservation funded projects such as miri in arkansas keywords rice irrigation miri life cycle assessment groundwater aquifer sustainability 1 introduction research conducted on public goods related to agriculture such as water quantity and quality and air quality are often funded from public sources such as usda nrcs state organizations and regionally by agricultural commodity boards and commodity checkoff programs evaluations of the effectiveness of such research typically include estimating cost revenue and profitability implications for producers and changes to the quantity and quality of the public good in question alston 2010 alston et al 1995 alston and pardey 1996 delonge et al 2016 hurley et al 2014 nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2018 as public funding becomes increasingly scarce and more competitive holistic valuations of the economic and environmental benefits of public good conservation are increasingly important for project funding decisions programs focused on increased water use efficiency for agricultural producers often only highlight the benefits to producers in the form of reduced costs but fail to encompass the future value of conserved water and the potential for additional environmental benefits associated with reduced irrigation failure to include the holistic benefits from water conservation programs may lead to reduced future funding or misallocation of funds to programs that have seemingly more direct and tangible benefits in the near term understanding how targeted public funding for agricultural irrigation conservation may impact the future value and quantity of water will be critical for addressing water scarcity and allocating funds effectively hurley et al 2014 turral et al 2010 this study illustrates the economic benefits derived from a publicly funded commodity board water conservation program multiple inlet rice irrigation miri as well as the potential for undervaluation in program benefits if environmental benefits are not monetized rice requires a substantial amount of water for production 30 ac in ac where an acre inch is equivalent to 3630 cubic feet or 27 154 gallons and has a relatively large environmental impact compared to other row crops li et al 2004 linquist et al 2015 2012 nalley et al 2014 massey et al 2018 as such rice is an ideal crop for assessing the benefits of public funding for water conservation programs and their impact on both producers and the environment rice consumption accounts for more than half the daily caloric intake of over three billion people globally most of whom are located in rapidly growing low income countries muthayya et al 2014 although accounting for only 1 3 of global production the united states ranks as a top five rice exporter usda fas 2020 in 2017 2019 the u s exported an annual average of 2 9 million metric tons of milled rice to over 120 countries which accounted for 6 5 of the global rice trade globally rice is thinly traded with only around nine percent of production entering international markets as most rice supplies are consumed domestically usda fas 2020 in 2017 2019 arkansas accounted for 47 of total rice production in the united states usda nass 2020 arkansas rice producers face decreased groundwater availability and increased pumping depths to access sufficient water for production reba et al 2017 the most common rice flooding method in arkansas and the lower mississippi river valley lmrv is single inlet irrigation in single inlet irrigation water is applied to the uppermost paddy sub field areas divided by levees for flood depth control and allowed to gravity flow or cascade from one paddy to the next until the lowest paddy has reached a desired flood depth massey et al 2018 cascade flooding requires that paddies be overfilled so that water moves downfield over the levee gates by nature this is inefficient requires excess water as overfilling paddies leads to water runoff from storms excess tailwater from flooding excess seepage and increased exposure to evaporation omer et al 2019 these inefficiencies increase the cost of rice production and increase overall water requirements nalley et al 2015 omer et al 2019 to give scale to current and future water concerns for the rice industry in arkansas and the lmrv the arkansas natural resource commission anrc 2019 estimated that only 44 2 of current groundwater withdrawals from the underlying mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa are sustainable for rice irrigation said another way total irrigation would have to be reduced by more than half to maintain current groundwater levels meaning that withdrawals are less than or equal to recharge rates groundwater furnishes 63 of the state s total consumption of water and 95 of the groundwater used is from the alluvial aquifer moreover agriculture accounts for 98 of the total water that is pumped from the mrvaa anrc 2019 in the 2019 annual groundwater report anrc recommended that the state work toward conservation research and education extension to bring about more sustainable water usage miri an alternative flooding practice in arkansas rice production distributes water through flexible pipes polytubing directly into paddy fields according to surface elevations across the field rather than using gravity to distribute water via spillways from paddy to paddy fig 1 concurrent water distribution prevents unnecessary seepage and leakage massey et al 2018 omer et al 2019 vories et al 2005 by adjusting the gates miri allows a producer to fill all paddies simultaneously reducing deep percolation and seepage through the outside levees vories et al 2005 with miri each paddy fills at the same time making it easier to manage paddy water depths and minimize tail water runoff other benefits may include the reduction of cold water effects in upper paddies which can cause stunting or reduce grain yield in the top paddy due to cold water shock miri distributes the cold water equally across all of the paddies at the same time allowing for some acclimation to ambient temperatures in the polytubing miri also provides faster flood establishment reducing the potential loss of urea applied just before establishing the flood and in large fields can reduce the time by half 7 days to 3 days for example moreover less in season flood depth management is required as once the gates are set the field floods evenly negating the need to adjust spills or levee gates throughout the growing season massey et al 2018 vories et al 2005 to implement miri the water flow into the field must be balanced with the area of each paddy and the flow is metered by the installation of holes and gates placed at each levee one of the initial challenges of implementing miri was the difficulty for rice producers to measure the area of each paddy and determine the placement and size of holes in the polytubing a critical barrier to miri adoption a mobile app 2017 2015 and educational extension program were initiated to help rice producers plan miri fields through funding from the arkansas rice check off program apple ios and android programs were developed and between 2015 and 2019 rice producers planned miri on 143 730 acres with 452 users and over 2 05 million feet of polytubing henry 2020 irrigation schools extension led county meetings and on farm demonstrations were conducted during the span of the study some with funding from the arkansas rice checkoff program the mobile app estimates paddy areas and makes the calculations necessary to develop a plan in only a few minutes where it may have previously taken hours to measure and manually calculate the hole numbers and gate settings massey et al 2018 used 260 site years of daily rainfall to estimate required irrigation for conventional irrigation and miri the authors found that miri required 24 8 less water than single inlet flooding nearly identical to the results of a similar on farm study by vories et al 2005 the conclusion of the massey et al 2018 study was that these water savings should be highlighted to producers and reinforced by university extension efforts in addition henry et al 2016 suggests more funding is needed for educating rice producers on the importance of irrigation management and demonstrating the water conserving benefits of miri much of the existing research on public funding and checkoff programs has focused on the benefits to producers mainly in the form of yield improvements from primary research or demand export enhancement from funding directed toward generic promotional activities however commodity programs and other public research funds like nrcs usda nifa and nsf among others which invest in water conservation programs may result in additional benefits in the form of cost reductions and improvements in environmental outcomes programs such as nrcs eqip pay for the adoption of efficiency enhancing irrigation technology which can help producers reduce irrigation costs and conserve water for producers cost reductions in rice production are important as in 2020 it was estimated that irrigation energy costs alone were 14 24 and 12 62 of total operating expenses for conventional and hybrid rice per acre respectively uaex 2020 these costs are significant but generally partial reductions in costs do not attract public funding for research at the same levels as yield enhancing research cost savings contributions from checkoff programs and other forms of public funding warrant further attention specifically with respect to water management in rice production in arkansas the arkansas rice checkoff allocates funds collected by an assessment of 1 35 cents per bushel of rice grown in arkansas paid by the grower and an assessment of 1 35 cents per bushel paid by the first point of sale buyer the funds raised by the grower assessment are reserved for the research program while buyer funds are reserved for domestic and international promotion and market development activities this study focuses on the 1 35 cents paid for by the grower and attempts to quantify the benefits that growers receive from this contribution specifically we focus on those funds allocated towards water saving research and dissemination in arkansas rice production although this study examines a checkoff program its methodology could be used to evaluate the benefits of water conservation research from any source of funds private or public between 2004 and 2018 the arkansas rice checkoff has allocated 47 58 million 2018 usd for research with a yearly high of 4 03 million in 2014 and a low of 2 8 million in 2013 these funds are allocated across breeding pathology agronomy entomology irrigation enhancement and other programs germane to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of arkansas rice over the same period irrigation enhancement has received just 2 31 of total rice checkoff funds on average this could be explained by the fact that water has rarely been a binding constraint to production in the arkansas delta however increasing attention is being given to critical groundwater zones due to the falling water table attributed to overdrafting by irrigators in the alluvial aquifer anrc 2019 reba et al 2017 usgs 2005 water savings do not increase yield and water has traditionally been seen as a long term issue not an immediate problem affecting current yields and profit moreover producers often focus on short term research benefits as it solves today s problem and tangible results can be demonstrated quickly as a result of this short term focus disproportionately less funding is allocated to long term issues such as groundwater sustainability benefit cost analysis is important when evaluating public funding such as those provided by commodity checkoff programs as it provides concrete comparisons of programs for producers who are the source of the checkoff funds to internalize returns on investments for checkoff programs that are solely yield enhancing such as plant breeding these benefits are relatively easy to estimate and straightforward to evaluate shew et al 2018 some commodity checkoff programs focus on market promotion in an effort to shift the demand curve each of these generic advertising checkoff groups struggles with the measurement of benefits and performance of their programs as the benefits are harder to quantify than simple yield enhancement usda ams 2020 previous literature has reported checkoff benefit to cost ratios bcrs for beef of 5 6 1 pork 4 8 1 dairy 4 6 1 flowers 6 6 1 prunes 2 7 1 eggs 4 7 1 and processed oranges between 2 1 and 4 1 depending on the model type and time period of analysis alston 2010 alston et al 1995 alston and pardey 1996 capps et al 2016 kaiser 2003 schmit et al 1997 ward 2006 williams 1999 the bcrs for soybeans and grain sorghum the only two grains with a national checkoff program were estimated to be 6 5 1 and 8 5 1 respectively williams et al 2014 evaluation of checkoff and other public funding decisions for programs like miri often only look at cost reductions as the primary benefits and do not consider the future value of conserved inputs such as water or energy attributed to the adoption of a new technology additionally they often do not consider potential positive environmental externalities beyond input savings the united nations 2018 stated that lack of information about the value of water in an aquifer is of great global concern moreover a continual problem for quantifying the benefits of water saving technologies is the challenge of placing a future value on conserved water addicott and fenichel 2019 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 fenichel et al 2016 torell et al 1990 understanding the factors determining the economic value of groundwater is important for creating effective irrigation policy and informing groundwater management and withdrawal decisions feinerman and knapp 1983 hrozencik et al 2017 qureshi et al 2012 tsur and graham tomasi 1991 hydroeconomic models and contingent valuation studies have been the primary tools for non market valuation of groundwater and irrigation policy assessment harou et al 2009 hrozencik et al 2017 mulligan et al 2014 suter et al 2021 manning et al 2020 conducted an integrated assessment valuation of groundwater in kansas finding that water retirement programs more than pay for themselves over a 15 year time horizon fenichel et al 2016 estimated the value of an acre inch of water to be 1 41 1 52 in 2020 usd for the kansas high plains aquifer similarly sampson et al 2019 found that the average marginal value of water in storage in the high plains aquifer of kansas ranged from 0 22 to 1 32 per acre in in this study we use previously estimated groundwater values from kovacs and durand morat 2020 as essential components of building a bcr for rice checkoff funding toward miri adoption in the mrvaa the source of water for this study kovacs and durand morat 2020 used a spatial dynamic aquifer model to estimate the price of water under the assumption of unlimited lateral flow bathtub aquifer they quantified the future value of groundwater at 19 20 per thousand cubic meters 1 97 per acre in not including the cost of extraction this price represents the in situ value defined as the value of another unit of water in the aquifer estimated over a 200 year planning horizon this study and other studies mentioned above highlight that water is priced at a relatively low value regardless of how you define low while rice producers and the arkansas rice checkoff a major contributor to miri research likely do not internalize this value when adopting or funding irrigation enhancing projects there are positive externalities from adoption which need to be accounted for given that rice uses 30 acre in of water and there are over 1 2 million rice acres in arkansas alone this positive externality can aggregate quickly thus when estimating the benefits of irrigation enhancing projects like miri evaluators should also account for the future value of conserved water beyond incorporating the economic cost savings and future value of water few studies quantify and monetize additional ecosystem benefits derived from conservation practices non market benefits include not only the natural capital or future value of water but also positive environmental externalities in this case reduced irrigation from miri use leads to less input diesel use which supports ecological improvements by reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions in previous studies life cycle assessment lca has been implemented to provide this additional analysis of benefits based on reduced input use nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2019b this study uses an lca to monetize the environmental improvements from miri adoption which can provide a more holistic view of miri benefits quantification of environmental impacts which are non market goods services in terms of a monetary unit that is a single score facilitates comparison amongst alternate management technologies pizzol et al 2015 as commodity checkoff and other public funds are more commonly being used for projects that focus on more efficient uses of resources it becomes even more important to capture the net present value benefits of saved resources and avoided environmental damage this study uses historical 2002 2018 adoption rates of miri attributed to arkansas rice checkoff funds county level average aquifer depth to water measurements and estimated water usage reductions from miri to calculate the total cost savings from miri adoption these cost savings alone would be the typical benefits used in a benefit cost ratio however we then use previous research on the in situ value of water in arkansas to estimate the future value of water saved in dollars per year through miri adoption lastly we use a lca to quantitatively compare the cradle to farm gate environmental impacts of replacing cascade flooded baseline rice production with miri adoption the summation of these three cost savings future value of conserved resources and reduced environmental impacts are aggregated and compared to the amount of money that the arkansas rice checkoff program has invested in miri research and dissemination the results of this study on the holistic costs benefits and environmental impacts of the checkoff funded miri program can be used by policy makers checkoff boards agricultural producers and agricultural scientists to inform future program evaluations and investments in research programs 2 materials and methods the total number of acres implementing miri from 2002 to 2018 that were directly attributed to checkoff funding first needed to be established producers adopt new technologies through a variety of ways including discussions with crop consultants word of mouth and extension programs among others arkansas rice checkoff funds supported research and dissemination extension so those producers who adopted miri due to extension programs were identified using the mid south irrigation survey edwards 2016 uadaiwmt 2015 2017 the ratio of the miri acres who adopted due to extension programs to total miri acreage from yearly estimates by the university of arkansas division of agriculture br wells various years provided the percentage of miri acres attributed to the extension and outreach efforts funded by the rice checkoff program in the mid south irrigation survey agricultural producers were asked 1 if they adopted miri and 2 if they adopted what was the driver of adoption choices included i wanted to reduce input costs experienced water shortage on farm tried it on my farm and saw the benefit learned about this technology from an industry meeting learned about this technology at an extension meeting and other of 199 responses 87 43 72 reported they had adopted miri of which 9 10 34 said they learned about this technology at an extension meeting as such this study assumes 10 34 of total miri acreage in arkansas can be attributed to checkoff funds as the checkoff program funded the research and extension of miri implementation admittedly this is a crude and likely conservative estimation as producers could have learned about the technology at an extension meeting but another factor drove them to adopt or they could have learned about it at an extension meeting not targeting miri that being said this method is the best approximation of adoption rates due to checkoff funds available table 1 illustrates the total miri acres in arkansas and the total miri acres attributed to the arkansas rice checkoff program 2 1 cost savings water savings of 23 8 7 14 acre in compared to cascade paddy flooding were derived from massey et al 2018 which is a more conservative but similar estimate to the 25 1 reduction found by vories et al 2005 thus in this study we assume no associated yield loss which was reported by both the massey et al 2018 and vories et al 2005 studies and an irrigation decrease of 23 8 via adoption of miri from cascade flooded paddy rice while there are multiple factors contributing to water usage differences the massey et al 2018 study used 260 site years to compare miri and cascade flooding and found a mean of 23 8 across sites with a minimum average site irrigation reduction of 21 8 and a maximum average site reduction of 25 8 the vories et al 2005 study was conducted on farm where farmers managed fields after help with the initial set up from extension agents this study assumes that if producers used extension assistance through workshops websites apps field days etc equivalent water savings can be achieved if producers do not use extension information savings could be less mitigating the benefits of miri while our estimates below are static the previous literature would suggest that variation around the mean of 23 8 water savings is relatively small state water savings ac in in year t wst for all years in t 2002 2018 across all counties l 1 l attributed to miri adoption via arkansas rice checkoff funds is calculated as 1 ws t a tl m t 7 14 0 1034 where state level savings is calculated by summing across a tl the total county level l rice acres in year t m t is the percentage of rice in year t table 1 that uses miri 7 14 represents the amount of water in acre inches acre saved via miri adoption relative to cascade flooding rice uses between 30 and 32 acre in acre uaex 2020 so the more conservative 30 acre in acre was assumed for cascade flood requirements and water reductions of 23 8 7 14 acres in acre from miri per acre were calculated from the cascade flood requirements the percentage of total water savings from miri attributed to arkansas rice checkoff funds was then derived based on 10 34 of producers who identified extension presentations funded by the rice checkoff program as the reason for adoption cost savings from miri manifest through energy savings from reduced irrigation pumping although there is a mix of both diesel 49 and electric 47 irrigation pumps in arkansas usda nass 2018 we assume that all irrigation is pumped using diesel for a few important reasons first the irrigation water management survey data represents the entire state of arkansas including the ozark and ouachita mountain regions as well as the delta region where our study focuses less than one third of arkansas counties produce rice and the irrigation energy source information does not distinguish electric and diesel energy for irrigation by region second the cost of electricity varies by company service region generation source and year and we do not have sufficient data for economic aggregation for the full time period and locations included in this study third the source hydro coal nuclear etc of electricity generation should be accounted for in the lca results but energy sources are not spatially disaggregated through time to generate such spatially and source explicit environmental impacts without stronger assumptions than those required for diesel however default energy sources for electricity can be assumed for a single year to generate lca results for a 50 diesel 50 electricity scenario which we include in later discussion and supplementary information for comparison the amount of energy assumed to be 100 diesel in this case it takes to lift an acre inch of water is a function of the depth to water therefore it was important to identify spatial differences in water table depths across the alluvial aquifer as an example in its 2018 annual report the anrc surveyed wells throughout the mrvaa in the arkansas delta and found depth to water ranged from 4 15 feet mississippi county to 144 78 feet lonoke county table s1 the large variance in depth to water suggests a large variance in the amount of diesel it would take to raise water and ultimately the cost for irrigation as such we used the average county measurements for depth to water for the 24 largest rice growing counties in arkansas it should be noted that the actual energy required to lift water is potentially higher as drawdown and friction losses were not accounted for in the analysis thus the additional total dynamic head or energy required could be between 5 and 50 feet higher than assumed in this analysis again we use the most conservative estimate to provide conservative returns on investment while rice is produced in more than 24 counties in arkansas the remaining counties only accounted for between 0 and 7 66 of total rice acreage from 2002 to 2018 and thus were excluded from this study using the 354 wells monitored by anrc average county level depth to water was estimated table s1 while we have county level data on depth to water we do not have county level miri adoption as this data is not maintained so one key assumption in our analysis is that miri is evenly adopted across all counties this will likely underestimate the total benefits of miri as those counties with larger depth to water would be expected to have higher miri adoption and thus benefit more fuel savings from miri adoption were estimated by using average depth to water dtwl in county l times the required amount of diesel to raise one acre inch from a given depth table s1 diesel requirements to raise one acre inch were derived from the arkansas rice production handbook henry et al 2018 and assumed a 5 drive loss and a 75 pump efficiency from the above assumptions the arkansas rice production handbook henry et al 2018 it was estimated that for every additional foot dtw it would require 0 0108 gallons to raise an acre inch of water mcdougall 2016 measured fuel consumption and efficiencies of arkansas diesel powered alluvial wells on a limited dataset and found the actual cost to be 0 0169 gallons per acre in per foot of total dynamic head or one foot in this analysis we use the more conservative 0 0108 as the mcdougall 2016 estimate was derived from limited data the total fuel cost savings s t can be calculated by multiplying depth to water dtw l at each county l by water savings in each location year ws lt summing savings across all counties l 1 l in years t 2002 2018 and using the annual cost of off road diesel d t with diesel gallons 0 0108 required per acre inch of irrigation applied this is calculated as follows 2 s t dtw l ws tl 0 0108 d t 2 2 benefits of conserving water while fuel costs savings s t is the most tangible benefit to producers of miri adoption the net present value of water conserved via miri needs to be accounted for to fully account for miri s holistic benefits using the in situ value of water calculated by kovacs and durand morat 2020 of 1 97 for an acre in of water in the mrvaa the state level value of saved water vw t in year t is estimated as the summation of county level l water savings in year t multiplied by the in situ value of water 1 97 in eq 3 a major challenge in valuing water in an aquifer is integrating the hydrologic and physical components of an aquifer into a valuation framework fenichel et al 2016 qureshi et al 2012 tsur and graham tomasi 1991 although groundwater has a spatial component to its valuation the kovacs and durand morat 2020 study aggregates the value of groundwater for the entire mrvaa which encompasses all of our rice growing area and which is used to quantify the future value of miri as 3 vw t ws tl 1 97 the value of fuel savings s t and the value of water saved vw t are two primary benefits from miri adoption but total benefits are incomplete without assessing the overall environmental impact improvements provided through miri adoption 2 3 environmental benefits an lca was conducted to quantitatively compare the cradle to farm gate environmental impact of miri adoption following an approach similar to previous work durand morat et al 2018 nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2019a an evaluation was conducted for the counterfactual scenario of no adoption of miri that is what would additional environmental damage have been if there was no adoption of miri in arkansas the functional unit 1 kg of rice serves as the basis for comparative evaluation the differences in fuel usage associated with miri and conventionally flooded rice are used to simulate and compare the environmental impact of different production scenarios all other inputs including pesticide and herbicide usage are assumed to be the same across scenarios inputs for each scenario were derived from the university of arkansas extension budgets uaex 2020 similar to previous literature durand morat et al 2018 shew et al 2019a this study used the stepwise life cycle impact assessment lcia framework which combines human and environmental effects in an economic valuation scheme weidema 2009 weidema et al 2008 the lifecycle impact categories included in the stepwise method are described in table 2 midpoint and endpoint characterization factors are provided weidema 2009 2015 the stepwise method includes damage characterization to account for both human health and ecosystem quality impairment effects to human health are quantified by quality adjusted life years qaly a measure of damage associated with morbidity and mortality and ecosystem quality is quantified by biodiversity adjusted hectare years bahy a measure of damages associated with biodiversity loss the monetization of qaly and bahy is calculated based on contributing factors to the midpoint impact categories using a budget constraint argument and an estimate of average global income it is argued that the maximum average funds available to pay to reach full quality of human life in a year is 72 776 2017 usd weidema 2009 in addition one bahy is assumed to be equivalent to 1 14 qaly weidema 2009 2015 the results presented as costs can be interpreted as the estimated expense to balance the environmental and human health externalities that is to restore full qalys and bahys based on the ability to pay weidema 2009 the environmental benefits eb for year t in dollars from miri adoption can be calculated as 4 eb t ect ecm a tl y tl where ect is the environmental cost of producing one kg of traditional paddy rice and ecm is the environmental cost of producing one kg of rice with miri a tl is the miri acreage in county in county l in year t and y tl is the county average yield usda nass 2020 in kilograms in year t from 2002 to 2018 the environmental benefits must be calculated based on total number of kilograms produced under miri production practices given the comparative metric for the lca is in kilograms of rice the only additional cost of miri compared to traditional flooding is the use of poly tubing which the university of arkansas cooperative extension uaex 2020 estimated at 3 88 per acre the total cost of polytubing is estimated at 8 82 per acre 0 44 h of labor at 11 33 per hour plus the 3 88 in material conventional rice production also requires 0 44 h of labor dedicated to irrigation thus the relative cost difference between conventional and miri rice is 3 88 per acre deliberto and harrell 2020 lsu 2020 total benefits tb t in dollars at the state level in year t associated with historical miri adoption attributed to the rice checkoff program can be estimated as 5 tb t s t vw t eb t a tl m t 3 88 the additional cost of miri adoption over conventional flooded rice is calculated by summing all county level miri acres a tl m t in year t and multiplying by the cost of polytubing 3 88 per acre the additional environmental impacts associated with polytubing production and recycling are accounted for in the lca as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 cost savings table s1 highlights the total cost savings from miri adoption from 2002 to 2018 on a county level basis all monetary values are expressed in 2018 usd pumping cost savings range from a low of 138 230 in 2002 to a high of 825 535 in 2008 with a total of 8 655 687 from 2002 to 2018 these savings are a function of miri acreage depth to water in each county and off road diesel price not surprisingly off road diesel price is the main driver of savings with the highest price gallon of 4 22 and the lowest price 1 34 occurring in the years with the highest and lowest cost savings respectively it is important to remember that these are only the benefits associated with rice checkoff funding those producers who said they adopted because of extension programs with funding from the rice checkoff and not the total benefits of miri for a given year in arkansas on a per acre basis savings range from a high of 16 48 in 2008 to a low of 5 37 in 2002 actual savings per acre are likely higher given that we assume equal adoption of miri across all rice growing counties when in reality it likely has a higher adoption rate in counties where depth to water is greater while not a straight comparison if we were to subtract the average per acre savings associated with miri adoption 10 75 estimated in our data from the 2020 total cost of conventional rice production 621 48 net returns would increase by 14 9 from 72 14 acre to 82 89 acre to put this in context roughly the same net return per acre 82 84 could be accomplished by a 1 5 gain in yield 170 172 55 bu ac this is likely why producers and checkoff boards and other public funding outlets are more supportive of funding breeding and other yield enhancement programs however yield gains from breeding specifically conventional rice breeding have slowed to an average genetic gain of 0 34 a year shew et al 2018 so while a 1 5 increase in yield seems marginal it is difficult to sustain over time 3 2 benefits of conserving water producers can easily internalize that saved water has a value but quantifying the value is not easy table s2 highlights the benefits of miri adoption using the in situ value of conserved water again these are only the benefits associated with the funds provided by the rice checkoff program and their associated miri acres unlike the cost savings which were a function of depth to water and diesel price the benefit of water conservation is simply a function of miri acres average yearly benefits were estimated to be 654 866 or 28 62 greater than the average yearly benefits from cost savings unlike the cost savings benefits these benefits may be slightly inflated as the kovacs and durand morat 2020 study estimated the in situ value of water to be 1 97 per acre in in 2020 it stands to reason that as the aquifer became more depleted over the time of our dataset 2002 2018 the value of stored water increased that being said there is no dynamic in situ value of water given the static 1 97 per acre estimate from previous work to give some relative context the in situ value of water per acre inch would have to fall to 1 53 a decrease of 28 75 before the total cost savings from fuel for 2002 2018 8 655 687 would become equivalent to the gains from water conservation this highlights the value of conserved water in relation to cost of production savings through water conservation programs like miri these results suggest that evaluating water efficiency enhancement programs like miri based on only direct cost savings underestimates the total value of the programs while rice producers and funding sources like commodity checkoff programs may not see instantaneous benefits from water savings they should understand the importance for industry sustainability and competitiveness if future funding decisions for miri were only made on direct cost savings it would underestimate the total yearly benefits by 128 as the annual average for cost savings was estimated to be 509 158 table s1 and for water conservation savings was estimated at 653 798 table s2 when the value of water conservation is considered suddenly water savings programs like miri become relatively more attractive than yield enhancing programs ceteris paribus 3 3 interpretation of midpoint lcia the characterization of environmental impacts from producing 1 kg of rice for the two case studies cascade as the baseline and miri are shown in table 3 including the bio physical units the differences between the baseline and miri represent the potential environmental impact reduction due to less water use the results show that the potential environmental mitigation from miri adoption was a reduction of 0 056 kg co2 eq gwp fossil and a 0 0001 kg pm2 5 eq respiratory inorganics compared to the baseline cascade flooding situation the stated impacts were 3 4 and 10 lower compared to the respective impacts calculated in the baseline situation likewise non renewable energy consumption was reduced by 0 73 mj per kg of rice which was attributed to 24 reduction in water use through miri and associated reduction in diesel consumption compared to the baseline situation other significant environmental benefits primarily from background stages i e production and supply of raw materials were for human toxicity non carcinogenic which was reduced by 22 aquatic ecotoxicity reduced by 18 4 and mineral extraction reduced by 15 5 table 3 the expected reduction in environmental impacts can be explained by the reduction of the raw materials consumption and energy inputs that change proportionally to the amount of irrigation one limitation of the current study is that we have not fully accounted for the integrated dynamics of ghg emissions primarily regarding methane and nitrous oxides which may be different for cascade flooded irrigation baseline and miri however there are mixed opinions on the net ghg savings due to water saving irrigation practices for instance wassmann et al 1993 argued that water saving could contribute to ch4 emissions reduction however kritee et al 2018 also suggested that the benefits of methane emission reduction are partially off set by increased n2o emissions in the case of cascade and miri both irrigation practices flood fields continuously during production so it is likely that these tradeoffs are less important than pumping fuel and materials for ghg emissions in the lcia comparison other potential effects relating to water stress are the potential increase in the mineralization of soil organic carbon due to heterotrophic respiration of soil when aerobic conditions prevail in soil in a non saturated condition that may increase co2 emissions moyano et al 2013 however these aspects are not investigated in the current study as the crop s net water requirement is not compromised 3 4 environmental benefits while the majority of commodity board funding is not aimed at more than economic gains our findings indicate miri funding and adoption is associated with substantial ecosystem benefits table 3 presents the monetized results for each of the stepwise impact categories the single score is the sum of the estimated external costs associated with the impacts that are associated with the full production supply chain for 1 kg of rice produced under cascade flooding single inlet and miri the single score for a kg of cascade flooded rice is estimated at 0 4066 and for miri it was estimated at 0 3814 a reduction of 0 0252 for every kg of rice produced with miri respiratory inorganics and effects associated with global warming were the major contributors to external environmental costs associated of rice production the difference between the ecosystem single scores for miri and cascade flooded rice 0 0252 kg in table 3 was multiplied by the total kg of rice produced under miri funded by the rice checkoff program for each year eq 4 to estimate the total ecosystem benefits of miri adoption associated with the arkansas rice checkoff program table s3 indicates that the average environmental impact reduction provided my miri adoption was valued at 3 72 million dollars annually across 2002 2018 to put this in perspective this is 730 larger than the annual average cost savings from fuel 509 198 568 larger than the average value of conserved water and 319 larger than the combined yearly average of fuel cost savings and the value of water conserved 1 16 million for both scenarios the contribution due to ghg emissions and respiratory inorganics to the total single score impact was about 54 and 30 the remaining impacts were due to human toxicity non carcinogenic 5 6 nature occupation 4 photo chemical ozone and vegetation 3 with the intervention of miri the reduction in impacts such as respiratory inorganics was 10 and for gwp fossil it was 3 4 we further compare the environmental impacts of miri adoption both with and without polytubing and find no significant difference in the lca likely due to recycling see table s4 the monetary values on table s3 need to be interpreted with some caution there are currently no markets for the majority of these environmental externalities limited carbon markets exist in some states and for some commodities and the benefits are not directly accrued by miri rice producers but rather society at large additionally we provide a comparison of these results assuming 100 diesel pumps with results assuming 50 diesel and 50 electric pumps in table s5 the environmental impacts are still substantially lower than in conventional flooded rice but about 30 lower relative to the 100 diesel impacts in our main results however we recommend caution in interpreting the 50 diesel and 50 electric pump scenario due to unknown heterogeneity of pumps across the time period of our study and county level sources and costs of electricity regardless of the pumping assumptions the benefits are not trivial as production agriculture becomes more aware of the value of environmental sustainability metrics like this stakeholders may incorporate these measures into research funding decisions commodity purchasing decisions and policy analysis while savings from miri investments are large the potential gains from further adoption are even greater as more producers face increasing irrigation costs and internalize the cost savings from miri via outlets funded by the arkansas rice checkoff program such as the mobile app adoption should increase 2017 2015 using 2018 acreage and prices as a baseline and the 33 2 adoption of miri we further estimate the benefits of complete 100 miri adoption holding the 10 34 of adoption attributed to the rice checkoff program constant with full adoption of miri on all 2018 arkansas rice acres the water savings would increase by 635 958 acre in avoided cost of environmental damages would increase by 7 62 million dollars fuel savings would increase by 878 994 and the savings from the in situ value of water increases by 1 25 million the net annual gain associated with miri adoption from fuel savings in situ value of water and avoided environmental costs while subtracting the price of polytubing would be 9 75 million dollars there is no a priori expectation that previous investments will lead to similar increases in adoption rates but given the average checkoff spending for miri was 70 650 2018 usd and the yearly gains for full adoption are estimated to be 9 75 million it would appear that more public funding is warranted for miri adoption 3 5 benefit cost ratio table 4 highlights the bcr of arkansas rice checkoff funds invested in the miri program these investments went to pay for labor flowmeters supplies and travel to conduct workshops apps demonstrations and general research average yearly funds invested in miri by the rice checkoff were 70 650 2018 usd annually when solely looking at the benefits derived from input reductions the estimated average bcr is 5 86 indicating that for every dollar the arkansas rice checkoff board invests into miri producers receive 5 86 dollars in benefits these would traditionally be the tangible benefits that producers and checkoff boards would use to evaluate the success of current and potential future investments however input savings research such as miri do not just save inputs internalizing only costs savings and failing to realize the future value of these saved inputs can underestimate the value of investments the bcr of fuel savings plus the value of conserved water is 16 79 1 table 4 these results would indicate that failing to account for the value of water conserved through miri underestimates its true benefits by 286 again producers and commodity boards understand that saving water is paramount to the long term viability of the rice industry but putting a value on water saved has been a difficult task these results shed light on the relative value of input savings versus the future value of saved inputs lastly accounting for the avoided environmental costs attributed to miri adoption resulting from rice checkoff funding plus fuel savings results in a bcr of 79 21 1 a 1350 increase in benefits from cost savings alone again it is important to realize these ecosystem benefits are not only being captured by the adopters of miri but society at large and as such the bcr can be misleading if trying to apply it solely to the arkansas rice industry regardless of the benefactors the avoided environmental damage provided via miri adoption should be recognized even if it is not accounted for in funding decisions the overarching objective of quantifying the environmental cost is to use the information to shape policies and incentives for better management despite the benefits the inherent drawbacks while managing environmental externalities is that in the majority of cases the individuals who make decisions such as farmers do not always directly benefit from the lower environmental burdens however even if farmers do not directly derive financial benefits from protecting the environment it is certain that their activities provide major benefits to other individuals power 2010 the agriculture sector accounts for 70 of global water use fao 2003 and as such the provision of an adequate amount of clean water is crucial for many agro ecosystems furthermore the increased variability of precipitation competition on the use of available water resources and predicted risks of drought and flood due to changing climatic effects has increased the importance of proper water stewardship ipcc 2007 miri provides farmers an effective method for conserving water in rice production while maintaining yields and profitability while we show the economic and environmental benefits of miri adoption it is important to note that some previous studies have shown increased water use due to technology adoption for water conservation li and zhao 2018 peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 such studies have primarily taken place in the high plains aquifer the colorado river basin and the central valley in california and not in the lmrv which has distinct characteristics relative to these other regions specifically the arkansas delta has little room for agricultural land conversion most land capable of being farmed is already farmed so there are few opportunities for new agricultural land investments usda nass 2020 additionally most arkansas agricultural land is already irrigated and rice is 100 irrigated usda nass 2018 so there is low capacity for dryland to irrigated land conversion as a rebound effect lastly it could be possible that farmers change crops specifically they might grow more rice rather than soybeans based on rebound effects but the agronomic benefits of typical rice soybean rotations likely outweigh the potential benefits and costs of converting to rice rice rotations still future research in the study region should consider rebound effects particularly how the cost and water savings from the adoption of miri and other water saving technologies might be reinvested for other extensive or intensive purposes 4 conclusions given increased competitiveness and reduction in funding from many public granting agencies there is a need for a concerted effort to better estimate the holistic impacts to producers and the environment of funded projects this study examined the benefits from the arkansas rice checkoff program who funds public research from investments made between 2002 and 2018 in miri unlike yield enhancing research which can have quick tangible benefits input reduction research typically leads to marginal reductions in costs which producers can easily misidentify as simply adopting best management practices that being said there are often overlooked benefits associated with input savings research specifically related to water such as the future value of inputs conserved and the avoided environmental impacts provided via input reduction our findings suggest that by overlooking the future value of water conserved via miri adoption the benefit cost ratio would be underestimated by 286 not accounting for the future value of conserved ground water as well as the avoided impacts provided by the adoption of miri from cascade flooded rice would underestimate the benefit cost ratio by 1350 as environmental concerns grow commodity yield ceilings are approached and more commodity board public and private monies flow into input reducing research accounting for environmental and ecosystem service benefits is becoming more important our findings show the importance of not only accounting for the direct benefits producers experience now but the benefits they will receive from conserving inputs and the societal benefits provided through maintaining a healthier environment while explicit objectives of commodity boards are not to mitigate environmental impacts if they can show tangible results as in this study quantifying these external benefits can provide important information to disseminate about the societal value that research funded through commodity boards provides the contribution of this study is that when decision makers evaluate input reducing research they should look deeper than the cost savings incurred and consider the holistic impact water and environment have historically been acknowledged but seldom quantified in previous benefit cost ratio studies our research indicates that failure to both recognize and quantify these benefits can grossly underestimate the impact of water saving research and its adoption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

10085,multiple inlet rice irrigation miri reduces water use and production costs for arkansas rice producers while the water savings from miri have been analyzed experimentally the overall holistic benefits of miri rice have yet to be quantified compared to cascade flooded rice as such this study evaluates the economic and environmental benefits of miri resulting from publicly funded research in this case the rice checkoff to continue improvements in agricultural sustainability miri acreage associated with public funding from the rice checkoff for 2002 2018 were identified by county using producer surveys based on miri acreage we estimate cost savings the future value of water conserved and reductions in environmental impacts comparing cascade and miri rice irrigation cost savings range from a low of 138 230 in 2002 to a high of 825 535 in 2008 with a total of 8 655 687 for all years we estimated the total in situ value of conserved water from miri adoption associated with the rice checkoff to be 11 133 069 if future funding decisions for miri were only made based on cost savings it would underestimate the average total yearly benefits by 128 additionally a life cycle assessment was used to compare single score ecosystem impacts for cascade versus miri flooded rice based on 1 kg of rice produced the single score calculated as the externalized environmental cost for producing one kg of rice using cascade versus miri flooded rice was estimated at 0 4066 and 0 3814 respectively a reduction of 0 0252 per kg of miri produced rice finally a benefit cost ratio of 79 1 was calculated after accounting for savings in situ value and reduced environmental impacts provided by miri adoption due to the rice checkoff this study provides stakeholders a holistic picture of the economic impacts and environmental benefits provided by water conservation funded projects such as miri in arkansas keywords rice irrigation miri life cycle assessment groundwater aquifer sustainability 1 introduction research conducted on public goods related to agriculture such as water quantity and quality and air quality are often funded from public sources such as usda nrcs state organizations and regionally by agricultural commodity boards and commodity checkoff programs evaluations of the effectiveness of such research typically include estimating cost revenue and profitability implications for producers and changes to the quantity and quality of the public good in question alston 2010 alston et al 1995 alston and pardey 1996 delonge et al 2016 hurley et al 2014 nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2018 as public funding becomes increasingly scarce and more competitive holistic valuations of the economic and environmental benefits of public good conservation are increasingly important for project funding decisions programs focused on increased water use efficiency for agricultural producers often only highlight the benefits to producers in the form of reduced costs but fail to encompass the future value of conserved water and the potential for additional environmental benefits associated with reduced irrigation failure to include the holistic benefits from water conservation programs may lead to reduced future funding or misallocation of funds to programs that have seemingly more direct and tangible benefits in the near term understanding how targeted public funding for agricultural irrigation conservation may impact the future value and quantity of water will be critical for addressing water scarcity and allocating funds effectively hurley et al 2014 turral et al 2010 this study illustrates the economic benefits derived from a publicly funded commodity board water conservation program multiple inlet rice irrigation miri as well as the potential for undervaluation in program benefits if environmental benefits are not monetized rice requires a substantial amount of water for production 30 ac in ac where an acre inch is equivalent to 3630 cubic feet or 27 154 gallons and has a relatively large environmental impact compared to other row crops li et al 2004 linquist et al 2015 2012 nalley et al 2014 massey et al 2018 as such rice is an ideal crop for assessing the benefits of public funding for water conservation programs and their impact on both producers and the environment rice consumption accounts for more than half the daily caloric intake of over three billion people globally most of whom are located in rapidly growing low income countries muthayya et al 2014 although accounting for only 1 3 of global production the united states ranks as a top five rice exporter usda fas 2020 in 2017 2019 the u s exported an annual average of 2 9 million metric tons of milled rice to over 120 countries which accounted for 6 5 of the global rice trade globally rice is thinly traded with only around nine percent of production entering international markets as most rice supplies are consumed domestically usda fas 2020 in 2017 2019 arkansas accounted for 47 of total rice production in the united states usda nass 2020 arkansas rice producers face decreased groundwater availability and increased pumping depths to access sufficient water for production reba et al 2017 the most common rice flooding method in arkansas and the lower mississippi river valley lmrv is single inlet irrigation in single inlet irrigation water is applied to the uppermost paddy sub field areas divided by levees for flood depth control and allowed to gravity flow or cascade from one paddy to the next until the lowest paddy has reached a desired flood depth massey et al 2018 cascade flooding requires that paddies be overfilled so that water moves downfield over the levee gates by nature this is inefficient requires excess water as overfilling paddies leads to water runoff from storms excess tailwater from flooding excess seepage and increased exposure to evaporation omer et al 2019 these inefficiencies increase the cost of rice production and increase overall water requirements nalley et al 2015 omer et al 2019 to give scale to current and future water concerns for the rice industry in arkansas and the lmrv the arkansas natural resource commission anrc 2019 estimated that only 44 2 of current groundwater withdrawals from the underlying mississippi river valley alluvial aquifer mrvaa are sustainable for rice irrigation said another way total irrigation would have to be reduced by more than half to maintain current groundwater levels meaning that withdrawals are less than or equal to recharge rates groundwater furnishes 63 of the state s total consumption of water and 95 of the groundwater used is from the alluvial aquifer moreover agriculture accounts for 98 of the total water that is pumped from the mrvaa anrc 2019 in the 2019 annual groundwater report anrc recommended that the state work toward conservation research and education extension to bring about more sustainable water usage miri an alternative flooding practice in arkansas rice production distributes water through flexible pipes polytubing directly into paddy fields according to surface elevations across the field rather than using gravity to distribute water via spillways from paddy to paddy fig 1 concurrent water distribution prevents unnecessary seepage and leakage massey et al 2018 omer et al 2019 vories et al 2005 by adjusting the gates miri allows a producer to fill all paddies simultaneously reducing deep percolation and seepage through the outside levees vories et al 2005 with miri each paddy fills at the same time making it easier to manage paddy water depths and minimize tail water runoff other benefits may include the reduction of cold water effects in upper paddies which can cause stunting or reduce grain yield in the top paddy due to cold water shock miri distributes the cold water equally across all of the paddies at the same time allowing for some acclimation to ambient temperatures in the polytubing miri also provides faster flood establishment reducing the potential loss of urea applied just before establishing the flood and in large fields can reduce the time by half 7 days to 3 days for example moreover less in season flood depth management is required as once the gates are set the field floods evenly negating the need to adjust spills or levee gates throughout the growing season massey et al 2018 vories et al 2005 to implement miri the water flow into the field must be balanced with the area of each paddy and the flow is metered by the installation of holes and gates placed at each levee one of the initial challenges of implementing miri was the difficulty for rice producers to measure the area of each paddy and determine the placement and size of holes in the polytubing a critical barrier to miri adoption a mobile app 2017 2015 and educational extension program were initiated to help rice producers plan miri fields through funding from the arkansas rice check off program apple ios and android programs were developed and between 2015 and 2019 rice producers planned miri on 143 730 acres with 452 users and over 2 05 million feet of polytubing henry 2020 irrigation schools extension led county meetings and on farm demonstrations were conducted during the span of the study some with funding from the arkansas rice checkoff program the mobile app estimates paddy areas and makes the calculations necessary to develop a plan in only a few minutes where it may have previously taken hours to measure and manually calculate the hole numbers and gate settings massey et al 2018 used 260 site years of daily rainfall to estimate required irrigation for conventional irrigation and miri the authors found that miri required 24 8 less water than single inlet flooding nearly identical to the results of a similar on farm study by vories et al 2005 the conclusion of the massey et al 2018 study was that these water savings should be highlighted to producers and reinforced by university extension efforts in addition henry et al 2016 suggests more funding is needed for educating rice producers on the importance of irrigation management and demonstrating the water conserving benefits of miri much of the existing research on public funding and checkoff programs has focused on the benefits to producers mainly in the form of yield improvements from primary research or demand export enhancement from funding directed toward generic promotional activities however commodity programs and other public research funds like nrcs usda nifa and nsf among others which invest in water conservation programs may result in additional benefits in the form of cost reductions and improvements in environmental outcomes programs such as nrcs eqip pay for the adoption of efficiency enhancing irrigation technology which can help producers reduce irrigation costs and conserve water for producers cost reductions in rice production are important as in 2020 it was estimated that irrigation energy costs alone were 14 24 and 12 62 of total operating expenses for conventional and hybrid rice per acre respectively uaex 2020 these costs are significant but generally partial reductions in costs do not attract public funding for research at the same levels as yield enhancing research cost savings contributions from checkoff programs and other forms of public funding warrant further attention specifically with respect to water management in rice production in arkansas the arkansas rice checkoff allocates funds collected by an assessment of 1 35 cents per bushel of rice grown in arkansas paid by the grower and an assessment of 1 35 cents per bushel paid by the first point of sale buyer the funds raised by the grower assessment are reserved for the research program while buyer funds are reserved for domestic and international promotion and market development activities this study focuses on the 1 35 cents paid for by the grower and attempts to quantify the benefits that growers receive from this contribution specifically we focus on those funds allocated towards water saving research and dissemination in arkansas rice production although this study examines a checkoff program its methodology could be used to evaluate the benefits of water conservation research from any source of funds private or public between 2004 and 2018 the arkansas rice checkoff has allocated 47 58 million 2018 usd for research with a yearly high of 4 03 million in 2014 and a low of 2 8 million in 2013 these funds are allocated across breeding pathology agronomy entomology irrigation enhancement and other programs germane to increasing the productivity and competitiveness of arkansas rice over the same period irrigation enhancement has received just 2 31 of total rice checkoff funds on average this could be explained by the fact that water has rarely been a binding constraint to production in the arkansas delta however increasing attention is being given to critical groundwater zones due to the falling water table attributed to overdrafting by irrigators in the alluvial aquifer anrc 2019 reba et al 2017 usgs 2005 water savings do not increase yield and water has traditionally been seen as a long term issue not an immediate problem affecting current yields and profit moreover producers often focus on short term research benefits as it solves today s problem and tangible results can be demonstrated quickly as a result of this short term focus disproportionately less funding is allocated to long term issues such as groundwater sustainability benefit cost analysis is important when evaluating public funding such as those provided by commodity checkoff programs as it provides concrete comparisons of programs for producers who are the source of the checkoff funds to internalize returns on investments for checkoff programs that are solely yield enhancing such as plant breeding these benefits are relatively easy to estimate and straightforward to evaluate shew et al 2018 some commodity checkoff programs focus on market promotion in an effort to shift the demand curve each of these generic advertising checkoff groups struggles with the measurement of benefits and performance of their programs as the benefits are harder to quantify than simple yield enhancement usda ams 2020 previous literature has reported checkoff benefit to cost ratios bcrs for beef of 5 6 1 pork 4 8 1 dairy 4 6 1 flowers 6 6 1 prunes 2 7 1 eggs 4 7 1 and processed oranges between 2 1 and 4 1 depending on the model type and time period of analysis alston 2010 alston et al 1995 alston and pardey 1996 capps et al 2016 kaiser 2003 schmit et al 1997 ward 2006 williams 1999 the bcrs for soybeans and grain sorghum the only two grains with a national checkoff program were estimated to be 6 5 1 and 8 5 1 respectively williams et al 2014 evaluation of checkoff and other public funding decisions for programs like miri often only look at cost reductions as the primary benefits and do not consider the future value of conserved inputs such as water or energy attributed to the adoption of a new technology additionally they often do not consider potential positive environmental externalities beyond input savings the united nations 2018 stated that lack of information about the value of water in an aquifer is of great global concern moreover a continual problem for quantifying the benefits of water saving technologies is the challenge of placing a future value on conserved water addicott and fenichel 2019 blanco gutiérrez et al 2013 fenichel et al 2016 torell et al 1990 understanding the factors determining the economic value of groundwater is important for creating effective irrigation policy and informing groundwater management and withdrawal decisions feinerman and knapp 1983 hrozencik et al 2017 qureshi et al 2012 tsur and graham tomasi 1991 hydroeconomic models and contingent valuation studies have been the primary tools for non market valuation of groundwater and irrigation policy assessment harou et al 2009 hrozencik et al 2017 mulligan et al 2014 suter et al 2021 manning et al 2020 conducted an integrated assessment valuation of groundwater in kansas finding that water retirement programs more than pay for themselves over a 15 year time horizon fenichel et al 2016 estimated the value of an acre inch of water to be 1 41 1 52 in 2020 usd for the kansas high plains aquifer similarly sampson et al 2019 found that the average marginal value of water in storage in the high plains aquifer of kansas ranged from 0 22 to 1 32 per acre in in this study we use previously estimated groundwater values from kovacs and durand morat 2020 as essential components of building a bcr for rice checkoff funding toward miri adoption in the mrvaa the source of water for this study kovacs and durand morat 2020 used a spatial dynamic aquifer model to estimate the price of water under the assumption of unlimited lateral flow bathtub aquifer they quantified the future value of groundwater at 19 20 per thousand cubic meters 1 97 per acre in not including the cost of extraction this price represents the in situ value defined as the value of another unit of water in the aquifer estimated over a 200 year planning horizon this study and other studies mentioned above highlight that water is priced at a relatively low value regardless of how you define low while rice producers and the arkansas rice checkoff a major contributor to miri research likely do not internalize this value when adopting or funding irrigation enhancing projects there are positive externalities from adoption which need to be accounted for given that rice uses 30 acre in of water and there are over 1 2 million rice acres in arkansas alone this positive externality can aggregate quickly thus when estimating the benefits of irrigation enhancing projects like miri evaluators should also account for the future value of conserved water beyond incorporating the economic cost savings and future value of water few studies quantify and monetize additional ecosystem benefits derived from conservation practices non market benefits include not only the natural capital or future value of water but also positive environmental externalities in this case reduced irrigation from miri use leads to less input diesel use which supports ecological improvements by reducing greenhouse gas ghg emissions in previous studies life cycle assessment lca has been implemented to provide this additional analysis of benefits based on reduced input use nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2019b this study uses an lca to monetize the environmental improvements from miri adoption which can provide a more holistic view of miri benefits quantification of environmental impacts which are non market goods services in terms of a monetary unit that is a single score facilitates comparison amongst alternate management technologies pizzol et al 2015 as commodity checkoff and other public funds are more commonly being used for projects that focus on more efficient uses of resources it becomes even more important to capture the net present value benefits of saved resources and avoided environmental damage this study uses historical 2002 2018 adoption rates of miri attributed to arkansas rice checkoff funds county level average aquifer depth to water measurements and estimated water usage reductions from miri to calculate the total cost savings from miri adoption these cost savings alone would be the typical benefits used in a benefit cost ratio however we then use previous research on the in situ value of water in arkansas to estimate the future value of water saved in dollars per year through miri adoption lastly we use a lca to quantitatively compare the cradle to farm gate environmental impacts of replacing cascade flooded baseline rice production with miri adoption the summation of these three cost savings future value of conserved resources and reduced environmental impacts are aggregated and compared to the amount of money that the arkansas rice checkoff program has invested in miri research and dissemination the results of this study on the holistic costs benefits and environmental impacts of the checkoff funded miri program can be used by policy makers checkoff boards agricultural producers and agricultural scientists to inform future program evaluations and investments in research programs 2 materials and methods the total number of acres implementing miri from 2002 to 2018 that were directly attributed to checkoff funding first needed to be established producers adopt new technologies through a variety of ways including discussions with crop consultants word of mouth and extension programs among others arkansas rice checkoff funds supported research and dissemination extension so those producers who adopted miri due to extension programs were identified using the mid south irrigation survey edwards 2016 uadaiwmt 2015 2017 the ratio of the miri acres who adopted due to extension programs to total miri acreage from yearly estimates by the university of arkansas division of agriculture br wells various years provided the percentage of miri acres attributed to the extension and outreach efforts funded by the rice checkoff program in the mid south irrigation survey agricultural producers were asked 1 if they adopted miri and 2 if they adopted what was the driver of adoption choices included i wanted to reduce input costs experienced water shortage on farm tried it on my farm and saw the benefit learned about this technology from an industry meeting learned about this technology at an extension meeting and other of 199 responses 87 43 72 reported they had adopted miri of which 9 10 34 said they learned about this technology at an extension meeting as such this study assumes 10 34 of total miri acreage in arkansas can be attributed to checkoff funds as the checkoff program funded the research and extension of miri implementation admittedly this is a crude and likely conservative estimation as producers could have learned about the technology at an extension meeting but another factor drove them to adopt or they could have learned about it at an extension meeting not targeting miri that being said this method is the best approximation of adoption rates due to checkoff funds available table 1 illustrates the total miri acres in arkansas and the total miri acres attributed to the arkansas rice checkoff program 2 1 cost savings water savings of 23 8 7 14 acre in compared to cascade paddy flooding were derived from massey et al 2018 which is a more conservative but similar estimate to the 25 1 reduction found by vories et al 2005 thus in this study we assume no associated yield loss which was reported by both the massey et al 2018 and vories et al 2005 studies and an irrigation decrease of 23 8 via adoption of miri from cascade flooded paddy rice while there are multiple factors contributing to water usage differences the massey et al 2018 study used 260 site years to compare miri and cascade flooding and found a mean of 23 8 across sites with a minimum average site irrigation reduction of 21 8 and a maximum average site reduction of 25 8 the vories et al 2005 study was conducted on farm where farmers managed fields after help with the initial set up from extension agents this study assumes that if producers used extension assistance through workshops websites apps field days etc equivalent water savings can be achieved if producers do not use extension information savings could be less mitigating the benefits of miri while our estimates below are static the previous literature would suggest that variation around the mean of 23 8 water savings is relatively small state water savings ac in in year t wst for all years in t 2002 2018 across all counties l 1 l attributed to miri adoption via arkansas rice checkoff funds is calculated as 1 ws t a tl m t 7 14 0 1034 where state level savings is calculated by summing across a tl the total county level l rice acres in year t m t is the percentage of rice in year t table 1 that uses miri 7 14 represents the amount of water in acre inches acre saved via miri adoption relative to cascade flooding rice uses between 30 and 32 acre in acre uaex 2020 so the more conservative 30 acre in acre was assumed for cascade flood requirements and water reductions of 23 8 7 14 acres in acre from miri per acre were calculated from the cascade flood requirements the percentage of total water savings from miri attributed to arkansas rice checkoff funds was then derived based on 10 34 of producers who identified extension presentations funded by the rice checkoff program as the reason for adoption cost savings from miri manifest through energy savings from reduced irrigation pumping although there is a mix of both diesel 49 and electric 47 irrigation pumps in arkansas usda nass 2018 we assume that all irrigation is pumped using diesel for a few important reasons first the irrigation water management survey data represents the entire state of arkansas including the ozark and ouachita mountain regions as well as the delta region where our study focuses less than one third of arkansas counties produce rice and the irrigation energy source information does not distinguish electric and diesel energy for irrigation by region second the cost of electricity varies by company service region generation source and year and we do not have sufficient data for economic aggregation for the full time period and locations included in this study third the source hydro coal nuclear etc of electricity generation should be accounted for in the lca results but energy sources are not spatially disaggregated through time to generate such spatially and source explicit environmental impacts without stronger assumptions than those required for diesel however default energy sources for electricity can be assumed for a single year to generate lca results for a 50 diesel 50 electricity scenario which we include in later discussion and supplementary information for comparison the amount of energy assumed to be 100 diesel in this case it takes to lift an acre inch of water is a function of the depth to water therefore it was important to identify spatial differences in water table depths across the alluvial aquifer as an example in its 2018 annual report the anrc surveyed wells throughout the mrvaa in the arkansas delta and found depth to water ranged from 4 15 feet mississippi county to 144 78 feet lonoke county table s1 the large variance in depth to water suggests a large variance in the amount of diesel it would take to raise water and ultimately the cost for irrigation as such we used the average county measurements for depth to water for the 24 largest rice growing counties in arkansas it should be noted that the actual energy required to lift water is potentially higher as drawdown and friction losses were not accounted for in the analysis thus the additional total dynamic head or energy required could be between 5 and 50 feet higher than assumed in this analysis again we use the most conservative estimate to provide conservative returns on investment while rice is produced in more than 24 counties in arkansas the remaining counties only accounted for between 0 and 7 66 of total rice acreage from 2002 to 2018 and thus were excluded from this study using the 354 wells monitored by anrc average county level depth to water was estimated table s1 while we have county level data on depth to water we do not have county level miri adoption as this data is not maintained so one key assumption in our analysis is that miri is evenly adopted across all counties this will likely underestimate the total benefits of miri as those counties with larger depth to water would be expected to have higher miri adoption and thus benefit more fuel savings from miri adoption were estimated by using average depth to water dtwl in county l times the required amount of diesel to raise one acre inch from a given depth table s1 diesel requirements to raise one acre inch were derived from the arkansas rice production handbook henry et al 2018 and assumed a 5 drive loss and a 75 pump efficiency from the above assumptions the arkansas rice production handbook henry et al 2018 it was estimated that for every additional foot dtw it would require 0 0108 gallons to raise an acre inch of water mcdougall 2016 measured fuel consumption and efficiencies of arkansas diesel powered alluvial wells on a limited dataset and found the actual cost to be 0 0169 gallons per acre in per foot of total dynamic head or one foot in this analysis we use the more conservative 0 0108 as the mcdougall 2016 estimate was derived from limited data the total fuel cost savings s t can be calculated by multiplying depth to water dtw l at each county l by water savings in each location year ws lt summing savings across all counties l 1 l in years t 2002 2018 and using the annual cost of off road diesel d t with diesel gallons 0 0108 required per acre inch of irrigation applied this is calculated as follows 2 s t dtw l ws tl 0 0108 d t 2 2 benefits of conserving water while fuel costs savings s t is the most tangible benefit to producers of miri adoption the net present value of water conserved via miri needs to be accounted for to fully account for miri s holistic benefits using the in situ value of water calculated by kovacs and durand morat 2020 of 1 97 for an acre in of water in the mrvaa the state level value of saved water vw t in year t is estimated as the summation of county level l water savings in year t multiplied by the in situ value of water 1 97 in eq 3 a major challenge in valuing water in an aquifer is integrating the hydrologic and physical components of an aquifer into a valuation framework fenichel et al 2016 qureshi et al 2012 tsur and graham tomasi 1991 although groundwater has a spatial component to its valuation the kovacs and durand morat 2020 study aggregates the value of groundwater for the entire mrvaa which encompasses all of our rice growing area and which is used to quantify the future value of miri as 3 vw t ws tl 1 97 the value of fuel savings s t and the value of water saved vw t are two primary benefits from miri adoption but total benefits are incomplete without assessing the overall environmental impact improvements provided through miri adoption 2 3 environmental benefits an lca was conducted to quantitatively compare the cradle to farm gate environmental impact of miri adoption following an approach similar to previous work durand morat et al 2018 nalley et al 2016 shew et al 2019a an evaluation was conducted for the counterfactual scenario of no adoption of miri that is what would additional environmental damage have been if there was no adoption of miri in arkansas the functional unit 1 kg of rice serves as the basis for comparative evaluation the differences in fuel usage associated with miri and conventionally flooded rice are used to simulate and compare the environmental impact of different production scenarios all other inputs including pesticide and herbicide usage are assumed to be the same across scenarios inputs for each scenario were derived from the university of arkansas extension budgets uaex 2020 similar to previous literature durand morat et al 2018 shew et al 2019a this study used the stepwise life cycle impact assessment lcia framework which combines human and environmental effects in an economic valuation scheme weidema 2009 weidema et al 2008 the lifecycle impact categories included in the stepwise method are described in table 2 midpoint and endpoint characterization factors are provided weidema 2009 2015 the stepwise method includes damage characterization to account for both human health and ecosystem quality impairment effects to human health are quantified by quality adjusted life years qaly a measure of damage associated with morbidity and mortality and ecosystem quality is quantified by biodiversity adjusted hectare years bahy a measure of damages associated with biodiversity loss the monetization of qaly and bahy is calculated based on contributing factors to the midpoint impact categories using a budget constraint argument and an estimate of average global income it is argued that the maximum average funds available to pay to reach full quality of human life in a year is 72 776 2017 usd weidema 2009 in addition one bahy is assumed to be equivalent to 1 14 qaly weidema 2009 2015 the results presented as costs can be interpreted as the estimated expense to balance the environmental and human health externalities that is to restore full qalys and bahys based on the ability to pay weidema 2009 the environmental benefits eb for year t in dollars from miri adoption can be calculated as 4 eb t ect ecm a tl y tl where ect is the environmental cost of producing one kg of traditional paddy rice and ecm is the environmental cost of producing one kg of rice with miri a tl is the miri acreage in county in county l in year t and y tl is the county average yield usda nass 2020 in kilograms in year t from 2002 to 2018 the environmental benefits must be calculated based on total number of kilograms produced under miri production practices given the comparative metric for the lca is in kilograms of rice the only additional cost of miri compared to traditional flooding is the use of poly tubing which the university of arkansas cooperative extension uaex 2020 estimated at 3 88 per acre the total cost of polytubing is estimated at 8 82 per acre 0 44 h of labor at 11 33 per hour plus the 3 88 in material conventional rice production also requires 0 44 h of labor dedicated to irrigation thus the relative cost difference between conventional and miri rice is 3 88 per acre deliberto and harrell 2020 lsu 2020 total benefits tb t in dollars at the state level in year t associated with historical miri adoption attributed to the rice checkoff program can be estimated as 5 tb t s t vw t eb t a tl m t 3 88 the additional cost of miri adoption over conventional flooded rice is calculated by summing all county level miri acres a tl m t in year t and multiplying by the cost of polytubing 3 88 per acre the additional environmental impacts associated with polytubing production and recycling are accounted for in the lca as well 3 results and discussion 3 1 cost savings table s1 highlights the total cost savings from miri adoption from 2002 to 2018 on a county level basis all monetary values are expressed in 2018 usd pumping cost savings range from a low of 138 230 in 2002 to a high of 825 535 in 2008 with a total of 8 655 687 from 2002 to 2018 these savings are a function of miri acreage depth to water in each county and off road diesel price not surprisingly off road diesel price is the main driver of savings with the highest price gallon of 4 22 and the lowest price 1 34 occurring in the years with the highest and lowest cost savings respectively it is important to remember that these are only the benefits associated with rice checkoff funding those producers who said they adopted because of extension programs with funding from the rice checkoff and not the total benefits of miri for a given year in arkansas on a per acre basis savings range from a high of 16 48 in 2008 to a low of 5 37 in 2002 actual savings per acre are likely higher given that we assume equal adoption of miri across all rice growing counties when in reality it likely has a higher adoption rate in counties where depth to water is greater while not a straight comparison if we were to subtract the average per acre savings associated with miri adoption 10 75 estimated in our data from the 2020 total cost of conventional rice production 621 48 net returns would increase by 14 9 from 72 14 acre to 82 89 acre to put this in context roughly the same net return per acre 82 84 could be accomplished by a 1 5 gain in yield 170 172 55 bu ac this is likely why producers and checkoff boards and other public funding outlets are more supportive of funding breeding and other yield enhancement programs however yield gains from breeding specifically conventional rice breeding have slowed to an average genetic gain of 0 34 a year shew et al 2018 so while a 1 5 increase in yield seems marginal it is difficult to sustain over time 3 2 benefits of conserving water producers can easily internalize that saved water has a value but quantifying the value is not easy table s2 highlights the benefits of miri adoption using the in situ value of conserved water again these are only the benefits associated with the funds provided by the rice checkoff program and their associated miri acres unlike the cost savings which were a function of depth to water and diesel price the benefit of water conservation is simply a function of miri acres average yearly benefits were estimated to be 654 866 or 28 62 greater than the average yearly benefits from cost savings unlike the cost savings benefits these benefits may be slightly inflated as the kovacs and durand morat 2020 study estimated the in situ value of water to be 1 97 per acre in in 2020 it stands to reason that as the aquifer became more depleted over the time of our dataset 2002 2018 the value of stored water increased that being said there is no dynamic in situ value of water given the static 1 97 per acre estimate from previous work to give some relative context the in situ value of water per acre inch would have to fall to 1 53 a decrease of 28 75 before the total cost savings from fuel for 2002 2018 8 655 687 would become equivalent to the gains from water conservation this highlights the value of conserved water in relation to cost of production savings through water conservation programs like miri these results suggest that evaluating water efficiency enhancement programs like miri based on only direct cost savings underestimates the total value of the programs while rice producers and funding sources like commodity checkoff programs may not see instantaneous benefits from water savings they should understand the importance for industry sustainability and competitiveness if future funding decisions for miri were only made on direct cost savings it would underestimate the total yearly benefits by 128 as the annual average for cost savings was estimated to be 509 158 table s1 and for water conservation savings was estimated at 653 798 table s2 when the value of water conservation is considered suddenly water savings programs like miri become relatively more attractive than yield enhancing programs ceteris paribus 3 3 interpretation of midpoint lcia the characterization of environmental impacts from producing 1 kg of rice for the two case studies cascade as the baseline and miri are shown in table 3 including the bio physical units the differences between the baseline and miri represent the potential environmental impact reduction due to less water use the results show that the potential environmental mitigation from miri adoption was a reduction of 0 056 kg co2 eq gwp fossil and a 0 0001 kg pm2 5 eq respiratory inorganics compared to the baseline cascade flooding situation the stated impacts were 3 4 and 10 lower compared to the respective impacts calculated in the baseline situation likewise non renewable energy consumption was reduced by 0 73 mj per kg of rice which was attributed to 24 reduction in water use through miri and associated reduction in diesel consumption compared to the baseline situation other significant environmental benefits primarily from background stages i e production and supply of raw materials were for human toxicity non carcinogenic which was reduced by 22 aquatic ecotoxicity reduced by 18 4 and mineral extraction reduced by 15 5 table 3 the expected reduction in environmental impacts can be explained by the reduction of the raw materials consumption and energy inputs that change proportionally to the amount of irrigation one limitation of the current study is that we have not fully accounted for the integrated dynamics of ghg emissions primarily regarding methane and nitrous oxides which may be different for cascade flooded irrigation baseline and miri however there are mixed opinions on the net ghg savings due to water saving irrigation practices for instance wassmann et al 1993 argued that water saving could contribute to ch4 emissions reduction however kritee et al 2018 also suggested that the benefits of methane emission reduction are partially off set by increased n2o emissions in the case of cascade and miri both irrigation practices flood fields continuously during production so it is likely that these tradeoffs are less important than pumping fuel and materials for ghg emissions in the lcia comparison other potential effects relating to water stress are the potential increase in the mineralization of soil organic carbon due to heterotrophic respiration of soil when aerobic conditions prevail in soil in a non saturated condition that may increase co2 emissions moyano et al 2013 however these aspects are not investigated in the current study as the crop s net water requirement is not compromised 3 4 environmental benefits while the majority of commodity board funding is not aimed at more than economic gains our findings indicate miri funding and adoption is associated with substantial ecosystem benefits table 3 presents the monetized results for each of the stepwise impact categories the single score is the sum of the estimated external costs associated with the impacts that are associated with the full production supply chain for 1 kg of rice produced under cascade flooding single inlet and miri the single score for a kg of cascade flooded rice is estimated at 0 4066 and for miri it was estimated at 0 3814 a reduction of 0 0252 for every kg of rice produced with miri respiratory inorganics and effects associated with global warming were the major contributors to external environmental costs associated of rice production the difference between the ecosystem single scores for miri and cascade flooded rice 0 0252 kg in table 3 was multiplied by the total kg of rice produced under miri funded by the rice checkoff program for each year eq 4 to estimate the total ecosystem benefits of miri adoption associated with the arkansas rice checkoff program table s3 indicates that the average environmental impact reduction provided my miri adoption was valued at 3 72 million dollars annually across 2002 2018 to put this in perspective this is 730 larger than the annual average cost savings from fuel 509 198 568 larger than the average value of conserved water and 319 larger than the combined yearly average of fuel cost savings and the value of water conserved 1 16 million for both scenarios the contribution due to ghg emissions and respiratory inorganics to the total single score impact was about 54 and 30 the remaining impacts were due to human toxicity non carcinogenic 5 6 nature occupation 4 photo chemical ozone and vegetation 3 with the intervention of miri the reduction in impacts such as respiratory inorganics was 10 and for gwp fossil it was 3 4 we further compare the environmental impacts of miri adoption both with and without polytubing and find no significant difference in the lca likely due to recycling see table s4 the monetary values on table s3 need to be interpreted with some caution there are currently no markets for the majority of these environmental externalities limited carbon markets exist in some states and for some commodities and the benefits are not directly accrued by miri rice producers but rather society at large additionally we provide a comparison of these results assuming 100 diesel pumps with results assuming 50 diesel and 50 electric pumps in table s5 the environmental impacts are still substantially lower than in conventional flooded rice but about 30 lower relative to the 100 diesel impacts in our main results however we recommend caution in interpreting the 50 diesel and 50 electric pump scenario due to unknown heterogeneity of pumps across the time period of our study and county level sources and costs of electricity regardless of the pumping assumptions the benefits are not trivial as production agriculture becomes more aware of the value of environmental sustainability metrics like this stakeholders may incorporate these measures into research funding decisions commodity purchasing decisions and policy analysis while savings from miri investments are large the potential gains from further adoption are even greater as more producers face increasing irrigation costs and internalize the cost savings from miri via outlets funded by the arkansas rice checkoff program such as the mobile app adoption should increase 2017 2015 using 2018 acreage and prices as a baseline and the 33 2 adoption of miri we further estimate the benefits of complete 100 miri adoption holding the 10 34 of adoption attributed to the rice checkoff program constant with full adoption of miri on all 2018 arkansas rice acres the water savings would increase by 635 958 acre in avoided cost of environmental damages would increase by 7 62 million dollars fuel savings would increase by 878 994 and the savings from the in situ value of water increases by 1 25 million the net annual gain associated with miri adoption from fuel savings in situ value of water and avoided environmental costs while subtracting the price of polytubing would be 9 75 million dollars there is no a priori expectation that previous investments will lead to similar increases in adoption rates but given the average checkoff spending for miri was 70 650 2018 usd and the yearly gains for full adoption are estimated to be 9 75 million it would appear that more public funding is warranted for miri adoption 3 5 benefit cost ratio table 4 highlights the bcr of arkansas rice checkoff funds invested in the miri program these investments went to pay for labor flowmeters supplies and travel to conduct workshops apps demonstrations and general research average yearly funds invested in miri by the rice checkoff were 70 650 2018 usd annually when solely looking at the benefits derived from input reductions the estimated average bcr is 5 86 indicating that for every dollar the arkansas rice checkoff board invests into miri producers receive 5 86 dollars in benefits these would traditionally be the tangible benefits that producers and checkoff boards would use to evaluate the success of current and potential future investments however input savings research such as miri do not just save inputs internalizing only costs savings and failing to realize the future value of these saved inputs can underestimate the value of investments the bcr of fuel savings plus the value of conserved water is 16 79 1 table 4 these results would indicate that failing to account for the value of water conserved through miri underestimates its true benefits by 286 again producers and commodity boards understand that saving water is paramount to the long term viability of the rice industry but putting a value on water saved has been a difficult task these results shed light on the relative value of input savings versus the future value of saved inputs lastly accounting for the avoided environmental costs attributed to miri adoption resulting from rice checkoff funding plus fuel savings results in a bcr of 79 21 1 a 1350 increase in benefits from cost savings alone again it is important to realize these ecosystem benefits are not only being captured by the adopters of miri but society at large and as such the bcr can be misleading if trying to apply it solely to the arkansas rice industry regardless of the benefactors the avoided environmental damage provided via miri adoption should be recognized even if it is not accounted for in funding decisions the overarching objective of quantifying the environmental cost is to use the information to shape policies and incentives for better management despite the benefits the inherent drawbacks while managing environmental externalities is that in the majority of cases the individuals who make decisions such as farmers do not always directly benefit from the lower environmental burdens however even if farmers do not directly derive financial benefits from protecting the environment it is certain that their activities provide major benefits to other individuals power 2010 the agriculture sector accounts for 70 of global water use fao 2003 and as such the provision of an adequate amount of clean water is crucial for many agro ecosystems furthermore the increased variability of precipitation competition on the use of available water resources and predicted risks of drought and flood due to changing climatic effects has increased the importance of proper water stewardship ipcc 2007 miri provides farmers an effective method for conserving water in rice production while maintaining yields and profitability while we show the economic and environmental benefits of miri adoption it is important to note that some previous studies have shown increased water use due to technology adoption for water conservation li and zhao 2018 peterson and ding 2005 pfeiffer and lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 such studies have primarily taken place in the high plains aquifer the colorado river basin and the central valley in california and not in the lmrv which has distinct characteristics relative to these other regions specifically the arkansas delta has little room for agricultural land conversion most land capable of being farmed is already farmed so there are few opportunities for new agricultural land investments usda nass 2020 additionally most arkansas agricultural land is already irrigated and rice is 100 irrigated usda nass 2018 so there is low capacity for dryland to irrigated land conversion as a rebound effect lastly it could be possible that farmers change crops specifically they might grow more rice rather than soybeans based on rebound effects but the agronomic benefits of typical rice soybean rotations likely outweigh the potential benefits and costs of converting to rice rice rotations still future research in the study region should consider rebound effects particularly how the cost and water savings from the adoption of miri and other water saving technologies might be reinvested for other extensive or intensive purposes 4 conclusions given increased competitiveness and reduction in funding from many public granting agencies there is a need for a concerted effort to better estimate the holistic impacts to producers and the environment of funded projects this study examined the benefits from the arkansas rice checkoff program who funds public research from investments made between 2002 and 2018 in miri unlike yield enhancing research which can have quick tangible benefits input reduction research typically leads to marginal reductions in costs which producers can easily misidentify as simply adopting best management practices that being said there are often overlooked benefits associated with input savings research specifically related to water such as the future value of inputs conserved and the avoided environmental impacts provided via input reduction our findings suggest that by overlooking the future value of water conserved via miri adoption the benefit cost ratio would be underestimated by 286 not accounting for the future value of conserved ground water as well as the avoided impacts provided by the adoption of miri from cascade flooded rice would underestimate the benefit cost ratio by 1350 as environmental concerns grow commodity yield ceilings are approached and more commodity board public and private monies flow into input reducing research accounting for environmental and ecosystem service benefits is becoming more important our findings show the importance of not only accounting for the direct benefits producers experience now but the benefits they will receive from conserving inputs and the societal benefits provided through maintaining a healthier environment while explicit objectives of commodity boards are not to mitigate environmental impacts if they can show tangible results as in this study quantifying these external benefits can provide important information to disseminate about the societal value that research funded through commodity boards provides the contribution of this study is that when decision makers evaluate input reducing research they should look deeper than the cost savings incurred and consider the holistic impact water and environment have historically been acknowledged but seldom quantified in previous benefit cost ratio studies our research indicates that failure to both recognize and quantify these benefits can grossly underestimate the impact of water saving research and its adoption declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

irrigated by groundwater gandhi and namboodiri 2009 siebert et al 2010 the irrigated agriculture can only meet the increasing food demand das et al 2015 sustainable irrigation supply will be challenging under uncertain climatic conditions kharif monsoon and rabi winter are the main cropping seasons of eastern india paddy is the main crop due to the uncertain nature of southwest monsoon supplementary irrigation is required even during kharif season rejani et al 2003 during rabi season paddy cultivation majorly depends on groundwater resource and river water groundwater is generally seen as an insurance against non availability of surface water excessive pumping through irregularly operated tube wells adversely affects the groundwater table dynamics centrifugal pumps become inoperative beyond its optimum suction lift groundwater table depth however use of submersible pumps accelerates the groundwater table decline this in turn increases socio economic stress on the farmers thus the socio economic status of the farmers can be improved by optimum crop planning irrigation scheduling and resources allocation along with strong groundwater legislation linked simulation optimization modeling is very much essential for spatiotemporal allocation of natural resources land and water within a management framework the present work focuses on natural resources

the regional scale groundwater flow belcher et al 2004 faunt et al 2004 hou and zhang 2008 shao et al 2009 wang et al 2009 maheswaran et al 2016 under steady unsteady state conditions however direct linking of modflow with the management framework is computationally expensive nature of the physical problem complexity linearity nonlinearity and discontinuity and the nature of decision variables

is covered by fine and course loamy soils the climate is humid sub tropical with distinct three seasons winter summer and rainy monsoon mainly two distinct crop seasons kharif and rabi are present the annual average rainfall is about 1760 mm the annual average temperature varies from 25 to 32 c the maximum temperature 45 c and minimum temperature 7 c are observed in the month of may june and december january respectively during monsoon season high relative humidity is observed in the coastal belt of the study area and varies from 40 to 85 agriculture is the main backbone of the local rural population for the livelihood of the study area paddy is the principal crop grown and also the main food habits of the local and almost 90 of the total cultivated area covered by paddy during monsoon kharif seasons and 47 area covered during winter rabi seasons groundwater and limited surface water resources river lifts are the main two resources for agriculture and domestic purposes due to erratic and uncertain nature of the rainfall groundwater becomes the only dependable source of irrigation water for all the seasons consequently the groundwater table drastically going down and

systems theory was first proposed by deng 1982 a grey system is a system other than white system with completely known information and black system with completely unknown information systems grey numbers represent partially known and unknown information simultaneously a grey number is such a number whose exact value is unknown but a range within which the value lies is known distribution is unknown however a grey number with the same upper and lower bounds is known as a deterministic number in a grey linear programming glp model the uncertain nature of parameters and control variables are expressed in terms of upper and lower bounds without any distributional information the glp allows the interval information to be directly communicated into the optimization process and the resulting solution a glp model can be written as 24a m a x f c x subject to 24b a x b 24c x j 0 w h e r e a r m n b r m 1 a n d c r 1 n r d e n o t e s a s e t o f g r e y n u m b e r s c j a i j and b i form sets of interval values with deterministic lower and upper bounds the and superscripts represent the lower and upper bounds of parameters variables respectively an interactive glp solution algorithm was proposed by huang et al 1995 a detailed methodology of the grey linear programming glp can be found in huang et al 1995 1998 and mandal et al 2013 2 2 5 2 acceptability constrained linear programming aclp model in general acceptability constrained linear programming model can be written as 25a m a x f c x subject to 25b o r a x b a x b classical linear programming technique is used to obtain the solution of aclp model with mid value of the interval objective function sengupta et al 2001 inequality constraints are also converted to a satisfactory crisp equivalent eqs 11a and 11b 2 2 6 response matrix method physically based numerical simulation model can be utilized to characterize the aquifer system evaluation of groundwater resources assessment and to define pumping schedule for better management of aquifer system the response matrix and embedding method are the two techniques by which groundwater simulation gws model can be coupled with the optimization model the embedding method directly incorporates the groundwater flow equations as constraints in an optimization framework peralta et al 1991 gorelick 1983 concluded that embedding method is computational unstable and cannot be applied for large scale applications tung and kolterman 1985 peralta et al 1991 and safavi and enteshari 2016 also concluded that the embedding method is useful for small management problems the response matrix method is a linear solver that considers space and space time superposition the response matrix method can handle a more complex transient groundwater flow model with more heterogeneity within the model domain the response matrix method is generally used as a groundwater drawdown simulator it acts as a bridge between the groundwater model and the optimization model in the response matrix method a calibrated numerical groundwater simulation model is used to estimate the response coefficients β coefficient i e the change in drawdown due to unit pumping increase extraction from the aquifer or decrease injection recharge to the aquifer from a particular location or zone the resulting matrix is called as the response matrix it can be represented as 26 s l n p 1 n j 1 n b l o c k β l n j p δ g w j p n 1 2 3 4 l 1 2 3 11 where s l n drawdown at a location l monitoring well l at the end of n th time period β l n j z p response matrix function change in drawdown at location l monitoring well l at the end of n th time period due to a unit pumping for the j th zone during p th time period and δ g w j p unit pumping against base pumping at j th zone during p th time period in this study response matrix coefficient was generated based on the eq 26 2 3 application of the developed methodology the developed methodology was applied for illustrative purposes to a real world area 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater recharge estimation to compute the recharge rate at the sub watershed scale calibrated and validated hydrological model swat was used mandal et al 2021 the average annual groundwater recharge rate was varying from 519 mm to 858 mm year 2000 2010 and is shown in fig 5 the maximum recharge rate was found for 2001 and 2003 due to high rainfall it was observed that for the years 2000 2002 and 2009 the recharge rate decreased significantly due to less rainfall 3 2 groundwater simulation model 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the model calibration was performed through trial and error method by changing the parameter values manually hydraulic conductivity specific yield specific storage and porosity values based on available preliminary pumping test data and calibrated swat model parameter values the calibration target of the groundwater flow model was to minimize the difference between the calculated and the measured heads the average groundwater table data of the year 2005 was used as the initial head three years 2006 2008 and two years 2009 2010 groundwater table observation data were used for the calibration and validation respectively the monthly time step was used as a stress period during the model simulation parameters horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield and porosity sub basin wise recharge fig 4 and extraction block wise were utilized in modflow model based on the available data modeling was performed for 36 months starting from january 2006 to december 2008 a calibration target of 1 5 m was set for the match between the model simulated and the observation heads the components of the calibration targets box diagram are illustrated in the fig s1 the spatial distribution of calibrated and validated model parameters is shown in table 3 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 60 m day table 3 specific yield and porosity value vary from 0 08 to 0 25 and 0 15 0 35 respectively figs s2 s7 shows the matching of the computed hydraulic head to the observed hydraulic head during the calibration period yearly 4 times namely post winter pre monsoon post monsoon and winter were considered for the matching purpose the coefficient of determination r 2 varies from 0 73 to 0 91 figs s2 s7 it indicates that the model calibration is satisfactory however outliers are present near the boundaries model validation was performed for 2 years 2009 2010 period with the same stress period figs s8 s11 the coefficient of determination was vary from 0 77 to 0 91 and can be considered as satisfactory scatter plot of observed and simulated water table data for the calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 a and 6 b the overall coefficient of determination during calibration and validation period is 0 80 and 0 84 respectively this validated model was further utilized to generate grey response matrix 3 2 2 response matrix generation different level of extraction rates were tested on the calibrated and validated groundwater model boundary conditions aquifer parameter values input values provided during the calibration period were assumed as the baseline of the model in this study extraction of groundwater was increased as 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 from the base pumping data it is justified as there is an increasing trend of number of deep tube wells in the study area for extensive pumping of groundwater for water marketing a block level increment of uniformly distributed pumping rate and its impact on hydraulic heads were monitored eq 26 the extraction rate was increased as per the crop growing seasons of the study area yearly 4 times slice were chosen to monitor the hydraulic head fluctuation in observation wells the limit of the maximum fluctuation was fixed based on the 11 years observed data for the respective observation wells the extraction rate was increased for each time step and each sector block drawdown values were recorded for 11 observation wells selected from the existing observation wells namely m32 d2a 2a1 m37 a09 m36 1a8 m07 2b1 m08 and m09 from the set of the β coefficient matrix a grey β coefficient matrix was generated and utilized in the management framework as a drawdown constraint 3 3 land and water resources assessment the glp and aclp models were developed in matlab the total geographical areas for the administrative blocks balasore baliapal and basta are 28 395 25 423 and 28 484 ha respectively the corresponding cultivable command areas are 22 716 ha 20 338 ha 22 787 ha existing cropping pattern adopted in the study area is based on the growing season local climate soil type and food habits of the farmers therefore lower and upper limits of the existing cropping pattern were utilized as a limit for grey numbers in glp and aclp optimization models the existing cropping pattern in different blocks is presented in table s1 the unit cost of surface water and groundwater varies from rs 1500 ha m to rs 1800 ha m and from rs 1600 ha m to rs 1750 ha m in both rabi and kharif seasons respectively other information related to the study area e g net irrigation requirement net return surface water and groundwater availability are given in tables s2 s4 3 4 optimal land and water allocation eight

for glp formulation e g i zero value for lower bound of the cropped area without considering the response matrix under present climatic condition ii 40 value for lower bound of the existing cropped area and without considering the response matrix under present climatic condition iii zero value for lower bound of the cropped area considering the response matrix under present climatic condition and iv 40 value for lower bound of existing cropped area considering the response matrix under present climatic condition similarly the remaining 4 scenarios were considered under the futuristic climatic condition specifying a zero value for the lower bound of the cropped area scenario i will yield higher benefits under a less constrained system the system will try to achieve the maximum benefit by specifying zero values for low priced crops this will not reflect the actual field situation thus lower limit was specified as 40 of the existing cropped area to consider the local farmers interest food habit and traditional thinking to compute the hydraulic response due to pumping from one block 11 observation wells were considered as control or monitoring points out of 11 observation wells balasore baliapal and basta blocks cover 2 4 and 5 wells respectively optimum allocation of land area for the scenario i is shown in table 4 it can be observed table 4 that no areas were allocated for multiple crops maize green gram black gram sesame chilli wheat mustard and sunflower corresponding to the lower limit however the upper limits are equal to the maximum specified value the same cropped area was allocated corresponding to the minimum and maximum limits for rest of the crops except groundnut and mesta for baliapal block the net annual return ranges between rs 2 800448 109 and rs 3 734783 109 sufficient water was available for this scenario and hence majority of crops attain the maximum land area table 4 also shows that the allocated area for rice cultivation significantly differs from season to season rice consumes more water as compared to all other crops however the economic return is comparatively less water availability in kharif season is more which allows farmers to grow more rice it was also reflected in optimization model solutions farmers are getting the maximum benefit from kharif season as the maximum area is being allocated for crops in comparison to rabi season optimal allocation of the groundwater and surface water is given in table 5 along with the minimum and maximum net annual return in rabi season river water allocation attained the maximum limit due to increased agricultural water demand in kharif season river water utilization is near to zero as the unit cost of river water is high as compared to the groundwater in all the blocks allocation for groundwater was more in comparison to river water due to its cost and availability in scenario ii profit increased for the basta blocks and decreased in baliapal block in rabi season as compared to scenario i it is due to specification of the crop area lower bound 40 of actual lower bound however overall net benefit from the study area ranges between rs 2 773824 109 and rs 3 734783 109 the upper limit remains unchanged however the lower limit becomes less as compared to scenario i scenario ii related results are given in table 6 groundwater and surface water allocations are given in table 5 scenario iii is similar to the scenario i except the drawdown constraint in this scenario grey response matrix was incorporated within the glp model land area allocations are presented in table 7 reduction in maximum cropped area during rabi season can be observed as compared to kharif season compared to the scenario i more than 30 87 reduction in the cropped area was observed during rabi season interestingly the area allocated to rice is zero including many other crops in rabi season table 7 area was allocated to few crops green gram vegetable gram potato garlic and coriander in rabi season however only 13 18 reduction in cropped area was observed in kharif season in comparison to scenario i groundwater and surface water allocation are shown in table 5 river water attained a maximum limit for both the seasons a decrease in groundwater allocation can be observed in scenario iii as compared to scenario i in scenarios i and ii it was observed that the groundwater allocation was at the maximum level as the estimation of total available groundwater was based on the water table fluctuation method without considering the modflow model link due to drawdown constraints the optimization model allocates less groundwater as compared to scenario i which decreases the cultivated area and eventually decreases the net benefits results indicate that the consideration of wtf method for groundwater availability estimation may lead to overexploitation of the aquifer system in kharif season net benefit from each block decreases in rabi season maximum decrease 61 67 is observed in baliapal block in scenario iii as compared to scenario i an overall economic loss was observed in the tune of 28 31 as compared to the scenario i table s5 scenario iv is similar to scenario ii and incorporates drawdown constraints tables 8 and 5 show the optimum allocation of land and water resources respectively overall crop area in rabi and kharif seasons decreases with respect to scenario ii by 62 78 and 14 19 respectively however individual blocks were showing crop area decrease 46 in balasore and 30 in basta and increase 100 in baliapal in rabi season a decrease of 1 1 5 during kharif season can be observed for all the blocks in comparison to scenario iii net benefit also decreases by 65 71 and 13 14 in rabi and kharif seasons respectively overall profit decreases by 40 43 in comparison to scenario ii table s5 there is no change in surface water allocation as compared to scenario iii surface water allocation was maximum in scenario iv as compared to scenario ii no zero allocation an increase in allocated groundwater value was observed in kharif season in basta and balasore blocks except for baliapal as compared to scenario ii however a decrease in groundwater allocation was observed for rabi season no significant differences were observed between the scenarios i and ii crop areas attain maximum level due to sufficient water availability however a reduction in the allocated land area was observed for both scenarios iii and iv due to a change in water availability condition a sharp drop in net return was observed for both scenarios iii and iv as compared to scenarios i and ii these suggest that the utility of grey response matrix scenarios v vi vii and viii were generated from scenarios i ii iii iv respectively with 10 yield reduction for all the blocks in scenarios v and vi no change was observed in crop area allocation as compared to scenarios i and ii no impact of yield reduction was observed on the land and water allocation however a decrease in net benefit was observed 10 55 10 77 for the scenarios v and vi the overall decrease in benefits in scenarios vii and viii were similar to scenarios v and vi the impact of yield reduction on crop area allocation was observed due to the inclusion of restrictive groundwater constraint response matrix change in optimum rice area allocation was observed only in kharif net benefit decreased by 8 10 as compared to scenario iii in scenario viii kharif rice area increased by 8 and 5 for the balasore and basta blocks respectively and decreased by 14 for the baliapal block as compared to scenario iv moreover no significant change was observed during water resources allocation table 5 net benefits for all the cropping seasons are given in table 5 table s5 shows block and season wise net benefits for all the scenarios table s6 shows the total area allocated for each season under different blocks of the study area upper and lower bounds for different crops were the same except for few cases thus the grey degree is nearly zero a decision with lesser grey degree value can easily be implemented as it indicates less operational uncertainty another eight scenarios ia to viiia were generated for the aclp model under different combinations of α value generated by latin hypercube sampling technique from the previously developed eight scenarios under glp model i to viii α value can be interpreted as an optimistic threshold and fixed value assigned by the decision maker in the range of 0 1 alpha values for 4 constraints were generated 10 sets of values by using latin hypercube sampling method scenario i and ii of glp model become the same for aclp model represented as scenario ia iia similarly scenario iii and iv of glp become the same for aclp model represented as scenario iiia iva and so on optimum allocation of land and water resources for the scenario ia to iva table s7 and scenario va to viiia table s8 were obtained from the aclp model the overall net benefits obtained in scenarios ia and iia were less than the upper limit of the glp model output scenarios i and ii however increased net benefits were observed for scenario iiia iva when compared with scenario iii and iv increase in crop area was observed during rabi season aclp provides a relatively less complex outcome it can be applied only for solving the problems under parameter uncertainty 3 5 groundwater aquifer status under optimum groundwater allocation to verify the efficacy of the optimization model groundwater allocation results were further utilized as the maximum withdrawal in the modflow simulation model block and season wise total groundwater pumping values were distributed as per the maximum allocated value among all the scenarios further calibrated and validated gw simulation model was run for 1 year to see the sustainable nature of the management model solutions the observation wells 14 number were used to monitor the response due to an increase in pumping value box diagram figs 7 and 8 shows post winter pre monsoon post monsoon winter simulation results in rabi season post monsoon and post winter all observation wells are satisfying the condition figs 7 and 8 in kharif season values corresponding to m31 2a3 and a16 are not matching there may be a possibility of a boundary effect for three observation wells except for two observation wells m31 and 2a3 12 observation wells are showing good agreement with the new pumping condition it can be concluded from the discussion that there is no sign of any overexploitation of groundwater the obtained groundwater extraction rates can be implemented by considering the gwpz map mandal et al 2016 and water quality map from the above discussion it is found that the implementation of optimum allocation of land and water resources is practically feasible 4 conclusions an integrated land and water resources model framework was developed it consists of a groundwater simulation model and an optimization model linked by the response matrix function mechanism the developed models were tested under plausible scenarios these performance evaluation results show that the proposed methodology performs satisfactorily for the downstream part of the subarnarekha river basin the following conclusions can be inferred from the present study different aquifer parameters ranges hydraulic conductivity in 5 60 m day specific yield in 0 08 0 25 and porosity in 0 15 0 35 were identified during the calibration of 3 d groundwater flow simulation model modflow model calibration and validation were performed satisfactorily with a coefficient of determination of more than 0 80 modflow was successfully utilized for generating the grey response matrix gray linear programming glp formulation was tested for eight plausible scenarios maximum profit was obtained for scenario i in scenario iii more than 30 87 cropped area reduction was observed during rabi season and 13 18 area reduction during kharif season as compared to scenario i economic loss was evident in scenario iii from 28 to 31 as compared to scenario i overall cropland area decreased by 62 78 and 14 19 in rabi and kharif respectively in scenario iv as compared to scenario ii in scenarios iii and iv crop area decreased due to the linking of optimization and simulation model by grey response matrix function yield reduction was introduced in the optimization model scenarios v viii however no significant changes in cropping and water allocation were observed moreover the net benefit reduced by 10 55 10 77 in scenario v to viii optimum groundwater allocation obtained from scenarios iii and iv were validated by the groundwater simulation model the aquifer system was under the safe limit indicating the sustainable condition of the aquifer grey degree for all the decision variables obtained from the glp model solution is near to zero or zero it indicates that the optimum solution can be implemented directly to the field acceptability constrained linear programming aclp formulation was also tested for the same set of scenarios an increase in crop area allocation was observed for positive change in alpha value overall profit decreases by 10 72 in scenarios iiia and iva as compared to scenarios ia and iia reduction in crop area during rabi was more than the kharif season this trend was also observed for va to viiia overall profit loss was observed in the tune of 10 11 from the first four scenarios ia iva to the last four scenarios va viiia it can be concluded that if there is no grey information available for decision or control variables aclp model can be used satisfactorily a solution with less grey degree is a realistic implementable solution for glp model the developed methodology will be helpful for the decision maker s to prepare a meaningful implementable strategy for enhancing the agricultural production of the study area the developed methodology can be potentially applied to any other tropical river basin with or without modifications the limitation of the present work is related to linking of response matrix model with optimization model grey response matrix linearizes the physical model the framework can be improved by direct linking of modflow or other groundwater simulation model with the optimization model the optimization framework needs to be modified under such alterations however it will increase the computational burden exponentially declaration of competing interest the authors

10086,constant decline of freshwater reserve poses a major challenge for coastal agricultural systems the present study focuses on the integrated land and water resources management framework under operational and climatic uncertainties to achieve sustainable agricultural production in a tropical coastal river basin to capture the operational and climatic uncertainties grey linear programming glp and acceptability constrained linear programming aclp optimization models were developed glp can consider both climatic and operational uncertainties however aclp can accommodate operational uncertainty only groundwater model was coupled within the optimization models glp and aclp by a grey response matrix the swat estimated recharge rates were utilized in the modflow model as the groundwater flux the calibrated r 2 0 80 and validated r 2 0 84 groundwater flow simulation model was utilized to generate the grey response matrix the eight plausible scenarios were tested for glp scenarios i ii iii iv v vi vii viii and aclp scenarios ia iia iiia iva va via viia viiia with groundwater table fluctuation gwtf method and grey response matrix as drawdown constraint a reduction in net annual return was observed in scenarios iii and iv with grey response matrix in comparison to scenarios i and ii with groundwater table fluctuation under any change in crop yield decrease was more prominent for rabi winter season compared to kharif monsoon season futuristic scenarios v vi vii viii considering crop yield reduction showed a possible change required in cropping pattern specifically rice area reduction in kharif season aclp model results showed similar trends results suggest that the gwtf method overestimates the groundwater availability compared to the physically based simulation model obtained land and water resources management plans were cross validated for the safe yield limit using modflow simulation model keywords acceptability constrained linear programming climatic and operational uncertainty grey linear programming integrated natural resources management framework surface and groundwater sustainable agriculture 1 introduction basin or sub basin scale water availability assessment from conjunctive use point of view is becoming a subject of concern mandal et al 2013 yang et al 2015 li et al 2018 gong et al 2020 lalehzari et al 2020 agriculture sector consumes more than 70 of the total available water yang et al 2015 in india 37 of the gross cropped area is under irrigation however approximately 60 of the cropped area is irrigated by groundwater gandhi and namboodiri 2009 siebert et al 2010 the irrigated agriculture can only meet the increasing food demand das et al 2015 sustainable irrigation supply will be challenging under uncertain climatic conditions kharif monsoon and rabi winter are the main cropping seasons of eastern india paddy is the main crop due to the uncertain nature of southwest monsoon supplementary irrigation is required even during kharif season rejani et al 2003 during rabi season paddy cultivation majorly depends on groundwater resource and river water groundwater is generally seen as an insurance against non availability of surface water excessive pumping through irregularly operated tube wells adversely affects the groundwater table dynamics centrifugal pumps become inoperative beyond its optimum suction lift groundwater table depth however use of submersible pumps accelerates the groundwater table decline this in turn increases socio economic stress on the farmers thus the socio economic status of the farmers can be improved by optimum crop planning irrigation scheduling and resources allocation along with strong groundwater legislation linked simulation optimization modeling is very much essential for spatiotemporal allocation of natural resources land and water within a management framework the present work focuses on natural resources allocation problem under climatic and operational uncertainty various optimization techniques were used to maximize the net annual return under optimal cropping patterns singh et al 2001 raju and kumar 2004 khare et al 2006 rejani et al 2009 raul and panda 2013 singh and panda 2013 li and guo 2015 singh 2016 khandelwal and dhiman 2018 optimization models such as deterministic linear programming sethi et al 2006 pulido velazquez et al 2008 karamouz et al 2010 raul and panda 2013 singh 2016 chance constrained linear programming panda et al 1985 sethi et al 2006 shirahatti and

kumar 2004 safavi et al 2010 peralta et al 2014 ayvaz 2016 were utilized in the context of optimum land and water resources allocations in irrigated canal commands as well as in the river basins a comprehensive review of important works is provided in table 1 groundwater modeling within management framework is important from conjunctive use point of view modflow can be suitably used to simulate the regional scale groundwater flow belcher et al 2004 faunt et al 2004 hou and zhang 2008 shao et al 2009 wang et al 2009 maheswaran et al 2016 under steady unsteady state conditions however direct linking of modflow with the management framework is computationally expensive nature of the physical problem complexity linearity nonlinearity and discontinuity and the nature of decision variables discrete continuous and integer dictates the choice of optimization algorithm for any problem linearization of physical processes by response matrix approach is a widely used method which facilitates the use of linear programming gorelick 1982 1983 karatzas and pinder 1993 hallaji and yazicigil 1996 mantoglou 2003 reichard and johnson 2005 psilovikos 2006 karterakis et al 2007 pisinaras et al 2013 kifanyi et al 2019 however response matrix approach does not consider the uncertainties in the real world problems the decision variables and coefficient of any management model are random in nature in the fuzzy optimization model the constraints and goals are viewed as fuzzy sets and assumed that their membership functions are known sengupta et al 2001 similarly in stochastic linear programming problem or chance constrained linear programming problem the parameters are viewed as random variables and fitted to suitable probability density functions the deterministic equivalents are determined under given exceedance non exceedance probability levels kall 1982 sengupta et al 2001 the selection of probability density function and membership function is subjective in nature and directly impacts the management strategy or policy grey linear programming and acceptability constrained linear programming models can be utilized to overcome the above mentioned limitation a judicious planning for optimum cropping and water resources surface water and groundwater allocation is essential for sustainable agriculture and aquifer the main objective of the present study is to develop an integrated land and water resources management framework by considering parameter and operational uncertainties framework includes a linked simulation optimization model a novel grey response matrix was utilized as a groundwater head simulator this is the first attempt to use grey linear programming glp and acceptability constraint linear programming aclp in conjunction with the grey response matrix for solving the natural resources allocation problem the proposed framework was applied to a tropical river basin of eastern india feedback mechanism was also applied to check the acceptability of the obtained results 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area description the coastal groundwater tropical river basin subarnarekha river s downstream part latitude 21 27 21 45 45 n and longitude 86 56 15 87 20 30 e and covering an area of about 823 km2 consists of three administrative blocks bounded by subarnarekha river in the east side budhabalang river in west side the southern side is the bay of bengal and the northern side is hilly terrain of mayurbhanj district of odisha state was chosen as the study area fig 1 the study area is having alluvial deposits of recent to older major area is covered by fine and course loamy soils the climate is humid sub tropical with distinct three seasons winter summer and rainy monsoon mainly two distinct crop seasons kharif and rabi are present the annual average rainfall is about 1760 mm the annual average temperature varies from 25 to 32 c the maximum temperature 45 c and minimum temperature 7 c are observed in the month of may june and december january respectively during monsoon season high relative humidity is observed in the coastal belt of the study area and varies from 40 to 85 agriculture is the main backbone of the local rural population for the livelihood of the study area paddy is the principal crop grown and also the main food habits of the local and almost 90 of the total cultivated area covered by paddy during monsoon kharif seasons and 47 area covered during winter rabi seasons groundwater and limited surface water resources river lifts are the main two resources for agriculture and domestic purposes due to erratic and uncertain nature of the rainfall groundwater becomes the only dependable source of irrigation water for all the seasons consequently the groundwater table drastically going down and some pockets of the study area observed seawater intrusion evidence mandal et al 2016 more details of the study area description are available in mandal et al 2016 2 2 integrated management framework the overall methodology is presented in fig 2 optimization model grey linear programming was utilized to get a possible policy using initial information about the different system parameters and variables the response coefficients were stored in grey response matrix in terms of hydraulic head changes due to different pumping scenarios instead of single response coefficient value a range of values i e grey numbers were used to capture the aquifer response optimal solutions were obtained from the grey linear programming model the results obtained from the optimization model were fed to the simulation model to check whether the hydraulic head is within the acceptable limit or not the management framework links the optimization and simulation models to give a sustainable land and water management policy 2 2 1 grey linear programming glp model a grey linear programming glp optimization model was developed for sustainable agricultural production system for land and water

in the optimization model 2 2 1 2 1 land area constraints total cultivable area tca should not be greater than the total geographical area it should not be the same unless the total geographical area completely bounded by agricultural activities land again it is the summation of all the crop cultivated area in a particular cropping season should not be greater than the total cultivated area and

constraints normally used to consider the stakeholders interest and food habit e g rice is the staple food farmers cultivate rice in three seasons monsoon winter and summer without bothering about groundwater extraction in this situation it will not be a feasible solution in real world situations to divert the entire cropping pattern towards a mono crop rice on the prevailing land water availability and returns in terms of economics however mathematically it is possible to get a maximum benefit based on resources limitation constraints to tackle this type of problem maximum minimum allowable area constraints are introduced here the constraints are represented in the mathematical form as 6 a i j k μ i j k max t a i j k 7 a i j k μ i j k min t a i j k where μ i j k max factor by which the existing area of crop k can be increased in season j for block i and μ i j k min factor by which the existing area of crop k can be decreased in season j for block i 2 2 1 2 5 drawdown

recharge rate estimation from hydrological model the hydrological model estimated recharge values were utilized in the modflow model the swat model utilizes gis framework along with spatiotemporal hydrological and meteorological data for simulation arnold et al 2012 the water balance equation was satisfied by considering different hydrological processes involved e g rainfall runoff recharge

period hydrological model swat and groundwater flow model modflow can be linked in two ways i one way approach and ii two way approach in a one way approach swat and modflow models are separately simulated swat model outputs recharge rate are used as inputs to the modflow model pisinaras et al 2013 however in a two way approach both swat and modflow models are linked internally and run simultaneously in a single dynamic framework in this study the recharge rate is unknown and estimated from the swat model output recharge rates at the sub basin scale were computed as the areal

types shallow wells owned by farmers and deep wells owned by both rich farmers and government its variable pumping rates duration of pumping and spatial distribution indirect estimation of groundwater abstraction was considered based on crop water demand crop evapotranspiration et crop was calculated based on available cropping patterns within a block and local meteorological parameters monthly net irrigation water demand was calculated by deducting the effective rainfall from the et crop considering the individual crop growth stages the tube well irrigation system efficiency value of 0 6 was considered estimated abstraction rates were assigned at each block levels fig 3 a it was assumed that the extraction is uniform over the study area for growing monocrop rice during the cropping season 2 2 4 model input database the optimization model also requires much data as per the objective function and various constraints used both surface water river water and groundwater were considered for the land resources agricultural statistics 2005 2015 for rabi and kharif program were utilized it was observed that the area under different crops vary from year to year similarly crop yield sowing

stored soil water and precipitation and supply the water required for the full yield of an irrigated crop to avoid crop water stress rainfall along with irrigation applications must be sufficient to meets the crops water demand in this study cropwat model was used to estimate the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 using penman monteith method daily monthly weather parameter and sunshine hour data were fed to the cropwat model to estimate et 0 the crop coefficient values for each crop were taken from the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 to calculate crop evapotranspiration et c at different stage of each crop growing period by multiplying the et 0 by a crop coefficient k c from the agronomist point of view effective rainfall erf is the utilizable water by plants retained in the root zone the erf is always equal to or larger than zero and never becomes negative usda soil conservation service equation was used to estimate monthly erf monthly net irrigation requirement nir was

as dynamic groundwater resource both pre and post monsoon data year 2000 2010 from observation wells 48 number were utilized to interpolate kriging technique the groundwater levels for a 0 50 km by 0

fluctuation was estimated from pre and post monsoon water table data year 2000 2010 from existing observation wells 11 nos were utilized difference max fluctuation at each observation well locations was utilized as the maximum drawdown it was also considered as the safe yield condition for sustainable pumping condition 2 2 5 optimization algorithm 2 2 5 1 grey linear programming glp model grey systems theory was first proposed by deng 1982 a grey system is a system other than white system with completely known information and black system with completely unknown information systems grey numbers represent partially known and unknown information simultaneously a grey number is such a number whose exact value is unknown but a range within which the value lies is known distribution is unknown however a grey number with the same upper and lower bounds is known as a deterministic number in a grey linear programming glp model the uncertain nature of parameters and control variables are expressed in terms of upper and lower bounds without any distributional information the glp allows the interval information to be directly communicated into the optimization process and the resulting solution a glp model can be written as 24a m a x f c x subject to 24b a x b 24c x j 0 w h e r e a r m n b r m 1 a n d c r 1 n r d e n o t e s a s e t o f g r e y n u m b e r s c j a i j and b i form sets of interval values with deterministic lower and upper bounds the and superscripts represent the lower and upper bounds of parameters variables respectively an interactive glp solution algorithm was proposed by huang et al 1995 a detailed methodology of the grey linear programming glp can be found in huang et al 1995 1998 and mandal et al 2013 2 2 5 2 acceptability constrained linear programming aclp model in general acceptability constrained linear programming model can be written as 25a m a x f c x subject to 25b o r a x b a x b classical linear programming technique is used to obtain the solution of aclp model with mid value of the interval objective function sengupta et al 2001 inequality constraints are also converted to a satisfactory crisp equivalent eqs 11a and 11b 2 2 6 response matrix method physically based numerical simulation model can be utilized to characterize the aquifer system evaluation of groundwater resources assessment and to define pumping schedule for better management of aquifer system the response matrix and embedding method are the two techniques by which groundwater simulation gws model can be coupled with the optimization model the embedding method directly incorporates the groundwater flow equations as constraints in an optimization framework peralta et al 1991 gorelick 1983 concluded that embedding method is computational unstable and cannot be applied for large scale applications tung and kolterman 1985 peralta et al 1991 and safavi and enteshari 2016 also concluded that the embedding method is useful for small management problems the response matrix method is a linear solver that considers space and space time superposition the response matrix method can handle a more complex transient groundwater flow model with more heterogeneity within the model domain the response matrix method is generally used as a groundwater drawdown simulator it acts as a bridge between the groundwater model and the optimization model in the response matrix method a calibrated numerical groundwater simulation model is used to estimate the response coefficients β coefficient i e the change in drawdown due to unit pumping increase extraction from the aquifer or decrease injection recharge to the aquifer from a particular location or zone the resulting matrix is called as the response matrix it can be represented as 26 s l n p 1 n j 1 n b l o c k β l n j p δ g w j p n 1 2 3 4 l 1 2 3 11 where s l n drawdown at a location l monitoring well l at the end of n th time period β l n j z p response matrix function change in drawdown at location l monitoring well l at the end of n th time period due to a unit pumping for the j th zone during p th time period and δ g w j p unit pumping against base pumping at j th zone during p th time period in this study response matrix coefficient was generated based on the eq 26 2 3 application of the developed methodology the developed methodology was applied for illustrative purposes to a real world area 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater recharge estimation to compute the recharge rate at the sub watershed scale calibrated and validated hydrological model swat was used mandal et al 2021 the average annual groundwater recharge rate was varying from 519 mm to 858 mm year 2000 2010 and is shown in fig 5 the maximum recharge rate was found for 2001 and 2003 due to high rainfall it was observed that for the years 2000 2002 and 2009 the recharge rate decreased significantly due to less rainfall 3 2 groundwater simulation model 3 2 1 model calibration and validation the model calibration was performed through trial and error method by changing the parameter values manually hydraulic conductivity specific yield specific storage and porosity values based on available preliminary pumping test data and calibrated swat model parameter values the calibration target of the groundwater flow model was to minimize the difference between the calculated and the measured heads the average groundwater table data of the year 2005 was used as the initial head three years 2006 2008 and two years 2009 2010 groundwater table observation data were used for the calibration and validation respectively the monthly time step was used as a stress period during the model simulation parameters horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity specific storage specific yield and porosity sub basin wise recharge fig 4 and extraction block wise were utilized in modflow model based on the available data modeling was performed for 36 months starting from january 2006 to december 2008 a calibration target of 1 5 m was set for the match between the model simulated and the observation heads the components of the calibration targets box diagram are illustrated in the fig s1 the spatial distribution of calibrated and validated model parameters is shown in table 3 the horizontal hydraulic conductivity ranges from 5 to 60 m day table 3 specific yield and porosity value vary from 0 08 to 0 25 and 0 15 0 35 respectively figs s2 s7 shows the matching of the computed hydraulic head to the observed hydraulic head during the calibration period yearly 4 times namely post winter pre monsoon post monsoon and winter were considered for the matching purpose the coefficient of determination r 2 varies from 0 73 to 0 91 figs s2 s7 it indicates that the model calibration is satisfactory however outliers are present near the boundaries model validation was performed for 2 years 2009 2010 period with the same stress period figs s8 s11 the coefficient of determination was vary from 0 77 to 0 91 and can be considered as satisfactory scatter plot of observed and simulated water table data for the calibration and validation period are shown in fig 6 a and 6 b the overall coefficient of determination during calibration and validation period is 0 80 and 0 84 respectively this validated model was further utilized to generate grey response matrix 3 2 2 response matrix generation different level of extraction rates were tested on the calibrated and validated groundwater model boundary conditions aquifer parameter values input values provided during the calibration period were assumed as the baseline of the model in this study extraction of groundwater was increased as 5 10 25 50 100 and 200 from the base pumping data it is justified as there is an increasing trend of number of deep tube wells in the study area for extensive pumping of groundwater for water marketing a block level increment of uniformly distributed pumping rate and its impact on hydraulic heads were monitored eq 26 the extraction rate was increased as per the crop growing seasons of the study area yearly 4 times slice were chosen to monitor the hydraulic head fluctuation in observation wells the limit of the maximum fluctuation was fixed based on the 11 years observed data for the respective observation wells the extraction rate was increased for each time step and each sector block drawdown values were recorded for 11 observation wells selected from the existing observation wells namely m32 d2a 2a1 m37 a09 m36 1a8 m07 2b1 m08 and m09 from the set of the β coefficient matrix a grey β coefficient matrix was generated and utilized in the management framework as a drawdown constraint 3 3 land and water resources assessment the glp and aclp models were developed in matlab the total geographical areas for the administrative blocks balasore baliapal and basta are 28 395 25 423 and 28 484 ha respectively the corresponding cultivable command areas are 22 716 ha 20 338 ha 22 787 ha existing cropping pattern adopted in the study area is based on the growing season local climate soil type and food habits of the farmers therefore lower and upper limits of the existing cropping pattern were utilized as a limit for grey numbers in glp and aclp optimization models the existing cropping pattern in different blocks is presented in table s1 the unit cost of surface water and groundwater varies from rs 1500 ha m to rs 1800 ha m and from rs 1600 ha m to rs 1750 ha m in both rabi and kharif seasons respectively other information related to the study area e g net irrigation requirement net return surface water and groundwater availability are given in tables s2 s4 3 4 optimal land and water allocation eight plausible scenarios were considered to evaluate the impact of groundwater simulation model coupled with the optimization model glp and aclp total 8 scenarios 4 present and 4 futuristic were generated for glp formulation e g i zero value for lower bound of the cropped area without considering the response matrix under present climatic condition ii 40 value for lower bound of the existing cropped area and without considering the response matrix under present climatic condition iii zero value for lower bound of the cropped area considering the response matrix under present climatic condition and iv 40 value for lower bound of existing cropped area considering the response matrix under present climatic condition similarly the remaining 4 scenarios were considered under the futuristic climatic condition specifying a zero value for the lower bound of the cropped area scenario i will yield higher benefits under a less constrained system the system will try to achieve the maximum benefit by specifying zero values for low priced crops this will not reflect the actual field situation thus lower limit was specified as 40 of the existing cropped area to consider the local farmers interest food habit and traditional thinking to compute the hydraulic response due to pumping from one block 11 observation wells were considered as control or monitoring points out of 11 observation wells balasore baliapal and basta blocks cover 2 4 and 5 wells respectively optimum allocation of land area for the scenario i is shown in table 4 it can be observed table 4 that no areas were allocated for multiple crops maize green gram black gram sesame chilli wheat mustard and sunflower corresponding to the lower limit however the upper limits are equal to the maximum specified value the same cropped area was allocated corresponding to the minimum and maximum limits for rest of the crops except groundnut and mesta for baliapal block the net annual return ranges between rs 2 800448 109 and rs 3 734783 109 sufficient water was available for this scenario and hence majority of crops attain the maximum land area table 4 also shows that the allocated area for rice cultivation significantly differs from season to season rice consumes more water as compared to all other crops however the economic return is comparatively less water availability in kharif season is more which allows farmers to grow more rice it was also reflected in optimization model solutions farmers are getting the maximum benefit from kharif season as the maximum area is being allocated for crops in comparison to rabi season optimal allocation of the groundwater and surface water is given in table 5 along with the minimum and maximum net annual return in rabi season river water allocation attained the maximum limit due to increased agricultural water demand in kharif season river water utilization is near to zero as the unit cost of river water is high as compared to the groundwater in all the blocks allocation for groundwater was more in comparison to river water due to its cost and availability in scenario ii profit increased for the basta blocks and decreased in baliapal block in rabi season as compared to scenario i it is due to specification of the crop area lower bound 40 of actual lower bound however overall net benefit from the study area ranges between rs 2 773824 109 and rs 3 734783 109 the upper limit remains unchanged however the lower limit becomes less as compared to scenario i scenario ii related results are given in table 6 groundwater and surface water allocations are given in table 5 scenario iii is similar to the scenario i except the drawdown constraint in this scenario grey response matrix was incorporated within the glp model land area allocations are presented in table 7 reduction in maximum cropped area during rabi season can be observed as compared to kharif season compared to the scenario i more than 30 87 reduction in the cropped area was observed during rabi season interestingly the area allocated to rice is zero including many other crops in rabi season table 7 area was allocated to few crops green gram vegetable gram potato garlic and coriander in rabi season however only 13 18 reduction in cropped area was observed in kharif season in comparison to scenario i groundwater and surface water allocation are shown in table 5 river water attained a maximum limit for both the seasons a decrease in groundwater allocation can be observed in scenario iii as compared to scenario i in scenarios i and ii it was observed that the groundwater allocation was at the maximum level as the estimation of total available groundwater was based on the water table fluctuation method without considering the modflow model link due to drawdown constraints the optimization model allocates less groundwater as compared to scenario i which decreases the cultivated area and eventually decreases the net benefits results indicate that the consideration of wtf method for groundwater availability estimation may lead to overexploitation of the aquifer system in kharif season net benefit from each block decreases in rabi season maximum decrease 61 67 is observed in baliapal block in scenario iii as compared to scenario i an overall economic loss was observed in the tune of 28 31 as compared to the scenario i table s5 scenario iv is similar to scenario ii and incorporates drawdown constraints tables 8 and 5 show the optimum allocation of land and water resources respectively overall crop area in rabi and kharif seasons decreases with respect to scenario ii by 62 78 and 14 19 respectively however individual blocks were showing crop area decrease 46 in balasore and 30 in basta and increase 100 in baliapal in rabi season a decrease of 1 1 5 during kharif season can be observed for all the blocks in comparison to scenario iii net benefit also decreases by 65 71 and 13 14 in rabi and kharif seasons respectively overall profit decreases by 40 43 in comparison to scenario ii table s5 there is no change in surface water allocation as compared to scenario iii surface water allocation was maximum in scenario iv as compared to scenario ii no zero allocation an increase in allocated groundwater value was observed in kharif season in basta and balasore blocks except for baliapal as compared to scenario ii however a decrease in groundwater allocation was observed for rabi season no significant differences were observed between the scenarios i and ii crop areas attain maximum level due to sufficient water availability however a reduction in the allocated land area was observed for both scenarios iii and iv due to a change in water availability condition a sharp drop in net return was observed for both scenarios iii and iv as compared to scenarios i and ii these suggest that the utility of grey response matrix scenarios v vi vii and viii were generated from scenarios i ii iii iv respectively with 10 yield reduction for all the blocks in scenarios v and vi no change was observed in crop area allocation as compared to scenarios i and ii no impact of yield reduction was observed on the land and water allocation however a decrease in net benefit was observed 10 55 10 77 for the scenarios v and vi the overall decrease in benefits in scenarios vii and viii were similar to scenarios v and vi the impact of yield reduction on crop area allocation was observed due to the inclusion of restrictive groundwater constraint response matrix change in optimum rice area allocation was observed only in kharif net benefit decreased by 8 10 as compared to scenario iii in scenario viii kharif rice area increased by 8 and 5 for the balasore and basta blocks respectively and decreased by 14 for the baliapal block as compared to scenario iv moreover no significant change was observed during water resources allocation table 5 net benefits for all the cropping seasons are given in table 5 table s5 shows block and season wise net benefits for all the scenarios table s6 shows the total area allocated for each season under different blocks of the study area upper and lower bounds for different crops were the same except for few cases thus the grey degree is nearly zero a decision with lesser grey degree value can easily be implemented as it indicates less operational uncertainty another eight scenarios ia to viiia were generated for the aclp model under different combinations of α value generated by latin hypercube sampling technique from the previously developed eight scenarios under glp model i to viii α value can be interpreted as an optimistic threshold and fixed value assigned by the decision maker in the range of 0 1 alpha values for 4 constraints were generated 10 sets of values by using latin hypercube sampling method scenario i and ii of glp model become the same for aclp model represented as scenario ia iia similarly scenario iii and iv of glp become the same for aclp model represented as scenario iiia iva and so on optimum allocation of land and water resources for the scenario ia to iva table s7 and scenario va to viiia table s8 were obtained from the aclp model the overall net benefits obtained in scenarios ia and iia were less than the upper limit of the glp model output scenarios i and ii however increased net benefits were observed for scenario iiia iva when compared with scenario iii and iv increase in crop area was observed during rabi season aclp provides a relatively less complex outcome it can be applied only for solving the problems under parameter uncertainty 3 5 groundwater aquifer status under optimum groundwater allocation to verify the efficacy of the optimization model groundwater allocation results were further utilized as the maximum withdrawal in the modflow simulation model block and season wise total groundwater pumping values were distributed as per the maximum allocated value among all the scenarios further calibrated and validated gw simulation model was run for 1 year to see the sustainable nature of the management model solutions the observation wells 14 number were used to monitor the response due to an increase in pumping value box diagram figs 7 and 8 shows post winter pre monsoon post monsoon winter simulation results in rabi season post monsoon and post winter all observation wells are satisfying the condition figs 7 and 8 in kharif season values corresponding to m31 2a3 and a16 are not matching there may be a possibility of a boundary effect for three observation wells except for two observation wells m31 and 2a3 12 observation wells are showing good agreement with the new pumping condition it can be concluded from the discussion that there is no sign of any overexploitation of groundwater the obtained groundwater extraction rates can be implemented by considering the gwpz map mandal et al 2016 and water quality map from the above discussion it is found that the implementation of optimum allocation of land and water resources is practically feasible 4 conclusions an integrated land and water resources model framework was developed it consists of a groundwater simulation model and an optimization model linked by the response matrix function mechanism the developed models were tested under plausible scenarios these performance evaluation results show that the proposed methodology performs satisfactorily for the downstream part of the subarnarekha river basin the following conclusions can be inferred from the present study different aquifer parameters ranges hydraulic conductivity in 5 60 m day specific yield in 0 08 0 25 and porosity in 0 15 0 35 were identified during the calibration of 3 d groundwater flow simulation model modflow model calibration and validation were performed satisfactorily with a coefficient of determination of more than 0 80 modflow was successfully utilized for generating the grey response matrix gray linear programming glp formulation was tested for eight plausible scenarios maximum profit was obtained for scenario i in scenario iii more than 30 87 cropped area reduction was observed during rabi season and 13 18 area reduction during kharif season as compared to scenario i economic loss was evident in scenario iii from 28 to 31 as compared to scenario i overall cropland area decreased by 62 78 and 14 19 in rabi and kharif respectively in scenario iv as compared to scenario ii in scenarios iii and iv crop area decreased due to the linking of optimization and simulation model by grey response matrix function yield reduction was introduced in the optimization model scenarios v viii however no significant changes in cropping and water allocation were observed moreover the net benefit reduced by 10 55 10 77 in scenario v to viii optimum groundwater allocation obtained from scenarios iii and iv were validated by the groundwater simulation model the aquifer system was under the safe limit indicating the sustainable condition of the aquifer grey degree for all the decision variables obtained from the glp model solution is near to zero or zero it indicates that the optimum solution can be implemented directly to the field acceptability constrained linear programming aclp formulation was also tested for the same set of scenarios an increase in crop area allocation was observed for positive change in alpha value overall profit decreases by 10 72 in scenarios iiia and iva as compared to scenarios ia and iia reduction in crop area during rabi was more than the kharif season this trend was also observed for va to viiia overall profit loss was observed in the tune of 10 11 from the first four scenarios ia iva to the last four scenarios va viiia it can be concluded that if there is no grey information available for decision or control variables aclp model can be used satisfactorily a solution with less grey degree is a realistic implementable solution for glp model the developed methodology will be helpful for the decision maker s to prepare a meaningful implementable strategy for enhancing the agricultural production of the study area the developed methodology can be potentially applied to any other tropical river basin with or without modifications the limitation of the present work is related to linking of response matrix model with optimization model grey response matrix linearizes the physical model the framework can be improved by direct linking of modflow or other groundwater simulation model with the optimization model the optimization framework needs to be modified under such alterations however it will increase the computational burden exponentially declaration of competing interest the authors

10087,the objective of the study was to develop a method for precise estimation of spatial and temporal variation in the elementary uptake of water by roots of an irrigated plant the project focused on plants irrigated in a unique way consisting in injection application of water directly within the reach of the root system the analyses were conducted on the basis of a study performed in controlled conditions on a cubicoid physical model with dimensions of 27 00 30 75 30 75 cm the subject of the study was butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l tdr sensors were installed in the substrate in which lettuce was cultivated for the purpose of measurement of volumetric moisture during the period of the experiment 28 days the values of volumetric moisture were recorded at 10 minute intervals at 12 points in each 4 5 cm layer of the substrate the analyses demonstrated that the maximum as an average for the entire volume of soil within a plant root system intensity of elementary water uptake by lettuce max i c t was 0 0006 cm3cm 3h 1 this was observed at around midday and when the plant is being irrigated the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots in each soil volume i i j k t were highly varied at the point situated the closest to the nozzle of the irrigation injector the maximum value was 0 008 cm3cm 3h 1 in a soil volume situated only 5 cm further away the maximum value was already only 0 003 cm3cm 3h 1 in many elementary soil volumes did not pick those values up diurnal values of i i j k t calculated for an injection dose of 100 cm3 were at the same points lower than for the dose of 200 cm3 the presented method permits the acquisition of information on spatial variation and on the dynamics of the

introduction the concept of a mobile injection system for plant irrigation is an approach to the optimisation of water consumption and reduction of the negative effects of climate change janik et al 2016 walczak 2021 the idea behind the concept is that water under high pressure is applied directly to the rhizosphere by means of injectors the injectors are installed on a mobile platform which can move over fields that require irrigation with the growth and development of plants water can be applied at various depths to places where it is currently needed with this approach water losses resulting from evaporation walczak et al 2021 interception and water application to soil with no plant root systems can be reduced to zero however the determination of the optimum depth and dose of water injection requires precise determination of the spatial distribution of the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots also in a situation where the plant is injection irrigated under high pressure determination of the dynamics of water uptake by an entire root mass without discrimination from which part it is taken can be performed either experimentally or through mathematical modelling green et al 2006 one of the experimental methods is based on the use of lysimeters the method has been used by e g szajda and łabędzki 2016 in their study these authors determined the actual evapotranspiration for meadow plants and at the same time the maximum water consumption by those plants the lysimetric method was also applied by ayars and soppe 2003 who performed measurements for safflower the authors described the flow and use of salt water by the plant in conditions of drip irrigation it was demonstrated that water uptake by plants growing in soil with a shallow groundwater table was as much as 46 lower compared to irrigation without that water source lysimeters have also been useful tools in the determination of evapotranspiration of grasses and maize anapalli et al 2016 the results of lysimetric measurements provided calibration data for a model used for the determination of potential evapotranspiration the model employed e g the richards equation describing water movement in a porous medium and the nimah and hanks 1973 methods describing water uptake by crop plants the lysimetric methods of evaporation determination have also been commonly used in studies with simultaneous application of mathematical modelling e g with the use of the hydrus 1d programme as an example luo and sophocleous 2010 developed a model to estimate the seasonal loss of underground waters lysimetric measurements were the calibration element of the model a similar path was chosen by schelle et al 2013 with a simulation tool of water uptake by the plant involving the use of the richards equation another example of a model study with lysimetric measurements as the calibration element is the comparison of results of water balance simulation for agricultural cultivations with the use of two models dssat and wave soldevilla martinez et al 2014 the dssat model uses the ritchie formula for the description of soil water dynamics ritchie 1972 1981a 1981b one of the tools in the unidimensional wave model is a modified version of the richards equation solved with the finite elements method comparing the results of simulations obtained with the two models with experimental results from lysimiters using the rmse method root mean square error an 82 fit was obtained for the dssat model and an 88 fit for the wave model the greatest shortcoming of methods making use of lysimeters disqualifying them from application for the achievement of the objective of this study is the lack of any possibility for the determination of spatial variation of water uptake by the plant this is due to the fact that the soil together with the plant is placed on a balance as a whole and the measurement relates to both of these elements as a whole therefore if a change in mass is noted it is known that water has been taken up by the plant but there is no information concerning from which volume within the root mass this has occurred in addition the recorded water losses are the sum of evaporation plant mass increment and water uptake by the roots and there is no possibility of determination of the relative contributions of each of these elements water uptake by plant roots can also be calculated with the use of mathematical models which are either empirical or phenomenological formulae to apply a given empirical formula it is necessary to ensure conditions similar to those that prevailed during the experiment non compliance with this prerequisite means that the results obtained will not be credible apart from the empirical formulae phenomenological mathematical models are constructed resulting from a description of physical phenomena governing a given process van genuchten 1987 developed a unidimensional programme for the simulation of the transport of water and substances dissolved in it in a non homogeneous porous medium water uptake as the source element was calculated on the basis of an s shaped curve the basis was the assumption that total soil water potential is closely related with transpiration this idea was further developed in subsequent studies simunek et al 2006 the model was enriched with the possibility for two and three dimensional analyses of heat flows kowalik 2012 presents the following formula for the calculation of water uptake by plant roots 1 s h s α h s e 0 l 1 where s h s water uptake by plant roots cm3 cm 3 s 1 or cm3 cm 3 d 1 α h s coefficient whose value depends on the value of pf e 0 transpiration cm3 cm 2 d 1 l soil profile depth at which water available for plants is found cm the value of coefficient α hs 0 is within the range from pf 0 to pf 1 7 and α hs 1 in the range from pf 1 7 to pf 2 7 in the range from pf 2 7 to pf 4 2 the value of coefficient α hs decreases from 1 to 0 in the range from pf 4 2 to pf 7 the value of α hs 0 in the method presented by kowalik 2012 the most problematic task is the determination of the value of transpiration the author adopts the average value for the conditions of poland i e 2 8 mm per day the process itself is extremely complex and the values of transpiration can change in the course of a day a 24 hour period caleb et al 2013 this means the appearance of large errors at the scale of elementary water uptake by a plant from a given soil volume these errors can generate a considerable overestimation of the value feddes et al 1978 developed a relatively simple to use model of water uptake by plants the model allows the determination of the source element in the richards equation it depends on the field soil water pressure h in the root zone a physical interpretation of this phenomenon in a modified version was presented by zaradny 1990 who presented a function of water uptake by plant roots in relation to the soil water pressure the method proposed by kowalik 2012 feddes et al 1978 and zaradny 1990 can be modified by the addition of a function of the distribution of roots however this fact does not guarantee the determination of the spatial intensity of water uptake by plant roots cai et al 2018 addressed the problem of the parameterisation of three models of root water uptake with different representations of compensation the feddes jarvis model based on an empirical function the feddes model without compensation and the couvreur model based on physical description of water movement in soil medium with a plant root system the analyses were based on measurement data from a study on winter wheat it was demonstrated that the models predict similar values of water uptake by roots but they also take into account the differences in water uptake from elementary volumes of soil therefore the rwu models do not provide the possibility of accurate spatial determination of root water uptake another model used for the calculation of water uptake by plant roots is the swmrum model besharat et al 2012 the equation used in this model had been presented in an earlier study by besharat et al 2010 the model was calibrated on the basis of a field experiment in an apple orchard it was demonstrated among other things that the maximum water uptake from soil at the depth of 25 30 cm was 0 04 m3 m 3 d 1 while the minimum value was 0 005 m3 m 3 d 1 d at the depth of 80 cm determination of the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots taking into account its spatial variation is possible with the use of probes for point wise sensing of volumetric moisture of a porous medium the measurement is almost non invasive and can be performed with a short even 1 minute time step such sensors are employed in the neutron fdr frequency domain reflectometry or tdr time domain reflectometry techniques roth et al 1992 heng et al 2002 janik et al 2014 skierucha et al 2012 in particular tdr is a technique that has found an extensive range of applications for instance tdr sensors have been used in the determination of the water regime in potato cultivation in the field starr et al 2008 and also in controlled conditions jama rodzeńska et al 2020 another example of the application of the tdr technique for the estimation of water uptake by plants is a study on maize cultivation li et al 2002 the tdr apparatus is a precision tool therefore results from such measurements constitute the basis for the calibration of mathematical models musters and bouten 2000 besharat et al 2012 satchithanantham et al 2014 it needs to be emphasised that as in the case of lysimeters in the studies presented above it is the sum of evaporation and water uptake by roots that is determined without any possibility of the presentation of the percentage contribution of the components the spatial variation in the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots alone was presented in a study by janik 2007 the method presented in that study also involved the use of tdr sensors the innovative aspect of the study consisted in the elimination of evaporation through the application of an impermeable barrier on the soil surface the study was conducted in zero irrigation conditions in research on water uptake by plants one can also make use of a technique consisting in analysing the signatures of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes a study conducted by bing et al 2016 involved the use of such technology for the determination of the effective root depth of winter wheat the technique was not used for direct determination of water uptake by the plant but still it provided an answer to the question of from what depth the plant uptakes water most effectively during the individual stages of growth the authors demonstrated that the detailed distribution of roots and soil water content does not always follow the same trends as water uptake li et al 2017 conducted a study on inter relationships e g between soil water content and root development in the case of a drip irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch on the example of maize and tomato it was demonstrated that plant roots develop the best in that soil layer which is wetted by irrigation daly et al 2018 used a combination of x ray computed tomography a non invasive method and image based modelling roose and fowler 2004 to test the accuracy of this spatial averaging by directly calculating plant water uptake for young wheat plants they demonstrated a good fit of the models the results of water uptake differing by less than 2 however the method of spatial averaging does not provide an answer to the question of how much water is taken up from the elementary volumes of the plant root system in relation to the above the objective of the study presented herein was to develop a method allowing determination of the spatial and temporal variation of elementary intensity of water uptake from the rhizosphere of an irrigated plant the objective was pursued for a situation where the plant is irrigated in a unique manner consisting in injection application of water directly into the area of the plant root system 2 method 2 1 definitions and methodological assumptions the intensity of elementary water uptake by a plant i i j k t is defined as the volume of water taken up by roots from a specific elementary soil volume v i j k over time δ t the sum of volumes v i j k is in accordance with fig 1 the total volume v c containing the root system of the plant the value of i i j k t is expressed by the formula 2 i i j k t v i j k t v i j k where i i j k t intensity of elementary water uptake by roots from volume v i j k over time δ t cm3 cm 3 h 1 v i j k t amount of water taken up by roots from volume v i j k over time δ t cm3 h 1 v i j k elementary volume cm3 v c soil volume containing the entire root system of the plant cm3 the basis for the determination of the value of v i j k t included in formula 2 is an understanding of the dynamics of the volumetric moisture of soil θ i j k t this is possible through the application of the tdr technique as presented in fig 2 knowing the initial moisture θ i j k in and the final moisture θ i j k fi in volume v i j k we can determine the change in water volume over time δ t using the formula 3 v i j k t v i j k θ i j k fi θ i j k in t where θ i j k fi final volumetric moisture in volume v i j k for time δ t cm3 cm 3 θ i j k in initial volumetric moisture in volume v i j k for time δ t cm3 cm 3 t time step h other symbols as in formula 2 ultimately based on formula 2 we can calculate the elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots from each volume v i j k for the entire vegetation period this allows determination of the temporal and spatial distribution of that value in addition knowing the value of v i j k t and keeping in mind that v c is the sum of v i j k we can calculate the intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of an individual plant 4 i c t i 1 i l j 1 j m k 1 k n v i j k t v c 1 where i c t intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant cm3 cm 3 h 1 v c total soil volume containing the root system cm3 other symbols as in formula 2 the determination of the spatial or surface distribution of a given value e g θ i j k v i j k t or i i j k t on the basis of point wise measurements requires the application of geostatistical methods janik 2008 kłosowicz 2019 in this study the method of kriging was applied for the determination of surface or spatial distributions as that is the best method of interpolation for such natural phenomena which are characterised by heterogeneity goldsztejn and skrzypek 2004 the value of i c t can be calculated not only on the basis of volumetric moisture measurements by means of the tdr apparatus θ i j k in θ i j k fi but also on the basis of the differences between measurement results for the weight of the whole pot at the initial m c in and final m c fi time points for consecutive time steps δ t the intensity of elementary water uptake by roots determined in this manner will still be denoted with the symbol i c w t and will be calculated on the basis of the following formula 5 i c w t m c fi m c in ρ w 1 v c 1 t 1 where i c w t intensity of elementary water uptake by plant over time δ t related to volume v c calculated on the basis of pot weight readings cm3 cm 3 h 1 m c fi pot weight at the final moment of time δ t g m c in pot weight at the initial moment of time δ t g ρ w volumetric density of water g cm 3 other symbols as in formulae 2 and 3 this method of calculating the value of i c w t does not take into account the fact that a part of the water actually taken up by plant roots is retained in the plant contributing to an increase in the plant mass m p that volume of water does not transpire and thus has no effect on the change in the total weight of the pot one can even imagine a situation in which a certain volume of water will be taken up by the roots and stored in its entirety in the plant in such a case the initial and final weights of the pot over time δ t read from the balance will be identical one could then draw the false conclusion that the roots did not take up any water for this reason we should introduce the concept of the elementary intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant calculated on the basis of changes in the weight of the whole pot including the change in the mass of the plant i c w t p this value will be expressed by the formula 6 i c w t p v c w t p v c 1 where i c w t p elementary intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant calculated on the basis of changes in pot weight including the change in plant mass cm3 cm 3 h 1 v c w t p amount of water taken up by the plant over time δ t determined on the basis of weighing of the pot and taking into account the current plant mass cm3 h 1 v c as in formula 4 in addition we should note that 7 v c w t p v c w t m p t ρ w 1 where m p t change in plant mass in time δ t g h 1 v c w t change in water volume in the pot over time δ t determined on the basis of pot weight change cm3 h 1 other symbols as in formulae 5 and 6 for formal reasons we should also state that 8 v c w t m c fi m c in t 1 ρ w 1 where m c fi pot weight at the final moment of time δ t g m c in pot weight at the initial moment of time δ t g other symbols as in formula 5 verification of the correctness of determination of the intensity of elementary water uptake by plant roots referenced to volume v c on the basis of tdr measurements i c t consists in comparing it with the value of i c w t p this is due to the fact that the volume of water loss from the pot calculated on the basis of the results of volumetric moisture measurement with lp ms sensors formula 3 and ultimately formula 4 is identical to the sum of the volume of water lost through transpiration and the volume of water that leads to an increase in plant mass the effect of plant mass on the determination of the value of i c t has not been taken into account in other studies so far it should be strongly emphasised that the above considerations are true when we assume that changes in water volume within volume v c are caused solely by the flow of water from the soil to the roots therefore it is necessary to isolate volume v c to eliminate evaporation through the use of an impermeable barrier on the surface and to eliminate water flow through side walls and through the bottom in addition at the moment of injection application of water the value of i c t cannot be calculated it should be assumed that moisture θ i j k measured at the central point of volume v i j k is representative for the whole volume this requires the assumption that either the moisture is uniform at every point of that volume or that it is the mean value for the volume for formula 2 to be true it needs to be additionally assumed that there is migration of water between the elementary volumes even if this condition is not met formula 4 is still true 2 2 description of the experiment the study aimed at the determination of temporal and spatial variation of water uptake by roots of a selected plant was conducted at the laboratory of soil physics and modelling of environmental processes wrocław university of environmental and life sciences the crop plant selected for the experiment was butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l a schematic of the experiment is presented in fig 3 lettuce seeds were sown on 4 november 2019 and further cultivation of the plants was conducted in a substrate of light loam the particle size distribution curve of which is presented in fig 4 14 days after sowing the plants at 4 true leaves were transferred into five 24 5 litre cubicoid pots lettuce plants were grown in controlled conditions until 2 january 2020 when they reached head formation stages one plant was planted in pot no 1 and 5 plants each in the remaining pots in pot no 1 a total of 66 miniature tdr lp ms sensors were installed each at the central point of volume v i j k the probes were designed and manufactured at the institute of agrophysics pas in lublin poland https www e test eu laboratory tdr probe html the website address is not given for commercial purposes due to their small dimensions body length and diameter of 5 0 cm and 0 8 cm respectively rod length and diameter of 5 3 cm and 0 8 mm the sensors are used primarily in laboratory experiments fig 5 the method of determination of the volumetric moisture of soil consists in fully automatic measurement of the relative permittivity of a porous medium although they were positioned at a relatively small spatial step δ x δ y δ z cm the sensors did not affect the internal structure of the soil and thus they did not cause any change in the conditions of water filtration a schematic of the distribution of the sensors for example in the third layer determining the shape of the elementary volumes v i j k is presented in fig 6 the positioning of the sensors was identical in all the layers of the substrate immediately prior to the installation each of the sensors was calibrated with the use of water and air accepted as calibration media skierucha et al 2008 volumetric soil moisture readings were recorded from 2 december 2019 until 3 january 2020 at a 10 min time step in view of the season of the year characterised by insufficient sunlight to improve the illumination conditions a 50 w grow led lighting system was installed above the experimental setup the plants received supplementary illumination every day between the hours of 10 00 and 22 00 in the course of the experiment the temperature in the laboratory was in the range from 18 to 22 c the surface layer in pot no 1 was covered with impermeable foil and sprinkled with sand to eliminate evaporation the foil was covered with a 1 centimetre layer of sand to make it adhere closely to the surface layer of the soil then the pot was placed on a balance the impermeable barrier was removed once a week for about 15 min to increase the level of oxygen in the soil it was assumed that over this period of 15 min evaporation had no effect on the course of the experiment the weight of pot no 1 was recorded from 2 december 2019 until 2 january 2020 weight determination was performed to compare the elementary intensity of water uptake by the roots calculated in 3 different ways following formulae 4 5 and 6 the plants from pots no 2 3 4 and 5 allowed determination of the increments of the total plant mass m p mass of the green parts m g and root mass m r four times in the vegetation period specimens were removed from the pots and the mass of the whole plant was measured with the roots cleaned of the soil m p followed by determination of the mass of the green part m g and the root mass m r this was done using a radwag pm 50 c32 balance with an accuracy of 0 1 g and measurement range up to 50 kg irrigation was performed by inserting an injector with an external diameter of ø2 mm equipped with a 200 ml tank with a piston allowing water application to the soil under pressure water was applied directly to the root zone of the plant in its axis of symmetry at the depth of 12 cm in the initial stage of the experiment the plants were irrigated with doses of 100 cm3 and from 17 december 2019 the dose was increased to 200 cm3 the injection time points and the doses are presented in figs 7 12 and 13 in the description of results 3 results and discussion in some volumes v i j k at the moment of water injection at doses of 100 or 200 cm3 a sharp increase in moisture was noted δ θ i j k examples of such changes are presented in fig 7 for layers iii and v increases in δ θ i j k were greater in layer iii because it is situated the closest to the injector nozzle the central point of that layer is situated at the depth of 11 25 cm and that of layer v at the depth of 20 25 cm the injection depth being 12 cm fig 6 in layer iii on the 13 d of the experiment in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle v17 30 15 37 11 25 moisture increased immediately after the injection θ 17 30 15 37 11 25 13 iii equal to 0 148 cm3 cm 3 at the same time in layer v in volume v17 30 15 37 20 25 the increase δ θ 17 30 15 37 20 25 13 v was 4 3 fold smaller and amounted to 0 034 cm3 cm 3 it should also be noted that the moisture increase in layer iii in the volume closest to the injector v17 30 15 37 11 25 took place practically at the very moment of injection while in layer v in an identically situated volume it took place about 50 min later t in iii v 50 min the next observation is that the farther the measurement points were situated from the vertical axis passing through the point of injection the smaller the increases of moisture as an example in layer iii on the 13th day θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 13 iii was equal to 0 041cm3 cm 3 while in layer v at the same time θ 21 14 15 37 20 25 13 v was 0 024 cm3 cm3 at the remaining points of that layer the values of moisture increase were zero throughout the period in addition the farther the distance from the axis of injection the later the moisture increases caused by injection irrigation occurred in the example mentioned above t in iii v in volume v17 30 15 37 20 25 was 50 min and in volume v21 14 15 37 20 25 as much as 120 min the above regularities were also observed at the remaining times of injection in addition it should be mentioned that until day 10 of the experiment when the injection doses were 100 cm3 soil moisture in layer v did not change these regularities confirm the correctness of measurements of volumetric moisture by means of the lp ms sensors in the conditions of injection irrigation fig 8 presents the distribution of volumetric moisture in a vertical section with points with the coordinate y 15 38 cm plane including the point with injection nozzle for the doses of 100 and 200 cm3 applied on the 6th and 13th days of the experiment respectively the distribution was prepared with the use of geostatistical methods on the basis of point wise data from measurements with lp ms sensors taken 20 min after the moment of injection also these distributions confirmed the correctness of the results obtained in both cases volumetric moisture was the highest at the point of water injection in addition the volumetric moisture in the area of operation of the injector was higher for the dose of 200 cm3 for instance at point a for the dose of 100 cm3 moisture was θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 a 100 0 153 c m 3 c m 3 and for the dose of 200 cm3 θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 a 200 0 206 c m 3 c m 3 in the case of the dose of 200 cm3 we should note the fact of the appearance of increased moisture just beneath soil surface above the points of injection area f this was caused by the outflow of a certain amount of water onto the soil surface under the impermeable barrier due to the application of 200 cm3 of water over a very short time scale this however is only a hypothesis which requires additional research into the filtration capacity in relation to the kind of substrate water dose applied and the initial moisture as the correctness of volumetric moisture measurements in volumes v i j k is the basis for correct calculation of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots an additional analysis was performed on the basis of information given in fig 9 this presents the dynamics of volumetric moisture distribution on the same vertical plane as in fig 8 on the 13th day of the experiment for the injection dose of 200 cm3 distributions were prepared for data from 10 min before injection t 0 10 min after injection t 1 and 12 t 3 and 24 t 4 hours after injection the distribution for t 0 shows a slightly higher moisture beneath the injection point this is the effect of irrigation on the preceding day for t 1 on the other hand close to the point of water application the moisture increased to as much as 0 315 cm3 cm 3 for t 2 and t 3 the moisture was again slightly increased in the entire section with values of 0 230 cm3 cm 3 and 0 197 cm3 cm 3 respectively this also indicated the correctness of the measurements the dynamics of increases in the total mass of a plant m p over the entire vegetation period and in the aboveground part m g and underground part m r was determined on the basis of the mass of 5 plants fig 10 the points marked in the figure are mean values calculated on the basis of measurements on days 1 6 15 and 27 of the experiment curves approximating the empirical data were fitted at the mean values of m p m g m r the best fitting models were parabolas the values of r 2 were as follows for m p r 2 0 9766 for m g r 2 0 9755 and for m r r 2 0 9875 function models are necessary for the reading of values of m p m g and m r at times when no measurements were taken values from the approximating models were used for the calculation of the value of v c w t formula 8 the difference between the current and the initial water volume in a pot was used to determine the change in volumetric moisture over time fig 11 this was calculated on the basis of measurements taken with the tdr sensor tdr δ v c t on the basis of pot weight change δ v c w t and on the basis of pot weight change taking into account the change in the plant mass δ v c w p t analysis of the figure shows that the introduction of the correction for the change in the plant mass leads to the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w p t being smaller than the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w t while in the first period when m p is small the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w t is slight e g on 11 december 2019 at 12 00 h it was 25 86 cm3 in the final stage of vegetation on 29 december 2019 at 12 00 h that difference was as much as 77 39 cm3 on the same dates the differences between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w p t were only 26 33 cm3 and 6 47 cm3 respectively the intensity of elementary water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant in the course of vegetation was calculated on the basis of measurements taken with the tdr sensor with the time step of δ t 10 min i c t formula 4 based on readings from the balance without taking into account the mass of the plant i c w t formula 5 and taking the plant mass into account i c w t p formula 6 fig 12 the maximum average for the whole soil volume with the root system intensity of elementary water uptake by lettuce i c t was 0 0006 cm3 cm 3 h 1 this occurred at around 12 00 h in the middle of the period of supplemental illumination and at the same time as when the plant was being irrigated the maximum values of means obtained on the basis of measurements with the tdr sensor i c w t i i c w t p occurred in the same periods but amounted only to 0 00048 cm3 cm 3 h 1 this difference is caused by the different time steps at which the measurements and the calculations were conducted analysing the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by roots in each volume i i j k t e g in layer iii we find that they are strongly varied for example the maximum value at the point situated the closest to the injector nozzle on the 25th day of the experiment was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 blue line in fig 13 while for the adjacent volume the maximum value was only 0 003 cm3 cm 3 h 1 and in the remaining volumes of that layer the values equalled 0 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the value of 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 is 13 fold higher than the average intensity for the entire soil volume the low value of the mean tension calculated for the entire volume is due to the fact that water is not taken up in all of the elementary volumes based on the calculations of the value of i i j k t for every volume v i j k a diagram of the spatial variation of the elementary diurnal intensity of water uptake by lettuce roots in the vertical plane passing through the injector nozzle was created fig 14 the data used as examples were from day 6 injection dose of 100 cm3 and from day 13 injection dose of 200 cm3 the values of i i j k t calculated for the injection dose of 100 cm3 were lower than those for the dose of 200 cm3 at the same points as an example in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle dose of 100 cm3 i i j k t was about 0 05 cm3 cm 3 day 1 but in the same volume but for the dose of 200 cm3 cm 3 day 1 the corresponding value was potentially as high as 0 1 cm3 cm 3 day 1 in a study into a totally different plant species apple tree and for a different method of water supply besharat et al 2010 see above determined on the basis of a mathematical model that these values amounted to 0 04 cm3 cm 3 day 1 and 0 005 cm3 cm 3 day 1 respectively other results presented in our study cannot reasonably be discussed due to the lack of reference material the reason for this is the lack of studies on the determination of spatial and temporal distributions of elementary water uptake by plant rots especially in the case of injection irrigation 4 conclusion the presented method allows the determination of the dynamics of the temporal and spatial distribution of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots the input parameter necessary for its application is the measurement of volumetric moisture in soil with the root system an additional advantage of the method is that the measurements are conducted in soil with undisturbed structure in the study the maximum average for the whole volume of soil with the plant root system intensity of elementary water uptake by butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l max i c t was 0 0006 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the maximum values of means obtained on the basis of measurement with the tdr sensor max i c w t i max i c w t p occurred in the same periods but amounted to only 0 00048 cm3 cm 3 h 1 it should be noted that the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots in individual volumes i i j k t are strongly varied in layer iii at the point situated the closest to the injector nozzle the maximum value was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 in the adjacent volume the maximum value was already as low as 0 003 cm3 cm 3 h 1 in the remaining volumes of that layer the values were equal to 0 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the value of 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 is 13 fold higher than the average value of intensity for the entire soil volume this is due to the fact that water is not taken up from all of the elementary volumes the diurnal values of i i j k t calculated for the injection dose of 100 cm3 were at the same points lower than the values for the dose of 200 cm3 in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle dose of 100 cm3 the diurnal value of i i j k t was approximately 0 05 cm3 cm 3 day 1 and in the same volume but for the dose of 200 cm3 cm 3 day 1 that value was even as high as 0 1 cm3 cm 3 day 1 the presented solution allows the acquisition of information necessary for precise determination of the place and dose of injection from the nozzle of a high pressure injector so as to minimise the losses of water and to increase

10087,the objective of the study was to develop a method for precise estimation of spatial and temporal variation in the elementary uptake of water by roots of an irrigated plant the project focused on plants irrigated in a unique way consisting in injection application of water directly within the reach of the root system the analyses were conducted on the basis of a study performed in controlled conditions on a cubicoid physical model with dimensions of 27 00 30 75 30 75 cm the subject of the study was butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l tdr sensors were installed in the substrate in which lettuce was cultivated for the purpose of measurement of volumetric moisture during the period of the experiment 28 days the values of volumetric moisture were recorded at 10 minute intervals at 12 points in each 4 5 cm layer of the substrate the analyses demonstrated that the maximum as an average for the entire volume of soil within a plant root system intensity of elementary water uptake by lettuce max i c t was 0 0006 cm3cm 3h 1 this was observed at around midday and when the plant is being irrigated the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots in each soil volume i i j k t were highly varied at the point situated the closest to the nozzle of the irrigation injector the maximum value was 0 008 cm3cm 3h 1 in a soil volume situated only 5 cm further away the maximum value was already only 0 003 cm3cm 3h 1 in many elementary soil volumes did not pick those values up diurnal values of i i j k t calculated for an injection dose of 100 cm3 were at the same points lower than for the dose of 200 cm3 the presented method permits the acquisition of information on spatial variation and on the dynamics of the

introduction the concept of a mobile injection system for plant irrigation is an approach to the optimisation of water consumption and reduction of the negative effects of climate change janik et al 2016 walczak 2021 the idea behind the concept is that water under high pressure is applied directly to the rhizosphere by means of injectors the injectors are installed on a mobile platform which can move over fields that require irrigation with the growth and development of plants water can be applied at various depths to places where it is currently needed with this approach water losses resulting from evaporation walczak et al 2021 interception and water application to soil with no plant root systems can be reduced to zero however the determination of the optimum depth and dose of water injection requires precise determination of the spatial distribution of the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots also in a situation where the plant is injection irrigated under high pressure determination of the dynamics of water uptake by an entire root mass without discrimination from which part it is taken can be performed either experimentally or through mathematical modelling green et al 2006 one of the experimental methods is based on the use of lysimeters the method has been used by e g szajda and łabędzki 2016 in their study these authors determined the actual evapotranspiration for meadow plants and at the same time the maximum water consumption by those plants the lysimetric method was also applied by ayars and soppe 2003 who performed measurements for safflower the authors described the flow and use of salt water by the plant in conditions of drip irrigation it was demonstrated that water uptake by plants growing in soil with a shallow groundwater table was as much as 46 lower compared to irrigation without that water source lysimeters have also been useful tools in the determination of evapotranspiration of grasses and maize anapalli et al 2016 the results of lysimetric measurements provided calibration data for a model used for the determination of potential evapotranspiration the model employed e g the richards equation describing water movement in a porous medium and the nimah and hanks 1973 methods describing water uptake by crop plants the lysimetric methods of evaporation determination have also been commonly used in studies with simultaneous application of mathematical modelling e g with the use of the hydrus 1d programme as an example luo and sophocleous 2010 developed a model to estimate the seasonal loss of underground waters lysimetric measurements were the calibration element of the model a similar path was chosen by schelle et al 2013 with a simulation tool of water uptake by the plant involving the use of the richards equation another example of a model study with lysimetric measurements as the calibration element is the comparison of results of water balance simulation for agricultural cultivations with the use of two models dssat and wave soldevilla martinez et al 2014 the dssat model uses the ritchie formula for the description of soil water dynamics ritchie 1972 1981a 1981b one of the tools in the unidimensional wave model is a modified version of the richards equation solved with the finite elements method comparing the results of simulations obtained with the two models with experimental results from lysimiters using the rmse method root mean square error an 82 fit was obtained for the dssat model and an 88 fit for the wave model the greatest shortcoming of methods making use of lysimeters disqualifying them from application for the achievement of the objective of this study is the lack of any possibility for the determination of spatial variation of water uptake by the plant this is due to the fact that the soil together with the plant is placed on a balance as a whole and the measurement relates to both of these elements as a whole therefore if a change in mass is noted it is known that water has been taken up by the plant but there is no information concerning from which volume within the root mass this has occurred in addition the recorded water losses are the sum of evaporation plant mass increment and water uptake by the roots and there is no possibility of determination of the relative contributions of each of these elements water uptake by plant roots can also be calculated with the use of mathematical models which are either empirical or phenomenological formulae to apply a given empirical formula it is necessary to ensure conditions similar to those that prevailed during the experiment non compliance with this prerequisite means that the results obtained will not be credible apart from the empirical formulae phenomenological mathematical models are constructed resulting from a description of physical phenomena governing a given process van genuchten 1987 developed a unidimensional programme for the simulation of the transport of water and substances dissolved in it in a non homogeneous porous medium water uptake as the source element was calculated on the basis of an s shaped curve the basis was the assumption that total soil water potential is closely related with transpiration this idea was further developed in subsequent studies simunek et al 2006 the model was enriched with the possibility for two and three dimensional analyses of heat flows kowalik 2012 presents the following formula for the calculation of water uptake by plant roots 1 s h s α h s e 0 l 1 where s h s water uptake by plant roots cm3 cm 3 s 1 or cm3 cm 3 d 1 α h s coefficient whose value depends on the value of pf e 0 transpiration cm3 cm 2 d 1 l soil profile depth at which water available for plants is found cm the value of coefficient α hs 0 is within the range from pf 0 to pf 1 7 and α hs 1 in the range from pf 1 7 to pf 2 7 in the range from pf 2 7 to pf 4 2 the value of coefficient α hs decreases from 1 to 0 in the range from pf 4 2 to pf 7 the value of α hs 0 in the method presented by kowalik 2012 the most problematic task is the determination of the value of transpiration the author adopts the average value for the conditions of poland i e 2 8 mm per day the process itself is extremely complex and the values of transpiration can change in the course of a day a 24 hour period caleb et al 2013 this means the appearance of large errors at the scale of elementary water uptake by a plant from a given soil volume these errors can generate a considerable overestimation of the value feddes et al 1978 developed a relatively simple to use model of water uptake by plants the model allows the determination of the source element in the richards equation it depends on the field soil water pressure h in the root zone a physical interpretation of this phenomenon in a modified version was presented by zaradny 1990 who presented a function of water uptake by plant roots in relation to the soil water pressure the method proposed by kowalik 2012 feddes et al 1978 and zaradny 1990 can be modified by the addition of a function of the distribution of roots however this fact does not guarantee the determination of the spatial intensity of water uptake by plant roots cai et al 2018 addressed the problem of the parameterisation of three models of root water uptake with different representations of compensation the feddes jarvis model based on an empirical function the feddes model without compensation and the couvreur model based on physical description of water movement in soil medium with a plant root system the analyses were based on measurement data from a study on winter wheat it was demonstrated that the models predict similar values of water uptake by roots but they also take into account the differences in water uptake from elementary volumes of soil therefore the rwu models do not provide the possibility of accurate spatial determination of root water uptake another model used for the calculation of water uptake by plant roots is the swmrum model besharat et al 2012 the equation used in this model had been presented in an earlier study by besharat et al 2010 the model was calibrated on the basis of a field experiment in an apple orchard it was demonstrated among other things that the maximum water uptake from soil at the depth of 25 30 cm was 0 04 m3 m 3 d 1 while the minimum value was 0 005 m3 m 3 d 1 d at the depth of 80 cm determination of the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots taking into account its spatial variation is possible with the use of probes for point wise sensing of volumetric moisture of a porous medium the measurement is almost non invasive and can be performed with a short even 1 minute time step such sensors are employed in the neutron fdr frequency domain reflectometry or tdr time domain reflectometry techniques roth et al 1992 heng et al 2002 janik et al 2014 skierucha et al 2012 in particular tdr is a technique that has found an extensive range of applications for instance tdr sensors have been used in the determination of the water regime in potato cultivation in the field starr et al 2008 and also in controlled conditions jama rodzeńska et al 2020 another example of the application of the tdr technique for the estimation of water uptake by plants is a study on maize cultivation li et al 2002 the tdr apparatus is a precision tool therefore results from such measurements constitute the basis for the calibration of mathematical models musters and bouten 2000 besharat et al 2012 satchithanantham et al 2014 it needs to be emphasised that as in the case of lysimeters in the studies presented above it is the sum of evaporation and water uptake by roots that is determined without any possibility of the presentation of the percentage contribution of the components the spatial variation in the dynamics of water uptake by plant roots alone was presented in a study by janik 2007 the method presented in that study also involved the use of tdr sensors the innovative aspect of the study consisted in the elimination of evaporation through the application of an impermeable barrier on the soil surface the study was conducted in zero irrigation conditions in research on water uptake by plants one can also make use of a technique consisting in analysing the signatures of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes a study conducted by bing et al 2016 involved the use of such technology for the determination of the effective root depth of winter wheat the technique was not used for direct determination of water uptake by the plant but still it provided an answer to the question of from what depth the plant uptakes water most effectively during the individual stages of growth the authors demonstrated that the detailed distribution of roots and soil water content does not always follow the same trends as water uptake li et al 2017 conducted a study on inter relationships e g between soil water content and root development in the case of a drip irrigated intercropping field with plastic mulch on the example of maize and tomato it was demonstrated that plant roots develop the best in that soil layer which is wetted by irrigation daly et al 2018 used a combination of x ray computed tomography a non invasive method and image based modelling roose and fowler 2004 to test the accuracy of this spatial averaging by directly calculating plant water uptake for young wheat plants they demonstrated a good fit of the models the results of water uptake differing by less than 2 however the method of spatial averaging does not provide an answer to the question of how much water is taken up from the elementary volumes of the plant root system in relation to the above the objective of the study presented herein was to develop a method allowing determination of the spatial and temporal variation of elementary intensity of water uptake from the rhizosphere of an irrigated plant the objective was pursued for a situation where the plant is irrigated in a unique manner consisting in injection application of water directly into the area of the plant root system 2 method 2 1 definitions and methodological assumptions the intensity of elementary water uptake by a plant i i j k t is defined as the volume of water taken up by roots from a specific elementary soil volume v i j k over time δ t the sum of volumes v i j k is in accordance with fig 1 the total volume v c containing the root system of the plant the value of i i j k t is expressed by the formula 2 i i j k t v i j k t v i j k where i i j k t intensity of elementary water uptake by roots from volume v i j k over time δ t cm3 cm 3 h 1 v i j k t amount of water taken up by roots from volume v i j k over time δ t cm3 h 1 v i j k elementary volume cm3 v c soil volume containing the entire root system of the plant cm3 the basis for the determination of the value of v i j k t included in formula 2 is an understanding of the dynamics of the volumetric moisture of soil θ i j k t this is possible through the application of the tdr technique as presented in fig 2 knowing the initial moisture θ i j k in and the final moisture θ i j k fi in volume v i j k we can determine the change in water volume over time δ t using the formula 3 v i j k t v i j k θ i j k fi θ i j k in t where θ i j k fi final volumetric moisture in volume v i j k for time δ t cm3 cm 3 θ i j k in initial volumetric moisture in volume v i j k for time δ t cm3 cm 3 t time step h other symbols as in formula 2 ultimately based on formula 2 we can calculate the elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots from each volume v i j k for the entire vegetation period this allows determination of the temporal and spatial distribution of that value in addition knowing the value of v i j k t and keeping in mind that v c is the sum of v i j k we can calculate the intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of an individual plant 4 i c t i 1 i l j 1 j m k 1 k n v i j k t v c 1 where i c t intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant cm3 cm 3 h 1 v c total soil volume containing the root system cm3 other symbols as in formula 2 the determination of the spatial or surface distribution of a given value e g θ i j k v i j k t or i i j k t on the basis of point wise measurements requires the application of geostatistical methods janik 2008 kłosowicz 2019 in this study the method of kriging was applied for the determination of surface or spatial distributions as that is the best method of interpolation for such natural phenomena which are characterised by heterogeneity goldsztejn and skrzypek 2004 the value of i c t can be calculated not only on the basis of volumetric moisture measurements by means of the tdr apparatus θ i j k in θ i j k fi but also on the basis of the differences between measurement results for the weight of the whole pot at the initial m c in and final m c fi time points for consecutive time steps δ t the intensity of elementary water uptake by roots determined in this manner will still be denoted with the symbol i c w t and will be calculated on the basis of the following formula 5 i c w t m c fi m c in ρ w 1 v c 1 t 1 where i c w t intensity of elementary water uptake by plant over time δ t related to volume v c calculated on the basis of pot weight readings cm3 cm 3 h 1 m c fi pot weight at the final moment of time δ t g m c in pot weight at the initial moment of time δ t g ρ w volumetric density of water g cm 3 other symbols as in formulae 2 and 3 this method of calculating the value of i c w t does not take into account the fact that a part of the water actually taken up by plant roots is retained in the plant contributing to an increase in the plant mass m p that volume of water does not transpire and thus has no effect on the change in the total weight of the pot one can even imagine a situation in which a certain volume of water will be taken up by the roots and stored in its entirety in the plant in such a case the initial and final weights of the pot over time δ t read from the balance will be identical one could then draw the false conclusion that the roots did not take up any water for this reason we should introduce the concept of the elementary intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant calculated on the basis of changes in the weight of the whole pot including the change in the mass of the plant i c w t p this value will be expressed by the formula 6 i c w t p v c w t p v c 1 where i c w t p elementary intensity of water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant calculated on the basis of changes in pot weight including the change in plant mass cm3 cm 3 h 1 v c w t p amount of water taken up by the plant over time δ t determined on the basis of weighing of the pot and taking into account the current plant mass cm3 h 1 v c as in formula 4 in addition we should note that 7 v c w t p v c w t m p t ρ w 1 where m p t change in plant mass in time δ t g h 1 v c w t change in water volume in the pot over time δ t determined on the basis of pot weight change cm3 h 1 other symbols as in formulae 5 and 6 for formal reasons we should also state that 8 v c w t m c fi m c in t 1 ρ w 1 where m c fi pot weight at the final moment of time δ t g m c in pot weight at the initial moment of time δ t g other symbols as in formula 5 verification of the correctness of determination of the intensity of elementary water uptake by plant roots referenced to volume v c on the basis of tdr measurements i c t consists in comparing it with the value of i c w t p this is due to the fact that the volume of water loss from the pot calculated on the basis of the results of volumetric moisture measurement with lp ms sensors formula 3 and ultimately formula 4 is identical to the sum of the volume of water lost through transpiration and the volume of water that leads to an increase in plant mass the effect of plant mass on the determination of the value of i c t has not been taken into account in other studies so far it should be strongly emphasised that the above considerations are true when we assume that changes in water volume within volume v c are caused solely by the flow of water from the soil to the roots therefore it is necessary to isolate volume v c to eliminate evaporation through the use of an impermeable barrier on the surface and to eliminate water flow through side walls and through the bottom in addition at the moment of injection application of water the value of i c t cannot be calculated it should be assumed that moisture θ i j k measured at the central point of volume v i j k is representative for the whole volume this requires the assumption that either the moisture is uniform at every point of that volume or that it is the mean value for the volume for formula 2 to be true it needs to be additionally assumed that there is migration of water between the elementary volumes even if this condition is not met formula 4 is still true 2 2 description of the experiment the study aimed at the determination of temporal and spatial variation of water uptake by roots of a selected plant was conducted at the laboratory of soil physics and modelling of environmental processes wrocław university of environmental and life sciences the crop plant selected for the experiment was butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l a schematic of the experiment is presented in fig 3 lettuce seeds were sown on 4 november 2019 and further cultivation of the plants was conducted in a substrate of light loam the particle size distribution curve of which is presented in fig 4 14 days after sowing the plants at 4 true leaves were transferred into five 24 5 litre cubicoid pots lettuce plants were grown in controlled conditions until 2 january 2020 when they reached head formation stages one plant was planted in pot no 1 and 5 plants each in the remaining pots in pot no 1 a total of 66 miniature tdr lp ms sensors were installed each at the central point of volume v i j k the probes were designed and manufactured at the institute of agrophysics pas in lublin poland https www e test eu laboratory tdr probe html the website address is not given for commercial purposes due to their small dimensions body length and diameter of 5 0 cm and 0 8 cm respectively rod length and diameter of 5 3 cm and 0 8 mm the sensors are used primarily in laboratory experiments fig 5 the method of determination of the volumetric moisture of soil consists in fully automatic measurement of the relative permittivity of a porous medium although they were positioned at a relatively small spatial step δ x δ y δ z cm the sensors did not affect the internal structure of the soil and thus they did not cause any change in the conditions of water filtration a schematic of the distribution of the sensors for example in the third layer determining the shape of the elementary volumes v i j k is presented in fig 6 the positioning of the sensors was identical in all the layers of the substrate immediately prior to the installation each of the sensors was calibrated with the use of water and air accepted as calibration media skierucha et al 2008 volumetric soil moisture readings were recorded from 2 december 2019 until 3 january 2020 at a 10 min time step in view of the season of the year characterised by insufficient sunlight to improve the illumination conditions a 50 w grow led lighting system was installed above the experimental setup the plants received supplementary illumination every day between the hours of 10 00 and 22 00 in the course of the experiment the temperature in the laboratory was in the range from 18 to 22 c the surface layer in pot no 1 was covered with impermeable foil and sprinkled with sand to eliminate evaporation the foil was covered with a 1 centimetre layer of sand to make it adhere closely to the surface layer of the soil then the pot was placed on a balance the impermeable barrier was removed once a week for about 15 min to increase the level of oxygen in the soil it was assumed that over this period of 15 min evaporation had no effect on the course of the experiment the weight of pot no 1 was recorded from 2 december 2019 until 2 january 2020 weight determination was performed to compare the elementary intensity of water uptake by the roots calculated in 3 different ways following formulae 4 5 and 6 the plants from pots no 2 3 4 and 5 allowed determination of the increments of the total plant mass m p mass of the green parts m g and root mass m r four times in the vegetation period specimens were removed from the pots and the mass of the whole plant was measured with the roots cleaned of the soil m p followed by determination of the mass of the green part m g and the root mass m r this was done using a radwag pm 50 c32 balance with an accuracy of 0 1 g and measurement range up to 50 kg irrigation was performed by inserting an injector with an external diameter of ø2 mm equipped with a 200 ml tank with a piston allowing water application to the soil under pressure water was applied directly to the root zone of the plant in its axis of symmetry at the depth of 12 cm in the initial stage of the experiment the plants were irrigated with doses of 100 cm3 and from 17 december 2019 the dose was increased to 200 cm3 the injection time points and the doses are presented in figs 7 12 and 13 in the description of results 3 results and discussion in some volumes v i j k at the moment of water injection at doses of 100 or 200 cm3 a sharp increase in moisture was noted δ θ i j k examples of such changes are presented in fig 7 for layers iii and v increases in δ θ i j k were greater in layer iii because it is situated the closest to the injector nozzle the central point of that layer is situated at the depth of 11 25 cm and that of layer v at the depth of 20 25 cm the injection depth being 12 cm fig 6 in layer iii on the 13 d of the experiment in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle v17 30 15 37 11 25 moisture increased immediately after the injection θ 17 30 15 37 11 25 13 iii equal to 0 148 cm3 cm 3 at the same time in layer v in volume v17 30 15 37 20 25 the increase δ θ 17 30 15 37 20 25 13 v was 4 3 fold smaller and amounted to 0 034 cm3 cm 3 it should also be noted that the moisture increase in layer iii in the volume closest to the injector v17 30 15 37 11 25 took place practically at the very moment of injection while in layer v in an identically situated volume it took place about 50 min later t in iii v 50 min the next observation is that the farther the measurement points were situated from the vertical axis passing through the point of injection the smaller the increases of moisture as an example in layer iii on the 13th day θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 13 iii was equal to 0 041cm3 cm 3 while in layer v at the same time θ 21 14 15 37 20 25 13 v was 0 024 cm3 cm3 at the remaining points of that layer the values of moisture increase were zero throughout the period in addition the farther the distance from the axis of injection the later the moisture increases caused by injection irrigation occurred in the example mentioned above t in iii v in volume v17 30 15 37 20 25 was 50 min and in volume v21 14 15 37 20 25 as much as 120 min the above regularities were also observed at the remaining times of injection in addition it should be mentioned that until day 10 of the experiment when the injection doses were 100 cm3 soil moisture in layer v did not change these regularities confirm the correctness of measurements of volumetric moisture by means of the lp ms sensors in the conditions of injection irrigation fig 8 presents the distribution of volumetric moisture in a vertical section with points with the coordinate y 15 38 cm plane including the point with injection nozzle for the doses of 100 and 200 cm3 applied on the 6th and 13th days of the experiment respectively the distribution was prepared with the use of geostatistical methods on the basis of point wise data from measurements with lp ms sensors taken 20 min after the moment of injection also these distributions confirmed the correctness of the results obtained in both cases volumetric moisture was the highest at the point of water injection in addition the volumetric moisture in the area of operation of the injector was higher for the dose of 200 cm3 for instance at point a for the dose of 100 cm3 moisture was θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 a 100 0 153 c m 3 c m 3 and for the dose of 200 cm3 θ 21 14 15 37 11 25 a 200 0 206 c m 3 c m 3 in the case of the dose of 200 cm3 we should note the fact of the appearance of increased moisture just beneath soil surface above the points of injection area f this was caused by the outflow of a certain amount of water onto the soil surface under the impermeable barrier due to the application of 200 cm3 of water over a very short time scale this however is only a hypothesis which requires additional research into the filtration capacity in relation to the kind of substrate water dose applied and the initial moisture as the correctness of volumetric moisture measurements in volumes v i j k is the basis for correct calculation of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots an additional analysis was performed on the basis of information given in fig 9 this presents the dynamics of volumetric moisture distribution on the same vertical plane as in fig 8 on the 13th day of the experiment for the injection dose of 200 cm3 distributions were prepared for data from 10 min before injection t 0 10 min after injection t 1 and 12 t 3 and 24 t 4 hours after injection the distribution for t 0 shows a slightly higher moisture beneath the injection point this is the effect of irrigation on the preceding day for t 1 on the other hand close to the point of water application the moisture increased to as much as 0 315 cm3 cm 3 for t 2 and t 3 the moisture was again slightly increased in the entire section with values of 0 230 cm3 cm 3 and 0 197 cm3 cm 3 respectively this also indicated the correctness of the measurements the dynamics of increases in the total mass of a plant m p over the entire vegetation period and in the aboveground part m g and underground part m r was determined on the basis of the mass of 5 plants fig 10 the points marked in the figure are mean values calculated on the basis of measurements on days 1 6 15 and 27 of the experiment curves approximating the empirical data were fitted at the mean values of m p m g m r the best fitting models were parabolas the values of r 2 were as follows for m p r 2 0 9766 for m g r 2 0 9755 and for m r r 2 0 9875 function models are necessary for the reading of values of m p m g and m r at times when no measurements were taken values from the approximating models were used for the calculation of the value of v c w t formula 8 the difference between the current and the initial water volume in a pot was used to determine the change in volumetric moisture over time fig 11 this was calculated on the basis of measurements taken with the tdr sensor tdr δ v c t on the basis of pot weight change δ v c w t and on the basis of pot weight change taking into account the change in the plant mass δ v c w p t analysis of the figure shows that the introduction of the correction for the change in the plant mass leads to the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w p t being smaller than the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w t while in the first period when m p is small the difference between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w t is slight e g on 11 december 2019 at 12 00 h it was 25 86 cm3 in the final stage of vegetation on 29 december 2019 at 12 00 h that difference was as much as 77 39 cm3 on the same dates the differences between the values of δ v c t and δ v c w p t were only 26 33 cm3 and 6 47 cm3 respectively the intensity of elementary water uptake by the entire root mass of the plant in the course of vegetation was calculated on the basis of measurements taken with the tdr sensor with the time step of δ t 10 min i c t formula 4 based on readings from the balance without taking into account the mass of the plant i c w t formula 5 and taking the plant mass into account i c w t p formula 6 fig 12 the maximum average for the whole soil volume with the root system intensity of elementary water uptake by lettuce i c t was 0 0006 cm3 cm 3 h 1 this occurred at around 12 00 h in the middle of the period of supplemental illumination and at the same time as when the plant was being irrigated the maximum values of means obtained on the basis of measurements with the tdr sensor i c w t i i c w t p occurred in the same periods but amounted only to 0 00048 cm3 cm 3 h 1 this difference is caused by the different time steps at which the measurements and the calculations were conducted analysing the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by roots in each volume i i j k t e g in layer iii we find that they are strongly varied for example the maximum value at the point situated the closest to the injector nozzle on the 25th day of the experiment was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 blue line in fig 13 while for the adjacent volume the maximum value was only 0 003 cm3 cm 3 h 1 and in the remaining volumes of that layer the values equalled 0 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the value of 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 is 13 fold higher than the average intensity for the entire soil volume the low value of the mean tension calculated for the entire volume is due to the fact that water is not taken up in all of the elementary volumes based on the calculations of the value of i i j k t for every volume v i j k a diagram of the spatial variation of the elementary diurnal intensity of water uptake by lettuce roots in the vertical plane passing through the injector nozzle was created fig 14 the data used as examples were from day 6 injection dose of 100 cm3 and from day 13 injection dose of 200 cm3 the values of i i j k t calculated for the injection dose of 100 cm3 were lower than those for the dose of 200 cm3 at the same points as an example in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle dose of 100 cm3 i i j k t was about 0 05 cm3 cm 3 day 1 but in the same volume but for the dose of 200 cm3 cm 3 day 1 the corresponding value was potentially as high as 0 1 cm3 cm 3 day 1 in a study into a totally different plant species apple tree and for a different method of water supply besharat et al 2010 see above determined on the basis of a mathematical model that these values amounted to 0 04 cm3 cm 3 day 1 and 0 005 cm3 cm 3 day 1 respectively other results presented in our study cannot reasonably be discussed due to the lack of reference material the reason for this is the lack of studies on the determination of spatial and temporal distributions of elementary water uptake by plant rots especially in the case of injection irrigation 4 conclusion the presented method allows the determination of the dynamics of the temporal and spatial distribution of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots the input parameter necessary for its application is the measurement of volumetric moisture in soil with the root system an additional advantage of the method is that the measurements are conducted in soil with undisturbed structure in the study the maximum average for the whole volume of soil with the plant root system intensity of elementary water uptake by butterhead lettuce of the crisphead type lactuca sativa l var capitata l max i c t was 0 0006 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the maximum values of means obtained on the basis of measurement with the tdr sensor max i c w t i max i c w t p occurred in the same periods but amounted to only 0 00048 cm3 cm 3 h 1 it should be noted that the values of elementary intensity of water uptake by plant roots in individual volumes i i j k t are strongly varied in layer iii at the point situated the closest to the injector nozzle the maximum value was 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 in the adjacent volume the maximum value was already as low as 0 003 cm3 cm 3 h 1 in the remaining volumes of that layer the values were equal to 0 cm3 cm 3 h 1 the value of 0 008 cm3 cm 3 h 1 is 13 fold higher than the average value of intensity for the entire soil volume this is due to the fact that water is not taken up from all of the elementary volumes the diurnal values of i i j k t calculated for the injection dose of 100 cm3 were at the same points lower than the values for the dose of 200 cm3 in the volume situated the closest to the injector nozzle dose of 100 cm3 the diurnal value of i i j k t was approximately 0 05 cm3 cm 3 day 1 and in the same volume but for the dose of 200 cm3 cm 3 day 1 that value was even as high as 0 1 cm3 cm 3 day 1 the presented solution allows the acquisition of information necessary for precise determination of the place and dose of injection from the nozzle of a high pressure injector so as to minimise the losses of water and to increase

10088,leaching is essential in irrigated croplands where natural precipitation is insufficient to control salinity buildup several useful models exist for salinity management however leaching requirement lr calculations are based on steady state approaches that only consider salinity tolerance of crops and irrigation water salinity to estimate the lr in this study a web based soil salinity leaching management model saleach was developed as an online tool to assist growers for better and easier management of soil salinity to sustain agricultural production in irrigated croplands saleach employs the traditional steady state approach to estimate lrs but improves outputs by not only considering irrigation water salinity eciw and salinity tolerance of specific crops ect but also root water uptake patterns to account for irrigation system differences and soil types for differences in hydraulic characteristics as well as water stress and rainfall input the saleach model can calculate the required irrigation water depth by using the estimated lr or any user specified leaching fraction lf values it can predict the drainage water salinity and soil salinity in the rootzone based on the applied leaching and it can estimate relative crop yield for a given lf saleach estimated lrs were assessed in different soil types and irrigation systems by comparing them with lrs soil water and drainage water salinity values obtained from an existing steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d statistical analyses showed that saleach estimated lrs soil salinity and drainage water salinity were all in the acceptable ranges of the corresponding values derived from other models thus we conclude saleach is reliable and can be employed by practitioners to produce satisfactory estimations of lrs and soil salinity by considering the soil crop water quality and irrigation system adoption of the model can improve water use efficiency and reduce groundwater pollution keywords leaching requirement lr leaching fraction lf salinity model saleach 1 introduction the ever growing world population requires increasing quantities of water to sustain agricultural productivity and maintain food security although irrigated agriculture makes up 20 of the total cultivated cropland worldwide it produces 40 of the global food supply the world bank 2020 expansion of irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid regions is constrained by the increasing water needs of municipalities and industries and by limited freshwater supply indeed the increased demand for irrigation water while freshwater resources are limited has led to the use of low quality water or saline water for irrigation bouwer 1994 ragab 1997 for example subsurface drainage water and reclaimed wastewater have been used in different regions of the world for irrigating salt tolerant crops and trees rhoades et al 1992 shannon et al 2000 chen et al 2013 grattan et al 2014 to sustain agriculture production it is required to keep soil salinity at a level below the threshold value of crop tolerance grieve et al 2012 when saline irrigation water is applied to croplands adding excess water to soil greater than the crop evapotranspiration demand is necessary to maintain rootzone salinity in an appropriate range for crop growth nevertheless water application in irrigated croplands must be managed properly because over irrigation may put pressure on limited water supplies as well as increase leaching which is considered a major non point source of pollution input to groundwater resources kronvang et al 1995 therefore it is critical to develop appropriate agricultural management practices including salinity leaching to cope simultaneously with soil salinity and environmental concerns salt dynamics in the soil water plant systems are complex and many factors such as soil type quality of irrigation water irrigation system and plant type can contribute to salinity buildup in soil chen et al 2013 conducting experimental studies to address the dynamics of salinity under various environmental conditions is time consuming expensive and sometimes not feasible on the other hand models are helpful tools for simulating such processes under various environmental conditions shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and are useful for assessing management options for salinity control in salt affected croplands soil salinity management models can be classified into two broad categories steady state models and transient state models steady state models such as the rhoades 1974 and watsuit models wu et al 2012 are easy to use and provide information about the long term effects of a given change e g to assess soil salinity resulting from a change in irrigation water quality these models use simple representations of soil water and crops skaggs et al 2014 and require general information such as average irrigation water volumes and concentrations and average crop evapotranspiration et to calculate the average yearly leaching fraction lf and soil salinity in contrast transient state models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 1998 and unsatchem suarez and šimůnek 1997 are more complicated and require more input data but they can provide specific detailed information on soil and water temporal variations to reflect the continual changes occurring in natural systems suarez 2012a the transient state models may represent a better opportunity for managing salinity in irrigated croplands however it is not clear yet if these benefits outweigh the complexity and parametrization required by such modeling approaches rhoades 1999 suarez 2012a skaggs et al 2014 although perfect steady state conditions do not exist in actual field conditions the suitability of traditional approaches has been assessed under common transient conditions corwin et al 2007 skaggs et al 2014 in this respect good correlations between experimental data and model predictions by steady state approaches have been evaluated by previous investigations letey et al 1985 shani et al 2007 skaggs et al 2014 indicating that steady state models can be utilized effectively over long time periods to make reliable estimates the concept of a leaching fraction lf under steady state conditions is defined as the ratio of drainage water depth to infiltrating irrigation water depth ddw diw which is equal to the ratio of irrigation water salinity to drainage water salinity eciw ecdw corwin et al 2007 the leaching requirement lr was originally defined by the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 as the lowest value of the leaching fraction lf that will result in salinity levels in the rootzone that will not reduce crop growth and yields in other words the lr is the amount of excess water that is required during irrigation so that the average rootzone salinity does not exceed the salinity threshold of a particular crop ect thus the minimum value of the lf i e lr will result in the maximum permissible salinity level of drainage water ec dw 1 lr ec iw ec dw where eciw ds m 1 is the ec of the applied irrigation water rhoades 1974 introduced a procedure for determining the appropriate values of ec dw to be used in eq 1 he assumed that the average salinity of a saturation extract ece in the rootzone is related to the ec values in the top and bottom of the soil profile therefore ec e is the average of eciw and ecdw when it is multiplied by the soil water content ratio swr ѳfc ѳs and a coefficient k according to the following equation 2 ec e k θ fc θ s ec iw ec dw 2 where ѳfc represents the soil water content at field capacity fc ѳs is the soil water content of a saturated paste and k is a parameter relating the average salinity of irrigation water and drainage water to the average salinity of soil water in the rootzone ec e ds m 1 is the threshold ece in the rootzone for a given crop such that higher levels of salinity would result in yield reduction maas and hoffman 1977 rhoades 1974 then substituted ecdw in eq 2 into eq 1 to generate the following equation 3 lr ec iw 2 k θ fc θ s ec e ec iw rhoades assumed that the soil water ratio swr is equal to 0 5 and the average k coefficient is approximately 0 8 based on data measured by bower et al 1969 therefore rhoades 1974 obtained the following equation for calculating the lr 4 lr ec iw 5 ec e ec iw eq 4 known as the traditional approach for determination of the lr under steady state conditions only requires information on crop salinity tolerance and irrigation water salinity the performance of steady state models has been evaluated in many previous studies by more sophisticated transient state models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 to simulate the dynamics of water salinity and other solutes in the soil corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 yang et al 2019 noshadi et al 2020 transient state models may have more advanced features with great accuracy but the complexity and high input data required by such models make them difficult for practical uses the traditional steady state models such as rhoades 1974 and watsuit oster and rhoades 1990 use different levels of simplicity and have their respective strengths and weaknesses a significant deficiency is that they do not account for factors such as soil types and irrigation systems involved in soil salinity management an open access and user friendly online tool for estimating the leaching requirements lr and managing soil salinity that also accounts for soil types and irrigation systems is highly desirable for practitioners in this study we developed a simple and straightforward online web tool titled soil salinity leaching management web tool saleach for practitioners this model is based on the traditional steady state model of rhoades 1974 but it has been modified to account for soil types and irrigation systems when its performance was assessed in comparison with existing models saleach produced reliable results for estimating the lr 2 material and methods 2 1 model development theory to develop the new model for estimating the lr with minimum inputs we followed the steady state approach by modifying eq 4 to include the effects of the soil type and the irrigation system in the web based salinity leaching management model saleach salinity ucr edu 2 1 1 soil type factor soil type is a dominant factor affecting irrigation management due to their different water holding capacities infiltration rates water flux rates and other hydraulic conductivity properties corwin et al 2007 that can contribute to differences in leaching efficiency and consequently the leaching requirement lr of soils the soil water content of a saturated paste ѳs is approximately 1 5 2 times greater than the field capacity ѳfc ayers and westcot 1985 accordingly ece is approximately one half of the salinity of soil water ecsw at field capacity u s salinity lab staff 1954 letey et al 2011 similarly a value of 0 5 for the soil water ratio swr ѳfc ѳs was used by rhoades 1974 however this approximation does not consider the unique hydraulic properties saturated paste vs field capacity of individual soils actual values of swrs can vary substantially depending on soil textures and clay mineralogy differences between actual swr values and the generally accepted swr value of 0 5 rhoades 1974 can range from 10 to 30 suarez 2012b the hydraulic properties of typical soil textures have been determined and reported by several researchers rawls et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 to incorporate the effect of soil type on soil hydraulic properties into the new model exact values of the swr were initially calculated by averaging soil water data ѳfc ѳs and ѳpwp soil water content at permanent wilting point from studies by saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1998 consequently the swr values in the model varied in a wide range of 0 2 for a sandy soil to 0 85 for a clay soil table 1 which resulted in higher lrs for clay soils and lower lrs for sandy soils compared with lr results based on the traditional model of rhoades 1974 to cope with the wide variations in the actual swrs in the new model while maintaining the presumptive concept of the swr in the rhoades model the ѳpwp was subtracted from both the numerator and denominator of the swr yielding swr eq 5 the outcome of this modification eq 5 is very similar to the definition of the dimensionless soil water content in soil water retention introduced by mualem 1976 soil water retention is recognized as a fundamental soil hydraulic property that has great influence on soil moisture status and water flow assouline et al 1998 kumar and prasad 2018 therefore soil leaching behavior is closely associated with its soil water retention characteristics the modified swr swr is thus 5 swr θ fc θ pwp θ s θ pwp to determine the lr in relation to the mean soil water content and consider the effect of crop tolerance to water stress in the new model the ѳfc in eq 5 is replaced with the mean soil water content ѳa for irrigation scheduling purposes only a portion of the total soil water holding capacity is allowed to be depleted before the next irrigation to minimize plant water stress and yield reduction depending on crop sensitivity to water stress the maximum allowable depletion mad will vary as reported by allen et al 1998 the specific values of mad for each crop are listed in the guidelines by allen et al 1998 approximately 30 40 for crops sensitive to water stress 50 for crops moderately sensitive to water stress and 50 70 for crops tolerant to water stress therefore it can be assumed that the soil moisture in an irrigated cropland will vary in a range from ѳfc to the moisture content at the mad point ѳmad thus the mean soil water content ѳa can be considered as the average of ѳfc and ѳmad as described by eq 6 6 θ a θ mad θ fc 2 where ѳmad is calculated by eq 7 7 θ mad θ fc mad θ fc θ pwp by substituting eq 7 into eq 6 and then substituting eq 6 into eq 5 the modified soil water ratio m factor is represented by eq 8 8 m 1 mad 2 θ fc θ pwp θ s θ pwp depending on the specific mad value for a crop the m factor also varies with soil types for example considering a mad of 50 the resulting m factor values fall approximately in the range of 0 12 0 44 table 1 in which the lower and higher values are associated with light soils and heavy soils respectively the low values of the m factor for light soils are in agreement with the inherent characteristics of those soils that have higher leaching efficiency than heavy soils yang et al 2019 van hoorn 1981 and consequently a lower lr can be considered in light soils for the same soil type the m factor is higher for crops sensitive to water stress which results in a higher lr the m factor is lower for crops tolerant to water stress which results in a lower lr table 1 the higher m values obtained for crops sensitive to salinity and water stress are reasonable since the interaction of salinity and water stress can be severe on those crops 2 1 2 irrigation system factor irrigation systems and water application methods can affect water use efficiency and salinity distribution in the rootzone the irrigation application rate soil wetting area irrigation efficiency and irrigation interval vary among flood sprinkler micro sprinkler and drip irrigation systems and these factors can all substantially affect irrigation management and leaching practices for example the volume of water needed for a given degree of leaching may be greater in surface irrigation than in sprinkler irrigation due to the lower irrigation efficiency of the surface irrigation method in the saleach model the effect of an irrigation system is incorporated into the lr calculations by two parameters the k coefficient and the irrigation leaching zone factor clz 2 1 2 1 k coefficient rhoades 1974 used the k coefficient to relate the distribution of rootzone salinity to the salinity of the applied irrigation water and the salinity of the drainage water below the rootzone the original k coefficient was defined as the ratio of the average soil salinity at different depths ecei where i 1 4 numerator to the average of eciw and ecdw denominator according to eq 9 9 k ec e 1 ec e 2 ec e 3 ec e 4 4 ec iw ec dw 2 where ece1 ece2 ece3 and ece4 are soil salinities ec of saturated extracts in each quarter of the rootzone according to eq 9 a higher k value is obtained by a relatively low ecdw as a result of a high leaching fraction lf therefore when the difference between eciw and ecdw is small the distribution of salinity in the rootzone will be relatively uniform fig 1 on the other hand a lower k value means that the ecdw is relatively high usually under a low lf resulting in higher soil salinity in the bottom layers fig 1 there are two major factors that can affect the k coefficient in the traditional rhoades 1974 model the first factor is the root water uptake pattern which is correlated with a crop s evapotranspiration rate a higher rate of water uptake within a soil layer leads to higher salt buildup in that depth hence soil salinity distribution within the rootzone varies with water uptake rates in the soil layers the second factor affecting the k coefficient is the leaching fraction lf because a greater lf displaces more salts downward in the rootzone regardless of the contributing environmental and climatic factors a higher lf leads to a relatively uniform soil salinity over the entire rootzone as a result of sufficient salt leaching from the top to the bottom soil layers therefore the k coefficient gets closer to 1 with a high lf vertical graph in fig 1 on the other hand a lower lf might lead to adequate leaching of salts from the top layers but it may not be adequate to leach salts from the entire rootzone and consequently the bottom layers still remain saline the k coefficient in the original rhoades 1974 model used a single value of k 0 80 without considering the salinity distribution in the rootzone however the k coefficient gets closer to 1 when the soil salinity in the bottom layers is similar to that in the top layers to account for this difference the k coefficient in the saleach model is calculated using the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 which calculates soil salinity in each quarter of the rootzone as a result soil salinity distribution in the rootzone is dependent on lf values and root water uptake rates 2 1 2 2 soil salinity estimation by assuming steady state conditions and the same irrigation water salinity distribution in the rootzone will approach an equilibrium concentration after several consecutive irrigations based on the eciw and the applied leaching fraction lf according to the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 a rootzone is divided into four quarters with a corresponding lf and soil water salinity in each quarter fig 2 the lf at the bottom of each quarter lfi where i 1 4 is calculated from the amount of water draining to the quarter below and the total water applied to the rootzone consequently the lf at the bottom of the rootzone is determined as stated in eq 10 10 lf d dw d iw aw a et b et c et d et aw where ddw is the depth of drainage water below the rootzone mm diw is the depth of the applied water mm a b c and d are the percentages of root water uptake from the first quarter to the fourth quarter respectively aw is the depth of applied irrigation water mm and et is the cumulative evapotranspiration in mm by definition the soil water salinity at the bottom of each quarter ecswi can be estimated using the eciw and the lf value in each quarter lfi as stated in eq 11 11 ec swi ec iw lf i where ec swi i 1 4 represents the ec of soil water at the bottom of each soil quarter i refers to the number of a rootzone quarter and ec sw0 ec iw at the soil surface and ec sw4 ec dw fig 2 at the bottom of the rootzone in the fourth quarter the soil water sw salinity is equal to the drainage water dw salinity hence the average ecsw in the rootzone can be calculated by 12 ec sw ec sw 0 ec sw 1 ec sw 2 ec sw 3 ec sw 4 5 in the traditional approach soil salinity is generally considered to be one half of the ecsw ayers and westcot 1985 the soil type effect was incorporated into the saleach model to calculate soil salinity ecei where i 1 4 from soil water salinity ecswi in each quarter by considering their differences in water retention characteristics swr in eq 5 13 ec ei swr ec swi based on its definition the purpose of the lr is to maintain the ece at about the ect therefore in the saleach model it is assumed that by applying the prescribed lr the mean rootzone salinity will be equal to the ect hence the ultimate soil salinity in each quarter of the rootzone eq 13 should be adjusted by multiplying by the ratio of ect to the average ec of the quarters soil salinity ecavg 2 1 2 3 root water uptake pattern the plant water uptake pattern is an important factor for determining salinity distribution in the rootzone because it directly affects the leaching fraction in each of the soil layers if the rate of water uptake is higher in the top layer near the soil surface more salts will accumulate in the soil during transpiration thus a higher lf would be required for salt leaching plant rooting behavior varies with irrigation systems due to different wetting and root water uptake patterns bai and li 2003 lv et al 2010 in steady state models such as the ayers and westcot 1985 approach the rootzone is usually divided into equal quarters and the water uptake is assumed to be 40 30 20 and 10 from the top to bottom quarters respectively rhoades and merrill 1976 hoffman and van genuchten 1983 studied the predictive accuracy of different water uptake patterns including the 40 30 20 10 rule the exponential model of raats 1974 and the trapezoid model of gardner 1967 they concluded the 40 30 20 10 pattern underestimates the water loss from the upper portion of the rootzone especially under saline conditions however both the raats 1974 model with a shape parameter of 0 2 which results in a pattern of 71 21 6 2 and the trapezoid model a 50 35 14 1 pattern were in good agreement with the experimental data the raats 1974 model had the best correlation among those models therefore prescriptive water uptake patterns in the range of the raats and trapezoid models are likely to result in appropriate predictions since the irrigation system can affect root growth and development the root water uptake patterns are assumed to differ for the three main types of irrigation systems surface sprinkler and drip irrigation in the saleach model root water uptake near the soil surface is higher under drip sprinkler and surface irrigation systems respectively lv et al 2010 in a drip irrigation system the largest portion of water is absorbed by roots in the upper layers of the soil due to frequent irrigation and appropriate soil water that induces root growth bai and li 2003 lv et al 2010 sprinkler and flood irrigation systems have a lower rate of water uptake in upper soil layers than that of a drip irrigation system the exponential water uptake pattern of raats 1974 was used in saleach by assuming the shape factors of 0 2 0 25 and 0 33 respectively for drip sprinkler and flood irrigation systems after slightly adjusting the uptake patterns to reach 100 it results in the patterns of 71 21 6 2 in the four quarters of the rootzone for drip irrigation 64 24 8 4 for sprinkler irrigation and 55 27 12 6 for flood irrigation the hypothetical water uptake rates are consistent with the patterns reported by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 novak 1994 and king et al 2020 2 1 2 4 determination of the k coefficient the leaching fraction lf and the k coefficient are dependent parameters in other words the lf can alter the distribution of salinity in the soil profile and accordingly affects the k coefficient eq 9 in turn the estimated k coefficient is ultimately employed in eq 3 to determine the most appropriate lf that controls rootzone salinity i e the lr in our new model soil salinity in each quarter of the soil profile was calculated in a spreadsheet using the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 for a range of lf values from 3 to 60 for each of the three specified root water uptake patterns noted in section b above as shown in fig 3 the k coefficient is equal to the slope of the linear regression between the average soil water salinity and the average of irrigation water and drainage water salinity eq 9 for each irrigation system consequently k was determined to be 0 682 for flood irrigation 0 769 for sprinkler irrigation and 0 883 for drip irrigation fig 3 in the saleach model the value of the k coefficient differs from its value in the traditional approach by rhoades 1974 in which k was set equal to 0 8 in the new model the value of the k coefficient is higher for drip irrigation but lower for the flood and sprinkler irrigation systems fig 3 2 1 2 5 leaching zone effect the salt accumulation pattern and the soil leaching zone can vary among different irrigation systems fig 4 in surface flooding or sprinkler irrigation systems water is spread across the entire field in contrast to furrow and drip irrigation systems where water only wets the in furrow soil and the root sphere respectively in furrow irrigation salt accumulation in the bottom layers of the rootzone might be similar to that of flood irrigation however salts are also accumulated in the tops of ridges where soil wetting and salt leaching are limited during an irrigation for drip irrigation salts can accumulate in soil at the edges of the wetting pattern fig 4 which results in higher salinity levels at the outer edges of the wetting sphere to include the effect of the irrigation system on the lr estimated in the new model an empirical leaching zone coefficient clz which represents the percentage of the wetted surface is considered for each irrigation system as shown in table 2 allen et al 2005 however the clz in real field conditions can be different in practice from the default values in table 2 depending on planting distances dripper flow rates and soil conditions therefore an optional feature in the saleach web tool is provided to allow users to input the actual clz based on their field conditions 2 1 3 model outputs the final lr equation irrigation water demand and relative yield 2 1 3 1 the final lr equation in the saleach model the lr calculated up to this point is multiplied by the clz resulting in the final lr eq 14 of the saleach model by considering the effects of the soil type and the irrigation system in determining the lr the traditional rhoades 1974 model is transformed into the final lr equation of the saleach model eq 14 14 lr ec iw 2 k m ec t ec iw c lz where ect is the salinity tolerance of a specific crop ds m 1 m is the modified factor representing the soil type effect eq 8 k is a coefficient representing the irrigation system effect associated with the water uptake pattern while clz is the leaching zone coefficient which is an additional factor representing the effect of the irrigation system on the lr see section 2 1 2 5 rainfall plays a significant role in the overall salt balance in the rootzone and can affect the lr when it is considered as a supplementary water source for crop use and for leaching in saleach the proportion of seasonal rainfall is used to adjust the overall salinity of infiltrated water during the growing season by treating the salinity of rainfall as equal to 0 ds m 1 and calculating the average salinity of the leaching water according to the following two equations 15 f d rain d rain d irri 16 ec iw f ec r 1 f ec i where drain represents the depth of seasonal rainfall mm dirri is the depth of applied irrigation water in the season mm f is the proportion of seasonal rainfall to the total received water eciw represents the salinity of the irrigation water ds m 1 and ecr is the salinity of rainwater ecr 0 ds m 1 the required yield function information including ect and the crop yield reduction rate slope from the guidelines of ayers and westcot 1985 and maas 1990 are incorporated into saleach the crop listing in the model contains more than 100 species of field vegetable forage and tree crops the information on the maximum allowable depletion mad uses the guidelines of allen et al 1998 a mad of 50 is assumed in saleach for the crops that are not included in the guidelines of allen et al 1998 2 1 3 2 irrigation water demand a proper irrigation management plan strives to apply sufficient water to meet the crop water demand plus the lr ayers and westcot 1985 the total depth of irrigation water iw1 that needs to be applied to meet both the et demand and the lr is estimated by the following equation 17 iw 1 et 1 lr however no irrigation system applies water perfectly and efficiently across the entire field in most cases extra water must be applied to ensure all parts of the field receive sufficient water sprinklers and micro systems have better irrigation efficiency than flooding systems and they tend to minimize deep percolation inefficiencies canessa et al 2011 the total depth of water iw2 to meet both the crop et demand and to account for less than 100 irrigation efficiency is estimated by the following equation 18 iw 2 et ie where ie is the irrigation efficiency typical irrigation efficiencies for the major irrigation systems in california were assumed on average as shown in table 2 canessa et al 2011 however there is an optional feature in saleach which allows users to input the appropriate irrigation application efficiency based on their field conditions the required water application iw3 to meet all three factors the crop et demand the lr and the ie is given in eq 19 19 iw 3 et ie 1 lr in saleach the irrigation water depths are calculated using all three approaches eqs 17 19 and the values are available for the users to compare and choose based on their preference or field conditions 2 1 3 3 relative crop yield plant growth decreases linearly as the average soil salinity increases in the rootzone ece a crop will experience yield reduction when the ec of the rootzone is above its critical threshold salinity level ect the following maas hoffman equation eq 20 expresses the straight line salinity effect on relative crop yield maas and hoffman 1977 20 y r 100 s yl ec e ec t where yr is relative crop yield ece and ect are both expressed in ds m 1 and syl is the slope representing yield loss per unit increase in salinity also expressed in ds m 1 the values for ect and syl in saleach are taken from maas 1990 the lr prescribed by saleach is theoretically sufficient to maintain crop yield at an acceptable level however in some cases saleach users may decide to apply a lower lf than the estimated lr in such cases the ece will be estimated by using the practitioner s lf subsequently the relative crop yield yr will be estimated by substituting the calculated ece into eq 20 in addition the required irrigation depth and soil salinity will be calculated based on the given lf value 2 2 model assessment 2 2 1 leaching requirement lr assessment to assess the performance of saleach we compared the estimated lr values by saleach with those obtained by corwin et al 2007 who estimated lrs by different steady state and transient models for three crops wheat lettuce alfalfa in a silty clay soil in the imperial valley of california table 3 that is lr values were determined for the same three crops and water salinity conditions using saleach and the obtained results in the present study were compared with the outcomes of corwin et al 2007 the three selected crops represent one crop moderately tolerant to salinity wheat and two crops moderately sensitive to salinity lettuce and alfalfa as defined by grieve et al 2012 in order to make the saleach results comparable with the corwin et al 2007 study in the imperial valley the irrigation water salinity eciw was assumed to be 1 23 ds m 1 similar to the corwin study similarly no rainwater was considered in the simulations the irrigation leaching zone factor clz was assumed as 100 for the three irrigation systems in the model validations 2 2 2 drainage water salinity assessment by dividing the rootzone into four quarters the leaching fraction lf decreases from the top quarter at the soil surface to the bottom quarter but salt concentration increases with depth ayers and westcot 1985 therefore the effect of the lf on salinity leaching is more evident at the bottom of the rootzone yang et al 2019 which can be observed by the drainage water salinity value ecdw the predicted salinity variations within soil layers can be different using transient state or steady state models we employed the hydrus 1d model a most widely used and validated transient state model to investigate the salinity of drainage water ecdw below the rootzone and to assess the performance of saleach in this comparison two representative crops were selected wheat to represent crops moderately tolerant with a low lr to salinity and corn to represent crops moderately sensitive with a higher lr to salinity grieve et al 2012 the salinity of the two irrigation waters eciw used for each crop were assumed to be 3 and 4 ds m 1 for wheat and 1 and 2 ds m 1 for corn the daily crop evapotranspiration rate etc was calculated from the equation of etc kc eto in which the daily reference evapotranspiration eto data 2018 2019 were obtained from the cimis 5 station shafter san joaquin valley ca and crop coefficients kc were obtained from a semi arid region lysimeter study in a silty clay loam soil by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 for flood and sprinkler irrigation the daily crop transpiration and evaporation in hydrus 1d were calculated as 70 and 30 respectively of the total evapotranspiration shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 since soil evaporation is lower under drip irrigation compared to sprinkler and flood methods the crop transpiration and evaporation were calculated to be 84 and 16 respectively of total et according to the studies of yang et al 2020 trout and dejonge 2017 and burt et al 2001 the distribution of root water uptake in the 1 meter soil profile was considered for the three irrigation systems in hydrus 1d the initial value of soil water salinity ecsw was assumed to be 0 4 ds m 1 in the rootzone the applied irrigation water was calculated based on the cumulative etc between two consecutive irrigation events by adding the lr that was estimated from saleach to each irrigation event during the growing season the irrigation intervals for flood irrigation were assumed to occur on a weekly to bi weekly basis for winter wheat and on a 4 day to 10 day interval for summer corn shorter irrigation intervals were used for sprinkler irrigation since it usually occurs more frequently than flood irrigation although the two dimensional water flow transient state model hydrus 2d is more appropriate to simulate water and solute dynamics under drip irrigation the hydrus 1d model has also been employed successfully to study water and solute transport for drip irrigation systems with daily scale irrigations ventrella et al 2019 slama et al 2019 therefore daily irrigation practices were used in our evaluations to mimic the drip irrigation in hydrus 1d and to make the simulations comparable to the one dimensional watsuit model oster and rhoades 1990 the hydrus 1d simulation period was considered for 10 consecutive year growing seasons for each crop 1400 days for corn and 2250 days for wheat to ensure that the field soil had reached steady state conditions 2 2 3 soil salinity assessment similar to the watsuit model oster and rhoades 1990 saleach uses a steady state approach for calculating soil salinity however it does not account for salt precipitation in soil to assess the performance of saleach in terms of soil water salinity predictions within the soil profile the saleach estimated soil water salinity values at each quarter of the rootzone were compared with the corresponding soil water salinity values estimated by the watsuit model for six different levels of irrigation water salinity eciw 0 96 1 24 1 52 1 72 2 15 and 4 0 ds m 1 also saleach was run using the same levels of irrigation water salinity for different soil textures and the seven crops noted below a total of 27 simulation scenarios were executed by saleach in the following combinations 7 crops which differed in tolerance to salinity alfalfa corn strawberry lettuce bean pepper and wheat 6 irrigation water salinity levels eciw 0 96 1 24 1 52 1 72 2 15 and 4 0 ds m 1 and 10 soil textural types under flood irrigation under the same irrigation water quality and equal lf values in the range of 5 40 the estimated soil water salinity values ecsw at each quarter of the rootzone obtained from watsuit and saleach were compared 2 2 4 statistical analysis regression analyses were conducted to assess the performance of saleach compared to the hydrus 1d and watsuit models the statistical parameters used by regression tests include r square r2 standard error se and significance level at 5 pvalue in addition the accuracy of saleach predictions in comparison with the hydrus 1d and watsuit models were assessed by the index of agreement d willmott 1981 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse parameters as follows 21 nrmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n o 100 22 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where o i is the predicted data by hydrus 1d or watsuit pi is the predicted data by saleach o is the average predictions by hydrus 1d or watsuit and n is the total number of data points the index of agreement d was used as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error which varies between 0 no agreement and 1 perfect agreement it can detect differences in the observed and simulated means and variances also the nrmse indicates the percentage of standard deviation of the prediction errors compared with a reference dataset e g observed data the nrmse has been used as a criterion for assessing the accuracy of model predications in several studies that have evaluated soil salinity predictions noshadi et al 2020 eldeiry and garcia 2010 a smaller value of nrmse close to 0 indicates slight differences between the two datasets predicted and observed and thus a higher accuracy of a model s predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 lr estimations by saleach soil type effect the lrs obtained from saleach with each of the 15 soil textural types and the three representative irrigation systems flood sprinkler and drip in addition to the calculated lrs by the traditional approach eq 4 rhoades 1974 are shown in fig 5 the lr values determined by the rhoades 1974 approach were 4 23 and 14 for wheat lettuce and alfalfa respectively fig 5 the estimated lr values by saleach were substantially different based on the soil types and the irrigation systems fig 5 compared with the rhoades 1974 approach the saleach estimated lr values are lower in coarse and moderate texture soils while the lr results for the two models are closely aligned in clay soils for wheat a crop moderately tolerant to salinity grieve et al 2012 the saleach estimated lr values under conditions of flood irrigation were approximately 1 for sand and loamy sand soils and 3 for loam and clay soils which is very close to the lr results by the traditional rhoades approach 4 fig 5 for lettuce a crop moderately sensitive to salinity grieve et al 2012 requiring higher leaching the saleach estimated lr was below 10 for sand to sandy loam soils and roughly 17 for moderate and heavy soils these lrs are lower than the traditional lr values calculated by the rhoades approach 23 fig 5 but they are similar to the corresponding predictions by unsatchem tetrans and watsuit table 3 the lr for alfalfa is lower than that of lettuce fig 5 although alfalfa was classified by grieve et al 2012 as moderately sensitive to salinity the same category as lettuce the saleach estimated lr was 4 for alfalfa in sand and loamy sand soils but 9 for finer clay soils under flood irrigation the latter lr is substantially lower than the lr value of 14 predicted by the traditional rhoades 1974 method the lower lr values estimated by saleach are consistent with the results obtained by corwin et al 2007 letey and feng 2007 and letey et al 2011 although the effects of soil types on the lr were not discussed in those studies for example corwin et al 2007 indicated that a lower lr than that estimated by the traditional method was needed to control soil salinity in the alfalfa wheat lettuce crop rotation table 3 their estimated lrs by the unsatchem model in a silty clay soil were 10 0 and 13 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively the lr approximations with the watsuit model resulted in 9 3 and 13 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively similarly the estimated lrs using the tetrans model corwin et al 1991 were 14 4 and 17 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively table 3 in saleach the estimated lrs in the same type of soil silty clay under flood irrigation were 10 3 and 16 respectively for alfalfa wheat and lettuce fig 5 therefore under similar conditions the estimated lr by saleach for the three crops are very close to those estimated by unsatchem tetrans and watsuit the results of corwin et al 2007 indicate that the appropriate lrs are lower than those prescribed by the traditional model of rhoades 1974 the rationale for this fact is that the traditional method 1 does not consider salt precipitation such as calcite which can reduce levels of soil salinity and 2 ignores the preferential flow that affects the efficiency of salt leaching within the rootzone letey et al 2011 reached a similar conclusion that the traditional steady state approach overestimates the lr and the negative consequences of irrigating with saline waters by which the lr difference is particularly large at low leaching fractions although saleach does not consider salt precipitation and preferential flow the modifications implemented in our steady state model have approximated the estimations of unsatchem suarez and šimůnek 1997 and tetrans corwin et al 1991 those modifications include considering the effect of soil hydraulic parameters soil maximum allowable depletion mad and root water uptake pattern irrigation system the lower lr estimated by saleach compared to the traditional approach is consistent with the unsatchem tetrans and watsuit estimations when leaching approaches nearly steady state in these models regarding soil texture effects on lr estimations it is well known that water movement under saturated conditions is faster through coarse soils due to larger pores compared to fine soils with smaller pores gardner 1979 smaller pores in clay soils are more likely to accumulate salts because salts are leached down by water flow initially in the large pores and subsequently in the smaller pores if sufficient water is applied therefore water application with a small lf in finer clay soils can lead to incomplete leaching of salts in the smaller pores similarly chen et al 2013 reported that soil salinity accumulation under reclaimed wastewater irrigation was three times higher in a clay loam than in a sandy loam soil because salts could more easily be intercepted by clay particles they concluded that higher leaching in heavy soils is necessary to avoid soil salinization irrigation frequency is another important factor affecting soil water salinity when irrigating with saline waters soil water salinity increases in direct proportion to the salinity and uptake of irrigation water under more frequent irrigation practices and higher soil water content the soil salinity does not reach high concentrations letey and feng 2007 in this respect sandy soils are usually irrigated more frequently than clay soils due to lower available water content and higher draining capacity of sandy soils furthermore the time span that a low water content lasts between two consecutive irrigation events in sandy soils is shorter than that in clay soils due to the lower range of moisture variations in sandy soils in other words the time period that plant roots are exposed to higher concentrations of salts is shorter in sandy soils than that in clay soils because the decrease in soil water occurs more rapidly in the former therefore the lower lr estimated by saleach for sandy soils compared with clay soils is rational this fact is also in agreement with the results of hydrus simulations by yang et al 2019 in which the sandy and loam soils are more efficient in terms of salt leaching compared with the clay soil depending on the susceptibility of a crop to water stress the level of allowable water depletion in soil varies for different crops this concept has been considered in saleach through the parameter called maximum allowable depletion mad in the soil type factor m as a result the saleach estimated lr for a crop sensitive to water stress is relatively higher than that of a crop more tolerant to water stress cultivated in the same soil type for example cabbage and celery have the same tolerance to salinity 1 8 ds m 1 but celery is more sensitive to water stress mad 0 2 than cabbage is mad 0 45 therefore under the same soil conditions irrigation system and irrigation water quality saleach prescribes a higher lr for celery than for cabbage to mitigate the interaction effects of salinity and water stress on celery the composition of ions in irrigation water can also impact the hydraulic properties of the soil and alter the effectiveness of salinity leaching a higher sodium absorption ratio sar in irrigation water reduces the soil infiltration rate which subsequently results in increased surface runoff during irrigation and rain events suarez et al 2006 in this respect the watsuit model wu et al 2012 can be utilized to assess the suitability of a specific water for irrigation soil spatial variability can be another factor affecting salinity management in the field as in other traditional salinity management models soil variability is not considered in saleach soil spatial variability is scale dependent and within a reasonable size of field management the soil can be practically considered as a uniform unit and thus the same management practices can be employed if significant variability of soil types exists in a particular field a user can run the model separately in each zone of similar soil type as an alternative approach users can also choose the moderate to heavy soil in a field with higher lr to estimate the lr in saleach which ensures that the model does not underestimate the overall lr for the field 3 2 lr estimations by saleach irrigation system effect in the saleach model the effect of irrigation systems on the estimated lrs was attributed to the differences in plant water uptake patterns and the zone of leaching in drip and sprinkler irrigation systems water uptake is higher at the upper soil layers than in flood irrigation therefore higher salinity is likely to accumulate in this region by plant transpiration and thus higher leaching water is required to leach the salts from the top to the bottom of the rootzone this concept has resulted in slightly higher 1 2 lrs estimated by saleach in the sprinkler irrigation system than those in the flood irrigation system for selected crops in different soils fig 5 furthermore higher lrs 2 4 in the flood irrigation system than those in the drip irrigation system were estimated by saleach when the wetted soil area in the drip irrigation system is considered 100 the same as flood and sprinkler systems it is evident that the leaching zone wetted area under drip irrigation is usually less than 100 in orchards and agricultural fields the leaching zone factor clz of 40 was used for drip irrigation in saleach therefore the final lr under drip irrigation is typically lower than the lrs predicted for both flood and sprinkler irrigation systems especially for crops that require higher lr values such as lettuce and alfalfa the patterns of the leaching zone under drip irrigation can differ depending on the system layout the dripper flow rate and the soil type affecting lateral water movement accordingly saleach has an option for users to input the leaching zone percentage to accommodate their specific field conditions irrigation efficiency can also affect the lr estimation it is important to note that the lr estimated by saleach is based on the assumption of uniform water distribution across the field therefore uniformity of irrigation must be considered for the optimal irrigation management letey and feng 2007 in addition to the lr for salinity leaching based on the approach provided by ayers and westcot 1985 the required irrigation water can be calculated separately based on irrigation uniformity or the lr accordingly if the amount of irrigation water to meet the irrigation uniformity requirement is higher than the salt leaching requirement no additional water is necessary for soil salinity leaching however this approach may not be perfect in every sector of a field because it is based on the average irrigation uniformity and in some cases it may not fulfill the salinity leaching requirement for all portions of a field letey and feng 2007 a second approach is to determine the amount of irrigation water by combining the estimated lr and the irrigation uniformity which leads to a lower risk of yield reduction but a higher amount of irrigation water compared with the first approach saleach accommodates these concepts and allows the users to make separate or combined calculations it provides users with choices for analyzing the trade offs for making the best decisions based on their field conditions 3 3 comparison of drainage water salinity and lf estimations by saleach and hydrus 1d two different levels of irrigation water salinity and five different soil textures were simulated by hydrus 1d for wheat and corn using data from shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 and climate data from the cimis 5 station 2018 2019 shafter san joaquin valley ca the three main types of irrigation systems i e flood sprinkler permanent and drip were included in the simulations for each crop and were represented by differentiating the irrigation intervals in hydrus 1d by increasing the simulation time the salinity of drainage water at the bottom of the rootzone ecdw increased gradually until it became nearly constant with time the final drainage water salinity values estimated by saleach and hydrus 1d were compared fig 6 regarding the slope of the regression analysis the ecdw values predicted by saleach were only 1 and 3 different from those predicted by hydrus 1d for corn and wheat respectively this slight difference is a reasonable result to be expected between saleach a steady state model and hydrus 1d a transient state model furthermore the coefficients of determination r2 between the simulated ecdw values by hydrus 1d and those by saleach were 0 986 se 4 50 and pvalue 0 001 for wheat and 0 986 se 1 24 and pvalue 0 001 for corn showing little discrepancy between the estimated drainage water salinity ecdw values from the two approaches for both wheat and corn the nrmse and d values were 12 and 0 907 for corn and 12 and 0 718 for wheat respectively indicating that the predictions by saleach agreed well with those by hydrus 1d especially when the salinity of drainage water ecdw is low e g in a corn field under steady state conditions the lf is determined to be the ratio of irrigation water salinity to drainage water salinity lf eciw ecdw therefore the lf lr estimated by saleach can be compared with the lf eciw ecdw obtained from hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 for both wheat and corn a very close correlation exists between the saleach estimated lr and the hydrus 1d estimated lf the slopes of regression for corn and wheat indicate that the lrs predicted by saleach are nearly identical to the lfs predicted by hydrus 1d the coefficient of determination r2 between the hydrus 1d simulated lf values and the saleach estimated lr values for wheat was 0 99 se 0 96 and pvalue 0 001 and for corn was 0 99 se 1 24 and pvalue 0 001 the nrmse and d values were 8 and 0 99 for corn and 10 and 0 93 for wheat respectively again these statistical results demonstrate that saleach lf lr estimations agreed well with hydrus 1d lf simulations and saleach is able to provide reliable lr estimations in regard to the different types of soils used in this study 3 4 comparison of soil salinity estimations by saleach and watsuit the steady state watsuit model was developed several decades ago and it has been used to assess water suitability for irrigation without considering the soil type or the effect of the irrigation system in this study soil water salinity values at each quarter of the rootzone estimated by saleach were compared with the corresponding values estimated by watsuit by means of the 27 simulation scenarios for different crops water salinity levels and soil types see section 2 2 3 as shown in fig 8 the soil water salinity values estimated by saleach were in close correlation with the values obtained from watsuit especially at the third and fourth quarters of the rootzone the statistical parameters were r2 0 97 se 0 22 and pvalue 0 001 for the first quarter r2 0 95 se 0 50 pvalue 0 001 for the second quarter r2 0 96 se 1 08 pvalue 0 001 for the third quarter and r2 0 95 se 1 8 pvalue 0 001 for the fourth quarter of the rootzone respectively indicating good correlations between the soil water salinity values estimated by saleach and watsuit in addition the nrmse and d values were 35 and 0 83 for the first quarter 23 and 0 94 for the second quarter 24 and 0 95 for the third quarter and 27 and 0 94 for the fourth quarter of the rootzone respectively which again show that the saleach estimated soil water salinity values compare well with those estimated by watsuit comparisons between the soil water salinity values over the rootzone the average of four quarters estimated by saleach and those by watsuit also showed good agreement r2 0 96 pvalue 0 001 fig 8 the nrmse and d values were 25 and 0 94 respectively the estimated soil water salinity values by saleach were relatively lower than those by watsuit for low salinity conditions in the first quarter of the rootzone while the estimations were much closer to watsuit for relatively high soil water salinity values in the second third and fourth quarters of the rootzone the difference may be attributed to the fact that unlike the saleach model watsuit considers salt precipitation and mineral weathering processes that can affect soil salinity also plant water uptake in watsuit occurs in the ratios of 40 30 20 10 which differs from that in saleach 4 conclusions existing models to calculate the salinity leaching requirement lr in irrigated croplands are used by scientists and field managers to engage in best management practices regarding water resources and soil salinity due to inherent strengths and weaknesses in each model none of them are perfect to serve all users purposes the traditional steady state lr model rhoades 1974 is easiest to apply but the estimated lr with this approach is higher than the required lr in real circumstances which can lead to excess usage of scarce water resources saleach broadens the applicability of the traditional approach with the purpose of providing a simple web based decision support tool for farm advisors specialists and water managers to estimate the lr irrigation water amount soil salinity and crop yield by considering the crop s tolerance to salinity soil characteristics and the irrigation system used with the least input information the new model was evaluated by comparing its simulations with a more established steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d overall although simplified approaches were used to develop our new model statistical analyses showed that the saleach estimated lrs drainage water salinity values ecdw and soil water salinity values ecsw were closely correlated with the results derived from a traditional steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d tested in 27 soil water and crop combinations thus we conclude that saleach is reliable and acceptable for practical applications and it is a useful tool for better irrigation management to improve water use efficiency and sustain agricultural production while reducing groundwater pollution in irrigated croplands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10088,leaching is essential in irrigated croplands where natural precipitation is insufficient to control salinity buildup several useful models exist for salinity management however leaching requirement lr calculations are based on steady state approaches that only consider salinity tolerance of crops and irrigation water salinity to estimate the lr in this study a web based soil salinity leaching management model saleach was developed as an online tool to assist growers for better and easier management of soil salinity to sustain agricultural production in irrigated croplands saleach employs the traditional steady state approach to estimate lrs but improves outputs by not only considering irrigation water salinity eciw and salinity tolerance of specific crops ect but also root water uptake patterns to account for irrigation system differences and soil types for differences in hydraulic characteristics as well as water stress and rainfall input the saleach model can calculate the required irrigation water depth by using the estimated lr or any user specified leaching fraction lf values it can predict the drainage water salinity and soil salinity in the rootzone based on the applied leaching and it can estimate relative crop yield for a given lf saleach estimated lrs were assessed in different soil types and irrigation systems by comparing them with lrs soil water and drainage water salinity values obtained from an existing steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d statistical analyses showed that saleach estimated lrs soil salinity and drainage water salinity were all in the acceptable ranges of the corresponding values derived from other models thus we conclude saleach is reliable and can be employed by practitioners to produce satisfactory estimations of lrs and soil salinity by considering the soil crop water quality and irrigation system adoption of the model can improve water use efficiency and reduce groundwater pollution keywords leaching requirement lr leaching fraction lf salinity model saleach 1 introduction the ever growing world population requires increasing quantities of water to sustain agricultural productivity and maintain food security although irrigated agriculture makes up 20 of the total cultivated cropland worldwide it produces 40 of the global food supply the world bank 2020 expansion of irrigated agriculture in arid and semi arid regions is constrained by the increasing water needs of municipalities and industries and by limited freshwater supply indeed the increased demand for irrigation water while freshwater resources are limited has led to the use of low quality water or saline water for irrigation bouwer 1994 ragab 1997 for example subsurface drainage water and reclaimed wastewater have been used in different regions of the world for irrigating salt tolerant crops and trees rhoades et al 1992 shannon et al 2000 chen et al 2013 grattan et al 2014 to sustain agriculture production it is required to keep soil salinity at a level below the threshold value of crop tolerance grieve et al 2012 when saline irrigation water is applied to croplands adding excess water to soil greater than the crop evapotranspiration demand is necessary to maintain rootzone salinity in an appropriate range for crop growth nevertheless water application in irrigated croplands must be managed properly because over irrigation may put pressure on limited water supplies as well as increase leaching which is considered a major non point source of pollution input to groundwater resources kronvang et al 1995 therefore it is critical to develop appropriate agricultural management practices including salinity leaching to cope simultaneously with soil salinity and environmental concerns salt dynamics in the soil water plant systems are complex and many factors such as soil type quality of irrigation water irrigation system and plant type can contribute to salinity buildup in soil chen et al 2013 conducting experimental studies to address the dynamics of salinity under various environmental conditions is time consuming expensive and sometimes not feasible on the other hand models are helpful tools for simulating such processes under various environmental conditions shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2017 and are useful for assessing management options for salinity control in salt affected croplands soil salinity management models can be classified into two broad categories steady state models and transient state models steady state models such as the rhoades 1974 and watsuit models wu et al 2012 are easy to use and provide information about the long term effects of a given change e g to assess soil salinity resulting from a change in irrigation water quality these models use simple representations of soil water and crops skaggs et al 2014 and require general information such as average irrigation water volumes and concentrations and average crop evapotranspiration et to calculate the average yearly leaching fraction lf and soil salinity in contrast transient state models such as hydrus šimůnek et al 1998 and unsatchem suarez and šimůnek 1997 are more complicated and require more input data but they can provide specific detailed information on soil and water temporal variations to reflect the continual changes occurring in natural systems suarez 2012a the transient state models may represent a better opportunity for managing salinity in irrigated croplands however it is not clear yet if these benefits outweigh the complexity and parametrization required by such modeling approaches rhoades 1999 suarez 2012a skaggs et al 2014 although perfect steady state conditions do not exist in actual field conditions the suitability of traditional approaches has been assessed under common transient conditions corwin et al 2007 skaggs et al 2014 in this respect good correlations between experimental data and model predictions by steady state approaches have been evaluated by previous investigations letey et al 1985 shani et al 2007 skaggs et al 2014 indicating that steady state models can be utilized effectively over long time periods to make reliable estimates the concept of a leaching fraction lf under steady state conditions is defined as the ratio of drainage water depth to infiltrating irrigation water depth ddw diw which is equal to the ratio of irrigation water salinity to drainage water salinity eciw ecdw corwin et al 2007 the leaching requirement lr was originally defined by the u s salinity laboratory staff 1954 as the lowest value of the leaching fraction lf that will result in salinity levels in the rootzone that will not reduce crop growth and yields in other words the lr is the amount of excess water that is required during irrigation so that the average rootzone salinity does not exceed the salinity threshold of a particular crop ect thus the minimum value of the lf i e lr will result in the maximum permissible salinity level of drainage water ec dw 1 lr ec iw ec dw where eciw ds m 1 is the ec of the applied irrigation water rhoades 1974 introduced a procedure for determining the appropriate values of ec dw to be used in eq 1 he assumed that the average salinity of a saturation extract ece in the rootzone is related to the ec values in the top and bottom of the soil profile therefore ec e is the average of eciw and ecdw when it is multiplied by the soil water content ratio swr ѳfc ѳs and a coefficient k according to the following equation 2 ec e k θ fc θ s ec iw ec dw 2 where ѳfc represents the soil water content at field capacity fc ѳs is the soil water content of a saturated paste and k is a parameter relating the average salinity of irrigation water and drainage water to the average salinity of soil water in the rootzone ec e ds m 1 is the threshold ece in the rootzone for a given crop such that higher levels of salinity would result in yield reduction maas and hoffman 1977 rhoades 1974 then substituted ecdw in eq 2 into eq 1 to generate the following equation 3 lr ec iw 2 k θ fc θ s ec e ec iw rhoades assumed that the soil water ratio swr is equal to 0 5 and the average k coefficient is approximately 0 8 based on data measured by bower et al 1969 therefore rhoades 1974 obtained the following equation for calculating the lr 4 lr ec iw 5 ec e ec iw eq 4 known as the traditional approach for determination of the lr under steady state conditions only requires information on crop salinity tolerance and irrigation water salinity the performance of steady state models has been evaluated in many previous studies by more sophisticated transient state models such as hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 1998 to simulate the dynamics of water salinity and other solutes in the soil corwin et al 2007 letey et al 2011 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2018 yang et al 2019 noshadi et al 2020 transient state models may have more advanced features with great accuracy but the complexity and high input data required by such models make them difficult for practical uses the traditional steady state models such as rhoades 1974 and watsuit oster and rhoades 1990 use different levels of simplicity and have their respective strengths and weaknesses a significant deficiency is that they do not account for factors such as soil types and irrigation systems involved in soil salinity management an open access and user friendly online tool for estimating the leaching requirements lr and managing soil salinity that also accounts for soil types and irrigation systems is highly desirable for practitioners in this study we developed a simple and straightforward online web tool titled soil salinity leaching management web tool saleach for practitioners this model is based on the traditional steady state model of rhoades 1974 but it has been modified to account for soil types and irrigation systems when its performance was assessed in comparison with existing models saleach produced reliable results for estimating the lr 2 material and methods 2 1 model development theory to develop the new model for estimating the lr with minimum inputs we followed the steady state approach by modifying eq 4 to include the effects of the soil type and the irrigation system in the web based salinity leaching management model saleach salinity ucr edu 2 1 1 soil type factor soil type is a dominant factor affecting irrigation management due to their different water holding capacities infiltration rates water flux rates and other hydraulic conductivity properties corwin et al 2007 that can contribute to differences in leaching efficiency and consequently the leaching requirement lr of soils the soil water content of a saturated paste ѳs is approximately 1 5 2 times greater than the field capacity ѳfc ayers and westcot 1985 accordingly ece is approximately one half of the salinity of soil water ecsw at field capacity u s salinity lab staff 1954 letey et al 2011 similarly a value of 0 5 for the soil water ratio swr ѳfc ѳs was used by rhoades 1974 however this approximation does not consider the unique hydraulic properties saturated paste vs field capacity of individual soils actual values of swrs can vary substantially depending on soil textures and clay mineralogy differences between actual swr values and the generally accepted swr value of 0 5 rhoades 1974 can range from 10 to 30 suarez 2012b the hydraulic properties of typical soil textures have been determined and reported by several researchers rawls et al 1998 saxton and rawls 2006 to incorporate the effect of soil type on soil hydraulic properties into the new model exact values of the swr were initially calculated by averaging soil water data ѳfc ѳs and ѳpwp soil water content at permanent wilting point from studies by saxton and rawls 2006 and rawls et al 1998 consequently the swr values in the model varied in a wide range of 0 2 for a sandy soil to 0 85 for a clay soil table 1 which resulted in higher lrs for clay soils and lower lrs for sandy soils compared with lr results based on the traditional model of rhoades 1974 to cope with the wide variations in the actual swrs in the new model while maintaining the presumptive concept of the swr in the rhoades model the ѳpwp was subtracted from both the numerator and denominator of the swr yielding swr eq 5 the outcome of this modification eq 5 is very similar to the definition of the dimensionless soil water content in soil water retention introduced by mualem 1976 soil water retention is recognized as a fundamental soil hydraulic property that has great influence on soil moisture status and water flow assouline et al 1998 kumar and prasad 2018 therefore soil leaching behavior is closely associated with its soil water retention characteristics the modified swr swr is thus 5 swr θ fc θ pwp θ s θ pwp to determine the lr in relation to the mean soil water content and consider the effect of crop tolerance to water stress in the new model the ѳfc in eq 5 is replaced with the mean soil water content ѳa for irrigation scheduling purposes only a portion of the total soil water holding capacity is allowed to be depleted before the next irrigation to minimize plant water stress and yield reduction depending on crop sensitivity to water stress the maximum allowable depletion mad will vary as reported by allen et al 1998 the specific values of mad for each crop are listed in the guidelines by allen et al 1998 approximately 30 40 for crops sensitive to water stress 50 for crops moderately sensitive to water stress and 50 70 for crops tolerant to water stress therefore it can be assumed that the soil moisture in an irrigated cropland will vary in a range from ѳfc to the moisture content at the mad point ѳmad thus the mean soil water content ѳa can be considered as the average of ѳfc and ѳmad as described by eq 6 6 θ a θ mad θ fc 2 where ѳmad is calculated by eq 7 7 θ mad θ fc mad θ fc θ pwp by substituting eq 7 into eq 6 and then substituting eq 6 into eq 5 the modified soil water ratio m factor is represented by eq 8 8 m 1 mad 2 θ fc θ pwp θ s θ pwp depending on the specific mad value for a crop the m factor also varies with soil types for example considering a mad of 50 the resulting m factor values fall approximately in the range of 0 12 0 44 table 1 in which the lower and higher values are associated with light soils and heavy soils respectively the low values of the m factor for light soils are in agreement with the inherent characteristics of those soils that have higher leaching efficiency than heavy soils yang et al 2019 van hoorn 1981 and consequently a lower lr can be considered in light soils for the same soil type the m factor is higher for crops sensitive to water stress which results in a higher lr the m factor is lower for crops tolerant to water stress which results in a lower lr table 1 the higher m values obtained for crops sensitive to salinity and water stress are reasonable since the interaction of salinity and water stress can be severe on those crops 2 1 2 irrigation system factor irrigation systems and water application methods can affect water use efficiency and salinity distribution in the rootzone the irrigation application rate soil wetting area irrigation efficiency and irrigation interval vary among flood sprinkler micro sprinkler and drip irrigation systems and these factors can all substantially affect irrigation management and leaching practices for example the volume of water needed for a given degree of leaching may be greater in surface irrigation than in sprinkler irrigation due to the lower irrigation efficiency of the surface irrigation method in the saleach model the effect of an irrigation system is incorporated into the lr calculations by two parameters the k coefficient and the irrigation leaching zone factor clz 2 1 2 1 k coefficient rhoades 1974 used the k coefficient to relate the distribution of rootzone salinity to the salinity of the applied irrigation water and the salinity of the drainage water below the rootzone the original k coefficient was defined as the ratio of the average soil salinity at different depths ecei where i 1 4 numerator to the average of eciw and ecdw denominator according to eq 9 9 k ec e 1 ec e 2 ec e 3 ec e 4 4 ec iw ec dw 2 where ece1 ece2 ece3 and ece4 are soil salinities ec of saturated extracts in each quarter of the rootzone according to eq 9 a higher k value is obtained by a relatively low ecdw as a result of a high leaching fraction lf therefore when the difference between eciw and ecdw is small the distribution of salinity in the rootzone will be relatively uniform fig 1 on the other hand a lower k value means that the ecdw is relatively high usually under a low lf resulting in higher soil salinity in the bottom layers fig 1 there are two major factors that can affect the k coefficient in the traditional rhoades 1974 model the first factor is the root water uptake pattern which is correlated with a crop s evapotranspiration rate a higher rate of water uptake within a soil layer leads to higher salt buildup in that depth hence soil salinity distribution within the rootzone varies with water uptake rates in the soil layers the second factor affecting the k coefficient is the leaching fraction lf because a greater lf displaces more salts downward in the rootzone regardless of the contributing environmental and climatic factors a higher lf leads to a relatively uniform soil salinity over the entire rootzone as a result of sufficient salt leaching from the top to the bottom soil layers therefore the k coefficient gets closer to 1 with a high lf vertical graph in fig 1 on the other hand a lower lf might lead to adequate leaching of salts from the top layers but it may not be adequate to leach salts from the entire rootzone and consequently the bottom layers still remain saline the k coefficient in the original rhoades 1974 model used a single value of k 0 80 without considering the salinity distribution in the rootzone however the k coefficient gets closer to 1 when the soil salinity in the bottom layers is similar to that in the top layers to account for this difference the k coefficient in the saleach model is calculated using the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 which calculates soil salinity in each quarter of the rootzone as a result soil salinity distribution in the rootzone is dependent on lf values and root water uptake rates 2 1 2 2 soil salinity estimation by assuming steady state conditions and the same irrigation water salinity distribution in the rootzone will approach an equilibrium concentration after several consecutive irrigations based on the eciw and the applied leaching fraction lf according to the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 a rootzone is divided into four quarters with a corresponding lf and soil water salinity in each quarter fig 2 the lf at the bottom of each quarter lfi where i 1 4 is calculated from the amount of water draining to the quarter below and the total water applied to the rootzone consequently the lf at the bottom of the rootzone is determined as stated in eq 10 10 lf d dw d iw aw a et b et c et d et aw where ddw is the depth of drainage water below the rootzone mm diw is the depth of the applied water mm a b c and d are the percentages of root water uptake from the first quarter to the fourth quarter respectively aw is the depth of applied irrigation water mm and et is the cumulative evapotranspiration in mm by definition the soil water salinity at the bottom of each quarter ecswi can be estimated using the eciw and the lf value in each quarter lfi as stated in eq 11 11 ec swi ec iw lf i where ec swi i 1 4 represents the ec of soil water at the bottom of each soil quarter i refers to the number of a rootzone quarter and ec sw0 ec iw at the soil surface and ec sw4 ec dw fig 2 at the bottom of the rootzone in the fourth quarter the soil water sw salinity is equal to the drainage water dw salinity hence the average ecsw in the rootzone can be calculated by 12 ec sw ec sw 0 ec sw 1 ec sw 2 ec sw 3 ec sw 4 5 in the traditional approach soil salinity is generally considered to be one half of the ecsw ayers and westcot 1985 the soil type effect was incorporated into the saleach model to calculate soil salinity ecei where i 1 4 from soil water salinity ecswi in each quarter by considering their differences in water retention characteristics swr in eq 5 13 ec ei swr ec swi based on its definition the purpose of the lr is to maintain the ece at about the ect therefore in the saleach model it is assumed that by applying the prescribed lr the mean rootzone salinity will be equal to the ect hence the ultimate soil salinity in each quarter of the rootzone eq 13 should be adjusted by multiplying by the ratio of ect to the average ec of the quarters soil salinity ecavg 2 1 2 3 root water uptake pattern the plant water uptake pattern is an important factor for determining salinity distribution in the rootzone because it directly affects the leaching fraction in each of the soil layers if the rate of water uptake is higher in the top layer near the soil surface more salts will accumulate in the soil during transpiration thus a higher lf would be required for salt leaching plant rooting behavior varies with irrigation systems due to different wetting and root water uptake patterns bai and li 2003 lv et al 2010 in steady state models such as the ayers and westcot 1985 approach the rootzone is usually divided into equal quarters and the water uptake is assumed to be 40 30 20 and 10 from the top to bottom quarters respectively rhoades and merrill 1976 hoffman and van genuchten 1983 studied the predictive accuracy of different water uptake patterns including the 40 30 20 10 rule the exponential model of raats 1974 and the trapezoid model of gardner 1967 they concluded the 40 30 20 10 pattern underestimates the water loss from the upper portion of the rootzone especially under saline conditions however both the raats 1974 model with a shape parameter of 0 2 which results in a pattern of 71 21 6 2 and the trapezoid model a 50 35 14 1 pattern were in good agreement with the experimental data the raats 1974 model had the best correlation among those models therefore prescriptive water uptake patterns in the range of the raats and trapezoid models are likely to result in appropriate predictions since the irrigation system can affect root growth and development the root water uptake patterns are assumed to differ for the three main types of irrigation systems surface sprinkler and drip irrigation in the saleach model root water uptake near the soil surface is higher under drip sprinkler and surface irrigation systems respectively lv et al 2010 in a drip irrigation system the largest portion of water is absorbed by roots in the upper layers of the soil due to frequent irrigation and appropriate soil water that induces root growth bai and li 2003 lv et al 2010 sprinkler and flood irrigation systems have a lower rate of water uptake in upper soil layers than that of a drip irrigation system the exponential water uptake pattern of raats 1974 was used in saleach by assuming the shape factors of 0 2 0 25 and 0 33 respectively for drip sprinkler and flood irrigation systems after slightly adjusting the uptake patterns to reach 100 it results in the patterns of 71 21 6 2 in the four quarters of the rootzone for drip irrigation 64 24 8 4 for sprinkler irrigation and 55 27 12 6 for flood irrigation the hypothetical water uptake rates are consistent with the patterns reported by hoffman and van genuchten 1983 novak 1994 and king et al 2020 2 1 2 4 determination of the k coefficient the leaching fraction lf and the k coefficient are dependent parameters in other words the lf can alter the distribution of salinity in the soil profile and accordingly affects the k coefficient eq 9 in turn the estimated k coefficient is ultimately employed in eq 3 to determine the most appropriate lf that controls rootzone salinity i e the lr in our new model soil salinity in each quarter of the soil profile was calculated in a spreadsheet using the approach of ayers and westcot 1985 for a range of lf values from 3 to 60 for each of the three specified root water uptake patterns noted in section b above as shown in fig 3 the k coefficient is equal to the slope of the linear regression between the average soil water salinity and the average of irrigation water and drainage water salinity eq 9 for each irrigation system consequently k was determined to be 0 682 for flood irrigation 0 769 for sprinkler irrigation and 0 883 for drip irrigation fig 3 in the saleach model the value of the k coefficient differs from its value in the traditional approach by rhoades 1974 in which k was set equal to 0 8 in the new model the value of the k coefficient is higher for drip irrigation but lower for the flood and sprinkler irrigation systems fig 3 2 1 2 5 leaching zone effect the salt accumulation pattern and the soil leaching zone can vary among different irrigation systems fig 4 in surface flooding or sprinkler irrigation systems water is spread across the entire field in contrast to furrow and drip irrigation systems where water only wets the in furrow soil and the root sphere respectively in furrow irrigation salt accumulation in the bottom layers of the rootzone might be similar to that of flood irrigation however salts are also accumulated in the tops of ridges where soil wetting and salt leaching are limited during an irrigation for drip irrigation salts can accumulate in soil at the edges of the wetting pattern fig 4 which results in higher salinity levels at the outer edges of the wetting sphere to include the effect of the irrigation system on the lr estimated in the new model an empirical leaching zone coefficient clz which represents the percentage of the wetted surface is considered for each irrigation system as shown in table 2 allen et al 2005 however the clz in real field conditions can be different in practice from the default values in table 2 depending on planting distances dripper flow rates and soil conditions therefore an optional feature in the saleach web tool is provided to allow users to input the actual clz based on their field conditions 2 1 3 model outputs the final lr equation irrigation water demand and relative yield 2 1 3 1 the final lr equation in the saleach model the lr calculated up to this point is multiplied by the clz resulting in the final lr eq 14 of the saleach model by considering the effects of the soil type and the irrigation system in determining the lr the traditional rhoades 1974 model is transformed into the final lr equation of the saleach model eq 14 14 lr ec iw 2 k m ec t ec iw c lz where ect is the salinity tolerance of a specific crop ds m 1 m is the modified factor representing the soil type effect eq 8 k is a coefficient representing the irrigation system effect associated with the water uptake pattern while clz is the leaching zone coefficient which is an additional factor representing the effect of the irrigation system on the lr see section 2 1 2 5 rainfall plays a significant role in the overall salt balance in the rootzone and can affect the lr when it is considered as a supplementary water source for crop use and for leaching in saleach the proportion of seasonal rainfall is used to adjust the overall salinity of infiltrated water during the growing season by treating the salinity of rainfall as equal to 0 ds m 1 and calculating the average salinity of the leaching water according to the following two equations 15 f d rain d rain d irri 16 ec iw f ec r 1 f ec i where drain represents the depth of seasonal rainfall mm dirri is the depth of applied irrigation water in the season mm f is the proportion of seasonal rainfall to the total received water eciw represents the salinity of the irrigation water ds m 1 and ecr is the salinity of rainwater ecr 0 ds m 1 the required yield function information including ect and the crop yield reduction rate slope from the guidelines of ayers and westcot 1985 and maas 1990 are incorporated into saleach the crop listing in the model contains more than 100 species of field vegetable forage and tree crops the information on the maximum allowable depletion mad uses the guidelines of allen et al 1998 a mad of 50 is assumed in saleach for the crops that are not included in the guidelines of allen et al 1998 2 1 3 2 irrigation water demand a proper irrigation management plan strives to apply sufficient water to meet the crop water demand plus the lr ayers and westcot 1985 the total depth of irrigation water iw1 that needs to be applied to meet both the et demand and the lr is estimated by the following equation 17 iw 1 et 1 lr however no irrigation system applies water perfectly and efficiently across the entire field in most cases extra water must be applied to ensure all parts of the field receive sufficient water sprinklers and micro systems have better irrigation efficiency than flooding systems and they tend to minimize deep percolation inefficiencies canessa et al 2011 the total depth of water iw2 to meet both the crop et demand and to account for less than 100 irrigation efficiency is estimated by the following equation 18 iw 2 et ie where ie is the irrigation efficiency typical irrigation efficiencies for the major irrigation systems in california were assumed on average as shown in table 2 canessa et al 2011 however there is an optional feature in saleach which allows users to input the appropriate irrigation application efficiency based on their field conditions the required water application iw3 to meet all three factors the crop et demand the lr and the ie is given in eq 19 19 iw 3 et ie 1 lr in saleach the irrigation water depths are calculated using all three approaches eqs 17 19 and the values are available for the users to compare and choose based on their preference or field conditions 2 1 3 3 relative crop yield plant growth decreases linearly as the average soil salinity increases in the rootzone ece a crop will experience yield reduction when the ec of the rootzone is above its critical threshold salinity level ect the following maas hoffman equation eq 20 expresses the straight line salinity effect on relative crop yield maas and hoffman 1977 20 y r 100 s yl ec e ec t where yr is relative crop yield ece and ect are both expressed in ds m 1 and syl is the slope representing yield loss per unit increase in salinity also expressed in ds m 1 the values for ect and syl in saleach are taken from maas 1990 the lr prescribed by saleach is theoretically sufficient to maintain crop yield at an acceptable level however in some cases saleach users may decide to apply a lower lf than the estimated lr in such cases the ece will be estimated by using the practitioner s lf subsequently the relative crop yield yr will be estimated by substituting the calculated ece into eq 20 in addition the required irrigation depth and soil salinity will be calculated based on the given lf value 2 2 model assessment 2 2 1 leaching requirement lr assessment to assess the performance of saleach we compared the estimated lr values by saleach with those obtained by corwin et al 2007 who estimated lrs by different steady state and transient models for three crops wheat lettuce alfalfa in a silty clay soil in the imperial valley of california table 3 that is lr values were determined for the same three crops and water salinity conditions using saleach and the obtained results in the present study were compared with the outcomes of corwin et al 2007 the three selected crops represent one crop moderately tolerant to salinity wheat and two crops moderately sensitive to salinity lettuce and alfalfa as defined by grieve et al 2012 in order to make the saleach results comparable with the corwin et al 2007 study in the imperial valley the irrigation water salinity eciw was assumed to be 1 23 ds m 1 similar to the corwin study similarly no rainwater was considered in the simulations the irrigation leaching zone factor clz was assumed as 100 for the three irrigation systems in the model validations 2 2 2 drainage water salinity assessment by dividing the rootzone into four quarters the leaching fraction lf decreases from the top quarter at the soil surface to the bottom quarter but salt concentration increases with depth ayers and westcot 1985 therefore the effect of the lf on salinity leaching is more evident at the bottom of the rootzone yang et al 2019 which can be observed by the drainage water salinity value ecdw the predicted salinity variations within soil layers can be different using transient state or steady state models we employed the hydrus 1d model a most widely used and validated transient state model to investigate the salinity of drainage water ecdw below the rootzone and to assess the performance of saleach in this comparison two representative crops were selected wheat to represent crops moderately tolerant with a low lr to salinity and corn to represent crops moderately sensitive with a higher lr to salinity grieve et al 2012 the salinity of the two irrigation waters eciw used for each crop were assumed to be 3 and 4 ds m 1 for wheat and 1 and 2 ds m 1 for corn the daily crop evapotranspiration rate etc was calculated from the equation of etc kc eto in which the daily reference evapotranspiration eto data 2018 2019 were obtained from the cimis 5 station shafter san joaquin valley ca and crop coefficients kc were obtained from a semi arid region lysimeter study in a silty clay loam soil by shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 for flood and sprinkler irrigation the daily crop transpiration and evaporation in hydrus 1d were calculated as 70 and 30 respectively of the total evapotranspiration shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 since soil evaporation is lower under drip irrigation compared to sprinkler and flood methods the crop transpiration and evaporation were calculated to be 84 and 16 respectively of total et according to the studies of yang et al 2020 trout and dejonge 2017 and burt et al 2001 the distribution of root water uptake in the 1 meter soil profile was considered for the three irrigation systems in hydrus 1d the initial value of soil water salinity ecsw was assumed to be 0 4 ds m 1 in the rootzone the applied irrigation water was calculated based on the cumulative etc between two consecutive irrigation events by adding the lr that was estimated from saleach to each irrigation event during the growing season the irrigation intervals for flood irrigation were assumed to occur on a weekly to bi weekly basis for winter wheat and on a 4 day to 10 day interval for summer corn shorter irrigation intervals were used for sprinkler irrigation since it usually occurs more frequently than flood irrigation although the two dimensional water flow transient state model hydrus 2d is more appropriate to simulate water and solute dynamics under drip irrigation the hydrus 1d model has also been employed successfully to study water and solute transport for drip irrigation systems with daily scale irrigations ventrella et al 2019 slama et al 2019 therefore daily irrigation practices were used in our evaluations to mimic the drip irrigation in hydrus 1d and to make the simulations comparable to the one dimensional watsuit model oster and rhoades 1990 the hydrus 1d simulation period was considered for 10 consecutive year growing seasons for each crop 1400 days for corn and 2250 days for wheat to ensure that the field soil had reached steady state conditions 2 2 3 soil salinity assessment similar to the watsuit model oster and rhoades 1990 saleach uses a steady state approach for calculating soil salinity however it does not account for salt precipitation in soil to assess the performance of saleach in terms of soil water salinity predictions within the soil profile the saleach estimated soil water salinity values at each quarter of the rootzone were compared with the corresponding soil water salinity values estimated by the watsuit model for six different levels of irrigation water salinity eciw 0 96 1 24 1 52 1 72 2 15 and 4 0 ds m 1 also saleach was run using the same levels of irrigation water salinity for different soil textures and the seven crops noted below a total of 27 simulation scenarios were executed by saleach in the following combinations 7 crops which differed in tolerance to salinity alfalfa corn strawberry lettuce bean pepper and wheat 6 irrigation water salinity levels eciw 0 96 1 24 1 52 1 72 2 15 and 4 0 ds m 1 and 10 soil textural types under flood irrigation under the same irrigation water quality and equal lf values in the range of 5 40 the estimated soil water salinity values ecsw at each quarter of the rootzone obtained from watsuit and saleach were compared 2 2 4 statistical analysis regression analyses were conducted to assess the performance of saleach compared to the hydrus 1d and watsuit models the statistical parameters used by regression tests include r square r2 standard error se and significance level at 5 pvalue in addition the accuracy of saleach predictions in comparison with the hydrus 1d and watsuit models were assessed by the index of agreement d willmott 1981 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse parameters as follows 21 nrmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n o 100 22 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where o i is the predicted data by hydrus 1d or watsuit pi is the predicted data by saleach o is the average predictions by hydrus 1d or watsuit and n is the total number of data points the index of agreement d was used as a standardized measure of the degree of model prediction error which varies between 0 no agreement and 1 perfect agreement it can detect differences in the observed and simulated means and variances also the nrmse indicates the percentage of standard deviation of the prediction errors compared with a reference dataset e g observed data the nrmse has been used as a criterion for assessing the accuracy of model predications in several studies that have evaluated soil salinity predictions noshadi et al 2020 eldeiry and garcia 2010 a smaller value of nrmse close to 0 indicates slight differences between the two datasets predicted and observed and thus a higher accuracy of a model s predictions 3 results and discussion 3 1 lr estimations by saleach soil type effect the lrs obtained from saleach with each of the 15 soil textural types and the three representative irrigation systems flood sprinkler and drip in addition to the calculated lrs by the traditional approach eq 4 rhoades 1974 are shown in fig 5 the lr values determined by the rhoades 1974 approach were 4 23 and 14 for wheat lettuce and alfalfa respectively fig 5 the estimated lr values by saleach were substantially different based on the soil types and the irrigation systems fig 5 compared with the rhoades 1974 approach the saleach estimated lr values are lower in coarse and moderate texture soils while the lr results for the two models are closely aligned in clay soils for wheat a crop moderately tolerant to salinity grieve et al 2012 the saleach estimated lr values under conditions of flood irrigation were approximately 1 for sand and loamy sand soils and 3 for loam and clay soils which is very close to the lr results by the traditional rhoades approach 4 fig 5 for lettuce a crop moderately sensitive to salinity grieve et al 2012 requiring higher leaching the saleach estimated lr was below 10 for sand to sandy loam soils and roughly 17 for moderate and heavy soils these lrs are lower than the traditional lr values calculated by the rhoades approach 23 fig 5 but they are similar to the corresponding predictions by unsatchem tetrans and watsuit table 3 the lr for alfalfa is lower than that of lettuce fig 5 although alfalfa was classified by grieve et al 2012 as moderately sensitive to salinity the same category as lettuce the saleach estimated lr was 4 for alfalfa in sand and loamy sand soils but 9 for finer clay soils under flood irrigation the latter lr is substantially lower than the lr value of 14 predicted by the traditional rhoades 1974 method the lower lr values estimated by saleach are consistent with the results obtained by corwin et al 2007 letey and feng 2007 and letey et al 2011 although the effects of soil types on the lr were not discussed in those studies for example corwin et al 2007 indicated that a lower lr than that estimated by the traditional method was needed to control soil salinity in the alfalfa wheat lettuce crop rotation table 3 their estimated lrs by the unsatchem model in a silty clay soil were 10 0 and 13 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively the lr approximations with the watsuit model resulted in 9 3 and 13 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively similarly the estimated lrs using the tetrans model corwin et al 1991 were 14 4 and 17 for alfalfa wheat and lettuce respectively table 3 in saleach the estimated lrs in the same type of soil silty clay under flood irrigation were 10 3 and 16 respectively for alfalfa wheat and lettuce fig 5 therefore under similar conditions the estimated lr by saleach for the three crops are very close to those estimated by unsatchem tetrans and watsuit the results of corwin et al 2007 indicate that the appropriate lrs are lower than those prescribed by the traditional model of rhoades 1974 the rationale for this fact is that the traditional method 1 does not consider salt precipitation such as calcite which can reduce levels of soil salinity and 2 ignores the preferential flow that affects the efficiency of salt leaching within the rootzone letey et al 2011 reached a similar conclusion that the traditional steady state approach overestimates the lr and the negative consequences of irrigating with saline waters by which the lr difference is particularly large at low leaching fractions although saleach does not consider salt precipitation and preferential flow the modifications implemented in our steady state model have approximated the estimations of unsatchem suarez and šimůnek 1997 and tetrans corwin et al 1991 those modifications include considering the effect of soil hydraulic parameters soil maximum allowable depletion mad and root water uptake pattern irrigation system the lower lr estimated by saleach compared to the traditional approach is consistent with the unsatchem tetrans and watsuit estimations when leaching approaches nearly steady state in these models regarding soil texture effects on lr estimations it is well known that water movement under saturated conditions is faster through coarse soils due to larger pores compared to fine soils with smaller pores gardner 1979 smaller pores in clay soils are more likely to accumulate salts because salts are leached down by water flow initially in the large pores and subsequently in the smaller pores if sufficient water is applied therefore water application with a small lf in finer clay soils can lead to incomplete leaching of salts in the smaller pores similarly chen et al 2013 reported that soil salinity accumulation under reclaimed wastewater irrigation was three times higher in a clay loam than in a sandy loam soil because salts could more easily be intercepted by clay particles they concluded that higher leaching in heavy soils is necessary to avoid soil salinization irrigation frequency is another important factor affecting soil water salinity when irrigating with saline waters soil water salinity increases in direct proportion to the salinity and uptake of irrigation water under more frequent irrigation practices and higher soil water content the soil salinity does not reach high concentrations letey and feng 2007 in this respect sandy soils are usually irrigated more frequently than clay soils due to lower available water content and higher draining capacity of sandy soils furthermore the time span that a low water content lasts between two consecutive irrigation events in sandy soils is shorter than that in clay soils due to the lower range of moisture variations in sandy soils in other words the time period that plant roots are exposed to higher concentrations of salts is shorter in sandy soils than that in clay soils because the decrease in soil water occurs more rapidly in the former therefore the lower lr estimated by saleach for sandy soils compared with clay soils is rational this fact is also in agreement with the results of hydrus simulations by yang et al 2019 in which the sandy and loam soils are more efficient in terms of salt leaching compared with the clay soil depending on the susceptibility of a crop to water stress the level of allowable water depletion in soil varies for different crops this concept has been considered in saleach through the parameter called maximum allowable depletion mad in the soil type factor m as a result the saleach estimated lr for a crop sensitive to water stress is relatively higher than that of a crop more tolerant to water stress cultivated in the same soil type for example cabbage and celery have the same tolerance to salinity 1 8 ds m 1 but celery is more sensitive to water stress mad 0 2 than cabbage is mad 0 45 therefore under the same soil conditions irrigation system and irrigation water quality saleach prescribes a higher lr for celery than for cabbage to mitigate the interaction effects of salinity and water stress on celery the composition of ions in irrigation water can also impact the hydraulic properties of the soil and alter the effectiveness of salinity leaching a higher sodium absorption ratio sar in irrigation water reduces the soil infiltration rate which subsequently results in increased surface runoff during irrigation and rain events suarez et al 2006 in this respect the watsuit model wu et al 2012 can be utilized to assess the suitability of a specific water for irrigation soil spatial variability can be another factor affecting salinity management in the field as in other traditional salinity management models soil variability is not considered in saleach soil spatial variability is scale dependent and within a reasonable size of field management the soil can be practically considered as a uniform unit and thus the same management practices can be employed if significant variability of soil types exists in a particular field a user can run the model separately in each zone of similar soil type as an alternative approach users can also choose the moderate to heavy soil in a field with higher lr to estimate the lr in saleach which ensures that the model does not underestimate the overall lr for the field 3 2 lr estimations by saleach irrigation system effect in the saleach model the effect of irrigation systems on the estimated lrs was attributed to the differences in plant water uptake patterns and the zone of leaching in drip and sprinkler irrigation systems water uptake is higher at the upper soil layers than in flood irrigation therefore higher salinity is likely to accumulate in this region by plant transpiration and thus higher leaching water is required to leach the salts from the top to the bottom of the rootzone this concept has resulted in slightly higher 1 2 lrs estimated by saleach in the sprinkler irrigation system than those in the flood irrigation system for selected crops in different soils fig 5 furthermore higher lrs 2 4 in the flood irrigation system than those in the drip irrigation system were estimated by saleach when the wetted soil area in the drip irrigation system is considered 100 the same as flood and sprinkler systems it is evident that the leaching zone wetted area under drip irrigation is usually less than 100 in orchards and agricultural fields the leaching zone factor clz of 40 was used for drip irrigation in saleach therefore the final lr under drip irrigation is typically lower than the lrs predicted for both flood and sprinkler irrigation systems especially for crops that require higher lr values such as lettuce and alfalfa the patterns of the leaching zone under drip irrigation can differ depending on the system layout the dripper flow rate and the soil type affecting lateral water movement accordingly saleach has an option for users to input the leaching zone percentage to accommodate their specific field conditions irrigation efficiency can also affect the lr estimation it is important to note that the lr estimated by saleach is based on the assumption of uniform water distribution across the field therefore uniformity of irrigation must be considered for the optimal irrigation management letey and feng 2007 in addition to the lr for salinity leaching based on the approach provided by ayers and westcot 1985 the required irrigation water can be calculated separately based on irrigation uniformity or the lr accordingly if the amount of irrigation water to meet the irrigation uniformity requirement is higher than the salt leaching requirement no additional water is necessary for soil salinity leaching however this approach may not be perfect in every sector of a field because it is based on the average irrigation uniformity and in some cases it may not fulfill the salinity leaching requirement for all portions of a field letey and feng 2007 a second approach is to determine the amount of irrigation water by combining the estimated lr and the irrigation uniformity which leads to a lower risk of yield reduction but a higher amount of irrigation water compared with the first approach saleach accommodates these concepts and allows the users to make separate or combined calculations it provides users with choices for analyzing the trade offs for making the best decisions based on their field conditions 3 3 comparison of drainage water salinity and lf estimations by saleach and hydrus 1d two different levels of irrigation water salinity and five different soil textures were simulated by hydrus 1d for wheat and corn using data from shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 and climate data from the cimis 5 station 2018 2019 shafter san joaquin valley ca the three main types of irrigation systems i e flood sprinkler permanent and drip were included in the simulations for each crop and were represented by differentiating the irrigation intervals in hydrus 1d by increasing the simulation time the salinity of drainage water at the bottom of the rootzone ecdw increased gradually until it became nearly constant with time the final drainage water salinity values estimated by saleach and hydrus 1d were compared fig 6 regarding the slope of the regression analysis the ecdw values predicted by saleach were only 1 and 3 different from those predicted by hydrus 1d for corn and wheat respectively this slight difference is a reasonable result to be expected between saleach a steady state model and hydrus 1d a transient state model furthermore the coefficients of determination r2 between the simulated ecdw values by hydrus 1d and those by saleach were 0 986 se 4 50 and pvalue 0 001 for wheat and 0 986 se 1 24 and pvalue 0 001 for corn showing little discrepancy between the estimated drainage water salinity ecdw values from the two approaches for both wheat and corn the nrmse and d values were 12 and 0 907 for corn and 12 and 0 718 for wheat respectively indicating that the predictions by saleach agreed well with those by hydrus 1d especially when the salinity of drainage water ecdw is low e g in a corn field under steady state conditions the lf is determined to be the ratio of irrigation water salinity to drainage water salinity lf eciw ecdw therefore the lf lr estimated by saleach can be compared with the lf eciw ecdw obtained from hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 for both wheat and corn a very close correlation exists between the saleach estimated lr and the hydrus 1d estimated lf the slopes of regression for corn and wheat indicate that the lrs predicted by saleach are nearly identical to the lfs predicted by hydrus 1d the coefficient of determination r2 between the hydrus 1d simulated lf values and the saleach estimated lr values for wheat was 0 99 se 0 96 and pvalue 0 001 and for corn was 0 99 se 1 24 and pvalue 0 001 the nrmse and d values were 8 and 0 99 for corn and 10 and 0 93 for wheat respectively again these statistical results demonstrate that saleach lf lr estimations agreed well with hydrus 1d lf simulations and saleach is able to provide reliable lr estimations in regard to the different types of soils used in this study 3 4 comparison of soil salinity estimations by saleach and watsuit the steady state watsuit model was developed several decades ago and it has been used to assess water suitability for irrigation without considering the soil type or the effect of the irrigation system in this study soil water salinity values at each quarter of the rootzone estimated by saleach were compared with the corresponding values estimated by watsuit by means of the 27 simulation scenarios for different crops water salinity levels and soil types see section 2 2 3 as shown in fig 8 the soil water salinity values estimated by saleach were in close correlation with the values obtained from watsuit especially at the third and fourth quarters of the rootzone the statistical parameters were r2 0 97 se 0 22 and pvalue 0 001 for the first quarter r2 0 95 se 0 50 pvalue 0 001 for the second quarter r2 0 96 se 1 08 pvalue 0 001 for the third quarter and r2 0 95 se 1 8 pvalue 0 001 for the fourth quarter of the rootzone respectively indicating good correlations between the soil water salinity values estimated by saleach and watsuit in addition the nrmse and d values were 35 and 0 83 for the first quarter 23 and 0 94 for the second quarter 24 and 0 95 for the third quarter and 27 and 0 94 for the fourth quarter of the rootzone respectively which again show that the saleach estimated soil water salinity values compare well with those estimated by watsuit comparisons between the soil water salinity values over the rootzone the average of four quarters estimated by saleach and those by watsuit also showed good agreement r2 0 96 pvalue 0 001 fig 8 the nrmse and d values were 25 and 0 94 respectively the estimated soil water salinity values by saleach were relatively lower than those by watsuit for low salinity conditions in the first quarter of the rootzone while the estimations were much closer to watsuit for relatively high soil water salinity values in the second third and fourth quarters of the rootzone the difference may be attributed to the fact that unlike the saleach model watsuit considers salt precipitation and mineral weathering processes that can affect soil salinity also plant water uptake in watsuit occurs in the ratios of 40 30 20 10 which differs from that in saleach 4 conclusions existing models to calculate the salinity leaching requirement lr in irrigated croplands are used by scientists and field managers to engage in best management practices regarding water resources and soil salinity due to inherent strengths and weaknesses in each model none of them are perfect to serve all users purposes the traditional steady state lr model rhoades 1974 is easiest to apply but the estimated lr with this approach is higher than the required lr in real circumstances which can lead to excess usage of scarce water resources saleach broadens the applicability of the traditional approach with the purpose of providing a simple web based decision support tool for farm advisors specialists and water managers to estimate the lr irrigation water amount soil salinity and crop yield by considering the crop s tolerance to salinity soil characteristics and the irrigation system used with the least input information the new model was evaluated by comparing its simulations with a more established steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d overall although simplified approaches were used to develop our new model statistical analyses showed that the saleach estimated lrs drainage water salinity values ecdw and soil water salinity values ecsw were closely correlated with the results derived from a traditional steady state model watsuit and a transient state model hydrus 1d tested in 27 soil water and crop combinations thus we conclude that saleach is reliable and acceptable for practical applications and it is a useful tool for better irrigation management to improve water use efficiency and sustain agricultural production while reducing groundwater pollution in irrigated croplands declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

10089,quantifying the water use effects of tree plantations on regional hydrological processes is vitally important for evaluating the reforestation strategies related to a sustainable use of water resources we conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the precipitation partitioning and hydrological effect of three different plantations schima wallichii acacia mangium and cunninghamia lanceolata by monitoring sap flow and using a water balance equation during a two year period from january 2017 to december 2018 in hilly lands of south china owing to the abundant precipitation and radiation both monthly stand scale transpiration and evapotranspiration of the tree plantations were higher in the wet season than in the dry season strong stand scale transpiration t stand and evapotranspiration et were observed in the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium with a large proportion more than 90 of et in precipitation p whereas the coniferous c lanceolata plantation possessed lower t stand and et but higher surface runoff indicating a water surplus for the water yield following the uneven distribution pattern of precipitation clear seasonal variation was observed for the ratio of et p that exceeded 1 during majority of the dry season the observed vigorous transpiration and the higher et p values of the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium plantations than those of the coniferous c lanceolata suggests that broadleaved plantations are more likely to pose a potential threat to the catchment water yield and water balance in this region however the c lanceolata which limited the water exchange between the atmosphere and plants is also considered to prevent its growth our findings quantified the hydrological effects of different plantations and will help to address the increasing water resource concerns related to the rapid expansion of plantations in hilly lands of south china keywords stand scale transpiration evapotranspiration hydrological effect subtropical plantations precipitation partition 1 introduction due to the population growth and urban development the area of native forest has experienced a considerable decline over the past decades cunningham et al 2015 negatively impacting the hydrology climate biodiversity and soils meyfroidt and lambin 2011 in this context reforestation has been regarded as an effective way of reducing surface runoff mitigating climate change and at the same time meeting the economical demands wichert et al 2018 chazdon and brancalion 2019 with the expansion of plantation public concerns have arisen regarding whether the reforestation would generate impacts on the regional water imbalance with subsequent consequences in reducing soil water storage and catchment water yields jackson et al 2005 ferraz et al 2019 beets beets 2020 numerous studies throughout the world have shown that reforestation can decrease the dry season runoff and annual water yield a global meta analysis of 504 catchment observations showed that streamflow was reduced after 20 years of reforestation jackson et al 2005 remote sensing data of long term hydrological response to reforestation indicated an increase in annual evapotranspiration et and an obvious decline in annual water yield from 1971 to 2009 in south china li et al 2014 however opposite hydrological effects of reforestation have also been reported a study conducted in southeastern china claimed that eucalyptus plantation did not significantly affect the local water supply lane et al 2004 another research in lower rainfall areas of australia 600 1000 mm year 1 where water is relatively limited showed no significant difference in stream flow between the agricultural lands and planted forests van dijk et al 2007 a recent study conducted in an area of argentina without water constraints indicated that replacement of native forests by pine plantations did not increase evapotranspiration et cristiano et al 2015 taken together it remains difficult to draw a general conclusion about the hydrological effects of forest plantations besides the difference in climate topography soil and vegetation the changes of hydrological parameters including et soil water storage capacity and surface runoff also play crucial roles in determining the hydrological processes several studies have addressed that the plantations could alter the patterns of et canopy interception iroumé and huber 2002 bonnesoeur et al 2019 runoff jiang et al 2019 and stream flow yields ferraz et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to quantify the change of regional water cycling and the associated hydrological parameters so as to better evaluate the hydrological effects of reforestation plant transpiration generally accounts for over 60 of et and returns about 39 of precipitation to the atmosphere at a global scale schlesinger and jasechko 2014 highlighting the crucial role of plants in regional water cycling and water balance due to the differences in water use patterns and biomass accumulation rates different tree species generally possess various transpiration rates and exert significant effects on soil evaporation therefore the choice of tree species for reforestation can noticeably influence the regional hydrological process jackson et al 2005 a review of 94 catchment studies showed that relative to the grasslands planting the deciduous hardwood forests caused a decrease of 25 mm in annual streamflow while planting the eucalyptus and pinus forests led to a decrease of about 40 mm bosch and hewlett 1982 field experimental data showed a decrease in water yield after converting the broadleaved forests to coniferous forests nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 also the modeling results further showed that the water recharge of broadleaf forests was higher than that of coniferous plantations because the latter had higher evaporation komatsu et al 2008 rosenqvist et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 furthermore precipitation partitioning in the plantations is known to considerably vary with the planted tree species vegetation with higher evapotranspiration usually results in falling groundwater levels and lower baseflow this is evident as several recent studies demonstrated a larger interception of precipitation and smaller surface runoff in evergreen coniferous forests canopies than those of broadleaf deciduous forests suggesting the evident hydrological effect of the deciduous leaf period on rainfall and runoff komatsu et al 2011 jiang et al 2019 china has the world s largest forest plantations with a total area of 69 million hm2 sfa data being an important forestry management model the plantation in the subtropical humid region accounts for 66 of the total forest area in china these subtropical plantations maintain high photosynthetic rates during majority of the year and have vigorous transpiration due to the relatively higher air temperatures even in the winter dry season cristiano et al 2015 characterized by high growth rate large water consumption and high sensitivity to environmental changes the effects of extensive plantations on hydrological processes in the subtropical region of china have been a major concern zheng et al 2008 zhou et al 2010 moreover a decreasing water supply during dry seasons was observed in subtropical china due to the unevenly distributed precipitation and increasing atmospheric evaporative demand song et al 2020 however previous studies on the impacts of different tree plantations on hydrological processes in south china mainly adopted the modeling methods to examine relationships between water cycling and vegetation li et al 2014 or were limited to the hydrologic effects of eucalyptus species zhou et al 2002 lane et al 2004 while field experimental observation remains scarce since the early 1980s guangdong province one of the most rapidly developing areas of south china has launched an ecological restoration campaign attempting to reforest the degraded hilly lands these plantations have played a prominent role in maintaining regional carbon balance addressing climate change and improving the local economy and environment to quantify the hydrological effects of different plantations at the stand scale especially in the subtropical areas that have been experiencing a climate change characterized with even wetter wet season and much more drier and prolonged dry season gao et al 2017 a field observation experiment was conducted in three types of plantations located in heshan county guangdong province south china the indigenous schima wallichii the introduced leguminous acacia mangium and the chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata were selected for this study they are common tree species and constitute the dominant plantations in the hilly lands of the studied area we hypothesized that 1 the evergreen broadleaved plantations consume more water than the coniferous plantation does and possess a higher et and 2 due to the unevenly distributed precipitation throughout the year and a lower water consumption the coniferous plantation can obtain more water yield especially in the relatively dry seasons our objectives were 1 to quantify the seasonal and inter annual variation of sap flow based stand scale water use of different plantations in hilly lands of subtropical china and 2 to assess the influences of different plantations on local water balance by quantifying the seasonal changes in the hydrological components such as the precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and soil water storage 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the field experiment sites are located in the heshan national field research station of forest ecosystem in the heshan county guangdong province china 22 41 n 112 54 e this area is characterized as a typical subtropical monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation in a range of 1700 1800 mm and mean annual temperature of about 19 c the precipitation is unevenly distributed throughout the year with more than 70 of the rainfall occurring in the wet season from april to september it receives less rainfall and is relatively cold and dry from october to march of the next year dry season detailed information was described in ouyang et al 2020 the experiment was conducted in plantations of s wallichii evergreen broadleaved species angiosperm a mangium evergreen broadleaved species angiosperm and c lanceolata coniferous species gymnosperm from january 2017 to december 2018 these plantations were planted in mid 1980 s and have been cleared of any human disturbance for almost 30 years in each plantation a permanent experimental plot was setup and designed for long term ecological research including plant community hydrological soil and water observations the three experimental plantations we selected are adjacent to each other and share similar elevation 80 m inclination 20 slope direction approximately southeast facing and soil properties the total experimental area of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata sites is 900 1600 and 900 m2 with the forest density of 867 519 and 725 trees per hectare respectively the soil type of the chosen stands is lateritic soil with topsoil 0 20 cm bulk densities ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 g cm 3 the soil organic matter total nitrogen n content total phosphorous p content and total potassium k of the three plantations were in a range of 34 02 44 03 g kg 1 1 48 1 87 g kg 1 0 18 0 33 g kg 1 and 15 86 36 65 g kg 1 respectively the soils of the three plots shared similar soil porosity 44 2 45 4 and field water holding capacity 29 2 30 1 additionally the s wallichii and a mangium sites possessed similar soil saturated moisture values 61 1 and 63 8 respectively slightly higher than that of c lanceolata site 54 6 detailed information of the site condition is displayed in table 1 2 2 meteorological parameters soil water content and leaf area index the air temperature t relative humidity rh photosynthetically active radiation par and precipitation p were measured using an automatic weather station vaisala maws301 vaisala espoo finland from january in 2017 to december in 2018 the station was located at an open site within 100 m from the experiment sites we calculated vapor pressure deficit vpd using the relative humidity and air

soil moisture values were output directly and recorded by a755 gprs adcon klosterneuburg austria the calibration equation to convert the probe readings into soil moisture values is θ 0 109 ε r 0 179 where θ is moisture εr is the real dielectric permittivity we randomly selected three locations to install the sensors within every experimental plot and the distance between the sensors and the surrounding trees was about 1 2 m for the s wallichii and c lanceolata sites the vwc measurements were conducted at depths of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 120 and 150 cm respectively the vwc of a mangium plantation were measured at depths of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 110 cm respectively because its soil layer is somehow shallower a bit deeper than 110 cm for each plantation 10 15 sample points within the experimental stand were randomly measured using an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne to derive the monthly leaf area indices lai following the standard protocol rosenqvist et al 2010 2 3 sap flow and stand scale transpiration for each experimental site we randomly selected fifteen trees of various sizes for the sap flux density measurements tree height h and diameter at the breast height dbh of the sampled trees are summarized in table 2 we applied thermal dissipation probe method to measure sap flow and the detailed information was described in ouyang et al 2020 the sap flux density j s g h2o m 2 s 1 was calculated according to the following equation granier 1987 2 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where δt m is the maximum temperature difference under zero flux conditions and δt is the instantaneous temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes sap flow readings were averaged every ten minutes and recorded by the delta t data loggers dl2e delta t devices ltd cambridge uk here we used the consistent relationships for angiosperm and gymnosperm trees summarized by pataki et al 2011 to take into account the radial variation in j s with sapwood depth when scaling up j s to whole tree transpiration 3 j i j o 1 033 exp 0 5 x 0 09963 0 4263 2 angiosperm 4 j i j o 1 257 exp 0 5 x 0 3724 0 6620 2 gymnosperm where j i j o is the ratio of sap flux at the actual sapwood depth of i to the outermost 2 cm sapwood depth and x is the relative sapwood depth after obtaining the actual mean sap flux density j s we calculated the whole tree transpiration by multiplying the mean sap flux density by the sapwood area t r j s a s g s 1 accordingly we separately applied the eq 3 to the s wallichii and a mangium and the eq 4 to the c lanceolata trees the daily average sap flow of the individual tree was scaled up to obtain the transpiration at a stand scale t stand mm day 1 by the following four steps firstly the sapwood area a s and aboveground biomass b were calculated by the allometric equations we felled five to seven selected trees that grew outside of but close to the experimental plots for each tree species and measured their dbh h a s and b then used simple least squares regressions to establish allometric equations listed in table 2 secondly whole tree transpiration was estimated by multiplying the j s derived from eqs 3 or 4 with the a s and the corresponding b value for every tree was calculated by the allometric equations thirdly once the relationship between t r and b of every monitored tree was established we applied it to obtain the whole tree transpiration of those unmonitored trees fourthly the monthly water use of all trees in the experimental plots was summed and divided by the canopy projected ground area a m2 to obtain the monthly stand transpiration t stand mm 2 4 rainfall partitioning and water balance surface runoff sr was monitored at three bounded monitoring subplots each experimental subplot is approximately 200 m2 in size 10 m wide 20 m slope length for each subplot the subplots were bordered with a plastic sheet inserted between the soil matrix to prevent the outside water from penetrating into the subplots the plastic sheet surrounding the subplot was 0 3 m in height the soil water storage sws was calculated according to he et al 2009 as follows sws mm σ vwc i h i 10 100 where vwc i mm is the volumetric water content at soil layer i h i is the height of soil layer i cm many trees were blown down by the super typhoon mangkhut on september 16 2018 taking advantage of these fallen trees we measured the root depths of each species which were in the range of 50 60 cm 80 100 cm and 40 60 cm for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolate respectively with the help of two wells at the bottom of the hill slope near our experimental sites for long term observations of the groundwater level we measured the depth of groundwater which fluctuated at about 1 5 m over an annual cycle the average depth of the groundwater level were 1 45 m and 1 32 m in year 2017 and 2018 respectively since our experimental sites lie on the hillside with approximately 10 m higher than the observation wells this lead to a relatively far distance between the tree root system and the groundwater table and thus these plantation trees are unlikely to rely on the groundwater for their growth additionally the averaged soil field capacity was observed to be generally higher than the averaged swc in the root zone table 1 and fig 3 these taken together i e the soil layer is thicker than root depths the root system is unlikely to access the groundwater and the soil field capacity is higher than the actual swc in the root zone suggest that the water leaking l from the bottom of the root zone directly to the water table aquifer and water recharge r from the groundwater to the root zone could be ignored chen et al 2004 allen et al 1998 therefore according to the water balance equation p et sr sws where the sws is the difference of sws between any two different periods the stand et can finally be obtained by subtracting sr and sws from the precipitation 2 5 statistical analysis to establish and compare the correlations between whole tree transpiration and par and p the linear model was operated in origin 16 0 tukey s post hoc test with one way anova was used for analysis of vwc values at depth of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm 110 cm for a mangium among three species respectively the homogeneity of regression slopes and the analysis of covariance were performed in spss 16 0 software package spss inc usa to check the difference in regressions for three plantations differences between the treatments were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 due to power or probe failure the missing of data is a common problem when conducting sap flow studies over long period of time to fill the data gaps we established linear or exponential saturation regressions using the available data of sap flux density and par for each tree within each month and then obtained the missing data from the corresponding par values based on the established regression equations 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions clear seasonal trends were observed for the monitored meteorological parameters fig 1 annual averaged temperature was 20 6 in 2017 and 22 1 in 2018 with the hottest and coldest month being in august and january respectively the wet season from april to september usually possessed high monthly averaged rh higher than 85 and the minimum rh usually occurred in winter with values of 60 8 and 70 in 2017 and 2018 respectively the monthly averaged par during the whole experimental period ranged from 8 16 march in 2017 to 28 54 mol m 2 d 1 august in 2017 annual averaged par of year 2017 was 17 02 mol m 2 d 1 almost identical to that of year 2018 17 27 mol m 2 d 1 different monthly mean vpd was observed between wet april september and dry october march of the next year seasons and the monthly mean vpd reached the highest value in october 2018 0 73 kpa and the lowest in march 2017 0 23 kpa the total annual precipitation was 1673 2 mm in year 2017 and 1787 7 mm in 2018 the precipitation was unevenly distributed and occurred mainly in the wet season that accounted for more than 77 of the annual total fig 2 due to the failure of sensors the soil moisture data from january to may in 2017 are intermittently missing the vwc values at ten different depths for the three stands were shown in fig 3 here we performed the statistical analysis of vwcs selectively at the depth of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm 110 cm in the case of a mangium representing shallow middle and deep soil layers to compare the site dependent changes of vwc generally vwc values of c lanceolatain were significantly higher than those of s wallichii and a mangium in the dry season p 0 05 while the three stands shared similar vwc in the wet season for s wallichii and c lanceolata vwc values at depth of 120 cm were significantly lower than those of top 30 cm and middle 60 cm soils in year 2017 while from may 2018 to later there was no significant difference in vwc at different depths for s wallichii except for the wintertime vwc values of a mangium stand showed no significant difference among different soil depths p 0 05 the s wallichii and a mangium stands showed a clear temporal change in vwc with relatively higher values occurring in the wet season and lower values in the dry season the vwcs of c lanceolata stand however remained relatively stable during the whole experimental period 3 2 stand scale transpiration the total stand scale transpiration t stand in the three stands showed species dependence and large temporal differences fig 4 compared to the s wallichii and a mangium the c lanceolata transpired much less water with monthly t stand values ranging from 3 5 mm to 16 7 mm during the whole experimental period t stand values of s wallichii were generally higher than those of a mangium in the wet season but both showed comparable t stand during the dry season following the seasonal change of precipitation and vwc the vigorous transpiration mainly occurred in the wet season accounting for more than 60 of the annual total the largest t stand values were observed in june for both years with values of 104 7 mm 48 5 mm and 11 9 mm in 2017 and 118 4 mm 35 0 mm and 11 7 mm in 2018 for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata respectively the dry season usually possessed lower water transpiration during which the minimum t stand values of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata were 26 6 mm 20 4 mm and 3 5 mm in 2017 and 22 2 mm 21 8 mm and 3 7 mm in 2018 respectively annual total t stand of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata in 2017 was 674 mm 560 mm and 105 mm respectively which were relatively higher than those 560 mm 407 mm and 91 mm respectively in 2018 the t stand presented significant linear relationships with par and p with the correlation coefficient r 2 ranging from 0 42 to 063 fig 5 p 0 05 generally the slopes of fitted lines for s wallichii and a mangium were significantly higher than those for the c lanceolata p 0 05 3 3 soil water storage surface runoff and evapotranspiration attributed to the shallower soil layer the sws of a mangium stand 187 322 mm was much lower than that of s wallichii and c lanceolata stands fig 6a during the whole experimental period the soil layer of c lanceolata stand had the largest water storage capacity with sws values ranging from 360 mm to 460 mm the three stands shared similar temporal changes i e sws was higher in the wet season and then decreased in the dry season and the monthly values were relatively higher in 2018 than in 2017 for all three stands a clear difference in surface runoff sr was observed among the three stands fig 6b annual total sr of c lanceolata stand was 152 mm in 2017 and 354 mm in 2018 respectively much higher than that of the other two species 61 6 mm and 60 3 mm in 2017 and 53 4 mm and 112 mm in 2018 respectively for s wallichii and a mangium stands as determined by the seasonal distribution of precipitation the sr was usually higher in the wet season and that of c lanceolata stand noticeably reached the highest value 194 mm in june of 2018 according to the water balance equation we calculated the stand evapotranspiration fig 6c because the data were incomplete in 2017 we can only calculate the annual total et in 2018 which was 1718 mm 1685 mm and 1423 mm for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata stands respectively similarly et values were generally higher in the wet season and in 2018 than in 2017 under the same calendar month the three stands shared similar et in the wintertime while for majority of the wet season the c lanceolata stand possessed relatively lower et values than the s wallichii and a mangium stands did 3 4 ratios of e t et e t p and et p to compare the relationships between transpiration evapotranspiration and precipitation of different plantation types we calculated the ratios of t stand et t stand p and et p in july and november the two months represent the wet and dry season table 3 results showed that the tree transpiration accounted for a relatively higher proportion of evapotranspiration and precipitation in the dry season as indicated by the higher values of t stand et and t stand p except for the c lanceolata in 2018 with higher t stand both broad leaved tree stands contributed significantly more transpiration to evapotranspiration than the coniferous tree stand and used most of the precipitation in the dry season to maintain the water use the t stand values of broad leaved trees have even exceeded the precipitation in november 2018 the uneven distribution of precipitation led to a large variation in the seasonal et p dryness index di generally the di values were lower than 1 in july and higher than 1 in november for the year 2018 those di values higher than 1 resulted from zero or very little precipitation indicated a potential seasonal drought during dry season though the annual total et was unavailable in 2017 due to data missing the annual total et of the two broad leaved stands in 2018 confirmed that the stand evapotranspiration was close to the annual total precipitation 1787 7 mm this further proved that the stand water consumption exhausted the precipitation and less water could be stored 3 5 leaf area index stand lai varied seasonally for all three species fig 7 higher lai values usually occurred in the wet season during the whole experimental period the ranges of lai for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata were 1 40 3 90 m2 m 2 1 25 2 86 m2 m 2 and 0 82 2 02 m2 m 2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 stand transpiration and evapotranspiration of different plantations precipitation is the primary hydrological input to forest ecosystems and largely determines the vegetation growth and water use patterns that consequently affect the hydrological processes liu et al 2019 this study observed significant linear relationships between the monthly t stand and p for the three plantations fig 5 p 0 05 indicating the crucial role of the amount of precipitation in affecting stand transpiration similarly the changing par partly explained the temporal variation of t stand chen et al 2014 as supported by the linear relationships between the monthly t stand and par expectedly with higher par during the summertime and the early stage of dry season october the trees transpired more water it has also been demonstrated that water consumption of different tree species may respond differently to the environmental variations considering that the three tree species have comparable age about 25 30 years the significantly higher regression slope between t stand and par of s wallichii 3 24 suggested a relatively higher and stable water use for this indigenous tree species being a broadleaved species the a mangium had however a relatively lower t stand par linear slope 1 68 this is possibly because the a mangium have nitrogen fixing root nodules and most of their fine roots are distributed in the shallow soil layer leading to a less vigorous transpiration the coniferous c lanceolata had a much lower slope 0 54 and less transpiration even in the wet season when there were plenty of radiation and precipitation indicating that the c lanceolata plays a weak role in the dynamic process of water exchange under the current environment our results showed that the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium possessed much higher et than the coniferous c lanceolata did differing from numerous paired catchment studies which reported generally lower annual et of broadleaved forests than that of coniferous forests nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 the contrary conclusions can be attributed to the different climate conditions and tree species examined in different studies most of the previous studies were conducted in the broadleaved deciduous forests and under the temperate climate with high winter precipitation on the contrary the examined s wallichii and a mangium in this study are evergreen broadleaved species and precipitation in the study region is distinctly high in summertime but low in wintertime additionally as an important component of et tree transpiration is the most variable parameter and profoundly affects et and the water exchange between the atmosphere and plants previous studies usually assumed that the annual transpiration does not differ greatly between the broadleaved and coniferous forests however the t stand of s wallichii and a mangium was much higher than that of c lanceolate similar to our results another study conducted in a low latitude moist area in south africa also showed that the annual et of broadleaved eucalyptus forests was higher than that of pine plantations scott lesch 1997 since the studied three tree species are evergreen in our study the differences in forest structure and interception could be responsible for the different et we observed komatsu et al 2011 the s wallichii possessed the largest lai values during the whole experimental period which were almost twice those of c lanceolata fig 7 indicating that s wallichii had a better interception that contributed to the annual et 4 2 hydrological impact for different plantations precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration are the primary input and output pathways of the forest ecosystem studies have reported that the change in regional water yield is mainly due to the change of et li et al 2014 cristiano et al 2015 among the components of water balance the annual et of s wallichii and a mangium accounted for over 90 of total p which was similar to the values reported by almeida et al 2007 in a warm annually averaged t 20 c region of brazil the average et of eucalyptus plantation comprised 95 of the water input to the catchment over the full rotation almeida et al 2007 despite having similar climate conditions as in our studied region another study performed in south china leizhou peninsula reported a smaller proportion of et in p 60 70 of eucalyptus plantation lane et al 2004 the different results could be attributed to the different precipitation and lai values as suggested by a comparison of the stand transpiration and forest structure between lane et al 2004 and our study compared to our study lane et al 2004 reported a higher annual runoff of eucalyptus plantation due to the very sparse understory resulted from continuous human disturbance they also reported lower lai values range from 1 0 to 1 5 indicating less canopy interception the higher annual runoff and lower lai values consequently lead to a relatively lower et in lane et al 2004 water balance is also strongly influenced by the tree species selected for afforestation previous studies stated a stronger decrease in the annual stream for coniferous vegetation than for the hardwood forests rosenqvist et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 they attributed the lower water recharge of coniferous stands to the greater interception evaporation in these coniferous stands than in hardwood stands since the selected hardwood species were deciduous species however as discussed above compared with the c lanceolata the evergreen broadleaved forest with higher lai could intercept more precipitation for evapotranspiration moreover the observed annual runoff of the c lanceolata plantation was 9 7 and 19 8 of the precipitation respectively which were higher than that of the other two plantations 3 2 6 9 this may suggest that a higher proportion of precipitation could be involved in the water yield li et al 2014 the ratio of et p was an important indicator for evaluating hydrological impact creed et al 2014 the ratio below 1 indicates a humid energy limited condition whereas ratio greater than 1 indicates a dry and water limited catchment though streamflow data were not available in our study the seasonal variations in et p could provide a perspective to evaluate the effect of the three plantations on regional water balance due to the unevenly distributed precipitation the et p of s wallichii and a mangium in the wet season was lower than but close to 1 implying a balance between the input and output with smaller water surplus whereas the dry season e g in december could experience potentially severe drought as the stand et remained greater than 40 mm with no rain events yet high radiation goulden and bales 2013 proposed that the streamflow is highly sensitive to plantation expansion where a 28 increase in et across a watershed could lead to a 26 decrease in streamflow moreover the soil water content and water storage usually increased in the wet season and then significantly decreased in the dry season figs 3 and 6a this suggests that it will take more soil water to sustain trees transpiration and soil evaporation during the dry season when the temperature and par remained at a relatively high level in our studied region from this perspective s wallichii and a mangium plantations are likely to be less favorable for the water balance in this region and more susceptible to the varied precipitation 4 3 implications for balancing the environmental benefits of plantations vegetation reforestation means various potential compromises between timber production water yields and biodiversity cunningham et al 2015 plantations of different tree species can definitely cause diverse changes in water yields jackson et al 2005 no single type of plantation can meet economic and environmental needs simultaneously but forest reforestation should attempt to maximize the benefits climate change in south china is likely to decrease the regional water supply due to the changes in precipitation patterns and increases the vpd and mean annual temperature zhou et al 2010 our results suggested that the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium generally have strong demand for water consumption and stand evaporation consequently limiting the supply of soil moisture groundwater and river runoff benefiting from the lower stand evapotranspiration the c lanceolata plantation is expected to increase water yield but at the cost of slow growth further the occurrence of extreme rainfall events will increase the surface runoff of c lanceolata plantation which is detrimental to soil water conservation given the changing climate and the expected increase in reforestation forest managers will face the problem of balancing timber production against the demand for water resources from a long term perspective our study to some extent quantified the hydrological effect of common plantations in south china further study should develop quantitative models at a larger space time scale to reveal how reforestation affects the structure function and interactions of plantations and local ecohydrological environment 5 conclusions we monitored the sap flow based transpiration and investigated the water balance and hydrological effect of three typical plantations in south china following the seasonal variations in precipitation and par monthly stand scale transpiration values were higher in the wet season than in the dry season with the transpiration from may to august accounting for about 47 65 of the annual total compared to the coniferous c lanceolata the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium generally presented a stronger tree transpiration and stand evapotranspiration it should be noticed that the et accounted for more than 90 of the precipitation and most of the et p values exceeded 1 in the dry season for s wallichii and a mangium plantations attributed to the relatively lower et the c lanceolata had higher surface runoff and soil water storage than the other two broadleaved plantations the difference in the hydrological parameters between the broadleaved and coniferous forests can be attributed to the different leaf phenology and forest structure such as the leaf area index values characterized by higher lai the evergreen broadleaved plantations have the advantage in canopy interception and thus decreasing the surface runoff our results highlighted the negative effect of s wallichii and a mangium plantations on local water yield and streamflow and suggested that the current climate models in south china might need to intensify the surface runoff of the c lanceolata plantation and decrease its adaptability due to the lower transpiration and tree growth declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

10089,quantifying the water use effects of tree plantations on regional hydrological processes is vitally important for evaluating the reforestation strategies related to a sustainable use of water resources we conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the precipitation partitioning and hydrological effect of three different plantations schima wallichii acacia mangium and cunninghamia lanceolata by monitoring sap flow and using a water balance equation during a two year period from january 2017 to december 2018 in hilly lands of south china owing to the abundant precipitation and radiation both monthly stand scale transpiration and evapotranspiration of the tree plantations were higher in the wet season than in the dry season strong stand scale transpiration t stand and evapotranspiration et were observed in the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium with a large proportion more than 90 of et in precipitation p whereas the coniferous c lanceolata plantation possessed lower t stand and et but higher surface runoff indicating a water surplus for the water yield following the uneven distribution pattern of precipitation clear seasonal variation was observed for the ratio of et p that exceeded 1 during majority of the dry season the observed vigorous transpiration and the higher et p values of the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium plantations than those of the coniferous c lanceolata suggests that broadleaved plantations are more likely to pose a potential threat to the catchment water yield and water balance in this region however the c lanceolata which limited the water exchange between the atmosphere and plants is also considered to prevent its growth our findings quantified the hydrological effects of different plantations and will help to address the increasing water resource concerns related to the rapid expansion of plantations in hilly lands of south china keywords stand scale transpiration evapotranspiration hydrological effect subtropical plantations precipitation partition 1 introduction due to the population growth and urban development the area of native forest has experienced a considerable decline over the past decades cunningham et al 2015 negatively impacting the hydrology climate biodiversity and soils meyfroidt and lambin 2011 in this context reforestation has been regarded as an effective way of reducing surface runoff mitigating climate change and at the same time meeting the economical demands wichert et al 2018 chazdon and brancalion 2019 with the expansion of plantation public concerns have arisen regarding whether the reforestation would generate impacts on the regional water imbalance with subsequent consequences in reducing soil water storage and catchment water yields jackson et al 2005 ferraz et al 2019 beets beets 2020 numerous studies throughout the world have shown that reforestation can decrease the dry season runoff and annual water yield a global meta analysis of 504 catchment observations showed that streamflow was reduced after 20 years of reforestation jackson et al 2005 remote sensing data of long term hydrological response to reforestation indicated an increase in annual evapotranspiration et and an obvious decline in annual water yield from 1971 to 2009 in south china li et al 2014 however opposite hydrological effects of reforestation have also been reported a study conducted in southeastern china claimed that eucalyptus plantation did not significantly affect the local water supply lane et al 2004 another research in lower rainfall areas of australia 600 1000 mm year 1 where water is relatively limited showed no significant difference in stream flow between the agricultural lands and planted forests van dijk et al 2007 a recent study conducted in an area of argentina without water constraints indicated that replacement of native forests by pine plantations did not increase evapotranspiration et cristiano et al 2015 taken together it remains difficult to draw a general conclusion about the hydrological effects of forest plantations besides the difference in climate topography soil and vegetation the changes of hydrological parameters including et soil water storage capacity and surface runoff also play crucial roles in determining the hydrological processes several studies have addressed that the plantations could alter the patterns of et canopy interception iroumé and huber 2002 bonnesoeur et al 2019 runoff jiang et al 2019 and stream flow yields ferraz et al 2019 therefore it is necessary to quantify the change of regional water cycling and the associated hydrological parameters so as to better evaluate the hydrological effects of reforestation plant transpiration generally accounts for over 60 of et and returns about 39 of precipitation to the atmosphere at a global scale schlesinger and jasechko 2014 highlighting the crucial role of plants in regional water cycling and water balance due to the differences in water use patterns and biomass accumulation rates different tree species generally possess various transpiration rates and exert significant effects on soil evaporation therefore the choice of tree species for reforestation can noticeably influence the regional hydrological process jackson et al 2005 a review of 94 catchment studies showed that relative to the grasslands planting the deciduous hardwood forests caused a decrease of 25 mm in annual streamflow while planting the eucalyptus and pinus forests led to a decrease of about 40 mm bosch and hewlett 1982 field experimental data showed a decrease in water yield after converting the broadleaved forests to coniferous forests nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 also the modeling results further showed that the water recharge of broadleaf forests was higher than that of coniferous plantations because the latter had higher evaporation komatsu et al 2008 rosenqvist et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 furthermore precipitation partitioning in the plantations is known to considerably vary with the planted tree species vegetation with higher evapotranspiration usually results in falling groundwater levels and lower baseflow this is evident as several recent studies demonstrated a larger interception of precipitation and smaller surface runoff in evergreen coniferous forests canopies than those of broadleaf deciduous forests suggesting the evident hydrological effect of the deciduous leaf period on rainfall and runoff komatsu et al 2011 jiang et al 2019 china has the world s largest forest plantations with a total area of 69 million hm2 sfa data being an important forestry management model the plantation in the subtropical humid region accounts for 66 of the total forest area in china these subtropical plantations maintain high photosynthetic rates during majority of the year and have vigorous transpiration due to the relatively higher air temperatures even in the winter dry season cristiano et al 2015 characterized by high growth rate large water consumption and high sensitivity to environmental changes the effects of extensive plantations on hydrological processes in the subtropical region of china have been a major concern zheng et al 2008 zhou et al 2010 moreover a decreasing water supply during dry seasons was observed in subtropical china due to the unevenly distributed precipitation and increasing atmospheric evaporative demand song et al 2020 however previous studies on the impacts of different tree plantations on hydrological processes in south china mainly adopted the modeling methods to examine relationships between water cycling and vegetation li et al 2014 or were limited to the hydrologic effects of eucalyptus species zhou et al 2002 lane et al 2004 while field experimental observation remains scarce since the early 1980s guangdong province one of the most rapidly developing areas of south china has launched an ecological restoration campaign attempting to reforest the degraded hilly lands these plantations have played a prominent role in maintaining regional carbon balance addressing climate change and improving the local economy and environment to quantify the hydrological effects of different plantations at the stand scale especially in the subtropical areas that have been experiencing a climate change characterized with even wetter wet season and much more drier and prolonged dry season gao et al 2017 a field observation experiment was conducted in three types of plantations located in heshan county guangdong province south china the indigenous schima wallichii the introduced leguminous acacia mangium and the chinese fir cunninghamia lanceolata were selected for this study they are common tree species and constitute the dominant plantations in the hilly lands of the studied area we hypothesized that 1 the evergreen broadleaved plantations consume more water than the coniferous plantation does and possess a higher et and 2 due to the unevenly distributed precipitation throughout the year and a lower water consumption the coniferous plantation can obtain more water yield especially in the relatively dry seasons our objectives were 1 to quantify the seasonal and inter annual variation of sap flow based stand scale water use of different plantations in hilly lands of subtropical china and 2 to assess the influences of different plantations on local water balance by quantifying the seasonal changes in the hydrological components such as the precipitation evapotranspiration surface runoff and soil water storage 2 methods and materials 2 1 site description the field experiment sites are located in the heshan national field research station of forest ecosystem in the heshan county guangdong province china 22 41 n 112 54 e this area is characterized as a typical subtropical monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation in a range of 1700 1800 mm and mean annual temperature of about 19 c the precipitation is unevenly distributed throughout the year with more than 70 of the rainfall occurring in the wet season from april to september it receives less rainfall and is relatively cold and dry from october to march of the next year dry season detailed information was described in ouyang et al 2020 the experiment was conducted in plantations of s wallichii evergreen broadleaved species angiosperm a mangium evergreen broadleaved species angiosperm and c lanceolata coniferous species gymnosperm from january 2017 to december 2018 these plantations were planted in mid 1980 s and have been cleared of any human disturbance for almost 30 years in each plantation a permanent experimental plot was setup and designed for long term ecological research including plant community hydrological soil and water observations the three experimental plantations we selected are adjacent to each other and share similar elevation 80 m inclination 20 slope direction approximately southeast facing and soil properties the total experimental area of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata sites is 900 1600 and 900 m2 with the forest density of 867 519 and 725 trees per hectare respectively the soil type of the chosen stands is lateritic soil with topsoil 0 20 cm bulk densities ranging from 1 3 to 1 4 g cm 3 the soil organic matter total nitrogen n content total phosphorous p content and total potassium k of the three plantations were in a range of 34 02 44 03 g kg 1 1 48 1 87 g kg 1 0 18 0 33 g kg 1 and 15 86 36 65 g kg 1 respectively the soils of the three plots shared similar soil porosity 44 2 45 4 and field water holding capacity 29 2 30 1 additionally the s wallichii and a mangium sites possessed similar soil saturated moisture values 61 1 and 63 8 respectively slightly higher than that of c lanceolata site 54 6 detailed information of the site condition is displayed in table 1 2 2 meteorological parameters soil water content and leaf area index the air temperature t relative humidity rh photosynthetically active radiation par and precipitation p were measured using an automatic weather station vaisala maws301 vaisala espoo finland from january in 2017 to december in 2018 the station was located at an open site within 100 m from the experiment sites we calculated vapor pressure deficit vpd using the relative humidity and air

soil moisture values were output directly and recorded by a755 gprs adcon klosterneuburg austria the calibration equation to convert the probe readings into soil moisture values is θ 0 109 ε r 0 179 where θ is moisture εr is the real dielectric permittivity we randomly selected three locations to install the sensors within every experimental plot and the distance between the sensors and the surrounding trees was about 1 2 m for the s wallichii and c lanceolata sites the vwc measurements were conducted at depths of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 90 120 and 150 cm respectively the vwc of a mangium plantation were measured at depths of 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 110 cm respectively because its soil layer is somehow shallower a bit deeper than 110 cm for each plantation 10 15 sample points within the experimental stand were randomly measured using an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc lincoln ne to derive the monthly leaf area indices lai following the standard protocol rosenqvist et al 2010 2 3 sap flow and stand scale transpiration for each experimental site we randomly selected fifteen trees of various sizes for the sap flux density measurements tree height h and diameter at the breast height dbh of the sampled trees are summarized in table 2 we applied thermal dissipation probe method to measure sap flow and the detailed information was described in ouyang et al 2020 the sap flux density j s g h2o m 2 s 1 was calculated according to the following equation granier 1987 2 j s 119 δ t m δ t δ t 1 231 where δt m is the maximum temperature difference under zero flux conditions and δt is the instantaneous temperature difference between the heated and the unheated probes sap flow readings were averaged every ten minutes and recorded by the delta t data loggers dl2e delta t devices ltd cambridge uk here we used the consistent relationships for angiosperm and gymnosperm trees summarized by pataki et al 2011 to take into account the radial variation in j s with sapwood depth when scaling up j s to whole tree transpiration 3 j i j o 1 033 exp 0 5 x 0 09963 0 4263 2 angiosperm 4 j i j o 1 257 exp 0 5 x 0 3724 0 6620 2 gymnosperm where j i j o is the ratio of sap flux at the actual sapwood depth of i to the outermost 2 cm sapwood depth and x is the relative sapwood depth after obtaining the actual mean sap flux density j s we calculated the whole tree transpiration by multiplying the mean sap flux density by the sapwood area t r j s a s g s 1 accordingly we separately applied the eq 3 to the s wallichii and a mangium and the eq 4 to the c lanceolata trees the daily average sap flow of the individual tree was scaled up to obtain the transpiration at a stand scale t stand mm day 1 by the following four steps firstly the sapwood area a s and aboveground biomass b were calculated by the allometric equations we felled five to seven selected trees that grew outside of but close to the experimental plots for each tree species and measured their dbh h a s and b then used simple least squares regressions to establish allometric equations listed in table 2 secondly whole tree transpiration was estimated by multiplying the j s derived from eqs 3 or 4 with the a s and the corresponding b value for every tree was calculated by the allometric equations thirdly once the relationship between t r and b of every monitored tree was established we applied it to obtain the whole tree transpiration of those unmonitored trees fourthly the monthly water use of all trees in the experimental plots was summed and divided by the canopy projected ground area a m2 to obtain the monthly stand transpiration t stand mm 2 4 rainfall partitioning and water balance surface runoff sr was monitored at three bounded monitoring subplots each experimental subplot is approximately 200 m2 in size 10 m wide 20 m slope length for each subplot the subplots were bordered with a plastic sheet inserted between the soil matrix to prevent the outside water from penetrating into the subplots the plastic sheet surrounding the subplot was 0 3 m in height the soil water storage sws was calculated according to he et al 2009 as follows sws mm σ vwc i h i 10 100 where vwc i mm is the volumetric water content at soil layer i h i is the height of soil layer i cm many trees were blown down by the super typhoon mangkhut on september 16 2018 taking advantage of these fallen trees we measured the root depths of each species which were in the range of 50 60 cm 80 100 cm and 40 60 cm for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolate respectively with the help of two wells at the bottom of the hill slope near our experimental sites for long term observations of the groundwater level we measured the depth of groundwater which fluctuated at about 1 5 m over an annual cycle the average depth of the groundwater level were 1 45 m and 1 32 m in year 2017 and 2018 respectively since our experimental sites lie on the hillside with approximately 10 m higher than the observation wells this lead to a relatively far distance between the tree root system and the groundwater table and thus these plantation trees are unlikely to rely on the groundwater for their growth additionally the averaged soil field capacity was observed to be generally higher than the averaged swc in the root zone table 1 and fig 3 these taken together i e the soil layer is thicker than root depths the root system is unlikely to access the groundwater and the soil field capacity is higher than the actual swc in the root zone suggest that the water leaking l from the bottom of the root zone directly to the water table aquifer and water recharge r from the groundwater to the root zone could be ignored chen et al 2004 allen et al 1998 therefore according to the water balance equation p et sr sws where the sws is the difference of sws between any two different periods the stand et can finally be obtained by subtracting sr and sws from the precipitation 2 5 statistical analysis to establish and compare the correlations between whole tree transpiration and par and p the linear model was operated in origin 16 0 tukey s post hoc test with one way anova was used for analysis of vwc values at depth of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm 110 cm for a mangium among three species respectively the homogeneity of regression slopes and the analysis of covariance were performed in spss 16 0 software package spss inc usa to check the difference in regressions for three plantations differences between the treatments were considered statistically significant at p 0 05 due to power or probe failure the missing of data is a common problem when conducting sap flow studies over long period of time to fill the data gaps we established linear or exponential saturation regressions using the available data of sap flux density and par for each tree within each month and then obtained the missing data from the corresponding par values based on the established regression equations 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions clear seasonal trends were observed for the monitored meteorological parameters fig 1 annual averaged temperature was 20 6 in 2017 and 22 1 in 2018 with the hottest and coldest month being in august and january respectively the wet season from april to september usually possessed high monthly averaged rh higher than 85 and the minimum rh usually occurred in winter with values of 60 8 and 70 in 2017 and 2018 respectively the monthly averaged par during the whole experimental period ranged from 8 16 march in 2017 to 28 54 mol m 2 d 1 august in 2017 annual averaged par of year 2017 was 17 02 mol m 2 d 1 almost identical to that of year 2018 17 27 mol m 2 d 1 different monthly mean vpd was observed between wet april september and dry october march of the next year seasons and the monthly mean vpd reached the highest value in october 2018 0 73 kpa and the lowest in march 2017 0 23 kpa the total annual precipitation was 1673 2 mm in year 2017 and 1787 7 mm in 2018 the precipitation was unevenly distributed and occurred mainly in the wet season that accounted for more than 77 of the annual total fig 2 due to the failure of sensors the soil moisture data from january to may in 2017 are intermittently missing the vwc values at ten different depths for the three stands were shown in fig 3 here we performed the statistical analysis of vwcs selectively at the depth of 30 cm 60 cm and 120 cm 110 cm in the case of a mangium representing shallow middle and deep soil layers to compare the site dependent changes of vwc generally vwc values of c lanceolatain were significantly higher than those of s wallichii and a mangium in the dry season p 0 05 while the three stands shared similar vwc in the wet season for s wallichii and c lanceolata vwc values at depth of 120 cm were significantly lower than those of top 30 cm and middle 60 cm soils in year 2017 while from may 2018 to later there was no significant difference in vwc at different depths for s wallichii except for the wintertime vwc values of a mangium stand showed no significant difference among different soil depths p 0 05 the s wallichii and a mangium stands showed a clear temporal change in vwc with relatively higher values occurring in the wet season and lower values in the dry season the vwcs of c lanceolata stand however remained relatively stable during the whole experimental period 3 2 stand scale transpiration the total stand scale transpiration t stand in the three stands showed species dependence and large temporal differences fig 4 compared to the s wallichii and a mangium the c lanceolata transpired much less water with monthly t stand values ranging from 3 5 mm to 16 7 mm during the whole experimental period t stand values of s wallichii were generally higher than those of a mangium in the wet season but both showed comparable t stand during the dry season following the seasonal change of precipitation and vwc the vigorous transpiration mainly occurred in the wet season accounting for more than 60 of the annual total the largest t stand values were observed in june for both years with values of 104 7 mm 48 5 mm and 11 9 mm in 2017 and 118 4 mm 35 0 mm and 11 7 mm in 2018 for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata respectively the dry season usually possessed lower water transpiration during which the minimum t stand values of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata were 26 6 mm 20 4 mm and 3 5 mm in 2017 and 22 2 mm 21 8 mm and 3 7 mm in 2018 respectively annual total t stand of s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata in 2017 was 674 mm 560 mm and 105 mm respectively which were relatively higher than those 560 mm 407 mm and 91 mm respectively in 2018 the t stand presented significant linear relationships with par and p with the correlation coefficient r 2 ranging from 0 42 to 063 fig 5 p 0 05 generally the slopes of fitted lines for s wallichii and a mangium were significantly higher than those for the c lanceolata p 0 05 3 3 soil water storage surface runoff and evapotranspiration attributed to the shallower soil layer the sws of a mangium stand 187 322 mm was much lower than that of s wallichii and c lanceolata stands fig 6a during the whole experimental period the soil layer of c lanceolata stand had the largest water storage capacity with sws values ranging from 360 mm to 460 mm the three stands shared similar temporal changes i e sws was higher in the wet season and then decreased in the dry season and the monthly values were relatively higher in 2018 than in 2017 for all three stands a clear difference in surface runoff sr was observed among the three stands fig 6b annual total sr of c lanceolata stand was 152 mm in 2017 and 354 mm in 2018 respectively much higher than that of the other two species 61 6 mm and 60 3 mm in 2017 and 53 4 mm and 112 mm in 2018 respectively for s wallichii and a mangium stands as determined by the seasonal distribution of precipitation the sr was usually higher in the wet season and that of c lanceolata stand noticeably reached the highest value 194 mm in june of 2018 according to the water balance equation we calculated the stand evapotranspiration fig 6c because the data were incomplete in 2017 we can only calculate the annual total et in 2018 which was 1718 mm 1685 mm and 1423 mm for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata stands respectively similarly et values were generally higher in the wet season and in 2018 than in 2017 under the same calendar month the three stands shared similar et in the wintertime while for majority of the wet season the c lanceolata stand possessed relatively lower et values than the s wallichii and a mangium stands did 3 4 ratios of e t et e t p and et p to compare the relationships between transpiration evapotranspiration and precipitation of different plantation types we calculated the ratios of t stand et t stand p and et p in july and november the two months represent the wet and dry season table 3 results showed that the tree transpiration accounted for a relatively higher proportion of evapotranspiration and precipitation in the dry season as indicated by the higher values of t stand et and t stand p except for the c lanceolata in 2018 with higher t stand both broad leaved tree stands contributed significantly more transpiration to evapotranspiration than the coniferous tree stand and used most of the precipitation in the dry season to maintain the water use the t stand values of broad leaved trees have even exceeded the precipitation in november 2018 the uneven distribution of precipitation led to a large variation in the seasonal et p dryness index di generally the di values were lower than 1 in july and higher than 1 in november for the year 2018 those di values higher than 1 resulted from zero or very little precipitation indicated a potential seasonal drought during dry season though the annual total et was unavailable in 2017 due to data missing the annual total et of the two broad leaved stands in 2018 confirmed that the stand evapotranspiration was close to the annual total precipitation 1787 7 mm this further proved that the stand water consumption exhausted the precipitation and less water could be stored 3 5 leaf area index stand lai varied seasonally for all three species fig 7 higher lai values usually occurred in the wet season during the whole experimental period the ranges of lai for s wallichii a mangium and c lanceolata were 1 40 3 90 m2 m 2 1 25 2 86 m2 m 2 and 0 82 2 02 m2 m 2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 stand transpiration and evapotranspiration of different plantations precipitation is the primary hydrological input to forest ecosystems and largely determines the vegetation growth and water use patterns that consequently affect the hydrological processes liu et al 2019 this study observed significant linear relationships between the monthly t stand and p for the three plantations fig 5 p 0 05 indicating the crucial role of the amount of precipitation in affecting stand transpiration similarly the changing par partly explained the temporal variation of t stand chen et al 2014 as supported by the linear relationships between the monthly t stand and par expectedly with higher par during the summertime and the early stage of dry season october the trees transpired more water it has also been demonstrated that water consumption of different tree species may respond differently to the environmental variations considering that the three tree species have comparable age about 25 30 years the significantly higher regression slope between t stand and par of s wallichii 3 24 suggested a relatively higher and stable water use for this indigenous tree species being a broadleaved species the a mangium had however a relatively lower t stand par linear slope 1 68 this is possibly because the a mangium have nitrogen fixing root nodules and most of their fine roots are distributed in the shallow soil layer leading to a less vigorous transpiration the coniferous c lanceolata had a much lower slope 0 54 and less transpiration even in the wet season when there were plenty of radiation and precipitation indicating that the c lanceolata plays a weak role in the dynamic process of water exchange under the current environment our results showed that the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium possessed much higher et than the coniferous c lanceolata did differing from numerous paired catchment studies which reported generally lower annual et of broadleaved forests than that of coniferous forests nisbet 2005 komatsu et al 2008 the contrary conclusions can be attributed to the different climate conditions and tree species examined in different studies most of the previous studies were conducted in the broadleaved deciduous forests and under the temperate climate with high winter precipitation on the contrary the examined s wallichii and a mangium in this study are evergreen broadleaved species and precipitation in the study region is distinctly high in summertime but low in wintertime additionally as an important component of et tree transpiration is the most variable parameter and profoundly affects et and the water exchange between the atmosphere and plants previous studies usually assumed that the annual transpiration does not differ greatly between the broadleaved and coniferous forests however the t stand of s wallichii and a mangium was much higher than that of c lanceolate similar to our results another study conducted in a low latitude moist area in south africa also showed that the annual et of broadleaved eucalyptus forests was higher than that of pine plantations scott lesch 1997 since the studied three tree species are evergreen in our study the differences in forest structure and interception could be responsible for the different et we observed komatsu et al 2011 the s wallichii possessed the largest lai values during the whole experimental period which were almost twice those of c lanceolata fig 7 indicating that s wallichii had a better interception that contributed to the annual et 4 2 hydrological impact for different plantations precipitation streamflow and evapotranspiration are the primary input and output pathways of the forest ecosystem studies have reported that the change in regional water yield is mainly due to the change of et li et al 2014 cristiano et al 2015 among the components of water balance the annual et of s wallichii and a mangium accounted for over 90 of total p which was similar to the values reported by almeida et al 2007 in a warm annually averaged t 20 c region of brazil the average et of eucalyptus plantation comprised 95 of the water input to the catchment over the full rotation almeida et al 2007 despite having similar climate conditions as in our studied region another study performed in south china leizhou peninsula reported a smaller proportion of et in p 60 70 of eucalyptus plantation lane et al 2004 the different results could be attributed to the different precipitation and lai values as suggested by a comparison of the stand transpiration and forest structure between lane et al 2004 and our study compared to our study lane et al 2004 reported a higher annual runoff of eucalyptus plantation due to the very sparse understory resulted from continuous human disturbance they also reported lower lai values range from 1 0 to 1 5 indicating less canopy interception the higher annual runoff and lower lai values consequently lead to a relatively lower et in lane et al 2004 water balance is also strongly influenced by the tree species selected for afforestation previous studies stated a stronger decrease in the annual stream for coniferous vegetation than for the hardwood forests rosenqvist et al 2010 salazar et al 2013 they attributed the lower water recharge of coniferous stands to the greater interception evaporation in these coniferous stands than in hardwood stands since the selected hardwood species were deciduous species however as discussed above compared with the c lanceolata the evergreen broadleaved forest with higher lai could intercept more precipitation for evapotranspiration moreover the observed annual runoff of the c lanceolata plantation was 9 7 and 19 8 of the precipitation respectively which were higher than that of the other two plantations 3 2 6 9 this may suggest that a higher proportion of precipitation could be involved in the water yield li et al 2014 the ratio of et p was an important indicator for evaluating hydrological impact creed et al 2014 the ratio below 1 indicates a humid energy limited condition whereas ratio greater than 1 indicates a dry and water limited catchment though streamflow data were not available in our study the seasonal variations in et p could provide a perspective to evaluate the effect of the three plantations on regional water balance due to the unevenly distributed precipitation the et p of s wallichii and a mangium in the wet season was lower than but close to 1 implying a balance between the input and output with smaller water surplus whereas the dry season e g in december could experience potentially severe drought as the stand et remained greater than 40 mm with no rain events yet high radiation goulden and bales 2013 proposed that the streamflow is highly sensitive to plantation expansion where a 28 increase in et across a watershed could lead to a 26 decrease in streamflow moreover the soil water content and water storage usually increased in the wet season and then significantly decreased in the dry season figs 3 and 6a this suggests that it will take more soil water to sustain trees transpiration and soil evaporation during the dry season when the temperature and par remained at a relatively high level in our studied region from this perspective s wallichii and a mangium plantations are likely to be less favorable for the water balance in this region and more susceptible to the varied precipitation 4 3 implications for balancing the environmental benefits of plantations vegetation reforestation means various potential compromises between timber production water yields and biodiversity cunningham et al 2015 plantations of different tree species can definitely cause diverse changes in water yields jackson et al 2005 no single type of plantation can meet economic and environmental needs simultaneously but forest reforestation should attempt to maximize the benefits climate change in south china is likely to decrease the regional water supply due to the changes in precipitation patterns and increases the vpd and mean annual temperature zhou et al 2010 our results suggested that the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium generally have strong demand for water consumption and stand evaporation consequently limiting the supply of soil moisture groundwater and river runoff benefiting from the lower stand evapotranspiration the c lanceolata plantation is expected to increase water yield but at the cost of slow growth further the occurrence of extreme rainfall events will increase the surface runoff of c lanceolata plantation which is detrimental to soil water conservation given the changing climate and the expected increase in reforestation forest managers will face the problem of balancing timber production against the demand for water resources from a long term perspective our study to some extent quantified the hydrological effect of common plantations in south china further study should develop quantitative models at a larger space time scale to reveal how reforestation affects the structure function and interactions of plantations and local ecohydrological environment 5 conclusions we monitored the sap flow based transpiration and investigated the water balance and hydrological effect of three typical plantations in south china following the seasonal variations in precipitation and par monthly stand scale transpiration values were higher in the wet season than in the dry season with the transpiration from may to august accounting for about 47 65 of the annual total compared to the coniferous c lanceolata the broadleaved s wallichii and a mangium generally presented a stronger tree transpiration and stand evapotranspiration it should be noticed that the et accounted for more than 90 of the precipitation and most of the et p values exceeded 1 in the dry season for s wallichii and a mangium plantations attributed to the relatively lower et the c lanceolata had higher surface runoff and soil water storage than the other two broadleaved plantations the difference in the hydrological parameters between the broadleaved and coniferous forests can be attributed to the different leaf phenology and forest structure such as the leaf area index values characterized by higher lai the evergreen broadleaved plantations have the advantage in canopy interception and thus decreasing the surface runoff our results highlighted the negative effect of s wallichii and a mangium plantations on local water yield and streamflow and suggested that the current climate models in south china might need to intensify the surface runoff of the c lanceolata plantation and decrease its adaptability due to the lower
