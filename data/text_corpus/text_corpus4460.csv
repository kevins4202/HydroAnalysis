superstructure to hull girder strength of the passenger ship is paid more attention in the present paper an inland passenger ship is taken into account the interaction of main hull and superstructure is analyzed based on the two beam theory the bending efficiency of superstructure is investigated and discussed which can provide technical supporting to the structural design of the superstructure of passenger ship keywords passenger ship superstructure bending efficiency longitudinal strength two beam theory 1 background compared to the early passenger ship considered only as a means of transportation nowadays the modern passenger ship is more likely to serve as a resort on the sea to provide accommodation leisure entertainment and other services for passengers in order to enrich and satisfy the diversified needs of passengers the passenger ship is developing towards the large scale and multi functionalization with the great economic benefit of the plump superstructure it also puts forward higher requirements for the ship s navigational performance and structural strength design the lightweight design of superstructure is performed under the premise of structural safety and reliability therefore the weight of ship structure can be reduced and the center of gravity will be lower as well the superstructure bending efficiency which reflects the degree of the superstructure participating in the longitudinal bending is different with various tiers due to the stiffness difference between the main hull and the superstructure of passenger ship by investigating the bending efficiency of superstructure and corresponding influence factors the structural design of superstructure can be conducted more rationally and effectively which is important for the design of passenger ship for the time being the bending efficiency of superstructure can be investigated by the direct calculation method and finite element method the direct calculation method is mainly applied to the hull structural design including the linear calculation the empirical formula the analytical method and so on the linear calculation is simple and widely used in the initial stage to estimate the structural stress level however the error becomes larger when the stress distribution of the section is not linear any longer the empirical formula is achieved by fitting amount of collection data so that it shows high precision for the ship types covered in the database the analytical method is proposed by simplifying the interaction behaviour between the main hull and superstructure the bending efficiency of superstructure is deduced by the structural stress distribution the existing analysis method is normally based on different beam theory such as the composite beam theory proposed by crawford 1950 the column beam theory proposed by bleich 1952 the two beam theory proposed by schade 1965 and the couple beam theory proposed by naar et al 2004 for the superstructure of inland passenger ship its structural type is different from normal transportation ships there are continuous opening in the side shell and larger size opening in the deck which are not considered in the mentioned methods so it is necessary to perform systematic comprehensive research on the superstructure bending efficiency of inland passenger ship it is noted there are vertical force and horizontal force in the conjunction of main hull and superstructure andric 2007 performed the research on the physics of the main hull and superstructure interaction furthermore methodology in the concept design phase for structural design is proposed crawford and ruby 1955 verified the column beam theory and formula proposed by bleich 1952 through the model test on nine models heder and ulfvarson 1991

bending efficiency of each deck is calculated by the ratio of fem results to those obtained by linear theory chen 2011 had investigated the participation degree to longitudinal bending of aluminum alloy superstructure fem analysis is performed by zou 2013 to get the stress distribution of typical section of an inland passenger ship the bending efficiency of each tier of superstructure is calculated and compared with that defined by rules in the present paper the interaction of main hull and superstructure of an inland passenger ship is investigated according to the two beam theory and finite element method the participation of superstructure to longitudinal bending is discussed and the influence of the superstructure length and width the ratio of deck opening and the opening ratio of side shell is discussed the fem results are introduced to correct the traditional two beam theory which can reflect the bending character of superstructure the research is meaningful for the structural safety and reliability and the lightweight design of superstructure 2 superstructural bending efficiency 2 1 definition superstructural bending efficiency reflects the participating degree to the longitudinal bending which is significant to the structural lightweight design on the premise of safety and reliability the exact definition of the bending efficiency is different in view of different researcher s opinion evans 1983 it is common to define the change of the stress in superstructure as bending efficiency 1 ν σ 1 σ 1 where σ 1 is the actual normal stress at the position of superstructure neutral axis and σ 1 is the normal stress at the same point assuming that the superstructure is totally effective actually a typical section is usually determined firstly to research the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure 2 2 two beam theory it is well known there is interaction between the main hull and superstructure assuming that the ship hull is in hogging condition in the wave the upper deck shall be in tension situation due to the longitudinal bending of main hull the stretch of upper deck is constrained by the lower edge of the superstructure because they are interconnected at the same time the lower edge of the superstructure is also be stretched by upper deck this interaction can be expressed by the horizontal shear force as shown in fig 1 the deformation of superstructure is opposite to the main hull due to the effect of horizontal shear force such phenomenon is obvious for the section which is near the end of superstructure it is so called end effect of superstructure the superstructure is connected to the main hull so that there is a set of equal value and opposite direction vertical distributed forces to resist the separation as shown in fig 1 a typical section which is x distance from the aft end section of superstructure is selected to be analyzed the subjected force and moment as shown in fig 2 the equilibrium equations of longitudinal force and moment on the neutral axis can be described as a 1 p 1 a f p f 0 2 m 1 m f a f e p f m where subscript 1 represents the main hull and f presents the superstructure a means the section area e is the distance between the neutral axis of superstructure and main hull p represents the mean stress and m presents the bending moment it is noted that the deflection of main hull and superstructure is related to its bending moment respectively considering the influence of shear deformation the bending moment of main hull m1 and superstructure mf can be expressed as follows according to conventional beam theory m 1 e 1 i 1 d 2 w 1 d x 2 q 1 a 1 g 1 3 m f e f i f d 2 w f d x 2 q f a f g f where e represents elastic modulus i is moment of inertia w presents deflection a means the shear area including side shell plating and longitudinal bulkhead and g is shear modulus by combining the above equations a four order differential equation may be obtained for the mean stress in the superstructure p f then the bending efficiency of superstructure can be achieved 3 traditional assessment method to the bending efficiency of superstructure the interaction between the main hull and superstructure is so complex that the bending efficiency of superstructure is not so easy to decide for bv classification two beam theory proposed by schade is adopted the efficiency v i of the tier i of superstructure is determined using the formula bureau veritas 2019 based on statistical data 4 ν i ν i 1 0 37 χ 0 034 χ 2 where ν i 1 bending efficiency of the below superstructure χ

axis of the main hull and superstructure respectively the meaning of above symbol is shown in fig 3 it is worth mention the geometry parameters of the superstructure should be corrected by the ratio of young s modulus e e e 1 when the main hull and superstructure adopt different material the bending efficiency of a typical tier superstructure can be defined as the bending efficiency of central point locating in the neutral axis of mentioned typical tier it is suitable for the evaluation of the stress distribution of the section not considering the local stress distribution when calculating the multi tier superstructure the main hull and the structures below the i tier superstructure are treated as the equivalent main hull the actual stress assessed by the rule can be obtained based on the simple beam theory with the correction of bending efficiency 4 analytical model in this section the finite element model of a typical inland passenger ship is generated the interaction of the main hull and superstructure is investigated and the bending efficiency of each tier of superstructure is discussed basing on the analysis of the sectional geometry and the sectional normal stress distribution 4 1 finite element model the target ship is one of the largest inland passenger ship which contains six decks and four tiers of superstructure there are more than 80 passenger cabins and the gymnasium meeting room bar and swimming pool in the recreational area the target steel ship has a double bottom and single side structural configuration with the decks mainly connected by pillars and transverse bulkheads the principal dimensions are shown in table 1 and the height and length of decks are summarized in table 2 the superstructure of target ship is distributed along the entire ship so that the whole ship fem model is necessary to calculate the bending efficiency of each tier the stiffener is simulated by beam element and the plating is simulated by plate element the web of girder is simulated by plate element and flange by beam element the mesh size is basically 250 mm which is half of stiffener space or frame space there are three divisions for the web the square plate element is prior to triangular element and the sharp angle element larger than 165 or less than 15 is tried to avoid there are totally 750 000 elements in the whole ship model a typical double span section model is demonstrated in fig 4 and whole ship model is shown in fig 5 the ship is usually floating in the water so that it is in equilibrium condition at each time instantaneous there are no so called geometry boundary conditions in order to perform the finite element analysis the minimum geometry boundary condition is necessary to prevent the rigid body movement in the present research the multi point constraints abbreviated as mpc are subjected to the aft end section and all degrees of freedom are fixed to simulate the rigid constraints as shown in fig 6 at the same time the mpc constraints are set to the fore end section and the vertical rotation angle are forced to simulate the longitudinal bending moment as shown in fig 7 4 2 load calculation the ship is subjected to still water bending moment and wave bending moment according to the definition of bv rules nr217 the moments can be calculated as follows still water bending moment in hogging conditions is calculated by 5 m h o 0 273 l 2 b 1 342 d 0 172 1 265 c b k n m where l length between perpendiculars l pp in m b breadth in m d depth in m c b block coefficient c b δ l b t t is for the draught in m wave bending moment can be derived by m w 0 021 n c l 2 b c b 0 7 k n m where n navigation coefficient n 0 85h s h s maximum significant wave height in m c wave parameter c 10 75 300 l 100 1 5 l 90m for the target ship the ratio of length to depth is l d 22 3 the significant wave height of the navigation route ranges from 0 6m to 2 0m the significant wave height hs 1 8m is adopted in the present research the calculated wave bending moment is 43 692 kn m and still water bending moment is 126 317 kn m the longitudinal bending moment shall include hydrostatic moment and the wave bending moment which is totally 1 700 10 8 n m in the present research the hogging condition is considered which is generally typical case for passenger vessels the forced rotation angle is increased in the fore end section until the reaction vertical bending moment reaches the mentioned longitudinal bending moment 5 results and analysis a typical inland passenger ship with four tiers of superstructure is considered in the present research the structural response under the longitudinal bending is investigated and analyzed in order to discuss the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength the longitudinal nominal stress distribution along depth direction of each element in the typical cross section is compared 5 1 fem calculation results fem analysis is carried out using the mentioned model boundary condition and loads condition then the stress distribution of each element can be obtained the typical cross section at the middle of ship length x 56m is chosen for discussion the longitudinal stress distribution along ship depth in the typical cross section is shown in fig 8 fem results show that the stress distribution below the main deck is almost linear and that above the first deck is also linear however the slope is different that represents the different stiffness in the main hull and superstructure 5 2 rules calculation results on the other hand the bending efficiency of superstructure according to bv rules is also performed the geometric parameters of each tier superstructure are obtained in accordance with the method described in chapter 3 as shown in table 3 then the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure can be obtained as shown in table 4 for the objective passenger ship the effective length of each tier superstructure is so long that the dimensionless coefficient χ reaches to 5 0 therefore the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is 100 the longitudinal stress distribution along ship depth is linear for both main hull and superstructure as shown by cyan line with diamond mark in fig 8 comparing with the fem results the position of neutral axis obtained by rules shows much higher one and the stress on the top deck is almost two times and that on the bottom is only half the contribution of deck constructions to longitudinal strength is not correctly defined in the present rules calculation formula the influence factors for example the ratio of deck opening the opening ratio of side shell and the ratio of the superstructure width must be considered in the rules definition in order to reveal the actual characteristics of stress distribution 5 3 modified rule calculation results the bending efficiency defined in the rules is based on beam theory so that the influence of opening cannot be considered to proper reflect the efficiency of the superstructure the influence of the superstructure length and width the ratio of deck opening and the opening ratio of side shell shall be taken into account so the efficiency formula v i can be corrected as follow zhu 2018 6 ν i k ν i 1 0 37 χ 0 034 χ 2 where k is influence factor k f π l s π b s π a d o π a s o the meaning of other symbols is same as eq 4 5 3 1 influence factor of superstructure length the length of superstructure plays an important role in the bending efficiency it is noted that the longer superstructure participates more for the longitudinal bending to express the effect factor properly the ratio of the superstructure length to the ship hull length π l s is defined as π l s l s l where l s is the effective length of superstructure and l is the effective length of main hull the calculation model for different π l s is shown in fig 9 the correction factor of bending efficiency is expressed in fig 10 it is more effective to transfer the force from the main hull to superstructure with the longer superstructure which leads to higher bending efficiency see fig 10 when the π l s is less than 0 3 the bending efficiency of superstructure is low and increases rapidly as the superstructure length increases the bending efficiency increases linearly with the superstructure length when the π l s is larger than 0 4 5 3 2 influence factor of superstructure width to investigate the influence of superstructure width on the bending efficiency the ratio of the superstructure width to the ship width π b s is defined as π b s b s b where b s is the effective width of superstructure and b is the width of main hull in the present research it is assumed that the width of main hull is unchanged to discuss the effect of different superstructure width the effect of various π b s 1 0 0 74 0 56 0 37 and 0 19 is discussed to ensure the force transferring effectively between the main hull and superstructure the pillars are set at the outer side of superstructure for different superstructure width as shown in fig 11 the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 12 it can be found the bending efficiency will decrease with the increase of π bs the narrower superstructure width represents the better force transformation which leads to higher bending efficiency it is worth noting the influence rate of superstructure width is less than 5 5 3 3 influence factor of deck opening area to investigate the effect of deck opening the ratio of the deck opening area to the deck area π a do is defined as π a d o a d o a d where a do is the deck opening area and a d is the deck area seven typical cases representing the ratio of the deck opening area to the deck area 0 4 11 18 25 32 and 39 are considered the meaning of π a do is shown in fig 13 the midst section is analyzed and the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 14 with the increase of deck opening area the structural strength becomes weaker and the effectiveness of superstructure is reduced the π a do is relatively small in most cases so that the influence of deck opening area on the bending efficiency is not crucial in actual situation 5 3 4 influence factor of side shell opening area to discuss the effect of side shell opening the ratio of the side shell opening area to the side shell area π a so is defined as π a s o a s o a s where a so is the side shell opening area and a s is the side shell area in order to better appreciate the scenery along the trip the passenger ship always sets many openings on the side shell of superstructure the ratio of side shell opening area to the side shell area can reach 0 3 0 45 in the present research the opening size is set 2400 1750mm and the distance between openings is 1100 mm six typical cases representing the ratio of the side shell opening area to the side shell area 0 10 19 29 38 and 43 are calculated the meaning of π a so is shown in fig 15 the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 16 side shell opening makes the force transfer poor as the side shell opening area increases the bending efficiency decreases rapidly when the π a so reaches 43 the efficiency is only 81 considering the effect of superstructure length width deck opening area side shell opening area the corrected bending efficiency of each tier superstructure can be calculated by eq 6 for the objective inland passenger ship the superstructure length width and deck opening area are fully effective so that the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is influenced by side shell opening area as summarized in table 5 the stress distribution along depth direction considering the corrected bending efficient is computed and shown in fig 8 by red rectangular marked with modified rules results 5 4 results discussion the fem results are obtained by structural direct calculation using whole ship model under longitudinal hogging moment the rules results are calculated by the present bv rules based on two beam theory and the modified rules results are achieved considering the correction factor of superstructure length width deck opening area and side shell opening area they are compared in fig 8 according to the fem results the stress distribution below the main deck is almost linear and that above the first deck is also linear there are different slope for that below the main deck and above the first deck for the passenger ship the force transformation between main hull and superstructure is not totally effective so that there exists bending efficiency of superstructure the present bv rules definition on bending efficiency of superstructure is based on two beam theory proposed by schade it is related to superstructure length vertical shear areas sectional area and inertia moment of main hull and superstructure the influence of deck opening and side shell opening cannot be considered properly in beam theory for the objective passenger ship the superstructure length is enough so that the dimensionless coefficient χ is 5 0 and the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is fully effective therefore the position of neutral axis is relative high which leads to larger longitudinal stress in the uppermost deck and the third deck of superstructure while smaller one in the bottom as shown in fig 8 it is known from the present research the superstructure length and width the opening ratio of deck and the opening ratio of side shell have an influence on the bending efficiency of each tier of superstructure the rules definition can be modified by considering the corresponding correction factors the modified rules results are expressed with red rectangular mark modified rules results in fig 8 the position of neutral axis is reduced a lot and shows good agreement with that of fem results the longitudinal stress in the sun deck the third deck and the bottom is quite different with that of traditional rules results but coincides with that of fem results so the correction factors play important roles on the bending efficiency of superstructure the modified rules results can basically reflect the characteristics of superstructure bending 6 conclusions it is important for the rational and lightweight structural design of passenger ship to research the superstructure bending efficiency in the present paper the whole ship fem model is generated and the stress distribution along depth direction of a typical section under hogging condition is analyzed the fem results are compared with those obtained by bv rules based on two beam theory the rules results show higher neutral axis position and quite different stress distribution the influence factors such as the superstructure length and width the ratio of deck opening area and side shell opening area are investigated and the corresponding correction coefficient is proposed the results obtained by proposed modification method show good agreement with fem results in both neutral axis position and stress distribution the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 under the longitudinal bending moment including still water bending moment and wave bending moment the structural behaviour of main hull basically follows beam theory and that of superstructure also follows it however the rigidity stiffness of main hull and superstructure are different 2 the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength is low if the superstructure length is less than 0 3 times of ship length and it increases with the superstructure length for flump superstructure 3 the superstructure width has a little effect on bending efficiency the bending efficiency changes no more than 5 when there are pillars under the side shell of superstructure to ensure the force transformation 4 with the increase of deck opening area the structural strength becomes weaker and the effectiveness of superstructure is reduced the actual deck opening area is so small that its influence on the bending efficiency is not crucial 5 as the side shell opening area increases the bending efficiency decreases rapidly the bending efficiency is only 81 when the ratio of side shell opening area to side shell area reaches 43 6 the modified results considering the correction factor of the superstructure length and width the deck opening area and side shell opening area are good agreement with those of fem results so that the modified method can basically reflect the characteristics of superstructure bending the present research deals with the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength of inland passenger ship with four decks the influence factors such as superstructure length and width the deck opening area and side shell opening area are investigated and discussed the modified formula is proposed to reflect the bending efficiency of superstructure

totally 1 700 10 8 n m in the present research the hogging condition is considered which is generally typical case for passenger vessels the forced rotation angle is increased in the fore end section until the reaction vertical bending moment reaches the mentioned longitudinal bending moment 5 results and analysis a typical inland passenger ship with four tiers of superstructure is considered in the present research the structural response under the longitudinal bending is investigated and analyzed in order to discuss the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength the longitudinal nominal stress distribution along depth direction of each element in the typical cross section is compared 5 1 fem calculation results fem analysis is carried out using the mentioned model boundary condition and loads condition then the stress distribution of each element can be obtained the typical cross section at the middle of ship length x 56m is chosen for discussion the longitudinal stress distribution along ship depth in the typical cross section is shown in fig 8 fem results show that the stress distribution below the main deck is almost linear and that above the first deck is also linear however the slope is different that represents the different stiffness in the main hull and superstructure 5 2 rules calculation results on the other hand the bending efficiency of superstructure according to bv rules is also performed the geometric parameters of each tier superstructure are obtained in accordance with the method described in chapter 3 as shown in table 3 then the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure can be obtained as shown in table 4 for the objective passenger ship the effective length of each tier superstructure is so long that the dimensionless coefficient χ reaches to 5 0 therefore the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is 100 the longitudinal stress distribution along ship depth is linear for both main hull and superstructure as shown by cyan line with diamond mark in fig 8 comparing with the fem results the position of neutral axis obtained by rules shows much higher one and the stress on the top deck is almost two times and that on the bottom is only half the contribution of deck constructions to longitudinal strength is not correctly defined in the present rules calculation formula the influence factors for example the ratio of deck opening the opening ratio of side shell and the ratio of the superstructure width must be considered in the rules definition in order to reveal the actual characteristics of stress distribution 5 3 modified rule calculation results the bending efficiency defined in the rules is based on beam theory so that the influence of opening cannot be considered to proper reflect the efficiency of the superstructure the influence of the superstructure length and width the ratio of deck opening and the opening ratio of side shell shall be taken into account so the efficiency formula v i can be corrected as follow zhu 2018 6 ν i k ν i 1 0 37 χ 0 034 χ 2 where k is influence factor k f π l s π b s π a d o π a s o the meaning of other symbols is same as eq 4 5 3 1 influence factor of superstructure length the length of superstructure plays an important role in the bending efficiency it is noted that the longer superstructure participates more for the longitudinal bending to express the effect factor properly the ratio of the superstructure length to the ship hull length π l s is defined as π l s l s l where l s is the effective length of superstructure and l is the effective length of main hull the calculation model for different π l s is shown in fig 9 the correction factor of bending efficiency is expressed in fig 10 it is more effective to transfer the force from the main hull to superstructure with the longer superstructure which leads to higher bending efficiency see fig 10 when the π l s is less than 0 3 the bending efficiency of superstructure is low and increases rapidly as the superstructure length increases the bending efficiency increases linearly with the superstructure length when the π l s is larger than 0 4 5 3 2 influence factor of superstructure width to investigate the influence of superstructure width on the bending efficiency the ratio of the superstructure width to the ship width π b s is defined as π b s b s b where b s is the effective width of superstructure and b is the width of main hull in the present research it is assumed that the width of main hull is unchanged to discuss the effect of different superstructure width the effect of various π b s 1 0 0 74 0 56 0 37 and 0 19 is discussed to ensure the force transferring effectively between the main hull and superstructure the pillars are set at the outer side of superstructure for different superstructure width as shown in fig 11 the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 12 it can be found the bending efficiency will decrease with the increase of π bs the narrower superstructure width represents the better force transformation which leads to higher bending efficiency it is worth noting the influence rate of superstructure width is less than 5 5 3 3 influence factor of deck opening area to investigate the effect of deck opening the ratio of the deck opening area to the deck area π a do is defined as π a d o a d o a d where a do is the deck opening area and a d is the deck area seven typical cases representing the ratio of the deck opening area to the deck area 0 4 11 18 25 32 and 39 are considered the meaning of π a do is shown in fig 13 the midst section is analyzed and the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 14 with the increase of deck opening area the structural strength becomes weaker and the effectiveness of superstructure is reduced the π a do is relatively small in most cases so that the influence of deck opening area on the bending efficiency is not crucial in actual situation 5 3 4 influence factor of side shell opening area to discuss the effect of side shell opening the ratio of the side shell opening area to the side shell area π a so is defined as π a s o a s o a s where a so is the side shell opening area and a s is the side shell area in order to better appreciate the scenery along the trip the passenger ship always sets many openings on the side shell of superstructure the ratio of side shell opening area to the side shell area can reach 0 3 0 45 in the present research the opening size is set 2400 1750mm and the distance between openings is 1100 mm six typical cases representing the ratio of the side shell opening area to the side shell area 0 10 19 29 38 and 43 are calculated the meaning of π a so is shown in fig 15 the correction factor of bending efficiency is demonstrated in fig 16 side shell opening makes the force transfer poor as the side shell opening area increases the bending efficiency decreases rapidly when the π a so reaches 43 the efficiency is only 81 considering the effect of superstructure length width deck opening area side shell opening area the corrected bending efficiency of each tier superstructure can be calculated by eq 6 for the objective inland passenger ship the superstructure length width and deck opening area are fully effective so that the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is influenced by side shell opening area as summarized in table 5 the stress distribution along depth direction considering the corrected bending efficient is computed and shown in fig 8 by red rectangular marked with modified rules results 5 4 results discussion the fem results are obtained by structural direct calculation using whole ship model under longitudinal hogging moment the rules results are calculated by the present bv rules based on two beam theory and the modified rules results are achieved considering the correction factor of superstructure length width deck opening area and side shell opening area they are compared in fig 8 according to the fem results the stress distribution below the main deck is almost linear and that above the first deck is also linear there are different slope for that below the main deck and above the first deck for the passenger ship the force transformation between main hull and superstructure is not totally effective so that there exists bending efficiency of superstructure the present bv rules definition on bending efficiency of superstructure is based on two beam theory proposed by schade it is related to superstructure length vertical shear areas sectional area and inertia moment of main hull and superstructure the influence of deck opening and side shell opening cannot be considered properly in beam theory for the objective passenger ship the superstructure length is enough so that the dimensionless coefficient χ is 5 0 and the bending efficiency of each tier superstructure is fully effective therefore the position of neutral axis is relative high which leads to larger longitudinal stress in the uppermost deck and the third deck of superstructure while smaller one in the bottom as shown in fig 8 it is known from the present research the superstructure length and width the opening ratio of deck and the opening ratio of side shell have an influence on the bending efficiency of each tier of superstructure the rules definition can be modified by considering the corresponding correction factors the modified rules results are expressed with red rectangular mark modified rules results in fig 8 the position of neutral axis is reduced a lot and shows good agreement with that of fem results the longitudinal stress in the sun deck the third deck and the bottom is quite different with that of traditional rules results but coincides with that of fem results so the correction factors play important roles on the bending efficiency of superstructure the modified rules results can basically reflect the characteristics of superstructure bending 6 conclusions it is important for the rational and lightweight structural design of passenger ship to research the superstructure bending efficiency in the present paper the whole ship fem model is generated and the stress distribution along depth direction of a typical section under hogging condition is analyzed the fem results are compared with those obtained by bv rules based on two beam theory the rules results show higher neutral axis position and quite different stress distribution the influence factors such as the superstructure length and width the ratio of deck opening area and side shell opening area are investigated and the corresponding correction coefficient is proposed the results obtained by proposed modification method show good agreement with fem results in both neutral axis position and stress distribution the main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 under the longitudinal bending moment including still water bending moment and wave bending moment the structural behaviour of main hull basically follows beam theory and that of superstructure also follows it however the rigidity stiffness of main hull and superstructure are different 2 the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength is low if the superstructure length is less than 0 3 times of ship length and it increases with the superstructure length for flump superstructure 3 the superstructure width has a little effect on bending efficiency the bending efficiency changes no more than 5 when there are pillars under the side shell of superstructure to ensure the force transformation 4 with the increase of deck opening area the structural strength becomes weaker and the effectiveness of superstructure is reduced the actual deck opening area is so small that its influence on the bending efficiency is not crucial 5 as the side shell opening area increases the bending efficiency decreases rapidly the bending efficiency is only 81 when the ratio of side shell opening area to side shell area reaches 43 6 the modified results considering the correction factor of the superstructure length and width the deck opening area and side shell opening area are good agreement with those of fem results so that the modified method can basically reflect the characteristics of superstructure bending the present research deals with the bending efficiency of superstructure to hull girder strength of inland passenger ship with four decks the influence factors such as superstructure length and width the deck opening area and side shell opening area are investigated and discussed the modified formula is proposed to reflect the bending efficiency of superstructure

22301,wave induced loads on advancing ships are studied by using a three dimensional nonlinear hybrid high order boundary element method with the combination of the rankine source green function applied in the internal domain and the transient free surface green function adopted in the external domain a quadratic representation of both the boundary and the unknowns on the boundary is adopted in the internal domain the forward speed problem is solved with the steady ship wave as the basis flow in the external domain an efficient algorithm combined with chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions for the transient free surface green function is adopted to the solution of radiation condition the nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces resulted from large amplitude incident waves are taken into consideration over the instantaneous wetted hull surface this paper presents an effective solution to the problems of excessive memory occupation and large time consuming in the long duration simulation a nonlinear numerical program is originally developed and the preliminary linear motions of wigley 3 and s175 container hull at relatively high speed are analyzed furthermore the nonlinear behavior of hydrodynamic forces motions and the wave loads of s175 hull are investigated in regular and irregular seas especially the phenomenon of super harmonics in severe regular waves are highlighted thoroughly comparisons with experiment results indicate the present method owns satisfactory numerical stability accuracy and efficiency for the practical application keywords time domain green function high order element hybrid method nonlinear wave loads 1 introduction accurate prediction of motions and wave loads of ships with forward speed is one of the most demanding in wave ship interactions especially under the influence of moderate or large amplitude waves p temarel et al 2016 temarel et al 2016 in conventional view of structural design the long term extreme value of wave loads for a hull girder come from the equivalent design waves or equivalent design sea states method lloyd s register 2014 register 2014 iacs 2015 iacs 2015 therefore the nonlinear hydrodynamics of advancing ships in regular and irregular waves are significantly essential as to this problem engineering approximations are often employed in the framework of three dimensional potential flow there have been four kinds of nonlinear method for the forward speed problem since the past three decades hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 except for the most fundamental linear method datta et al 2011 datta et al 2011 bingham 1994 bingham 1994 the remaining three level 2 4 can be called froude krylov f k nonlinear liu and papanikolaou 2011 liu and papanikolaou 2011 sengupta et al 2016 sengupta et al 2016 weak scattered nonlinear kim et al 2013 kim et al 2013 and mixed eulerian lagrangian method yan and liu 2010 yan and liu 2010 to some extent although the increasing level of methods represents fewer approximations in the problem formulation and higher prediction accuracy this is at the expense of numerical stability and computational effort especially for the level 3 and 4 therefore at present state of art the level 2 the f k nonlinear method are still the most popular and practical scheme since it captures many essential nonlinear aspects with much less computer time and more stability its solution of perturbation potential is identical to the linear level but the f k force and hydrostatics are considered to be nonlinear and solved over the instantaneous wetted hull surface under the incident wave elevation as a modification of linear method the prediction accuracy of f k nonlinear method mainly depends on the linear solution of the forward speed problem in time domain in this regard considering the local hydrodynamic pressure needed in structural strength analysis the direct method which solves the linear disturbance potential problem in time domain is superior to the indirect impulse response function method nam et al 2009 nam et al 2009 liu el al 2014 liu et al 2014 which is usually only for ship motions in regular waves in the direct time domain research there are three kinds of mainstream methods which are the rankine source method the free surface green function method and the hybrid method by combining the former two methods as to the rankine source method with the simple expression 1 r as green function it is popular since it can be easily implemented and is flexible to various boundary conditions kring 1994 kring 1994 yasukawa 2002 yasukawa 2002 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 kim 2010 kim and kim 2010 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018a however an artificial damping beach is required to allow no reflection of body generated waves from the edge of the computational domain and the size of free surface domain should be several times wavelength and the discretized panel must be small enough to capture short waves as a consequence the dispersion errors stemming from the panel discretization of the free surface is inevitable and the computational cost is quite high chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b in contrast the implementation of the transient free surface green function with complex expression can avoid those problems caused by rankine source method bingham 1994 bingham 1994 lin and yue 1990 lin and yue 1990 sen 2002 sen 2002 a numerical instability for ships with large flare may be caused due to the singular and high oscillating integration over a panel or a line segment close to the free surface and solutions are presented by datta et al 2011 datta et al 2011 datta and sen 2006 datta and sen 2006 and walree 2014 walree 2014 to deal with this instability but even so it is still hard to prevent the problem thoroughly and inconvenient in practical applications besides there is another deficiency that the free surface green function are derived with the neumann kelvin linearized free surface conditions this means the effects of the steady ship wave and the double body approximation cannot be included this hypothesis is proper for a slender body however the steady flow influence is critically important for a blunt body chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 in view of drawbacks of the rankine source method and the free surface green function method a reasonable hybrid method has been developed by combining the advantages of both the rankine source method and that inherits in the free surface green function a virtual control surface is introduced to divide the fluid domain into two parts the internal domain and the external domain the rankine source function and the free surface green function are applied in the internal domain and the external domain respectively by this method only a small region of the free surface domain need to be discretized due to the free surface green function satisfying the radiation condition and the internal domain is flexible to the free surface condition with the virtual control surface meshed zhang et al 1998 zhang et al 1998 tang et al 2014 tang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018c employed the hybrid method in reference coordinate which is moving at the same speed as the ship to solve non wall sided ship motions in time domain in order to make the theory free from line integral kataoka and iwashita 2004 kataoka and iwashita 2004 liu and papanikolaou 2011 liu and papanikolaou 2011 introduced a spaced fixed artificial control surface to the simulation of unsteady wave making problems nevertheless the scheme without line integral is significantly time consuming due to the time varying free surface mesh recently chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b studied the preliminary hydrodynamic coefficient of a wigley ship by a new hybrid method with meshless control surface however it should be noted that all these methods mainly focus on the linear problem in regular waves and the nonlinear motion and hull girder wave load are not involved in addition the constant panel method and the neumann kelvin linearized conditions are employed by most of these research accordingly it is worth noting that the high order boundary element method can improve the calculation of spatial derivatives and the stability of time integration sasa and kashiwagi 2014 sasa and kashiwagi 2014 yue and liu 2007 yue and liu 2007 furthermore compared with the complete steady ship wave and double body flow the uniform stream and the corresponding m terms can poorly capture the speed effect on free surface boundary condition and body boundary condition hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 when the ship is advancing with relative high speed or owns a blunt geometry the steady wave elevation is not negligible then the theoretical approximation double body flow cannot be used as the basis flow the complete steady ship wave may be more suitable for this case chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018a in this paper the time domain motions and wave loads are computed based on the f k nonlinear method wherein the perturbation velocity potential are solved from a direct three dimensional hybrid method the quadratic element is used to discretize the body surface the free surface of internal domain the virtual vertical control surface and the intersection line of the last two surfaces in the internal fluid domain the steady ship wave serves as the basis flow and the interactions between the steady and unsteady flows are reflected in more accurate numerical implementations for both linearized free surface condition and the so called m terms combinations of economized polynomials and asymptotic approximations is use to computer the free surface green function with which the radiation condition for the external domain is satisfied automatically based on the originally developed program results are presented for a mathematically defined wigley and a s175 container hull compared with available experimental data the linear and nonlinear motion and wave load in regular and irregular waves are investigated 2 mathematical formulation of hybrid high order boundary element method 2 1 statement of the problem assume that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational then the velocity potential exists a coordinate system o x y z moving with the ship at the forward speed u along the positive o x axis is introduced by letting the x y plane coincide with the mean free surface in fig 1 its origin o lies in the vertical line through the center of gravity g another body fixed system g x b y b z b is introduced by vertically shifting the origin of o x y z from o to g noting the numerical solution of the velocity potential is based on o x y z and six degree rigid motion is defined with respect to the body fixed system in coordinate system o x y z it is assumed that the fluid disturbance due to the steady forward motion and the unsteady oscillations can be separated in this case the total velocity potential φ in the fluid domain can be divided as shown below 1 φ x y z t u x φ s x y z φ i x y z t φ p x y z t where the term u x φ s is the potential due to the steady translation of the ship φ i is the unsteady incident wave potential φ p is the unsteady perturbation potential generally the time independent φ s is the steady flow potential and needs to be derived beforehand and φ p are solved through a time stepping procedure in fluid domain however φ i is always known for the case of infinite depth water and the regular linear wave the incident wave elevation and the velocity potential is 2 ζ i x y t a w cos ω e t k x cos β y sin β γ φ i x y z t g a w ω 0 e k z s i n ω e t k x cos β y sin β γ where γ initial phase a w wave amplitude ω 0 circular frequency k wave number ω e encounter frequency with ω e ω 0 k u cos β and β wave angle in addition for case of irregular waves ζ i and φ i are regarded as the sum of a series of regular wave components in a conventional manner with the present hybrid method the fluid domain ω is decomposed by a vertical and rectangular control surface s c into two parts the internal domain i where the ship is present and the external domain ii as illustrated in fig 1 the boundary surfaces of the internal domain is composed of the body mean wetted surface s h the internal free surface s f i and the control surface s c the boundary surfaces of the external domain include the control surface s c the external free surface s f ii and the infinite surface s as shown in fig 1 rankine source green function and free surface green function are distributed in the boundary surface of internal and external domain respectively the corresponding high order panel method is applied and the continuous velocity potential and its normal derivative in two domain is maintained by the dirichlet and neumann conditions imposed on s c 2 2 boundary value problem the perturbation potential φ p satisfies the governing laplace equation in ω and based on the decomposition of fluid domain φ p needs to satisfy the following boundary condition see eq 3 8 3 2 φ p 0 in ω 4 t u φ s ζ p i φ p i z φ s z 2 φ s z 2 ζ p i φ s ζ i u φ s ζ s t u φ s φ p i g ζ p i ζ s φ s φ i u φ s 1 2 φ s φ s on s f ι z 0 t u x 2 φ ιι g φ ιι z 0 o

of steady potential u is the vector of ship velocity defined as u 0 0 g is the acceleration due to gravity η j are the amplitude of corresponding motions the generalized unit normal n is defined by 9 n n 1 n 2 n 2 n 4 n 5 n 6 t n 1 n 2 n 2 n n 4 n 5 n 6 r n in which r is the position vector in order to match the linearized body boundary condition and account for the forward speed effect more accurately apart from two simplified steady flow modes uniform stream and double body flow a ship wave linearized free surface condition are employed in this study the boundary condition of the steady potential φ s is as follows 10 2 φ s 0 i n ω 2 φ s x 2 g u 2 φ s z 0 s f z 0 φ s n u n 1 o n s h φ s o 1 x 2 y 2 o n s for the lack of space further details of evaluations based on the above boundary condition are available in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 if the steady potential φ s is ignored the free surface condition of s f ι is degenerated into the neumann kelvin form which is identical to that of s f ι ι that is to say the free surface condition of s f ι is more general than that of s f ι ι since only the neumann kelvin linearization is adopted on s f ι ι thus it should be noted that there is an inconsistency of linear free surface condition between s f ι and s f ι ι to deal with this inconsistency a transition zone near the control surface is imposed to gradually damp φ s and ζ s in the transition zone the steady term is define by φ s ζ s φ s ζ s f d x y where f d x y is a free surface decay function showed in fig 2 l d denotes the length of transition zone x r and y r are coordinates of edge of free surface numerical experiments show terms with only steady potential and wave elevation in eq 4 will cause steady component and make no influence on dynamic responses in present work only the contribution of the dynamic effects to the linear and nonlinear responses are considered in other words the steady trim and sinkage due to the ship advancing in still water is not included in present results furthermore as to eq 5 in addition to the linear incident wave used in the present work any explicit description of φ i could be used such as stoke s higher order waves and full nonlinear numerical waves as is done in some other works singh and sen 2007 singh and sen 2007 the so called m terms results from the linearization of the body boundary condition and accounts for the interactions between the steady and the unsteady flow they are computed by 11 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ s m 4 m 5 m 6 n r u φ s the above formulas show that the emphasis of computing m terms is the second order derivatives of the steady flow potential φ s of which the computational method is illustrated in shao 2010 shao 2010 2 3 boundary integral equations with green s second identity since the rankine source green function 1 r does not satisfy any boundary condition all the boundary surfaces s f ι s h s c involved in the internal domain is used in the following boundary integral equation with source and dipole mixed distributions 12 c p φ p i p t s f ι s h s c φ p i q t n q 1 r φ p i q t n q 1 r d s q in which p and q denote field and source points respectively r is the distance between p and q c p is the solid angle coefficient as to the boundary integral equation of external domain according to the work of liapis 1986 liapis 1986 the integral over s is disappear due to the property of φ ιι and the integral on s f ι ι is transform into a line integral along the intersection γ 0 of s f ι ι and s c then the resulted integral equation is only related to s c and γ 0 as eq 13

is a compact form obtained by using the partial integration in τ of φ p ii g f τ and considering the condition φ p ii 0 at τ 0 and g f 0 at τ t g 0 and g f are the instantaneous and memory part of the transient free surface green function respectively with the notation 14 g 0 p q 1 r 1 r 1 g f p q t τ 2 0 g k sin t τ g k e k z j 0 k r d k where r 1 is the distance between p and the symmetry point

body motions and sectional wave loads the conventional six modes of rigid body surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw can be determined from solution of the above hydrodynamic problem in time domain based on the proper initial condition once the perturbation potential of the fluid domain is obtained the motion η of center of gravity the global force f can be derived the equation of motions are 16

from the perturbation velocity potential f i denotes the f k force f s is the hydrostatic restoring force c is the linear hydrostatic stiffness matrix the hydrodynamic pressures p p and p i are calculated by the bernoulli s equation 18 p p i ρ t u φ s φ p i it should be noted that in order to keep the numerical simulation more stable the strategy that the perturbation potential φ p is further divided into the local part φ l and the memory part φ m as the work of kring 1994 kring 1994 is adopted in this study as well as a result the hydrodynamic force f l from the local perturbation potential is expressed by a combination of three steady coefficient matrix a b c and the motion vector 19 f l a η t b η t c η t then the equation of motions is re arranged as 20 m a η t b η t c η t f i t f m t f s t for detail expression of the steady coefficient refer to kring 1994 kring 1994 in eq 20 motions and forces are defined respected to the body fixed system and the solution of perturbation potential is solved in system o x y z thus these forces should be transformed in advance sen 2002 the wave loads f se shear force and bending moment at a cross section is calculated by the difference between the inertial forces m x η t and the sum of the dynamic forces f x acting on the part of the hull forward of that section x dai et al 2007 dai et al 2007 21 f se f x m x η t where m x denotes the sectional body mass matrix which is different from the global one m 3 numerical implementation 3 1 discretization the first step to solve the boundary integral equation is to discretize the boundary surfaces with a number of higher order elements for the discretization of surfaces s f ι s h s c the curvilinear quadrilateral with nine nodes is used the 3 node quadratic

function the critical part of eq 13 is to have an accurate and fast technique to compute the memory part g f and its derivatives a number of efficient methods have appeared over the years beck 1994 beck 1994 and huang 1992 huang 1992 individually developed the method with the interpolation in a table newman et al 1992 newman et al 1992 lin and yue 1990 lin and yue 1990 presented methods for the green function with polynomial approximations shan et al 2019 shan et al 2019 presented the detail deduction of series and asymptotic expansions for both the green function and its two spatial derivatives new residual functions which have been demonstrated to be more rapid decaying than the existing choice are derived straightforwardly from the resulted asymptotic formulas then an efficient algorithm with six digits of accuracy is proposed by the combination of chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions the ultimate algorithm is shown in fig 4 3 3 determination of the exact wetted surface nonlinear solution of f i and f c is over the wetted surface of the displaced hull under the incident wave surface this requires that surface s h t is determined accurately at every instant of time considering the six modes of rigid motion and in the coordinate system o x y z the offset point x 0 y 0 z 0 of hull transverse section line at initial instant of time is transformed to the new offset point x 0 y 0 z 0 at any time step 28 x 0 y 0 z 0 t x t y t z x 0 y 0 z 0 z g η 1 η 2 η 3 z g in which transformation matrix t x t y and t z are as follows 29 t x 1 0 0 0 cos η 4 sin η

the intersection of new hull transverse section line and incident wave elevation cubic b spline interpolation is introduced to discretize the instantaneous wetted hull automatically noting that the efficient de boor algorithm shi 2013 shi 2013 which avoids the calculation of b spline base function is used during the numerical interpolation 3 4 treatment of long duration simulation as mentioned above the perturbation potential is calculated based on the linearized free surface and body boundary condition in view of computational efficiency the time independent influence coefficient a i j and h i j and the coefficient related to g f in the three time convolution integrations should be calculated in advance before the time domain simulation and stored in ram memory obviously eq 13 shows that the number of memory occupied by the four coefficients related to g f in convolution integrations is significantly larger than that of the time independent ones assumed that the total number of time steps is n the element number on the control surface s c and water line γ 0 is n c and n γ 0 respectively then array dimension of the four coefficient in fortran program is 30 g f n c n c n g f n c n c n n g f n c n γ 0 n g f n c n γ 0 n x q for the transient or linear problem the simulation time will not be too long and more than a dozen periods is enough however for the nonlinear extreme value of ship wave induced load in irregular waves the time simulation should be run for at least 3 h in order to be able to predict of the probable maximum for instance for a general case without using the geometry symmetry of body n c 1000 γ 0 200 n 108000 3 h simulation with time step of 0 1 s ram memory required for storing these four coefficients with single precision is n c n c n n c n γ 0 n 2 4 1024 3 886 g b this is completely beyond the memory capability of the ordinary personal computer even if fetched from the hard disk the computational cost of so huge data calling and convolution operations is totally unacceptable which is the common feather of any potential flow approaches with transient free surface green function however it is known that the physical meaning of the convolution integral is the influence of previous flow on current flow field this meaning is used to solve the problem mentioned above in fact the larger the time interval t τ is the smaller the influence of history flow at τ on present instant t is this is illustrated by the variation of influence coefficient g f in fig 5 here p 1 p 2 and p 3 are the collection point on the control surface obviously g f decays slowly with the increase of t τ which is right for the remaining three coefficients as well therefore the lower limit of integral may be transferred from 0 to the truncated value t c and the difference t t c is constant which means the new size n of the third dimension in these arrays above in eq 30 now is t t c δ t generally this truncated size is much less than the real one n in practical application which will significantly reduce the memory storage and computational cost as well influence of this implementation on simulation results will be discussed in section 4 4 results and discussion a fortran program with the nonlinear hybrid high order element method above is developed and computations are performed for wigley 3 and s175 container hull see table 1 in the table above l p p is the ship length between perpendiculars b and d denote the beam and the draft of the ship respectively c b denotes the block coefficient for ease of discussion in the sequel the wigley 3 hull is mainly used for the comparison of the linear vertical plane motions with experimental data from journée 1992 journée 1992 s175 container hull is mainly used for the comparison of both linear and nonlinear responses in regular waves with experimental date from fonseca and guedes soares 2004 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 the half breadth y below the mean water line of wigley 3 is defined mathematically as y b 2 1 z d 2 1 2 x l 2 1 0 2 2 x l 2 convergence tests for spatial and temporal discretization are carried out before numerical validations as to the two types of hull above the recommended parameters of the present program are as follows length of free surface s f ι upstream downstream and in width is 0 4 l p p depth of control surface s c is 3 0 d the total number of quadratic element n e h n e f and n e c on s h s f ι and s c respectively is 130 583 nodes 460 1953 nodes 132 665 nodes the total number of calculated element n l c on γ 0 is 20 time step length δ t defined by number of time steps divided by encounter wave period is t e 50 for instance the mesh of s175 on the boundary surfaces is shown in fig 6 in which the exact wetted surface of hull for f k nonlinear calculation is obtained by the cubic b spline interpolation in the case of λ l p p 0 3 a w 2 m and β 180 4 1 linear motions for wigley 3 and s175 4 1 1 wigley 3 fig 7 presents the non dimensionalizd heave and pitch motion rao for wigley 3 hull where ω 0 l p p g 0 5 is the non dimensionalized circular frequency and labels us db and sw mean that the uniform stream double body and the steady ship wave linearized free surface and the corresponding m terms are adopted in the calculation the figure depicts that us linearization obtains a relatively large overestimation of the heave and pitch resonance peak at the high speed of fn 0 4 whereas db and sw linearization can achieve a more satisfactory results due to the reasonable consideration of interactions between steady flow and unsteady flow in addition there are slightly difference between results of double body flow and steady ship wave linearization the former can provide acceptable results in such high speed even though the double body flow only represents a kind of steady flow satisfying the rigid wall free surface condition this may be because of the simple and slender body 4 1 2 s175 the non dimensionalized vertical plane motion rao of s175 is illustrated in fig 8 the experimental data is the nonlinear results for a small amplitude regular wave of 2 a w λ 1 120 λ denotes the incident wave length it can be observed from this figure that the resulted curves are smooth which proves the developed program owns excellent numerical stability moreover heave and pitch of computations by db and sw are obviously in better agreement with model test data than results of us for s175 with complex form motions obtained by sw linearization are a little better than db motions computed by db linearization are satisfactory in most cases however for blunt and complex hulls such as 50500 tanker mentioned in chen et al 2018 with rankine source method sw linearization can improve results of ship motions due to the non negligible steady waves after the numerical comparisons of motion raos one investigates contours of free surface elevation ζ i ζ p on s f ι with three kinds of free surface linearization as shown in fig 9 except for the incident wave parts visible scatter wave parts can be found in this figure besides there are quite a few differences in both near and far field between us and db or sw linearization moreover after about 70 s simulation contours of free surface elevation are still stable and no distinct reflected waves are captured from the intersection of internal and external domain the results lead us to concluded that the free surface green function provides an effective radiation condition in present program 4 2 nonlinear motion and wave loads for s175 4 2 1 influences of the value of t t c as mentioned in section 3 4 the influence of the different truncated size t t c of time interval will be discussed in regular wave let t t c to be a value of 4 t e and 30 t e and the two corresponding time history of motions are compared with the original one without truncation as shown in fig 10 the heave and pitch motion are non dimensionalized by a w and k a w respectively it can be found that the result with 30 t e about 1500 time steps converges to the original one this means n in this case is 1500 instead of 108000 the wanted ram for 3 h simulations with the mesh illustrated in fig 6 is less than 5 gb which naturally will lead to an efficient convolution operations it should be noted that this numerical treatment is introduced if the number of time steps exceeds 1500 in the following calculations 4 2 2 results in regular waves next one pays attention to the comparisons of the nonlinear motion and wave loads in regular wave for s175 according to the above conclusion the steady ship wave linearized free surface and the corresponding m terms are adopted in the following calculations fig 11 and fig 12 depict the comparisons of nonlinear calculations of motions and wave loads with experimental data the wave induced vertical shear force f z non dimensionalized by ρ g b l p p a w and bending moment m y non dimensionalized by ρ g b l p p 2 a w are parameters of great importance in ship structural design the results are obtained in two kinds of incident wave steepness 2 a w λ 1 120 1 40 respectively as for the s175 container hull the low steepness 2 a w λ 1 120 means small amplitude wave and can be approximated as linear case whereas large steepness 2 a w λ 1 40 wave is considered as the severe sea states in which the nonlinear behavior of ship responses will be significant compared with the experimental data the calculated motions and wave loads are quite satisfactory furthermore it is obvious that the correlation of calculation and experiments for the two steepness are of the same order which demonstrates the developed program can capture reasonably accurate results with nonlinear behaviors one can also find that near the resonance peak raos of the heave pitch and vertical shear force decrease with the increase of wave steepness and that is quite opposite to the vertical bending moment the nonlinear phenomenon of hydrodynamic forces motions and the sectional loads of s175 hull are numerically calculated in the case of λ l p p 1 2 fn 0 25 β 180 λ l p p 1 2 corresponding to ω 0 l p p g 0 5 2 3 is chosen since the largest responses occur at or in this vicinity see figs 11 and 12 the time history of sum of the f k force and hydrostatic restoring force f i s and the hydrodynamic force from perturbation potential f p are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the label 2 m means the amplitude of regular incident wave is 2 m a relative wave elevation of 4 m is up to about 42 of the draft to which the label 1 m is similar hydrodynamic force of heave and pitch mode is non dimensionalized by the a w c 33 and k a w c 55 respectively from these two figures it is natural that the nonlinearity of f i s is more remarkable than that of f p owing to the philosophy of the f k nonlinear method although φ p is solved in the mean wetted surface the corresponding force f p in fig 14 still show quite a few nonlinearities which is due to the presence of nonlinear motions in eq 5 in addition the nonlinear motion is presented in fig 15 one can find that the nonlinear heave motion shows an uplifting of the ship as whole and the pitch motion implies the ship has trim by stern fig 16 shows the time history of f z and m y in midship with visible nonlinearities it can be found that f k nonlinear simulations present different positive and negative peak values negative peak is found to be greater than positive peak especially for the vertical bending moment as to the vertical bending moment positive and negative peaks are defined as hogging and sagging moments respectively in a conventional manner the time history of f z and m y is no longer harmonic and this is significantly different from that of hydrodynamic forces and motions moreover the time histories also show a phase gap between the linear and nonlinear calculations maybe because of the corresponding hydrodynamic force and motions with different phases see figs 13 figs 14 and 15 for the purpose of further investigating the nonlinear behavior frequency characteristics of motions and wave loads for the large wave amplitude of 2 m in figs 15 and 16 are obtained by means of the fast fourier transform fft method fig 17 and fig 18 present the fft results of motion and wave loads respectively note that the encounter wave frequency ω e of current case equals 0 13555 hz in these two figures one finds that except for the stationary component with different magnitude and the ω e component there are many of components with higher frequency which usually are integral multiples of ω e and can be called as the super harmonics in a nonlinear system the phenomenon of super harmonics is more distinct in wave loads than in rigid motions since the former has relatively large component of 2 ω e and the component of up to 5 ω e on the contrary only much smaller component of 2 ω e exists in the latter since the calculation of wave load includes rigid ship motions and integrations of hydrodynamic pressure over partial wetted hull surface this phenomenon of super harmonics presented in the vertical shear force and bending moment can be explained as follows as to the ship with large flare and high forward speed with the increase of incident wave amplitude large motions will be excited in specific wave length e g λ l p p 1 0 although the rigid ship motions can still be considered as harmonic the hydrodynamic pressure and its integration are no longer harmonic and the significant nonlinear behavior of wave load will ultimately be caused the super harmonics components mainly come from the non harmonic behavior of pressures the larger the amplitude of motions is the greater proportion the super harmonic components have that is to say under the same condition in other regular waves with much more longer or shorter length the super harmonic components shall be no longer significant and for large and blocky hulls with small flare the influence of nonlinearities may be less severe fig 19 presents filtering results of different frequency component corresponding to fig 18 it is demonstrated that the different super harmonic component has a different vibration amplitude and an independent phase angle 4 2 3 results in long crest irregular waves with the treatment of long duration simulation presented in section 3 4 linear and nonlinear time simulation of about 5 h have been carried out for s175 in the case of pm spectrum h s 4 0 m t z 12 0 s fn 0 25 β 180 the results of hydrodynamic forces motions and wave loads are shown in fig 20 with partial time interval from 200 to 400 s and it should be noted that here a w 0 5 h s and ω 0 intended for k is 2 π t z as can be seen the nonlinear behavior of wave loads is more significant than that of hydrodynamic forces and motions especially the sagging bending moment is found to be much larger than the hogging bending moment all these conclusions are similar to earlier ones in regular waves the snapshot of the resultant wave pattern from fig 20 is presented in fig 21 the wave pattern has been magnified by a factor of 7 in order to enhance the illustration in the local view of irregular wave elevation at the top left of b the location pointed by the black arrow is the current incident wave elevation one finds that its varying trend is similar to that of the boundary pointed by a red arrow moreover there are still no clear reflected waves at the intersection of internal and external domain and it demonstrates that the free surface green function provides an effective radiation condition for the irregular wave as well 4 3 computational efficiency an important aspect of this section refers to the computational efficiency looking back at the work in this paper a hybrid high order boundary element method for time simulation is presented taking the linear calculations in regular waves and with the steady ship wave linearized free surface condition as example the most three time consuming parts of the present program are the solution of the steady flow potential the precomputed influence coefficient mentioned in section 3 4 and the main time stepping procedure the used mesh with about 3200 nodes and 750 quadratic elements is shown in fig 6 length of the time simulation is 16 t e about 800 time steps for typical practical hull shapes the consumed time showed in table 2 is about quarter of an hour for one single regular wave on an ordinary personal computer with cpu clock of 3 6 ghz considering the satisfactory numerical accuracy and stability this efficiency naturally can be accepted in the practical ship design one more thing to explain is that the slightly complicated nonlinear computation takes almost the same time as this linear case 5 conclusions in the present work a three dimensional nonlinear hybrid time domain boundary element method is proposed to study the computation of linear and nonlinear motions and wave loads of advancing ships a quadratic representation of both the boundary and the unknowns on the boundary is adopted in the internal domain the rankine source method is applied with the steady ship wave as the basis flow in the external domain the transient free surface green function is computed by a combined method and is adopted to satisfy the radiation condition the f k and hydrostatic restoring forces are computed over the instantaneous wetted hull surface obtained by using the cubic b spline interpolation this paper presents a practical solution to the restriction from memory occupation and time consuming in the long duration simulation to validate the present method motions and wave loads on wigley 3 and s175 at relatively high speed are calculated and comparisons are made with the available experimental data in the literature the conclusions can be drawn through the numerical exploration 1 with the steady ship wave as the basis flow the linear and the f k nonlinear responses of wigley 3 and s175 are in favorable agreement with experimental data 2 assumed the truncated time interval t t c 30 t e problems of large memory usage and inefficient convolution operations can be solved practically in a long duration simulation 3 the algorithm combined with chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions for the transient free surface green function is efficient and effective to the solution of radiation condition in both regular and irregular waves 4 the phenomenon of super harmonics is more distinct in wave loads than in rigid motions the different super harmonic component has a different vibration amplitude and an independent phase angle 5 the stable and accurate hybrid method takes about 16 min for solutions of one single regular wave which can be considered efficient and accepted in the practical ship design 
22301,wave induced loads on advancing ships are studied by using a three dimensional nonlinear hybrid high order boundary element method with the combination of the rankine source green function applied in the internal domain and the transient free surface green function adopted in the external domain a quadratic representation of both the boundary and the unknowns on the boundary is adopted in the internal domain the forward speed problem is solved with the steady ship wave as the basis flow in the external domain an efficient algorithm combined with chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions for the transient free surface green function is adopted to the solution of radiation condition the nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic restoring forces resulted from large amplitude incident waves are taken into consideration over the instantaneous wetted hull surface this paper presents an effective solution to the problems of excessive memory occupation and large time consuming in the long duration simulation a nonlinear numerical program is originally developed and the preliminary linear motions of wigley 3 and s175 container hull at relatively high speed are analyzed furthermore the nonlinear behavior of hydrodynamic forces motions and the wave loads of s175 hull are investigated in regular and irregular seas especially the phenomenon of super harmonics in severe regular waves are highlighted thoroughly comparisons with experiment results indicate the present method owns satisfactory numerical stability accuracy and efficiency for the practical application keywords time domain green function high order element hybrid method nonlinear wave loads 1 introduction accurate prediction of motions and wave loads of ships with forward speed is one of the most demanding in wave ship interactions especially under the influence of moderate or large amplitude waves p temarel et al 2016 temarel et al 2016 in conventional view of structural design the long term extreme value of wave loads for a hull girder come from the equivalent design waves or equivalent design sea states method lloyd s register 2014 register 2014 iacs 2015 iacs 2015 therefore the nonlinear hydrodynamics of advancing ships in regular and irregular waves are significantly essential as to this problem engineering approximations are often employed in the framework of three dimensional potential flow there have been four kinds of nonlinear method for the forward speed problem since the past three decades hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 except for the most fundamental linear method datta et al 2011 datta et al 2011 bingham 1994 bingham 1994 the remaining three level 2 4 can be called froude krylov f k nonlinear liu and papanikolaou 2011 liu and papanikolaou 2011 sengupta et al 2016 sengupta et al 2016 weak scattered nonlinear kim et al 2013 kim et al 2013 and mixed eulerian lagrangian method yan and liu 2010 yan and liu 2010 to some extent although the increasing level of methods represents fewer approximations in the problem formulation and higher prediction accuracy this is at the expense of numerical stability and computational effort especially for the level 3 and 4 therefore at present state of art the level 2 the f k nonlinear method are still the most popular and practical scheme since it captures many essential nonlinear aspects with much less computer time and more stability its solution of perturbation potential is identical to the linear level but the f k force and hydrostatics are considered to be nonlinear and solved over the instantaneous wetted hull surface under the incident wave elevation as a modification of linear method the prediction accuracy of f k nonlinear method mainly depends on the linear solution of the forward speed problem in time domain in this regard considering the local hydrodynamic pressure needed in structural strength analysis the direct method which solves the linear disturbance potential problem in time domain is superior to the indirect impulse response function method nam et al 2009 nam et al 2009 liu el al 2014 liu et al 2014 which is usually only for ship motions in regular waves in the direct time domain research there are three kinds of mainstream methods which are the rankine source method the free surface green function method and the hybrid method by combining the former two methods as to the rankine source method with the simple expression 1 r as green function it is popular since it can be easily implemented and is flexible to various boundary conditions kring 1994 kring 1994 yasukawa 2002 yasukawa 2002 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 kim 2010 kim and kim 2010 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018a however an artificial damping beach is required to allow no reflection of body generated waves from the edge of the computational domain and the size of free surface domain should be several times wavelength and the discretized panel must be small enough to capture short waves as a consequence the dispersion errors stemming from the panel discretization of the free surface is inevitable and the computational cost is quite high chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b in contrast the implementation of the transient free surface green function with complex expression can avoid those problems caused by rankine source method bingham 1994 bingham 1994 lin and yue 1990 lin and yue 1990 sen 2002 sen 2002 a numerical instability for ships with large flare may be caused due to the singular and high oscillating integration over a panel or a line segment close to the free surface and solutions are presented by datta et al 2011 datta et al 2011 datta and sen 2006 datta and sen 2006 and walree 2014 walree 2014 to deal with this instability but even so it is still hard to prevent the problem thoroughly and inconvenient in practical applications besides there is another deficiency that the free surface green function are derived with the neumann kelvin linearized free surface conditions this means the effects of the steady ship wave and the double body approximation cannot be included this hypothesis is proper for a slender body however the steady flow influence is critically important for a blunt body chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 in view of drawbacks of the rankine source method and the free surface green function method a reasonable hybrid method has been developed by combining the advantages of both the rankine source method and that inherits in the free surface green function a virtual control surface is introduced to divide the fluid domain into two parts the internal domain and the external domain the rankine source function and the free surface green function are applied in the internal domain and the external domain respectively by this method only a small region of the free surface domain need to be discretized due to the free surface green function satisfying the radiation condition and the internal domain is flexible to the free surface condition with the virtual control surface meshed zhang et al 1998 zhang et al 1998 tang et al 2014 tang et al 2014 chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018c employed the hybrid method in reference coordinate which is moving at the same speed as the ship to solve non wall sided ship motions in time domain in order to make the theory free from line integral kataoka and iwashita 2004 kataoka and iwashita 2004 liu and papanikolaou 2011 liu and papanikolaou 2011 introduced a spaced fixed artificial control surface to the simulation of unsteady wave making problems nevertheless the scheme without line integral is significantly time consuming due to the time varying free surface mesh recently chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018b studied the preliminary hydrodynamic coefficient of a wigley ship by a new hybrid method with meshless control surface however it should be noted that all these methods mainly focus on the linear problem in regular waves and the nonlinear motion and hull girder wave load are not involved in addition the constant panel method and the neumann kelvin linearized conditions are employed by most of these research accordingly it is worth noting that the high order boundary element method can improve the calculation of spatial derivatives and the stability of time integration sasa and kashiwagi 2014 sasa and kashiwagi 2014 yue and liu 2007 yue and liu 2007 furthermore compared with the complete steady ship wave and double body flow the uniform stream and the corresponding m terms can poorly capture the speed effect on free surface boundary condition and body boundary condition hirdaris et al 2014 hirdaris et al 2014 when the ship is advancing with relative high speed or owns a blunt geometry the steady wave elevation is not negligible then the theoretical approximation double body flow cannot be used as the basis flow the complete steady ship wave may be more suitable for this case chen et al 2018 chen et al 2018a in this paper the time domain motions and wave loads are computed based on the f k nonlinear method wherein the perturbation velocity potential are solved from a direct three dimensional hybrid method the quadratic element is used to discretize the body surface the free surface of internal domain the virtual vertical control surface and the intersection line of the last two surfaces in the internal fluid domain the steady ship wave serves as the basis flow and the interactions between the steady and unsteady flows are reflected in more accurate numerical implementations for both linearized free surface condition and the so called m terms combinations of economized polynomials and asymptotic approximations is use to computer the free surface green function with which the radiation condition for the external domain is satisfied automatically based on the originally developed program results are presented for a mathematically defined wigley and a s175 container hull compared with available experimental data the linear and nonlinear motion and wave load in regular and irregular waves are investigated 2 mathematical formulation of hybrid high order boundary element method 2 1 statement of the problem assume that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational then the velocity potential exists a coordinate system o x y z moving with the ship at the forward speed u along the positive o x axis is introduced by letting the x y plane coincide with the mean free surface in fig 1 its origin o lies in the vertical line through the center of gravity g another body fixed system g x b y b z b is introduced by vertically shifting the origin of o x y z from o to g noting the numerical solution of the velocity potential is based on o x y z and six degree rigid motion is defined with respect to the body fixed system in coordinate system o x y z it is assumed that the fluid disturbance due to the steady forward motion and the unsteady oscillations can be separated in this case the total velocity potential φ in the fluid domain can be divided as shown below 1 φ x y z t u x φ s x y z φ i x y z t φ p x y z t where the term u x φ s is the potential due to the steady translation of the ship φ i is the unsteady incident wave potential φ p is the unsteady perturbation potential generally the time independent φ s is the steady flow potential and needs to be derived beforehand and φ p are solved through a time stepping procedure in fluid domain however φ i is always known for the case of infinite depth water and the regular linear wave the incident wave elevation and the velocity potential is 2 ζ i x y t a w cos ω e t k x cos β y sin β γ φ i x y z t g a w ω 0 e k z s i n ω e t k x cos β y sin β γ where γ initial phase a w wave amplitude ω 0 circular frequency k wave number ω e encounter frequency with ω e ω 0 k u cos β and β wave angle in addition for case of irregular waves ζ i and φ i are regarded as the sum of a series of regular wave components in a conventional manner with the present hybrid method the fluid domain ω is decomposed by a vertical and rectangular control surface s c into two parts the internal domain i where the ship is present and the external domain ii as illustrated in fig 1 the boundary surfaces of the internal domain is composed of the body mean wetted surface s h the internal free surface s f i and the control surface s c the boundary surfaces of the external domain include the control surface s c the external free surface s f ii and the infinite surface s as shown in fig 1 rankine source green function and free surface green function are distributed in the boundary surface of internal and external domain respectively the corresponding high order panel method is applied and the continuous velocity potential and its normal derivative in two domain is maintained by the dirichlet and neumann conditions imposed on s c 2 2 boundary value problem the perturbation potential φ p satisfies the governing laplace equation in ω and based on the decomposition of fluid domain φ p needs to satisfy the following boundary condition see eq 3 8 3 2 φ p 0 in ω 4 t u φ s ζ p i φ p i z φ s z 2 φ s z 2 ζ p i φ s ζ i u φ s ζ s t u φ s φ p i g ζ p i ζ s φ s φ i u φ s 1 2 φ s φ s on s f ι z 0 t u x 2 φ ιι g φ ιι z 0 o

of steady potential u is the vector of ship velocity defined as u 0 0 g is the acceleration due to gravity η j are the amplitude of corresponding motions the generalized unit normal n is defined by 9 n n 1 n 2 n 2 n 4 n 5 n 6 t n 1 n 2 n 2 n n 4 n 5 n 6 r n in which r is the position vector in order to match the linearized body boundary condition and account for the forward speed effect more accurately apart from two simplified steady flow modes uniform stream and double body flow a ship wave linearized free surface condition are employed in this study the boundary condition of the steady potential φ s is as follows 10 2 φ s 0 i n ω 2 φ s x 2 g u 2 φ s z 0 s f z 0 φ s n u n 1 o n s h φ s o 1 x 2 y 2 o n s for the lack of space further details of evaluations based on the above boundary condition are available in chen et al 2016 chen et al 2016 if the steady potential φ s is ignored the free surface condition of s f ι is degenerated into the neumann kelvin form which is identical to that of s f ι ι that is to say the free surface condition of s f ι is more general than that of s f ι ι since only the neumann kelvin linearization is adopted on s f ι ι thus it should be noted that there is an inconsistency of linear free surface condition between s f ι and s f ι ι to deal with this inconsistency a transition zone near the control surface is imposed to gradually damp φ s and ζ s in the transition zone the steady term is define by φ s ζ s φ s ζ s f d x y where f d x y is a free surface decay function showed in fig 2 l d denotes the length of transition zone x r and y r are coordinates of edge of free surface numerical experiments show terms with only steady potential and wave elevation in eq 4 will cause steady component and make no influence on dynamic responses in present work only the contribution of the dynamic effects to the linear and nonlinear responses are considered in other words the steady trim and sinkage due to the ship advancing in still water is not included in present results furthermore as to eq 5 in addition to the linear incident wave used in the present work any explicit description of φ i could be used such as stoke s higher order waves and full nonlinear numerical waves as is done in some other works singh and sen 2007 singh and sen 2007 the so called m terms results from the linearization of the body boundary condition and accounts for the interactions between the steady and the unsteady flow they are computed by 11 m 1 m 2 m 3 n u φ s m 4 m 5 m 6 n r u φ s the above formulas show that the emphasis of computing m terms is the second order derivatives of the steady flow potential φ s of which the computational method is illustrated in shao 2010 shao 2010 2 3 boundary integral equations with green s second identity since the rankine source green function 1 r does not satisfy any boundary condition all the boundary surfaces s f ι s h s c involved in the internal domain is used in the following boundary integral equation with source and dipole mixed distributions 12 c p φ p i p t s f ι s h s c φ p i q t n q 1 r φ p i q t n q 1 r d s q in which p and q denote field and source points respectively r is the distance between p and q c p is the solid angle coefficient as to the boundary integral equation of external domain according to the work of liapis 1986 liapis 1986 the integral over s is disappear due to the property of φ ιι and the integral on s f ι ι is transform into a line integral along the intersection γ 0 of s f ι ι and s c then the resulted integral equation is only related to s c and γ 0 as eq 13

from the perturbation velocity potential f i denotes the f k force f s is the hydrostatic restoring force c is the linear hydrostatic stiffness matrix the hydrodynamic pressures p p and p i are calculated by the bernoulli s equation 18 p p i ρ t u φ s φ p i it should be noted that in order to keep the numerical simulation more stable the strategy that the perturbation potential φ p is further divided into the local part φ l and the memory part φ m as the work of kring 1994 kring 1994 is adopted in this study as well as a result the hydrodynamic force f l from the local perturbation potential is expressed by a combination of three steady coefficient matrix a b c and the motion vector 19 f l a η t b η t c η t then the equation of motions is re arranged as 20 m a η t b η t c η t f i t f m t f s t for detail expression of the steady coefficient refer to kring 1994 kring 1994 in eq 20 motions and forces are defined respected to the body fixed system and the solution of perturbation potential is solved in system o x y z thus these forces should be transformed in advance sen 2002 the wave loads f se shear force and bending moment at a cross section is calculated by the difference between the inertial forces m x η t and the sum of the dynamic forces f x acting on the part of the hull forward of that section x dai et al 2007 dai et al 2007 21 f se f x m x η t where m x denotes the sectional body mass matrix which is different from the global one m 3 numerical implementation 3 1 discretization the first step to solve the boundary integral equation is to

function the critical part of eq 13 is to have an accurate and fast technique to compute the memory part g f and its derivatives a number of efficient methods have appeared over the years beck 1994 beck 1994 and huang 1992 huang 1992 individually developed the method with the interpolation in a table newman et al 1992 newman et al 1992 lin and yue 1990 lin and yue 1990 presented methods for the green function with polynomial approximations shan et al 2019 shan et al 2019 presented the detail deduction of series and asymptotic expansions for both the green function and its two spatial derivatives new residual functions which have been demonstrated to be more rapid decaying than the existing choice are derived straightforwardly from the resulted asymptotic formulas then an efficient algorithm with six digits of accuracy is proposed by the combination of chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions the ultimate algorithm is shown in fig 4 3 3 determination of the exact wetted surface nonlinear solution of f i and f c is over the wetted surface of the displaced hull under the incident wave surface this requires that surface s h t is determined accurately at every instant of time considering the six modes of rigid motion and in the coordinate system o x y z the offset point x 0 y 0 z 0 of hull transverse section line at initial instant of time is transformed to the new offset point x 0 y 0 z 0 at any time step 28 x 0 y 0 z 0 t x t y t z x 0 y 0 z 0 z g η 1 η 2 η 3 z g in which transformation matrix t x t y and t z are as follows 29 t x 1 0 0 0 cos η 4 sin η

the intersection of new hull transverse section line and incident wave elevation cubic b spline interpolation is introduced to discretize the instantaneous wetted hull automatically noting that the efficient de boor algorithm shi 2013 shi 2013 which avoids the calculation of b spline base function is used during the numerical interpolation 3 4 treatment of long duration simulation as mentioned above the perturbation potential is calculated based on the linearized free surface and body boundary condition in view of computational efficiency the time independent influence coefficient a i j and h i j and the coefficient related to g f in the three time convolution integrations should be calculated in advance before the time domain simulation and stored in ram memory obviously eq 13 shows that the number of memory occupied by the four coefficients related to g f in convolution integrations is significantly larger than that of the time independent ones assumed that the total number of time steps is n the element number on the control surface s c and water line γ 0 is n c and n γ 0 respectively then array dimension of the four coefficient in fortran program is 30 g f n c n c n g f n c n c n n g f n c n γ 0 n g f n c n γ 0 n x q for the transient or linear problem the simulation time will not be too long and more than a dozen periods is enough however for the nonlinear extreme value of ship wave induced load in irregular waves the time simulation should be run for at least 3 h in order to be able to predict of the probable maximum for instance for a general case without using the geometry symmetry of body n c 1000 γ 0 200 n 108000 3 h simulation with time step of 0 1 s ram memory required for storing these four coefficients with single precision is n c n c n n c n γ 0 n 2 4 1024 3 886 g b this is completely beyond the memory capability of the ordinary personal computer even if fetched from the hard disk the computational cost of so huge data calling and convolution operations is totally unacceptable which is the common feather of any potential flow approaches with transient free surface green function however it is known that the physical meaning of the convolution integral is the influence of previous flow on current flow field this meaning is used to solve the problem mentioned above in fact the larger the time interval t τ is the smaller the influence of history flow at τ on present instant t is this is illustrated by the variation of influence coefficient g f in fig 5 here p 1 p 2 and p 3 are the collection point on the control surface obviously g f decays slowly with the increase of t τ which is right for the remaining three coefficients as well therefore the lower limit of integral may be transferred from 0 to the truncated value t c and the difference t t c is constant which means the new size n of the third dimension in these arrays above in eq 30 now is t t c δ t generally this truncated size is much less than the real one n in practical application which will significantly reduce the memory storage and computational cost as well influence of this implementation on simulation results will be discussed in section 4 4 results and discussion a fortran program with the nonlinear hybrid high order element method above is developed and computations are performed for wigley 3 and s175 container hull see table 1 in the table above l p p is the ship length between perpendiculars b and d denote the beam and the draft of the ship respectively c b denotes the block coefficient for ease of discussion in the sequel the wigley 3 hull is mainly used for the comparison of the linear vertical plane motions with experimental data from journée 1992 journée 1992 s175 container hull is mainly used for the comparison of both linear and nonlinear responses in regular waves with experimental date from fonseca and guedes soares 2004 fonseca and guedes soares 2004 the half breadth y below the mean water line of wigley 3 is defined mathematically as y b 2 1 z d 2 1 2 x l 2 1 0 2 2 x l 2 convergence tests for spatial and temporal discretization are carried out before numerical validations as to the two types of hull above the recommended parameters of the present program are as follows length of free surface s f ι upstream downstream and in width is 0 4 l p p depth of control surface s c is 3 0 d the total number of quadratic element n e h n e f and n e c on s h s f ι and s c respectively is 130 583 nodes 460 1953 nodes 132 665 nodes the total number of calculated element n l c on γ 0 is 20 time step length δ t defined by number of time steps divided by encounter wave period is t e 50 for instance the mesh of s175 on the boundary surfaces is shown in fig 6 in which the exact wetted surface of hull for f k nonlinear calculation is obtained by the cubic b spline interpolation in the case of λ l p p 0 3 a w 2 m and β 180 4 1 linear motions for wigley 3 and s175 4 1 1 wigley 3 fig 7 presents the non dimensionalizd heave and pitch motion rao for wigley 3 hull where ω 0 l p p g 0 5 is the non dimensionalized circular frequency and labels us db and sw mean that the uniform stream double body and the steady ship wave linearized free surface and the corresponding m terms are adopted in the calculation the figure depicts that us linearization obtains a relatively large overestimation of the heave and pitch resonance peak at the high speed of fn 0 4 whereas db and sw linearization can achieve a more satisfactory results due to the reasonable consideration of interactions between steady flow and unsteady flow in addition there are slightly difference between results of double body flow and steady ship wave linearization the former can provide acceptable results in such high speed even though the double body flow only represents a kind of steady flow satisfying the rigid wall free surface condition this may be because of the simple and slender body 4 1 2 s175 the non dimensionalized vertical plane motion rao of s175 is illustrated in fig 8 the experimental data is the nonlinear results for a small amplitude regular wave of 2 a w λ 1 120 λ denotes the incident wave length it can be observed from this figure that the resulted curves are smooth which proves the developed program owns excellent numerical stability moreover heave and pitch of computations by db and sw are obviously in better agreement with model test data than results of us for s175 with complex form motions obtained by sw linearization are a little better than db motions computed by db linearization are satisfactory in most cases however for blunt and complex hulls such as 50500 tanker mentioned in chen et al 2018 with rankine source method sw linearization can improve results of ship motions due to the non negligible steady waves after the numerical comparisons of motion raos one investigates contours of free surface elevation ζ i ζ p on s f ι with three kinds of free surface linearization as shown in fig 9 except for the incident wave parts visible scatter wave parts can be found in this figure besides there are quite a few differences in both near and far field between us and db or sw linearization moreover after about 70 s simulation contours of free surface elevation are still stable and no distinct reflected waves are captured from the intersection of internal and external domain the results lead us to concluded that the free surface green function provides an effective radiation condition in present program 4 2 nonlinear motion and wave loads for s175 4 2 1 influences of the value of t t c as mentioned in section 3 4 the influence of the different truncated size t t c of time interval will be discussed in regular wave let t t c to be a value of 4 t e and 30 t e and the two corresponding time history of motions are compared with the original one without truncation as shown in fig 10 the heave and pitch motion are non dimensionalized by a w and k a w respectively it can be found that the result with 30 t e about 1500 time steps converges to the original one this means n in this case is 1500 instead of 108000 the wanted ram for 3 h simulations with the mesh illustrated in fig 6 is less than 5 gb which naturally will lead to an efficient convolution operations it should be noted that this numerical treatment is introduced if the number of time steps exceeds 1500 in the following calculations 4 2 2 results in regular waves next one pays attention to the comparisons of the nonlinear motion and wave loads in regular wave for s175 according to the above conclusion the steady ship wave linearized free surface and the corresponding m terms are adopted in the following calculations fig 11 and fig 12 depict the comparisons of nonlinear calculations of motions and wave loads with experimental data the wave induced vertical shear force f z non dimensionalized by ρ g b l p p a w and bending moment m y non dimensionalized by ρ g b l p p 2 a w are parameters of great importance in ship structural design the results are obtained in two kinds of incident wave steepness 2 a w λ 1 120 1 40 respectively as for the s175 container hull the low steepness 2 a w λ 1 120 means small amplitude wave and can be approximated as linear case whereas large steepness 2 a w λ 1 40 wave is considered as the severe sea states in which the nonlinear behavior of ship responses will be significant compared with the experimental data the calculated motions and wave loads are quite satisfactory furthermore it is obvious that the correlation of calculation and experiments for the two steepness are of the same order which demonstrates the developed program can capture reasonably accurate results with nonlinear behaviors one can also find that near the resonance peak raos of the heave pitch and vertical shear force decrease with the increase of wave steepness and that is quite opposite to the vertical bending moment the nonlinear phenomenon of hydrodynamic forces motions and the sectional loads of s175 hull are numerically calculated in the case of λ l p p 1 2 fn 0 25 β 180 λ l p p 1 2 corresponding to ω 0 l p p g 0 5 2 3 is chosen since the largest responses occur at or in this vicinity see figs 11 and 12 the time history of sum of the f k force and hydrostatic restoring force f i s and the hydrodynamic force from perturbation potential f p are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively the label 2 m means the amplitude of regular incident wave is 2 m a relative wave elevation of 4 m is up to about 42 of the draft to which the label 1 m is similar hydrodynamic force of heave and pitch mode is non dimensionalized by the a w c 33 and k a w c 55 respectively from these two figures it is natural that the nonlinearity of f i s is more remarkable than that of f p owing to the philosophy of the f k nonlinear method although φ p is solved in the mean wetted surface the corresponding force f p in fig 14 still show quite a few nonlinearities which is due to the presence of nonlinear motions in eq 5 in addition the nonlinear motion is presented in fig 15 one can find that the nonlinear heave motion shows an uplifting of the ship as whole and the pitch motion implies the ship has trim by stern fig 16 shows the time history of f z and m y in midship with visible nonlinearities it can be found that f k nonlinear simulations present different positive and negative peak values negative peak is found to be greater than positive peak especially for the vertical bending moment as to the vertical bending moment positive and negative peaks are defined as hogging and sagging moments respectively in a conventional manner the time history of f z and m y is no longer harmonic and this is significantly different from that of hydrodynamic forces and motions moreover the time histories also show a phase gap between the linear and nonlinear calculations maybe because of the corresponding hydrodynamic force and motions with different phases see figs 13 figs 14 and 15 for the purpose of further investigating the nonlinear behavior frequency characteristics of motions and wave loads for the large wave amplitude of 2 m in figs 15 and 16 are obtained by means of the fast fourier transform fft method fig 17 and fig 18 present the fft results of motion and wave loads respectively note that the encounter wave frequency ω e of current case equals 0 13555 hz in these two figures one finds that except for the stationary component with different magnitude and the ω e component there are many of components with higher frequency which usually are integral multiples of ω e and can be called as the super harmonics in a nonlinear system the phenomenon of super harmonics is more distinct in wave loads than in rigid motions since the former has relatively large component of 2 ω e and the component of up to 5 ω e on the contrary only much smaller component of 2 ω e exists in the latter since the calculation of wave load includes rigid ship motions and integrations of hydrodynamic pressure over partial wetted hull surface this phenomenon of super harmonics presented in the vertical shear force and bending moment can be explained as follows as to the ship with large flare and high forward speed with the increase of incident wave amplitude large motions will be excited in specific wave length e g λ l p p 1 0 although the rigid ship motions can still be considered as harmonic the hydrodynamic pressure and its integration are no longer harmonic and the significant nonlinear behavior of wave load will ultimately be caused the super harmonics components mainly come from the non harmonic behavior of pressures the larger the amplitude of motions is the greater proportion the super harmonic components have that is to say under the same condition in other regular waves with much more longer or shorter length the super harmonic components shall be no longer significant and for large and blocky hulls with small flare the influence of nonlinearities may be less severe fig 19 presents filtering results of different frequency component corresponding to fig 18 it is demonstrated that the different super harmonic component has a different vibration amplitude and an independent phase angle 4 2 3 results in long crest irregular waves with the treatment of long duration simulation presented in section 3 4 linear and nonlinear time simulation of about 5 h have been carried out for s175 in the case of pm spectrum h s 4 0 m t z 12 0 s fn 0 25 β 180 the results of hydrodynamic forces motions and wave loads are shown in fig 20 with partial time interval from 200 to 400 s and it should be noted that here a w 0 5 h s and ω 0 intended for k is 2 π t z as can be seen the nonlinear behavior of wave loads is more significant than that of hydrodynamic forces and motions especially the sagging bending moment is found to be much larger than the hogging bending moment all these conclusions are similar to earlier ones in regular waves the snapshot of the resultant wave pattern from fig 20 is presented in fig 21 the wave pattern has been magnified by a factor of 7 in order to enhance the illustration in the local view of irregular wave elevation at the top left of b the location pointed by the black arrow is the current incident wave elevation one finds that its varying trend is similar to that of the boundary pointed by a red arrow moreover there are still no clear reflected waves at the intersection of internal and external domain and it demonstrates that the free surface green function provides an effective radiation condition for the irregular wave as well 4 3 computational efficiency an important aspect of this section refers to the computational efficiency looking back at the work in this paper a hybrid high order boundary element method for time simulation is presented taking the linear calculations in regular waves and with the steady ship wave linearized free surface condition as example the most three time consuming parts of the present program are the solution of the steady flow potential the precomputed influence coefficient mentioned in section 3 4 and the main time stepping procedure the used mesh with about 3200 nodes and 750 quadratic elements is shown in fig 6 length of the time simulation is 16 t e about 800 time steps for typical practical hull shapes the consumed time showed in table 2 is about quarter of an hour for one single regular wave on an ordinary personal computer with cpu clock of 3 6 ghz considering the satisfactory numerical accuracy and stability this efficiency naturally can be accepted in the practical ship design one more thing to explain is that the slightly complicated nonlinear computation takes almost the same time as this linear case 5 conclusions in the present work a three dimensional nonlinear hybrid time domain boundary element method is proposed to study the computation of linear and nonlinear motions and wave loads of advancing ships a quadratic representation of both the boundary and the unknowns on the boundary is adopted in the internal domain the rankine source method is applied with the steady ship wave as the basis flow in the external domain the transient free surface green function is computed by a combined method and is adopted to satisfy the radiation condition the f k and hydrostatic restoring forces are computed over the instantaneous wetted hull surface obtained by using the cubic b spline interpolation this paper presents a practical solution to the restriction from memory occupation and time consuming in the long duration simulation to validate the present method motions and wave loads on wigley 3 and s175 at relatively high speed are calculated and comparisons are made with the available experimental data in the literature the conclusions can be drawn through the numerical exploration 1 with the steady ship wave as the basis flow the linear and the f k nonlinear responses of wigley 3 and s175 are in favorable agreement with experimental data 2 assumed the truncated time interval t t c 30 t e problems of large memory usage and inefficient convolution operations can be solved practically in a long duration simulation 3 the algorithm combined with chebyshev approximations and asymptotic expressions for the transient free surface green function is efficient and effective to the solution of radiation condition in both regular and irregular waves 4 the phenomenon of super harmonics is more distinct in wave loads than in rigid motions the different super harmonic component has a different vibration amplitude and an independent phase angle 5 the stable and accurate hybrid method takes about 16 min for solutions of one single regular wave which can be considered efficient and accepted in the practical ship design 
22302,for an offshore vessel it is common practice to evaluate the ship s operability considering working criteria inherent to motions accelerations in several operative conditions however to an offshore vessel it is also required to keep an assigned position and heading during operations or in a rough sea station keeping and seakeeping problems are not usually considered as part of the same analysis mainly because the station keeping issues are mostly related to surge sway and yaw while seakeeping deals more with heave roll and pitch it is also possible to perform combined analysis determining seakeeping criteria for dynamic positioning dp due to ship motions and use it as effective limiting environmental criteria for capability plots in any case even though seakeeping operational criteria are probably more restrictive than dp ones it can be useful to investigate the effective operability of the dp system considering all the possible wind wave combinations the vessel can encounter during his operational life together with the sea current for this purpose an enhanced and innovative procedure to establish the effective dp operability of an offshore vessel has been developed by explicitly considering the vessel geographic operational area the procedure has been tested on a pipe lay vessel plv and compared with the standard dp calculations considering all

other units during field operations are nowadays equipped with dynamic positioning dp systems in fact by moving offshore activities towards deeper waters dp system is the most suitable method to keep the required position aalberts et al 1995 and for auxiliary and support vessels dp is probably the most flexible choice also for intermediate and shallow waters therefore good station keeping performances are mandatory besides station keeping requirements the operation capability of a vessel is also determined by the level of motions during standard stationing and seagoing operations nordforsk 1987 that means both aspects should be evaluated nabergoj 2011 since the preliminary design stage even if nowadays these two characteristics are predicted separately conventional standalone dp calculations do not consider restrictions due to ship motions during field operations on the other hand seakeeping calculations for ship motions are not used to establish proper constraints to dp predictions usually the regulations for dp assessment det norske veritas dnv 2011 dnv gl 2016 abs 2014 refer only to constant environmental conditions independent with vessel heading that the dp system should be able to balance there is no reference to motion limitations perform seakeeping calculations during the dp analysis will give additional information to ship designers while evaluating the dp capability of an offshore vessel during specific operations or under different environmental conditions when designers or operators could provide motion criteria for operation or rough sea state conditions it is possible to convert these criteria into a maximum sustainable wind speed that can be used to establish an effective environmental limit for dp calculations both through a quasi steady approach mauro and nabergojtaylor 2015 or a time domain simulation serraris 2009 in the present work an alternative and innovative method has been developed to provide an enhancement to standard station keeping predictions instead of performing dp analysis according to a prescribed wind wave correlation dedicated calculations can be carried out on the wave scatter diagram of specific sea areas hogben et al 1986 in such a case the dp calculations are referring to the same conditions of seakeeping ones and not only to the combination of sea states determined by a wind wave correlation since it is the intention to develop a methodology suitable for an early design stage the quasi steady approach is used to asses vessel station keeping capability in such a way to speed up the calculation process giving the possibility to analyse quickly multiple design variations the selection of a quasi steady approach is for sure a limitation a quasi steady approach is intrinsically neglecting the dynamics involved in dp operations as e g thruster rudder dynamics palm 2018 dynamic thrust loss effects external loads variations and transient effects smogeli et al 2013 the calculation is then limited to a static balance between environmental and thruster forces it is well known that the quasi steady dp calculations overestimate the vessel capability compared to time domain simulations smogeli et al 2013 mauro and gaudiano 2018 which are more time consuming but easier to validate with full scale data smogeli et al 2015 quasi steady calculations can be enhanced by including correction factors smogeli et al 2013 modelling additional features like offset determination antheunisse et al 2016 or thrust losses arditti et al 2015 to overcome the absence of vessel dynamics unfortunately it is not possible to provide an error level on the final prediction serraris and cozijn 2017 means a universal confidence level cannot be stated to determine quasi steady prediction reliability and compliance wang et al 2018 despite these limitations quasi steady programs are still considered acceptable in an early design stage and their use is allowed by regulation societies dnv gl 2018 in the present work a newly developed methodology is proposed to perform preliminary dp calculations on a wave scatter diagram cell predictions evaluating an enhanced dp operability index for early design stage the presented method as an assumption is still considering seakeeping and station keeping dissociate however the adopted methodology ensures that both calculations refer to the same environmental modelling through this paper firstly the vessel under analysis is introduced secondly the method adopted to perform the dp calculations is described together with its compliance with regulations then the newly developed procedure is presented and compared with existing indexing methods the method is here applied to a reference vessel with multiple thruster configurations to compare the obtained results with standard dp predictions significant differences have been found and due criticism presented 2 reference vessel the newly developed procedure roughly has been tested on a generic plv nabergoj et al 2012 main dimensions in table 1 equipped with a stern stinger for s lay operations see fig 1 the vessel presents a peculiarity in the equipment because of the asymmetrical location of both stinger and dp system thrusters see table 2 for the considered vessel experimental data for the s lay condition were available to tune the seakeeping hydrodynamic model and the environmental load modelling for dp analysis the vessel has seven thrusters installed on board however only the six steerable ones represented with stars in fig 2 are part of the dp system the particular thruster configuration with asymmetrical positions and multiple sizes led to a complicate execution also of standard dp calculations an additional 150 tonnes load has been considered for pipe tensioning mauro and nabergoj 2017 to simulate s lay operations note that the presence of the asymmetric pipe load in combination with the presence of six thrusters is complicating even more the solution of the static balance between thrusters and environmental forces all the presented data and calculations refer to a reference system centred on the ship midpoint o with x axis positive to the bow 0 and y axis positive to starboard 90 for angles and moments clockwise rotations are considered positive the adopted reference system is reported in fig 3 with the intention to analyse more than one thruster configuration in table 2 two additional options are listed being named c1 and c2 original configuration c0 cases c1 and c2 got the same thruster s positions of c0 the thruster sizes change considering the adoption of smaller thrusters 3 standard dynamic positioning calculations two distinct strategies can be used to solve the station keeping problem the first option is to simulate the onboard dp system and run specific time domain simulations serraris 2009 the second one consists in performing quasi steady calculations the first case requires a detailed definition of the vessel characteristics and onboard systems here the computational time became an issue since to establish the vessel capability multiple time domain simulations have to run flint and stephens 2008 the second case requires fewer input data but is a simplification of the problem that may lead to possible overestimation of the vessel station keeping capability however for an evaluation of dp capability in the early design stage the quasi steady approach can be considered as a valid tool to decrease calculation time wichers et al 2011 giving a sufficient amount of information on dp capability smogeli et al 2013 and allowing to investigate and compare multiple design solutions in short time once a quasi steady approach is selected the solution of the problem consists of determining the thrust distribution for each environmental case ensuring the static balance of forces and moments acting on the vessel because of the redundancy level required by dedicated regulations dnv gl 2016 and guidelines imo 1994 lead to the installation of more thrusters devices than necessary for operations the thrust allocation problem results more difficult than a simple static balance the core of a quasi steady dp calculation is the solution of the following equilibrium system 1 i 1 n f x i f x e x t i 1 n f y i f y e x t i 1 n f y i x t i f x i y t i m z e x t where f x i s and f y i s are the delivered forces in the x axis and y axis direction respectively and x t i and y t i are the thruster locations from the vessel s midpoint the right terms of system 1 are the external loads acting on the vessel typically the main external loads are due to the environment wind wave current and ice but in the considered case of the plv also the pipe load needs to be taken into account system 1 presents infinite feasible solutions having more unknowns than equations thus its solution requires the application of a dedicated algorithm 3 1 thrust allocation algorithm the solution of the equilibrium system implies the implementation of a thrust allocation algorithm the most common way to avoid the overestimation problem in system 1 is to adopt optimisation techniques that requires the adoption of an objective function like minimum power or fuel consumption subject to constraints like forbidden zones and thrust saturation there are multiple algorithms which can be applied to determine an optimal thrust allocation mauro and nabergoj 2015 all suitable to predict the dp capability of the vessel but with different accuracy levels starting from simple optimisation procedures as the moore penrose pseudo inverse matrix the complexity of the algorithm can raise considering quadratic programming techniques wang et al 2018 johanson et al 2014 or fully non linear optimisations daalen et al 2011 mauro and duranti 2018 up to the application of genetic algorithms zhao et al 2010 mauro and nabergoj 2016 here the solver adopted for dp calculations is using a thrust allocation procedure based on a genetic algorithm the algorithm evaluates also thrust losses due to thruster hull and thruster thruster interactions with automatic detection of interaction areas mauro and nabergoj 2016 3 2 external loads to solve the force balance on the vessel the evaluation of the quasi steady loads acting on it is necessary the loads to consider are the environmental ones given by the action of wind waves and current together with other external loads given by mooring lines raisers or connected pipes for the plv vessel the external loads have the following decomposition 2 f x e x t f x w i n d f x w a v e f x c u r r f x p i p e 3 f y e x t f y w i n d f y w a v e f y c u r r f y p i p e 4 m z e x t m z w i n d m z w a v e m z c u r r m z p i p e the pipe load is constant with the vessel heading however for the environmental loads it is necessary to determine them for each encounter angle the vessel will face during operations it is common practice to use non dimensional coefficients for the characterisation of the environmental loads giving more flexibility for the reproduction of multiple environmental conditions here the non dimensional coefficients for wind and current and the quadratic transfer functions for waves derive from model experiments during the experiments also the stinger was fitted on the model resulting in an exhaustive description of the real vessel geometry during pipe lay operations it is possible to combine the environmental loads in different ways e g by changing their directions or their relative contributions according to classification societies rules guidelines are differing from some peculiarities on loads coefficients but they almost agree that environmental loads should be considered concurrent means coming from the same direction the current speed is constant while wind speed v w and wave height and period change according to specific wind wave correlations the developed dp solver changes the environmental conditions according to the guideline selected for the analysis ensuring the compliance of the obtained results with the regulation 3 3 dynamic allowances the nature of a quasi steady dp calculation leads to the overestimation of the final station keeping ability of a vessel serraris 2009 it is possible to decrease this overestimation by using a dynamic allowance smogeli et al 2013 in such a way all the dynamic effects neglected by a quasi steady approach can be approximatively taken into account considering an addition to the external loads the execution of time domain simulations on the same vessel led to a possible estimation of the dynamic allowance mauro and gaudiano 2018 however without time domain calculations use can be made of guidelines given by regulations dnv gl 2016 in the present study a dynamic allowance coefficient c a d y n is used to represent the allowances taken into account in the analysed cases in fig 4 a comparison is reported between the capability plots for plv s configurations c0 c1 and c2 using c a d y n 1 25 3 4 dp capability evaluation the representation of dp capability predictions can follow several standards imca and specifications for dp 2000 dnv gl 2018 kerkeni et al 2015 the different modes refer to multiple conventions on environmental modelling and specific case studies moreover due to the safety requirements of the dp system also failure conditions have to be taken into account based on the failure definition imca and m 2005 a dp system should be analysed to find the worst failure regulations divide vessels into three possible dp classes considering the number of failures the system can accept by keeping position with a prescribed environment of particular interest is the possibility to have methods giving a rank to the analysed conditions for early design stage for this purpose dnv introduced the environmental regularity number ern dnv 2004 dnv 2013 nowadays more recent dnv gl regulations dnv gl 2016 dnv gl 2018 provide a ranking on vessel capability according to the typology of calculation performed these regulations prescribe the adoption of a specific environmental modelling which consists of the concurrent action of wind wave and current current speed is supposed to be constant with the heading angle while wind speed and wave height and period are changing with a prescribed wind wave correlation ern regulation allowed using environmental loads coming from multiple sources and was giving no restrictions on the algorithm to use for thrust allocation on the contrary dnv gl new regulations define more notation levels level 1 notation implies the use of standard environmental loads standards wind wave correlation and a c a d y n of 1 25 moreover it requires also the inclusion of forbidden zones and thruster losses for hull and appendages interaction evaluated according to the regulation or with an equivalent method level 2 notation allows the adoption of environmental coefficients coming from other sources experiments regressions databases and the use of a c a d y n according to experience or derived from time domain simulations level 2 site notation introduces the possibility to consider different wind waves correlations and the inclusion of external loads however level 2 site is not giving an official ranking but just a comparison with level 2 prediction karlsen et al 2016 the regulations clearly state that the proposed methods are non conservative calculations for the establishment of a minimum dp acceptance level for benchmarking the obtained results are not intended to be used in operational studies 3 5 dp solver compliance with dnv gl regulations the developed dp prediction program uses a different allocation algorithm than dnv prescribed one therefore a test is performed on the plv to ensure procedure compliance with regulations comparing the results with dnv on line tool nguyen 2018 the obtained predictions for level 1 calculation see fig 5 show a good agreement with dnv tool giving the confidence that the developed solver is suitable for early design stage 4 scatter diagram calculations the aim of a preliminary dp analysis is also to determine the station keeping operability of the vessel for the geographic area of interest in terms of environment limiting curves this kind of computation is a prediction for seakeeping investigations but in case of a dp analysis a similar assessment is not obvious because standard regulations and combined predictions mauro and nabergojtaylor 2015 are not able to define the vessel s capability for any combination of environment and heading conditions therefore instead of performing basic dp predictions for capability plot determination here it is proposed how to execute dp calculations for each combination of significant wave height h 1 3 and zero crossing period t z for an operational area calculations can be carried out for each heading evaluating whether the dp system is able or not to keep the vessel in position with the selected sea environment this is an original approach which evaluates dp limiting curves directly on a scatter diagram here for sake of simplicity the dp calculation remains dissociated from the seakeeping one but both they refer to the same working environment 4 1 environment definition standard calculations use generic wind wave correlations such as ern dnv gl or imca recommended ones or pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 derived formulations wind wave correlations establish h 1 3 t z and v w triplets corresponding to a few cells in the wave scatter diagram as an example in fig 6 the mentioned correlations are compared considering the north sea area 11 scatter diagram from fig 6 it appears clear that a recommended wind wave correlation is not sufficient to model the complete sea area however a scatter diagram defines only the wave conditions representative of a selected area thus the definition of related combinations for wind and current is necessary determine the wind speed associated to a specific h 1 3 and t z is not an easy task to solve and needs a dedicated analysis nevertheless in an early design stage some approximations can be made to simplify this issue by modelling as an assumption the sea state with a pierson moskowitz spectrum the following relations can be used to correlate irregular wave parameters with wind speed 5 t z 2 π g π β 4 v w 6 h 1 3 2 g α β v w 2 where α and β are two constants set to 0 0081 and 0 74 respectively equations 5 and 6 are representative of the pierson moskowitz wind wave correlation giving a single solution only for the curve presented in fig 6 in the remaining scatter diagram part the two equations give distinct v w values data analysis performed in the oceanography field have always found a strong correlation between h 1 3 and v w correlations involving t z are not easy to derive and maybe could change by sea area from this consideration it is reasonable to evaluate the wind speed only with equation 6 neglecting t z dependency taking into account equation 5 then for each h 1 3 t z couple the following relation should be checked 7 h 1 3 g π β 2 π 2 α β t z 2 once relation 7 is satisfied equation 5 estimates a higher wind speed value than equation 6 when the relation is not satisfied the opposite occurs therefore to consider also t z dependency a possible solution for wind speed determination is given by equation 5 when 7 is satisfied and equation 6 when 7 is not satisfied then the maximum possible wind speed is determined for each h 1 3 t z couple this approximation is a safety side approach probably overestimating the wind loads acceptable for an early design stage as an example the same process can be executed with a jonswap spectrum being pierson moskowitz and imca correlations similar in case specific wind wave correlations are at disposal they can be used to model the wind speed in the analysed area another issue is the current load in this paper the same settings of imca standards have been adopted considering a constant current speed collinear with wind and waves 4 2 dp operability index determination having determined the environmental condition settings is then possible to perform dp calculations for each cell of the scatter diagram for each wave condition and vessel heading it is possible to evaluate if the dp system keeps the position or not then considering the wave occurrences the operability in the selected sea area can be calculated according to the following formulation 8 o p d p i 1 n h p h i i 1 n w p w i i d p where p h is the probability associated with each n h vessel headings and p w is the probability associated with each n w specific wave conditions in case the vessel operation requires a preferential heading then p h should be given by the operator otherwise it is assumed uniform through the whole heading range the function i d p is defined as 9 i d p 1 when dp system holds position 0 when dp system loses position with this kind of approach dp critical curves can be drawn on the scatter diagram to obtain a visual indication of the vessel operability at each heading they represent the environmental limit of the dp system considering the combined effect of wind waves and current as reported in fig 7 the critical curves refer to multiple heading angles taking into account also different failure conditions in particular fig 7 refers to an intact a dp2 and dp3 case respectively for the c0 configuration of the plv by increasing the failure level the critical curves became lower visibly decreasing the operability environment of the vessel to evaluate the o p d p index according to equation 8 it is necessary to determine the function i d p defined in equation 9 per each cell of the scatter diagram and at each heading required by the dp calculation then applying equation 8 it is possible to calculate the final o p d p of the vessel for the selected area the developed procedure considers the headings from 0 to 360 in the step of 5 figs from 8 to 10 illustrate the i d p function determination for the intact and failure conditions previously shown in fig 7 reporting the values of p w i d p determined per each angle for simplicity of representation the graphs show the headings in steps of 60 considering a uniform p h for all the headings then the calculated o p d p is 99 1 for the intact condition 97 8 for the dp2 case and 93 2 for the dp3 one thus confirming the visual observation in this first example dynamic allowances were neglected imposing a c a d y n equal to 1 00 it is then necessary to study the variability of the index with different allowance levels 4 3 dynamic effects on o p d p index as already mentioned quasi steady calculations are overestimating the final capability of the vessel compared to a time domain simulation in standard dp analysis the dynamic allowances are considered to take care of all the dynamic effects that are neglected by a quasi steady approach then the variability of the critical curves and consequently of the o p d p index has been investigated against c a d y n coefficient on a range between 1 00 and 1 75 to consider dynamic effects the study has been carried out not only for the intact condition but also for the possible failure conditions representative of dp2 and dp3 cases that leads to the evaluation of 21 cases on plv s c0 configuration 1 for intact 6 for dp2 and 14 for dp3 conditions each case has four c a d y n values from 1 00 to 1 75 in a step of 0 25 resulting in a total of 84 operability estimates all the calculations evaluate 36 headings from 0 to 350 every 10 however to simplify the graphical representation only the 6 starboard heading curves have been plotted on the scatter diagrams the results reported in figs 11 13 highlight the strong dependence of the critical curves from the c a d y n coefficient the minimum sustainable h 1 3 drops down of about 1 5 m while considering the lowest limiting curve as a reference this trend appears for intact and failure conditions however the drop down occurs case by case in different areas of the scatter diagram the failure cases limiting curves especially the dp3 ones exclude from the sustainable dp environment cells with a higher p w value compared to intact condition then the o p d p index variation with the c a d y n has different trends in the analysed cases fig 14 shows a resume of the variability plotting o p d p index against the c a d y n value for intact and worst dp2 and dp3 failures for intact condition the operability level remains high however for failure conditions the index reduction is significant its quantification is of about 10 for the intact 20 for the dp2 and 50 for the dp3 case as an example table 3 reports the o p d p index evaluated for all the 21 cases of configuration c0 considering a c a d y n of 1 00 and 1 25 here the o p d p variations between the same failure class cases remain around 5 having the same reduction of the reported worst case for such a reason once it is possible to estimate the dynamic allowances correctly it is suggested to use a proper c a d y n value in an early design stage a c a d y n of at least 1 25 as per dnv gl level 1 calculations is advisable 4 4 differences with existing methods the newly proposed method is a scatter diagram cell based approach suitable to perform dp analysis by systematically changing the wave conditions moreover the procedure provides dp critical curves defining the sustainable dp environment for a specific sea area the developed procedure being referred to a wave scatter diagram gives more information on wave parameters i e h 1 3 and t z rather than on wind speed in conventional dp calculations it is usual to represent the capability plots as a function of the maximum sustainable wind speed the vessel can face the proposed dp critical curves are not showing a wind limit but a wave one even though wind speed is implicitly considered as a function of wave parameters to determine the wind loads however the dp critical curves present a minimum at each heading angle being representative of the worst h 1 3 t z combination for the analysed vessel in these points the wind speed can be calculated according to equations 5 and 6 and represented on a polar plot in fig 15 the results for c0 configuration in intact condition are reported to compare the standard dp capability and the wind associated with the worse wave condition given by critical curves here the associated wind speed for the new approach is always lower than the one of standard capability plot this fact underlines that the conventional capability plot is not representative of the maximum sustainable wind a vessel can face because critical conditions may occur at lower wind speeds but with a different associated wave parameters combination the standard calculation methods or prescribed ones like ern and dnv gl provide a notation according to predefined wind wave correlations invariant with the sea area only the level 2 site calculation by dnv gl takes into account a specific environment however the procedure is still related to a conventional capability plot and did not provide a notation number in table 4 a summary is given on the inputs and expected result differences of the standard quasi steady calculation methods classification ones and o p d p index here no reference is made to combined predictions since the motion limitations are not changing the way to determine dp capability outputs it is evident that all the standard dp calculations are carried out only for a specific wind wave correlation curve moreover regulation calculations refer only to the north sea area then it is not possible to establish whether the dp system is suitable to keep the position for all the environmental conditions of a specific sea area this assessment is possible only with a cell based approach 5 the o p d p index as a design attribute the developed dp operability index can evaluate the operability of a dp system during the early design stage as mentioned the goal of the method is also to establish a rank between different design solutions then a designer can choose the preferable option based on the evaluated index however the regulation methods like ern and level 1 level 2 dnv gl notations are also used to compare multiple calculations here the o p d p index and the regulation notations are used to compare different design solutions on this purpose the plv s configurations c0 c1 and c2 already described in table 2 have been used to test the three mentioned ranking methods c0 refers to the original vessel configuration c1 is a design solution with the same installed power of c0 but thrusters from 2 to 5 have the same size c2 is an underpowered configuration with thrusters from 2 to 5 derated compared to c1 configuration the thruster positions remain fixed through the analysed cases a c a d y n of 1 25 and a current speed of 1 944 knots concurrent with wind and waves have been adopted to perform o p d p evaluation the calculations refer to the north sea area to be compliant with ern and level 2 calculations a jonswap spectrum is then used to estimate wave loads the analysis is performed considering both dp2 and dp3 failures level 2 and ern calculations are done with c a d y n 1 25 to facilitate the comparison with o p d p index figs 16 18 show the intact dp2 and dp3 cases for the three tested configurations for intact and dp2 condition the limiting curves for configurations c0 and c1 are comparable the o p d p index values confirm the observed trend assessing variations between the two configurations of 1 for intact and 2 for dp2 case c2 is in both cases the worst solution for dp3 condition the configuration c1 appears to be the best choice having an index 5 higher than configuration c0 also here the c2 is the worst solution in table 5 the index values are listed together with the notations coming out from the regulation methods the level 2 calculations state no difference between configuration c0 and c1 while ern is giving preference to configuration c0 also for the dp3 failure case according to the calculated indexes ern suggests that configuration c0 is the best one followed by c1 and c2 for level 2 calculation c0 and c1 are equivalent while c2 is the worst solution however considering o p d p index the choice between configuration c0 and c1 has to be discussed in detail by designers in fact the two configurations present similar operability for intact and dp2 case but configuration c1 has higher operability for dp3 failure moreover the o p d p index refers to a specific area a less severe area will increase the operability so that also configuration c2 can be considered suitable by designers final considerations on dp system derating can be made only analysing also the limiting motions then the designers operators can select if it is convenient or not derate the dp system 6 conclusions the possibility to evaluate alternative design solutions has been studied on three different thruster size configurations the obtained results show that the proposed dp operability index is capable to give a site oriented ranking between the different solutions moreover the o p d p index is capable to give more detailed information on the analysed systems with respect to standard evaluation methods the newly proposed and implemented calculation method is based on certain approximations that still need to be firmly confirmed in fact further investigations complying the analysis of environmental records have to be done regarding the effective correlation between average wind speed and generated wave in a scatter diagram for such a reason the proposed index cannot be considered as an absolute evaluation number but can be suitably used to compare different feasible design solutions in various operative scenarios already in early design stage credit author statement f mauro conceptualization methodology software

22302,for an offshore vessel it is common practice to evaluate the ship s operability considering working criteria inherent to motions accelerations in several operative conditions however to an offshore vessel it is also required to keep an assigned position and heading during operations or in a rough sea station keeping and seakeeping problems are not usually considered as part of the same analysis mainly because the station keeping issues are mostly related to surge sway and yaw while seakeeping deals more with heave roll and pitch it is also possible to perform combined analysis determining seakeeping criteria for dynamic positioning dp due to ship motions and use it as effective limiting environmental criteria for capability plots in any case even though seakeeping operational criteria are probably more restrictive than dp ones it can be useful to investigate the effective operability of the dp system considering all the possible wind wave combinations the vessel can encounter during his operational life together with the sea current for this purpose an enhanced and innovative procedure to establish the effective dp operability of an offshore vessel has been developed by explicitly considering the vessel geographic operational area the procedure has been tested on a pipe lay vessel plv and compared with the standard dp calculations considering all

the required position aalberts et al 1995 and for auxiliary and support vessels dp is probably the most flexible choice also for intermediate and shallow waters therefore good station keeping performances are mandatory besides station keeping requirements the operation capability of a vessel is also determined by the level of motions during standard stationing and seagoing operations nordforsk 1987 that means both aspects should be evaluated nabergoj 2011 since the preliminary design stage even if nowadays these two characteristics are predicted separately conventional standalone dp calculations do not consider restrictions due to ship motions during field operations on the other hand seakeeping calculations for ship motions are not used to establish proper constraints to dp predictions usually the regulations for dp assessment det norske veritas dnv 2011 dnv gl 2016 abs 2014 refer only to constant environmental conditions independent with vessel heading that the dp system should be able to balance there is no reference to motion limitations perform seakeeping calculations during the dp analysis will give additional information to ship designers while evaluating the dp capability of an offshore vessel during specific operations or under different environmental conditions when designers or operators could provide motion criteria for operation or rough sea state conditions it is possible to convert these criteria into a maximum sustainable wind speed that can be used to establish an effective environmental limit for dp calculations both through a quasi steady approach mauro and nabergojtaylor 2015 or a time domain simulation serraris 2009 in the present work an alternative and innovative method has been developed to provide an enhancement to standard station keeping predictions instead of performing dp analysis according to a prescribed wind wave correlation dedicated calculations can be carried out on the wave scatter diagram of specific sea areas hogben et al 1986 in such a case the dp calculations are referring to the same conditions of seakeeping ones and not only to the combination of sea states determined by a wind wave correlation since it is the intention to develop a methodology suitable for an early design stage the quasi steady approach is used to asses vessel station keeping capability in such a way to speed up the calculation process giving the possibility to analyse quickly multiple design variations the selection of a quasi steady approach is for sure a limitation a quasi steady approach is intrinsically neglecting the dynamics involved in dp operations as e g thruster rudder dynamics palm 2018 dynamic thrust loss effects external loads variations and transient effects smogeli et al 2013 the calculation is then limited to a static balance between environmental and thruster forces it is well known that the quasi steady dp calculations overestimate the vessel capability compared to time domain simulations smogeli et al 2013 mauro and gaudiano 2018 which are more time consuming but easier to validate with full scale data smogeli et al 2015 quasi steady calculations can be enhanced by including correction factors smogeli et al 2013 modelling additional features like offset determination antheunisse et al 2016 or thrust losses arditti et al 2015 to overcome the absence of vessel dynamics unfortunately it is not possible to provide an error level on the final prediction serraris and cozijn 2017 means a universal confidence level cannot be stated to determine quasi steady prediction reliability and compliance wang et al 2018 despite these limitations quasi steady programs are still considered acceptable in an early design stage and their use is allowed by regulation

operability index for early design stage the presented method as an assumption is still considering seakeeping and station keeping dissociate however the adopted methodology ensures that both calculations refer to the same environmental modelling through this paper firstly the vessel under analysis is introduced secondly the method adopted to perform the dp calculations is described together with its compliance with regulations then the newly developed procedure is presented and compared with existing indexing methods the method is here applied to a reference vessel with multiple thruster configurations to compare the obtained results with standard dp predictions significant differences have been found and due criticism presented 2 reference vessel the newly developed procedure roughly has been tested on a generic plv nabergoj et al 2012 main dimensions in table 1 equipped with a stern stinger for s lay operations see fig 1 the vessel presents a peculiarity in the equipment because of the asymmetrical location of both stinger and dp system thrusters see table 2 for the considered vessel experimental data for the s lay condition were available to tune the seakeeping hydrodynamic model and the environmental load modelling for dp analysis the vessel has seven thrusters installed on board however only the six steerable ones represented with stars in fig 2 are part of the dp system the particular thruster configuration with asymmetrical positions and multiple sizes led to a complicate execution also of standard dp calculations an additional 150 tonnes load has been considered for pipe tensioning mauro and nabergoj 2017 to simulate s lay operations note that the presence of the asymmetric pipe load in combination with the presence of six thrusters is complicating even more the solution of the static balance between thrusters and environmental forces all the presented data and calculations refer to a reference system centred on the ship midpoint o with x axis positive to the bow 0 and y axis positive to starboard 90 for angles and moments clockwise rotations are considered positive the adopted reference system is reported in fig 3 with the intention to analyse more than one thruster configuration in table 2 two additional options are listed being named c1 and c2 original configuration c0 cases c1 and c2 got the same thruster s positions of c0 the thruster sizes change considering the adoption of smaller thrusters 3 standard dynamic positioning calculations two distinct strategies can be used to solve the station keeping problem the first option is to simulate the onboard dp system and run specific time domain simulations serraris 2009 the second one consists in performing quasi steady calculations the first case requires a detailed definition of the vessel characteristics and onboard systems here the computational time became an issue since to establish the vessel capability multiple time domain simulations have to run flint and stephens 2008 the second case requires fewer input data but is a simplification of the problem that may lead to possible overestimation of the vessel station keeping capability however for an evaluation of dp capability in the early design stage the quasi steady approach can be considered as a valid tool to decrease calculation time wichers et al 2011 giving a sufficient amount of information on dp capability smogeli et al 2013 and allowing to investigate and compare multiple design solutions in short time once a quasi steady approach is selected the solution of the problem consists of determining the thrust distribution for each environmental case ensuring the static balance of forces and moments acting on the vessel because of the redundancy level required by dedicated regulations dnv gl 2016 and guidelines imo 1994 lead to the installation of more thrusters devices than necessary for operations the thrust allocation problem results more difficult than a simple static balance the core of a quasi steady dp calculation is the solution of the following equilibrium system 1 i 1 n f x i f x e x t i 1 n f y i f y e x t i 1 n f y i x t i f x i y t i m z e x t where f x i s and f y i s are the delivered forces in the x axis and y axis direction respectively and x t i and y t i are the thruster locations from the vessel s midpoint the right terms of system 1 are the external loads acting on the vessel typically the main external loads are due to the environment wind wave current and ice but in the considered case of the plv also the pipe load needs to be taken into account system 1 presents infinite feasible solutions having more unknowns than equations thus its solution requires the application of a dedicated algorithm 3 1 thrust allocation algorithm the solution of the equilibrium system implies the implementation of a thrust allocation algorithm the most common way to avoid the overestimation problem in system 1 is to adopt optimisation techniques that requires the adoption of an objective function like minimum power or fuel consumption subject to constraints like forbidden zones and thrust saturation there are multiple algorithms which can be applied to determine an optimal thrust allocation mauro and nabergoj 2015 all suitable to predict the dp capability of the vessel but with different accuracy levels starting from simple optimisation procedures as the moore penrose pseudo inverse matrix the complexity of the algorithm can raise considering quadratic programming techniques wang et al 2018 johanson et al 2014 or fully non linear optimisations daalen et al 2011 mauro and duranti 2018 up to the application of genetic algorithms zhao et al 2010 mauro and nabergoj 2016 here the solver adopted for dp calculations is using a thrust allocation procedure based on a genetic algorithm the algorithm evaluates also thrust losses due to thruster hull and thruster thruster interactions with automatic detection of interaction areas mauro and nabergoj 2016 3 2 external loads to solve the force balance on the vessel the evaluation of the quasi steady loads acting on it is necessary the loads to consider are the environmental ones given by the action of wind waves and current together with other external loads given by mooring lines raisers or connected pipes for the plv vessel the external loads have the following decomposition 2 f x e x t f x w i n d f x w a v e f x c u r r f x p i p e 3 f y e x t f y w i n d f y w a v e f y c u r r f y p i p e 4 m z e x t m z w i n d m z w a v e m z c u r r m z p i p e the pipe load is constant with the vessel heading however for the environmental loads it is necessary to determine them for each encounter angle the vessel will face during operations it is common practice to use non dimensional coefficients for the characterisation of the environmental loads giving more flexibility for the reproduction of multiple environmental conditions here the non dimensional coefficients for wind and current and the quadratic transfer functions for waves derive from model experiments during the experiments also the stinger was fitted on the model resulting in an exhaustive description of the real vessel geometry during pipe lay operations it is possible to combine the environmental loads in different ways e g by changing their directions or their relative contributions according to classification societies rules guidelines are differing from some peculiarities on loads coefficients but they almost agree that environmental loads should be considered concurrent means coming from the same direction the current speed is constant while wind speed v w and wave height and period change according to specific wind wave correlations the developed dp solver changes the environmental conditions according to the guideline selected for the analysis ensuring the compliance of the obtained results with the regulation 3 3 dynamic allowances the nature of a quasi steady dp calculation leads to the overestimation of the final station keeping ability of a vessel serraris 2009 it is possible to decrease this overestimation by using a dynamic allowance smogeli et al 2013 in such a way all the dynamic effects neglected by a quasi steady approach can be approximatively taken into account considering an addition to the external loads the execution of time domain simulations on the same vessel led to a possible estimation of the dynamic allowance mauro and gaudiano 2018 however without time domain calculations use can be made of guidelines given by regulations dnv gl 2016 in the present study a dynamic allowance coefficient c a d y n is used to represent the allowances taken into account in the analysed cases in fig 4 a comparison is reported between the capability plots for plv s configurations c0 c1 and c2 using c a d y n 1 25 3 4 dp capability evaluation the representation of dp capability predictions can follow several standards imca and specifications for dp 2000 dnv gl 2018 kerkeni et al 2015 the different modes refer to multiple conventions on environmental modelling and specific case studies moreover due to the safety requirements of the dp system also failure conditions have to be taken into account based on the failure definition imca and m 2005 a dp system should be analysed to find the worst failure regulations divide vessels into three possible dp classes considering the number of failures the system can accept by keeping position with a prescribed environment of particular interest is the possibility to have methods giving a rank to the analysed conditions for early design stage for this purpose dnv introduced the environmental regularity number ern dnv 2004 dnv 2013 nowadays more recent dnv gl regulations dnv gl 2016 dnv gl 2018 provide a ranking on vessel capability according to the typology of calculation performed these regulations prescribe the adoption of a specific environmental modelling which consists of the concurrent action of wind wave and current current speed is supposed to be constant with the heading angle while wind speed and wave height and period are changing with a prescribed wind wave correlation ern regulation allowed using environmental loads coming from multiple sources and was giving no restrictions on the algorithm to use for thrust allocation on the contrary dnv gl new regulations define more notation levels level 1 notation implies the use of standard environmental loads standards wind wave correlation and a c a d y n of 1 25 moreover it requires also the inclusion of forbidden zones and thruster losses for hull and appendages interaction evaluated according to the regulation or with an equivalent method level 2 notation allows the adoption of environmental coefficients coming from other sources experiments regressions databases and the use of a c a d y n according to experience or derived from time domain simulations level 2 site notation introduces the possibility to consider different wind waves correlations and the inclusion of external loads however level 2 site is not giving an official ranking but just a comparison with level 2 prediction karlsen et al 2016 the regulations clearly state that the proposed methods are non conservative calculations for the establishment of a minimum dp acceptance level for benchmarking the obtained results are not intended to be used in operational studies 3 5 dp solver compliance with dnv gl regulations the developed dp prediction program uses a different allocation algorithm than dnv prescribed one therefore a test is performed on the plv to ensure procedure compliance with regulations comparing the results with dnv on line tool nguyen 2018 the obtained predictions for level 1 calculation see fig 5 show a good agreement with dnv tool giving the confidence that the developed solver is suitable for early design stage 4 scatter diagram calculations the aim of a preliminary dp analysis is also to determine the station keeping operability of the vessel for the geographic area of interest in terms of environment limiting curves this kind of computation is a prediction for seakeeping investigations but in case of a dp analysis a similar assessment is not obvious because standard regulations and combined predictions mauro and nabergojtaylor 2015 are not able to define the vessel s capability for any combination of environment and heading conditions therefore instead of performing basic dp predictions for capability plot determination here it is proposed how to execute dp calculations for each combination of significant wave height h 1 3 and zero crossing period t z for an operational area calculations can be carried out for each heading evaluating whether the dp system is able or not to keep the vessel in position with the selected sea environment this is an original approach which evaluates dp limiting curves directly on a scatter diagram here for sake of simplicity the dp calculation remains dissociated from the seakeeping one but both they refer to the same working environment 4 1 environment definition standard calculations use generic wind wave correlations such as ern dnv gl or imca recommended ones or pierson moskowitz spectrum pierson and moskowitz 1964 derived formulations wind wave correlations establish h 1 3 t z and v w triplets corresponding to a few cells in the wave scatter diagram as an example in fig 6 the mentioned correlations are compared considering the north sea area 11 scatter diagram from fig 6 it appears clear that a recommended wind wave correlation is not sufficient to model the complete sea area however a scatter diagram defines only the wave conditions representative of a selected area thus the definition of related combinations for wind and current is necessary determine the wind speed associated to a specific h 1 3 and t z is not an easy task to solve and needs a dedicated analysis nevertheless in an early design stage some approximations can be made to simplify this issue by modelling as an assumption the sea state with a pierson moskowitz spectrum the following relations can be used to correlate irregular wave parameters with wind speed 5 t z 2 π g π β 4 v w 6 h 1 3 2 g α β v w 2 where α and β are two constants set to 0 0081 and 0 74 respectively equations 5 and 6 are representative of the pierson moskowitz wind wave correlation giving a single solution only for the curve presented in fig 6 in the remaining scatter diagram part the two equations give distinct v w values data analysis performed in the oceanography field have always found a strong correlation between h 1 3 and v w correlations involving t z are not easy to derive and maybe could change by sea area from this consideration it is reasonable to evaluate the wind speed only with equation 6 neglecting t z dependency taking into account equation 5 then for each h 1 3 t z couple the following relation should be checked 7 h 1 3 g π β 2 π 2 α β t z 2 once relation 7 is satisfied equation 5 estimates a higher wind speed value than equation 6 when the relation is not satisfied the opposite occurs therefore to consider also t z dependency a possible solution for wind speed determination is given by equation 5 when 7 is satisfied and equation 6 when 7 is not satisfied then the maximum possible wind speed is determined for each h 1 3 t z couple this approximation is a safety side approach probably overestimating the wind loads acceptable for an early design stage as an example the same process can be executed with a jonswap spectrum being pierson moskowitz and imca correlations similar in case specific wind wave correlations are at disposal they can be used to model the wind speed in the analysed area another issue is the current load in this paper the same settings of imca standards have been adopted considering a constant current speed collinear with wind and waves 4 2 dp operability index determination having determined the environmental condition settings is then possible to perform dp calculations for each cell of the scatter diagram for each wave condition and vessel heading it is possible to evaluate if the dp system keeps the position or not then considering the wave occurrences the operability in the selected sea area can be calculated according to the following formulation 8 o p d p i 1 n h p h i i 1 n w p w i i d p where p h is the probability associated with each n h vessel headings and p w is the probability associated with each n w specific wave conditions in case the vessel operation requires a preferential heading then p h should be given by the operator otherwise it is assumed uniform through the whole heading range the function i d p is defined as 9 i d p 1 when dp system holds position 0 when dp system loses position with this kind of approach dp critical curves can be drawn on the scatter diagram to obtain a visual indication of the vessel operability at each heading they represent the environmental limit of the dp system considering the combined effect of wind waves and current as reported in fig 7 the critical curves refer to multiple heading angles taking into account also different failure conditions in particular fig 7 refers to an intact a dp2 and dp3 case respectively for the c0 configuration of the plv by increasing the failure level the critical curves became lower visibly decreasing the operability environment of the vessel to evaluate the o p d p index according to equation 8 it is necessary to determine the function i d p defined in equation 9 per each cell of the scatter diagram and at each heading required by the dp calculation then applying equation 8 it is possible to calculate the final o p d p of the vessel for the selected area the developed procedure considers the headings from 0 to 360 in the step of 5 figs from 8 to 10 illustrate the i d p function determination for the intact and failure conditions previously shown in fig 7 reporting the values of p w i d p determined per each angle for simplicity of representation the graphs show the headings in steps of 60 considering a uniform p h for all the headings then the calculated o p d p is 99 1 for the intact condition 97 8 for the dp2 case and 93 2 for the dp3 one thus confirming the visual observation in this first example dynamic allowances were neglected imposing a c a d y n equal to 1 00 it is then necessary to study the variability of the index with different allowance levels 4 3 dynamic effects on o p d p index as already mentioned quasi steady calculations are overestimating the final capability of the vessel compared to a time domain simulation in standard dp analysis the dynamic allowances are considered to take care of all the dynamic effects that are neglected by a quasi steady approach then the variability of the critical curves and consequently of the o p d p index has been investigated against c a d y n coefficient on a range between 1 00 and 1 75 to consider dynamic effects the study has been carried out not only for the intact condition but also for the possible failure conditions representative of dp2 and dp3 cases that leads to the evaluation of 21 cases on plv s c0 configuration 1 for intact 6 for dp2 and 14 for dp3 conditions each case has four c a d y n values from 1 00 to 1 75 in a step of 0 25 resulting in a total of 84 operability estimates all the calculations evaluate 36 headings from 0 to 350 every 10 however to simplify the graphical representation only the 6 starboard heading curves have been plotted on the scatter diagrams the results reported in figs 11 13 highlight the strong dependence of the critical curves from the c a d y n coefficient the minimum sustainable h 1 3 drops down of about 1 5 m while considering the lowest limiting curve as a reference this trend appears for intact and failure conditions however the drop down occurs case by case in different areas of the scatter diagram the failure cases limiting curves especially the dp3 ones exclude from the sustainable dp environment cells with a higher p w value compared to intact condition then the o p d p index variation with the c a d y n has different trends in the analysed cases fig 14 shows a resume of the variability plotting o p d p index against the c a d y n value for intact and worst dp2 and dp3 failures for intact condition the operability level remains high however for failure conditions the index reduction is significant its quantification is of about 10 for the intact 20 for the dp2 and 50 for the dp3 case as an example table 3 reports the o p d p index evaluated for all the 21 cases of configuration c0 considering a c a d y n of 1 00 and 1 25 here the o p d p variations between the same failure class cases remain around 5 having the same reduction of the reported worst case for such a reason once it is possible to estimate the dynamic allowances correctly it is suggested to use a proper c a d y n value in an early design stage a c a d y n of at least 1 25 as per dnv gl level 1 calculations is advisable 4 4 differences with existing methods the newly proposed method is a scatter diagram cell based approach suitable to perform dp analysis by systematically changing the wave conditions moreover the procedure provides dp critical curves defining the sustainable dp environment for a specific sea area the developed procedure being referred to a wave scatter diagram gives more information on wave parameters i e h 1 3 and t z rather than on wind speed in conventional dp calculations it is usual to represent the capability plots as a function of the maximum sustainable wind speed the vessel can face the proposed dp critical curves are not showing a wind limit but a wave one even though wind speed is implicitly considered as a function of wave parameters to determine the wind loads however the dp critical curves present a minimum at each heading angle being representative of the worst h 1 3 t z combination for the analysed vessel in these points the wind speed can be calculated according to equations 5 and 6 and represented on a polar plot in fig 15 the results for c0 configuration in intact condition are reported to compare the standard dp capability and the wind associated with the worse wave condition given by critical curves here the associated wind speed for the new approach is always lower than the one of standard capability plot this fact underlines that the conventional capability plot is not representative of the maximum sustainable wind a vessel can face because critical conditions may occur at lower wind speeds but with a different associated wave parameters combination the standard calculation methods or prescribed ones like ern and dnv gl provide a notation according to predefined wind wave correlations invariant with the sea area only the level 2 site calculation by dnv gl takes into account a specific environment however the procedure is still related to a conventional capability plot and did not provide a notation number in table 4 a summary is given on the inputs and expected result differences of the standard quasi steady calculation methods classification ones and o p d p index here no reference is made to combined predictions since the motion limitations are not changing the way to determine dp capability outputs it is evident that all the standard dp calculations are carried out only for a specific wind wave correlation curve moreover regulation calculations refer only to the north sea area then it is not possible to establish whether the dp system is suitable to keep the position for all the environmental conditions of a specific sea area this assessment is possible only with a cell based approach 5 the o p d p index as a design attribute the developed dp operability index can evaluate the operability of a dp system during the early design stage as mentioned the goal of the method is also to establish a rank between different design solutions then a designer can choose the preferable option based on the evaluated index however the regulation methods like ern and level 1 level 2 dnv gl notations are also used to compare multiple calculations here the o p d p index and the regulation notations are used to compare different design solutions on this purpose the plv s configurations c0 c1 and c2 already described in table 2 have been used to test the three mentioned ranking methods c0 refers to the original vessel configuration c1 is a design solution with the same installed power of c0 but thrusters from 2 to 5 have the same size c2 is an underpowered configuration with thrusters from 2 to 5 derated compared to c1 configuration the thruster positions remain fixed through the analysed cases a c a d y n of 1 25 and a current speed of 1 944 knots concurrent with wind and waves have been adopted to perform o p d p evaluation the calculations refer to the north sea area to be compliant with ern and level 2 calculations a jonswap spectrum is then used to estimate wave loads the analysis is performed considering both dp2 and dp3 failures level 2 and ern calculations are done with c a d y n 1 25 to facilitate the comparison with o p d p index figs 16 18 show the intact dp2 and dp3 cases for the three tested configurations for intact and dp2 condition the limiting curves for configurations c0 and c1 are comparable the o p d p index values confirm the observed trend assessing variations between the two configurations of 1 for intact and 2 for dp2 case c2 is in both cases the worst solution for dp3 condition the configuration c1 appears to be the best choice having an index 5 higher than configuration c0 also here the c2 is the worst solution in table 5 the index values are listed together with the notations coming out from the regulation methods the level 2 calculations state no difference between configuration c0 and c1 while ern is giving preference to configuration c0 also for the dp3 failure case according to the calculated indexes ern suggests that configuration c0 is the best one followed by c1 and c2 for level 2 calculation c0 and c1 are equivalent while c2 is the worst solution however considering o p d p index the choice between configuration c0 and c1 has to be discussed in detail by designers in fact the two configurations present similar operability for intact and dp2 case but configuration c1 has higher operability for dp3 failure moreover the o p d p index refers to a specific area a less severe area will increase the operability so that also configuration c2 can be considered suitable by designers final considerations on dp system derating can be made only analysing also the limiting motions then the designers operators can select if it is convenient or not derate the dp system 6 conclusions the possibility to evaluate alternative design solutions has been studied on three different thruster size configurations the obtained results show that the proposed dp operability index is capable to give a site oriented ranking between the different solutions moreover the o p d p index is capable to give more detailed information on the analysed systems with respect to standard evaluation methods the newly proposed and implemented calculation method is based on certain approximations that still need to be firmly confirmed in fact further investigations complying the analysis of environmental records have to be done regarding the effective correlation between average wind speed and generated wave in a scatter diagram for such a reason the proposed index cannot be considered as an absolute evaluation number but can be suitably used to compare different feasible design solutions in various operative scenarios already in early design stage credit author statement f mauro conceptualization methodology software

melnikov method the chaotic regions of the system parameters are illustrated the chaotic feature on the system parameters is discussed in detail it is obtained that the critical values of chaos for homoclinic orbits increase monotonously as the increasing of the nonlinear roll attenuation coefficient while the critical values of chaos for the heteroclinic cycle decrease monotonously as the

of a ship in regular longitudinal waves are studied both analytically and numerically system parameter conditions for chaos arising from homoclinic and heteroclinic intersections are presented rigorously chaotic feature on system parameters is investigated in detail the results show that the critical values of chaos for homoclinic orbits increase monotonously as the increasing of the nonlinear roll attenuation coefficient while the critical values of chaos for heteroclinic cycle decrease monotonously as the increasing of the nonlinear roll attenuation coefficient meanwhile critical values of chaos for both homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle increase monotonously as the increasing of the excitation amplitude another interesting finding is that chaotic bands may exist in this system with the fourth order runge kutta method and the wolf algorithm the phase portraits time history curves poincaré section and lyapunov exponent spectrum are obtained respectively

subsection we take ω 0 1 α 3 0 8046 and α 5 0 081 in the flowing discussions consequently there are three system parameters μ 1 μ 3 and f which may lead to chaos we will fix two of them and discuss the other one in the following discussions case 1 μ 1 and μ 3 are fixed in this case the conditions of chaotic motions are as follows respectively for the homoclinic orbits 16 1 f i 3 μ 1 i 1 μ 3 i 2 for the heteroclinic cycle 17 1 f j 3 μ 1 j 1 μ 3 j 2 taking μ 1 0 1 μ 3 0 2 or μ 3 0 8 the critical curves of chaos are shown as in fig 2 from which one can see that the critical values of the heteroclinic cycle are always below that of the homoclinic orbits this means that the heteroclinic cycle is easier chaotically excited than homoclinic orbits fixing μ 1 0 1 taking μ 3 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 the critical curves of chaos for the homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle are shown as in fig 3 from which one can obtain that the critical values of chaos for homoclinic orbits increase monotonously as the increasing of μ 3 while the critical values of chaos for heteroclinic cycle decrease monotonously as the increasing of μ 3 case 2 μ 1 and f are fixed in this case the conditions of chaotic motions are as follows respectively for the homoclinic orbits 18 μ 1 i 1 μ 3 i 2 f i 3 it can be verified that i 1 0 i 2 0 and i 3 0 for all ω 0 on the other hand the parameters μ 1 μ 3 and f

ω 0 condition 22 can be written as 21 μ 3 f j 3 μ 1 j 1 j 2 f j 3 μ 1 j 1 0 fixing μ 1 0 1 taking f 3 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 respectively the critical curves of chaos for the homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle are shown as in fig 4 from which one can see that there exist chaotic bands for homoclinic orbits when the excitation frequency is small the excitation frequency range of the chaotic band decreases monotonously as the increasing of f while the width of the chaotic band increases as the increasing of f one can also see that the heteroclinic cycle can be chaotically excited only in a interval of the excitation frequency and the interval increases as the increasing of the excitation amplitude case 3 μ 3 and f are fixed in this case due to i 1 0 i 2 0 i 3 0 j 1 0 j 2 0 and j 3 0 for all ω 0 the conditions of chaotic motions are as follows respectively for the homoclinic orbits 22 max 0 f i 3 μ 3 i 2 i 1 μ 1 f i 3 μ 3 i 2 i 1 for the heteroclinic cycle 23 μ 1 f j 3 μ 3 j 2 j 1 f j 3 μ 3 j 2 0 fixing μ 3 0 1 taking f 3 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 respectively one can verify that f i 3 μ 3 i 2 0 for all ω 0 so condition 24 can be written as 24 μ 1 f i 3 μ 3 i 2 i 1 the critical curves of chaos for the homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle are shown as in fig 5 it can be concluded that the critical values of chaos for both homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle increase monotonously as the increasing of the excitation amplitude similarly as case 2 the heteroclinic cycle can be chaotically excited only in a interval of the excitation frequency and the interval increases as the increasing of the excitation amplitude 4 numerical simulations in this section taking a maritime patrol ship for example numerical simulations are given to verify the analytical

8 using the wolf algorithm wolf et al 1985 the lyapunov exponent spectrum is shown as in fig 9 the largest lyapunov exponent is 0 5467 0 so the system undergoes chaotic motions on the other hand one can compute that μ 1 i 1 μ 3 i 2 f i 3 0 1453 1 and μ 1 j 1 μ 3 j 2 f j 3 0 2909 1 i e conditions 12 and 15 are satisfied so the system is chaotically excited according the analytical method which agrees with the numerical results lastly choosing h 0 1 1 1 15 1 25 1 3 respectively one can obtain the phase portraits shown as in figs 10 13 from figs 10 13 and 6 it can be seen that as the increasing of the excitation amplitude first the system undergoes periodic motions then chaotic motions occur at last it undergoes periodic motions again 5 conclusions with the melnikov method and numerical methods chaotic dynamics for the parametrically excited roll motion of a ship in regular longitudinal waves is investigated in this paper the critical curves separating the chaotic and non chaotic regions are plotted it is presented that the critical values of chaos for homoclinic orbits increase monotonously as the increasing of the nonlinear roll attenuation coefficient while the critical values of chaos for heteroclinic cycle decrease monotonously as the increasing of the nonlinear roll attenuation coefficient nevertheless the critical values of chaos for both homoclinic orbits and heteroclinic cycle increase monotonously as the increasing of the excitation amplitude it is also demonstrated that there exist chaotic bands for this model and the excitation frequency range of the chaotic band decreases monotonously as the increasing of the excitation amplitude while the width of the chaotic band increases as the increasing of the excitation amplitude the results provide some inspiration and guidance for the analysis and dynamics design of ships for example we should choose the system parameters suitably so that they are not in the chaotic regions otherwise

22304,the scale effects and the shielding effects on the current loads for typical offshore vessels in side by side configuration are investigated using model tests and cfd calculations model tests have been carried out in a water basin to obtain reference data including shielding effects numerical verification for model and full scale reynolds number is carried out to quantify the numerical uncertainty of the cfd results validation of the numerical results is performed by comparing the numerical results at model scale reynolds number to the model test results reynolds scale effects are investigated by comparing the numerical results at model scale and full scale reynolds number based on the results presented in this paper it is concluded that using cfd calculations the current loads on two vessels in side by side configuration can be obtained with acceptable accuracy the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings comparing the numerical results at full scale reynolds number with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number it can be concluded that scale effects on current loads are important to consider in mooring and

computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations for single vessels on deep water see for example fathi et al 2010 koop and bereznitski 2011 koop et al 2013 and in shallow water koop 2015 vaz et al 2009 compared the results for the current loads on a semi submersible configuration obtained with model tests semi empirical models and cfd simulations showing that with cfd calculations acceptable results can be obtained for engineering purposes these studies indicate that using cfd calculations the current loads for single vessels can nowadays be determined in an accurate and efficient manner when two vessels are positioned close to each other in a wind field or current flow significant shielding or hydrodynamic interaction effects can be observed as discussed by koo and kim 2005 and pessoa et al 2016 and as illustrated in fig 1 for the current flow these shielding effects are important to consider when designing a side by side mooring configuration or when considering an approach operation of two vessels see for example buchner and bunnik 2002 nam et al 2016 de wilde and dekker 2013 and zhao et al 2014 cfd simulations have been performed by koop et al 2010 2015 to assess wind shielding effects for a tandem offloading configuration these wind shielding effects include changes in wind loading on the downstream vessel related to changes in the wind velocity field around the vessels illuminati et al 2009 investigated the current wake effects to evaluate the effects on the dynamic positioning dp system of a shuttle tanker a preliminary assessment using cfd simulations was carried out by tannuri et al 2010 to obtain the current shadow zone induced by a fpso a more extensive study using rans to determine the hydrodynamic interaction for two vessels positioned next to each other was carried out by jin et al 2016 traditionally current loads are determined using wind tunnel tests or tow tests in basins however as these tests are carried out using scaled models the reynolds number in the tests is very different from the reynolds number of the flow around the real vessel with cfd calculations the effect of this difference in reynolds number on the current coefficients can potentially be determined see for instance koop and bereznitski 2011 and koop et al 2013 for the scale effects on the resistance of ships extensive research has been carried out see for example amongst others verhulst 2012 and tezdogan et al 2015 and references therein however much less is known when the current is coming from different directions high quality validation material at full scale reynolds number is difficult and expensive to obtain consequently the validation of full scale cfd results for current loads is still not being done and the accuracy of these results is unknown therefore as done in this paper it is recommended to carry out calculations at grids with different resolution to determine the numerical uncertainty for both model and full scale reynolds number to obtain confidence in the numerical results then assuming that the differences between model test results and numerical results at model scale reynolds number can be used for the accuracy of numerical results at full scale reynolds number the numerical results at full scale reynolds number can be used to assess the current loads for engineering applications in this paper both the scale effects and the shielding effects on the current loads are investigated the current loads are determined for a lng carrier alone a shuttle tanker alone and both vessels in side by side configuration these vessels are chosen as they are two typical offshore vessels for which stock models were readily available these vessels are similar in size as could occur in a typical ship to ship transfer of oil and gas more importantly due to their similar sizes significant shielding effects occur when one vessel is upstream of the other vessel the current loads are obtained by means of tow tests in a water basin at scale 1 60 and by numerical calculations at model and full scale reynolds number the objective of the measurements was to obtain reference data including shielding effects cfd calculations at model scale reynolds number are carried out and compared with the model test results to determine whether the side by side current load coefficients can be obtained using cfd calculations furthermore cfd calculations at full scale reynolds number are performed to determine the scale effects on the current loads the experimental and numerical uncertainties on the results are determined to be able to state whether the numerical results are validated for this application and whether the observed scale effects are relevant section 2 presents the definitions and sign conventions used in this paper in section 3 the model test set up is described and the experimental uncertainty is derived the results of the model tests are presented in section 4 the numerical set up for the cfd calculations is discussed in section 5 the model scale cfd results are compared with the experimental results in section 6 for the shuttle tanker and the side by side configuration the model scale and full scale cfd results are compared to each other in section 7 for the lng carrier the shuttle tanker and the side by side configuration finally the conclusions and recommendations are discussed in section 8 2 definitions and sign conventions the sign convention adopted is schematically represented in fig 2 and fig 3 a right handed axis system and si units are used the x axis points towards the bow the y axis towards portside and the z axis is pointing upwards this means that 180 corresponds to head on current 135 to bow quartering current and 90 to beam on current it should be noted that for the side by side configuration the lng carrier is positioned upstream of the shuttle tanker for 90 current direction and that it is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker for 270 the dimensionless current coefficients are defined by 1 c x y f x y 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 l r e f t c m z m z 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 l r e f 2 t with the reference length lref taken equal to lpp of the vessel the magnitude of the force

current loads the objective of the measurements was to obtain reference current load data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects the current loads were measured in a captive set up in marin s seakeeping and manoeuvring basin which measures 170 m x 40 m x 5 m in this set up the models are fixed to the carriage meaning that the models are restricted in their motion including trim and sinkage the loads were obtained on the lng carrier alone the shuttle tanker alone and on each vessel for the side by side configuration as illustrated in fig 4 both models were tested at one draft and the gap between the models in the side by side configuration was 6 m at full scale bilge keels were present on both models thrusters propellers and rudders were not present as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 the scale of the models was 1 60 and the main particulars of the vessels are defined in table 1 the current velocity tested was 4 m s at full scale the reynolds number is 2 106 at model scale each model was mounted to a 3 component measurement frame to measure the surge and sway forces and the yaw moment on the vessels the measurement frame was fixed to the carriage using a rotating table such that the heading of the models could easily be changed current was simulated by towing the captive models through the basin for different headings and velocities the vessels are symmetric and thus it is assumed that the current loads for the vessels alone are also symmetric for tow angles from starboard and port side to minimize the number of rotations of the models in the basin tests were carried out in forward 180 270 and backward 0 90 towing direction for the lng carrier alone and shuttle tanker alone in steps of 15 for the side by side configuration headings between 0 and 360 were tested in steps of 15 additional headings were added around 90 and 270 to obtain a better resolution the froude number for 180 heading using lref lpp in equation 3 was equal to 0 077 the froude number for 90 using lref b in equation 3 was equal to 0 19 thus for beam on current free surface effects may play a role during the tests no significant waves were observed however inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings although the water levels were not measured during the tests in future work the effect of the free surface on the current loads will be investigated using cfd but this is not included in the present work 3 1 experimental uncertainty various uncertainty sources may contribute to the overall experimental uncertainty for the mean value e g the variability in results between repeat tests the statistical stationarity during a test and the uncertainty of the measurement devices to obtain the overall uncertainty of the derived force coefficients the following uncertainty sources have been identified force f calibration uncertainty based on static loads the calibration uncertainty of the force measurement is determined to be 1 5 force f random uncertainty from repeat tests for a number of headings the tests were repeated the results for cy and cmz deviated by at most 4 between those tests the variation in cx is larger i e up to 10 force f random uncertainty without repeat tests for headings where no repeat tests were performed the repeatability is estimated using the techniques from brouwer et al 2013 using the transient scanning technique of brouwer et al 2015 the random uncertainty of the mean value is determined to be at most 2 however the test length of the basin was not always sufficient to have a truly stationary mean value hence this 2 has to be interpreted as a lower bound to the actual random uncertainty for those tests velocity u based on the position accuracy of the carriage the uncertainty of the velocity measurement is 1 density the variations in density due to temperature are at most 0 3 999 7 kg m3 at 10 c and 997 0 at 25 c during a model test campaign the variation in temperature and thus in density is negligible length lpp and draft t the accuracy of the models is 1 mm at model scale i e the uncertainty for lpp is 0 02 and for t it is 0 5 roll and pitch of the models the models were mounted level with the free surface but deviations up to 0 1 deg may occur it is assumed that the effect of this uncertainty on the current load measurement is at most 0 5 but this should be investigated further the equations for the force coefficients are presented in equation 1 following coleman and steele 2009 the total experimental uncertainty for cx can be determined from the equation below a similar formulation holds for the uncertainty for cy and cmz 6 u c x c x 2 u f x b i a s f x 2 u f x r a n d o m f x 2 u f x b i a s f x 2 u ρ ρ 2 2 u u u 2 u l p p l p p 2 u t t 2 based on the uncertainty sources described above it is concluded that the experimental uncertainty ranges between 3 and 5 for the force coefficients cy and cmz and between 3 and 10 for cx it should be mentioned that following the above procedure the experimental uncertainty is dominated by the random uncertainty of repeat tests 4 model test results for side by side configuration the interaction and shielding effects can be observed by comparing the current loads on the single vessel with the results for the vessel in side by side configuration in fig 7 this comparison is shown for the lng carrier and for the shuttle tanker the trend of the cx coefficient for the lng carrier completely changes when the lng carrier is positioned next to the shuttle tanker as the force in x direction is small even a slight change in direction of the total force can result in a very different cx coefficient when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the cy coefficient on the lng carrier significantly reduces and even changes sign this means that the lng carrier is attracted towards the shuttle tanker a small reduction in cy coefficient for the lng carrier can be observed when the lng carrier is positioned upstream this is probably due to the higher pressure in front of the shuttle tanker thereby reducing the pressure difference over the lng carrier compared with when the lng carrier is alone for cmz the trend is very similar between the lng carrier alone and when it is positioned next to the shuttle tanker the cmz coefficient increases when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the trend of the cx coefficient for the shuttle tanker completely changes when comparing the results in side by side configuration to the results for the shuttle tanker alone again this is due to a small change in direction of the resultant force on the vessel the shielding effect in cy for the shuttle tanker can clearly be observed when the shuttle tanker is in the wake of the lng carrier however the effect is less strong than for the lng carrier this is probably due to the larger draft of the shuttle tanker compared with the draft of the lng carrier resulting in less shielding of the shuttle tanker when it is in the wake of the lng carrier for the cmz coefficient larger differences due to shielding can be observed for the shuttle tanker than for the lng carrier the lng carrier is longer than the shuttle tanker this probably causes more deviations on the incoming flow on the shuttle tanker when it is positioned in the wake of the lng carrier when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the ends of the lng carrier are sticking out from the bow and stern of the shuttle tanker which causes the largest moments apparently the moments are then comparable in magnitude as when the lng carrier is positioned in free stream the objective of these measurements was to obtain reference current load data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects these results can be used as reference values in side by side mooring studies provided that the ratio in lengths and drafts are similar to the vessels in this paper however when the drafts lengths or the geometry of the vessels change also the shielding effects are expected to change therefore it is recommended to carry out measurements and or calculations for a ballast loaded and loaded ballast configuration when the current coefficients are needed in a mooring investigation 5 numerical set up for cfd calculations cfd calculations are carried out for model and full scale reynolds number for the lng carrier alone the shuttle tanker alone and both vessels in side by side configuration for the cfd calculations the following assumptions are taken the vessels are kept stationary and fixed the vessels are positioned in an uniform inflow velocity field the flow is assumed to be statistically steady i e the flow variables and forces are time averaged quantities the effects of the free water surface are assumed to be negligible and thus the water surface is taken into account as a flat slip wall condition the last two assumptions may not hold for the side by side configuration considered both assumptions need to be investigated further by carrying out unsteady calculations and including the free water surface this will be pursued in a future study and is not investigated in this paper 5 1 cfd code refresco for the calculations the cfd code refresco www refresco org is employed refresco is a community based open usage cfd code aimed at hydrodynamic maritime applications refresco is currently being developed verified and its several applications are validated at marin in the netherlands in collaboration with a number of partners around the world state of the art cfd features such as moving sliding and deforming grids as well as automatic grid adaptation refinement and or coarsening are also available coupling with structural equations of motion rigid body 6dof is possible and fluid structure interaction fsi is being developed for turbulence modelling both rans urans and scale resolving simulations srs models such as sas ddes iddes xles pans and les approaches can be used other special features are also available such as acoustic models coupling with propeller models rans bem coupling fast time simulation tools xmf and wave generation potential flow codes oceanwave3d swash 5 2 mathematical model and settings in refresco the incompressible rans conservation equations are solved for a statistically steady flow these equations can be written as 7 ρ u i x i 0 8 ρ u i u j x j x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i x i p 2 3 ρ k with ρ the fluid density ui the flow velocity in the i direction xi the space coordinate in i direction t the time μ the dynamic viscosity p the pressure relative to the hydrostatic pressure and k the turbulence kinetic energy it should be noted that the boussinesq hypothesis is applied in the equation above which relates the reynolds stress tensor to the eddy viscosity μt in this paper the k ω sst turbulence model is used for which two additional equations are solved for the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation per unit kinetic energy ω as defined by menter et al 2003 steady state calculations are carried out at model scale and full scale reynolds number i e at 2 106 and 1 109 respectively the equations are discretised using a finite volume approach with cell centered collocated variables in strong conservation form and a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation see klaij and vuik 2013 the non linear system for velocity and pressure is linearised with picard s method and a segregated approach is used for the solution of all equations the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces and if needed h refinement hanging nodes the code is parallelised using mpi and sub domain decomposition and runs on linux workstations and hpc clusters the second order upwind quick scheme of leonard 1979 is employed for the space discretization of the momentum equations the momentum and turbulence equations were solved using the generalized minimal residual method gmres of saad and schultz 1986 and the pressure poisson equation was solved using the conjugate gradient method matrix preconditioning was performed using the modified jacobi technique and the extrapolation to the domain boundaries was zero th order more details on those methods can be found in for example ferziger and peric 2002 wall functions are not used as the highest maximum y values are below 2 for all reynolds numbers headings and configurations and the average y values are below 0 7 for all calculations presented in this paper the iterative convergence levels were satisfactory i e a decrease in residuals of 4 orders or more in the l2 norm the calculated total forces became stationary for most angles except for angles with massive flow separation for these headings small oscillations in the calculated forces less than 2 could be observed in those cases the average over the last 1000 iterations was taken 5 3 geometry computational domain and grid the geometry to represent the underwater part of the vessels is shown in fig 8 for the lng carrier and in fig 9 for the shuttle tanker the geometrical features of the vessels include rudder lng carrier in the side by side model tests the rudder of the lng carrier was not present however in the cfd calculations for the side by side configuration the rudder was included as the same geometry for the lng carrier was taken as used in earlier studies presented in fathi et al 2010 koop et al 2013 and koop 2015 the force on the rudder has been calculated separately in the cfd results and only amounts to at most 3 of the total force and moment on the lng carrier furthermore it is assumed that the rudder has a small influence on the overall flow field so that a direct comparison of the cfd results to the experiments is possible rudder head boxes shuttle tanker bilge keels running along part of the side of the hull for both vessels for an efficient calculation of the current loads for different headings a cylindrical computational domain is used with the bottom surface located at 4lpp water depth to mimic deep water this means that the walls of the towing tank are not included in the calculations the blockage effects in the measurements are assumed to be minimal as the side walls in the tests were positioned at least 4lpp away from the models and as deep water is considered for more information on blockage effects on current loads see also koop 2015 the far field boundary where the inflow and outflow boundaries are applied is placed at 4 vessel lengths 4lpp with respect to the centre of the vessel in fig 10 an overview is presented of the computational grid around the side by side configuration the computational grids are constructed with the grid generator software package hexpress 2018 the grid is refined on the hull and appendages of the vessels to be able to capture the geometry and the important flow features the grid around the vessel is refined towards the solid surfaces to capture the boundary layers the number of cells for the different grids and configurations are presented in table 2 5 4 boundary and initial conditions at the inflow an uniform current velocity u is prescribed by u uref cos θ sin θ 0 with θ equal to the current heading for full scale the eddy viscosity ratio is μt μ 10 and the turbulence intensity i is chosen equal to 10 as the flow is fully turbulent at full scale reynolds number for model scale reynolds number these values are 1 and 1 respectively this information is not available from the model tests but as these were carried out by towing the model through still water it is assumed that in the model tests the turbulence levels were very low for the pressure a zero normal gradient condition is imposed at the outflow boundary a constant static pressure is specified equal to pref 0 pa and a zero normal gradient condition is imposed for all quantities at the water surface a free slip wall condition is imposed i e the normal velocity is set to zero at the surfaces of the vessels a no slip boundary condition is imposed a constant static pressure equal to pref is prescribed on the bottom surface of the domain 5 5 numerical uncertainty for validation of the numerical results both the numerical and experimental uncertainty have to be known furthermore to be able to quantify the significance of scale effects the numerical uncertainty should be known for model and full scale reynolds number making this a costly exercise to determine the numerical uncertainty eca and hoekstra 2014 proposed procedures based on grid refinement studies however to obtain global quantities such as force coefficients with a numerical uncertainty of a few percent highly refined grids and good iterative convergence are required as discussed by klaij et al 2014 which are very difficult to obtain on unstructured grids for this study 4 consecutively refined grids were used as presented in table 2 on those grids the results are calculated at model and full scale reynolds number for the vessels alone and for the vessels in side by side configuration for a selection of headings i e 270 180 120 and 90 these headings were selected as 90 and 270 are the headings with the largest cy coefficient and for these headings one vessel is in the wake of the other vessel resulting in the largest shielding effects heading 180 is important to determine the resistance of the vessel and around 120 are the headings with the largest moment coefficient for a single vessel the results for all grids were within 5 from each other even for headings with significant shielding effects following the procedures as described by eca and hoekstra 2014 larger uncertainties are obtained i e around 10 and they vary for different headings this is mostly due to the difficulty to obtain a proper fit of the data an example of the numerical uncertainty for the cx coefficient for the lng carrier at 180 current heading is presented in fig 11 both for model and full scale reynolds number the refined grids are not geometrically similar as this is impossible to construct using unstructured grids also for a number of headings the flow may be unsteady resulting in an iterative convergence that is not good enough to obtain proper uncertainty estimates based on the grid refinement study and the numerical uncertainty analysis the numerical uncertainty is taken to be 10 as these are the highest values found from the numerical uncertainty analysis 6 comparison cfd results at model scale reynolds number and model test results in this section the model scale cfd results are compared with the model test results for the shuttle tanker and for the side by side configuration the objective of these calculations is to investigate whether the current loads can be obtained using cfd calculations for a side by side configuration including shielding effects it should be noted that the comparison for the lng carrier in deep and shallow water was already presented by koop 2015 6 1 results for shuttle tanker the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the shuttle tanker are compared with the model test results in fig 12 the calculated cy and cmz coefficients agree well with the measured coefficients as all calculated values are within 10 from the measured coefficients the calculated cx coefficient differs significantly from the measured coefficient for headings between 90 and 120 the specific reason for this is not clear but for these headings the fx force is small and the fy force is large thus a slight deviation in direction of the total force already results in a large difference in fx force this implies that the fx force has to be measured very accurately furthermore a small deviation of the calculated separation location from the location in the measurements has a significant effect on the fx force both aspects could be the reason for the observed difference 6 2 results for side by side configuration the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the side by side configuration are compared with the model test results in fig 13 for the shuttle tanker and the lng carrier for the shuttle tanker positioned side by side to the lng carrier the calculated cy coefficients agree within 5 with the measured coefficients for all headings except for the headings around 90 where larger differences can be observed this is the heading where the shuttle tanker is located in the wake of the lng carrier the calculated cx coefficients show larger differences with the experiments than obtained for the cy coefficient the calculated cmz coefficients agree within 5 with the measured values for all headings for the lng carrier positioned side by side to the shuttle tanker the calculated cx and cy coefficients agree well with the measured coefficients except for the headings around 270 which is the heading where the lng carrier is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker for the heading range where the lng carrier is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker the calculated cmz coefficients agree within 5 with the measured values however for the range where the lng carrier is upstream of the shuttle tanker the calculated coefficients deviate significantly from the measured values for which the reason is unclear at the moment based on the results presented in this section it is concluded that the side by side current loads can be obtained using cfd calculations with acceptable accuracy as the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings however larger differences may be found for certain headings with significant interaction and shielding effects it should be noted that for beam on current the froude number based on the width of the vessels is around 0 19 which indicates that free surface effects may be important during the tests no significant waves were observed but inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings this is not investigated in the present study but will be investigated further in a future study as free surface effects may be the reason for the observed differences 6 3 results for velocity distribution for side by side configuration in fig 14 the velocity distribution in the water surface around the vessels are presented for the headings 90 135 and 270 illustrating the main flow patterns for 90 and 270 a large region with returning flow with low velocity can be observed behind the two vessels when the lng carrier is upstream i e for 90 this dead water region is larger than when the shuttle tanker is upstream i e for 270 for 135 the flow accelerates and deviates from its main direction due to the orientation of the vessels due to this deviation the wake with lower flow velocities is not immediately downstream of the vessels but located directly behind the stern of the vessels within the gap between the vessels high velocities can be observed as the flow is squeezed through the gap this results in lower pressure inside the gap which may cause the free surface to change 7 comparison numerical results at model and full scale reynolds number to estimate the reynolds scale effects the numerical results at full scale reynolds number are compared in this section with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for both model and full scale reynolds number the numerical uncertainty is estimated to be 10 as discussed in sections 3 1 and 5 5 therefore any difference larger than 10 is considered to be significant concerning reynolds scale effects first the results are presented for the lng carrier alone and the shuttle tanker alone followed by the results for the side by side configuration 7 1 results for lng carrier in fig 15 a d the numerical results at full scale reynolds number are compared with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the lng carrier for 180 and 0 the full scale cx value is about 50 lower than the value at model scale reynolds number for these headings the force on the vessel is mainly dominated by the friction of the flow on the vessel as shown in fig 16 a this 50 reduction of cx in head on current at full scale reynolds number corresponds well with values found in extrapolation methods for resistance of vessels in propulsion tests as presented by verhulst 2012 for the other headings the force in x direction is small for the range from 120 to 150 the full scale coefficient is positive whereas the model scale value is negative when comparing the direction of force in fig 15 d it can be observed that the resultant horizontal force is around 90 for model scale it is around 88 thus with a negative x component and for full scale the direction is around 92 thus with a positive x component the total horizontal force in this range is very similar for full scale and model scale reynolds number indicating that the difference in cx for this range is mainly due to a small difference in direction of the resultant force the cy and cmz coefficients are dominated by the pressure force on the vessel for both coefficients it can be observed that the value at full scale reynolds number is slightly smaller than the model scale value i e about 5 10 for cy for current heading 90 and up to 25 for cmz at 120 current heading the lower cy value indicates that also on the pressure component a small reynolds scale effect can be observed mainly due to the smaller wake around and behind the vessel as illustrated in fig 17 for current heading 90 for this heading the bilge keels clearly define the flow separation on the vessel but as can be seen mainly near the skeg of the vessel the separation area at model scale is slightly larger than at full scale resulting in a slightly higher cy coefficient at model scale the lower cmz value at full scale reynolds number is caused by a change of the pressure distribution on the hull of the vessel due to a change in the regions of flow separation as visualized in fig 18 for current heading 120 the locations and size of flow separation are slightly different especially near the bow and stern of the vessel 7 2 results for shuttle tanker the numerical results at full scale reynolds number for the shuttle tanker are compared with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number in fig 15 d f the trends in differences between the model scale and full scale results for the shuttle tanker are very similar to the trends found for the lng carrier as described in the previous section the full scale cx results are generally smaller than the model scale values except for the region between 120 and 150 where the cx values are close to zero and the main difference in the coefficients is due to a small difference in direction of the resultant force the cx coefficient for the shuttle tanker is mainly dominated by the friction force but the contribution from the pressure to the cx coefficient is larger than for the lng carrier as can be seen in fig 16 d the full scale cy and cmz coefficients are lower than the model scale values for cy the difference is 5 10 and for cmz the difference is 30 for headings between 15 and 75 for the other headings the difference in cmz coefficient is small also for the shuttle tanker the cy and cmz coefficient are dominated by the pressure force as can be seen in fig 16 e and f based on the results presented in this section and in the previous section it is concluded that reynolds scale effects may have a significant influence on current loads the effect on friction dominated forces is large i e around 50 the effect on pressure dominated forces is small but present i e 5 10 the effect on cmz coefficient may be large up to 30 lower at full scale due to a change in location and size of the separation regions on the hull resulting in a slightly different pressure distribution on the hull the results for the current coefficients at full scale reynolds number seem to be lower than at model scale reynolds number which implies that results from model tests are conservative for the current loads however current load coefficients may be used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and a lower coefficient implies lower damping this indicates that at full scale reynolds number the hydrodynamic damping would be less than estimated from model test results this is relevant for mooring studies as the motions at full scale may be larger than expected based on model scale damping values 7 3 results for side by side configuration the numerical results at full scale reynolds number for the side by side configuration are compared with the model scale numerical results in fig 19 for the shuttle tanker and the lng carrier when a vessel is upstream of the other vessel i e 270 for the shuttle tanker and 90 for the lng carrier the same trends can be observed as for the vessel alone a significant smaller cx coefficient and slightly smaller cy and cmz coefficients at full scale reynolds number however when the shuttle tanker is positioned in the wake of the lng carrier i e for current heading around 90 the cy coefficient at full scale reynolds number is slightly larger than at model scale reynolds number this can be explained by that at full scale reynolds number the boundary layers and wake behind the lng carrier are smaller than at model scale reynolds number as a consequence the region with shielding effects become smaller and thus the force coefficients for the downstream shuttle tanker become larger at full scale reynolds number when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker this phenomenon is not observed as the cy coefficient is close to zero for both model scale and full scale reynolds number for headings around 270 the shuttle tanker has larger draft than the lng carrier and thus the shuttle tanker is completely blocking the inflow to the lng carrier both at model and full scale reynolds number the result for cmz at 120 on the lng carrier at full scale reynolds number seems to be deviating from the trend when investigating the flow patterns for this heading nothing strange can be observed so it has to be assumed that the calculated value is correct the cmz values around this heading are close to zero for full scale reynolds number and thus small deviations in flow direction around the vessels can result in a different sign for the moment coefficient conclusions and recommendations current load measurements have been carried out on a side by side configuration of a lng carrier positioned close to a shuttle tanker furthermore the current loads on the lng carrier alone and on the shuttle tanker alone have been measured as well the objective of these measurements was to obtain reference data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects this reference data is then used to compare with numerical results at model scale reynolds number these results can be used as reference values in side by side mooring studies provided that the ratio in lengths and drafts are similar to the vessels in this paper however when the drafts lengths or the geometry of the vessels change also the shielding effects are expected to change when the two vessels are positioned next to each other significant shielding or interaction effects can be observed the cx coefficient of the vessel completely changes with another vessel present for the cy coefficient hardly anything changes when the vessel is upstream of the other vessel however when the vessel is in the wake of the other vessel the coefficient can even change sign meaning that the vessel is sucked towards the upstream vessel this effect is stronger for the lng carrier than for the shuttle tanker as the shuttle tanker is the largest vessel of the two for the cmz coefficient a decrease can be observed when the vessel is in the wake of the other vessel in this paper the experimental uncertainty range is estimated to be between 3 and 5 for the force coefficients cy and cmz and between 3 and 10 for cx based on the variability in results between repeat tests the random uncertainty of the mean value and based on the uncertainty of the measurement devices to determine the numerical uncertainty of the calculated results four consecutively refined grids are used for a selected number of headings based on those results the numerical uncertainty is determined to be 10 considering the uncertainties mentioned above a good agreement between experiments and cfd calculations is obtained when the difference is within 10 based on the results presented in this paper it is concluded that the current loads on two vessels in side by side configuration can be obtained using cfd calculations with acceptable accuracy the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings except for certain headings with significant interaction and shielding effects where larger differences can be found it should be noted that for beam on current the froude number based on the width of the vessels is around 0 19 which indicates that free surface effects may be important during the tests no significant waves were observed but inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings this is not investigated in the present study but will be investigated further in a future study as free surface effects may be the reason for the observed differences based on the comparison between the numerical results at full scale and model scale reynolds number it is concluded that reynolds scale effects may have a significant influence on current loads the effect on friction dominated forces is large for cx a reduction up to 50 is observed at full scale reynolds number the effect on pressure dominated forces is smaller the values for cy at full scale reynolds number are 5 10 lower than at model scale reynolds number the moment coefficient cmz is also dominated by the pressure force but up to 30 lower values are found at full scale reynolds number due to a change of location and size of the flow separation regions and the associated pressure distribution on the hull the shielding effects appear to be slightly smaller at full scale reynolds number as the wake from the upstream vessel is slightly smaller in size resulting in larger force coefficients on the downstream vessel the results for the current coefficients at full scale reynolds number are found to be lower than at model scale reynolds number which implies that results from model tests are conservative for the current loads however current load coefficients may be used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and a lower coefficient implies lower damping this indicates that at full scale reynolds number the hydrodynamic damping would be less than estimated from model test results using cfd calculations the current load coefficients can be obtained at full scale reynolds number but as no validation material exists at full scale reynolds number the accuracy of these calculations is unknown therefore as done in this paper it is recommended to carry out calculations at grids with different resolution to determine the numerical uncertainty for both model and full scale reynolds number to obtain confidence in the numerical results then assuming that the differences between model test results and the numerical results at model scale reynolds number can be used for the accuracy of the numerical results at full scale reynolds number the numerical results at full scale reynolds number can be used to assess the current loads for engineering

uncertainty of the cfd results validation of the numerical results is performed by comparing the numerical results at model scale reynolds number to the model test results reynolds scale effects are investigated by comparing the numerical results at model scale and full scale reynolds number based on the results presented in this paper it is concluded that using cfd calculations the current loads on two vessels in side by side configuration can be obtained with acceptable accuracy the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings comparing the numerical results at full scale reynolds number with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number it can be concluded that scale effects on current loads are important to consider in mooring and

computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations for single vessels on deep water see for example fathi et al 2010 koop and bereznitski 2011 koop et al 2013 and in shallow water koop 2015 vaz et al 2009 compared the results for the current loads on a semi submersible configuration obtained with model tests semi empirical models and cfd simulations showing that with cfd calculations acceptable results can be obtained for engineering purposes these studies indicate that using cfd calculations the current loads for single vessels can nowadays be determined in an accurate and efficient manner when two vessels are positioned close to each other in a wind field or current flow significant shielding or hydrodynamic interaction effects can be observed as discussed by koo and kim 2005 and pessoa et al 2016 and as illustrated in fig 1 for the current flow these shielding effects are important to consider when designing a side by side mooring configuration or when considering an approach operation of two vessels see for example buchner and bunnik 2002 nam et al 2016 de wilde and dekker 2013 and zhao et al 2014 cfd simulations have been performed by koop et al 2010 2015 to assess wind shielding effects for a tandem offloading configuration these wind shielding effects include changes in wind loading on the downstream vessel related to changes in the wind velocity field around the vessels illuminati et al 2009 investigated the current wake effects to evaluate the effects on the dynamic positioning dp system of a shuttle tanker a preliminary assessment using cfd simulations was carried out by tannuri et al 2010 to obtain the current shadow zone induced by a fpso a more extensive study using rans to determine the hydrodynamic interaction for two vessels positioned next to each other was carried out by jin et al 2016 traditionally current loads are determined using wind tunnel tests or tow tests in basins however as these tests are carried out using scaled models the reynolds number in the tests is very different from the reynolds number of the flow around the real vessel with cfd calculations the effect of this difference in reynolds number on the current coefficients can potentially be determined see for instance koop and bereznitski 2011 and koop et al 2013 for the scale effects on the resistance of ships extensive research has been carried out see for example amongst others verhulst 2012 and tezdogan et al 2015 and references therein however much less is known when the current is coming from different directions high quality validation material at full scale reynolds number is difficult and expensive to obtain consequently the validation of full scale cfd results for current loads is still not being done and the accuracy of these results is unknown therefore as done in this paper it is recommended to carry out calculations at grids with different resolution to determine the numerical uncertainty for both model and full scale reynolds number to obtain confidence in the numerical results then assuming that the differences between model test results and numerical results at model scale reynolds number can be used for the accuracy of numerical results at full scale reynolds number the numerical results at full scale reynolds number can be used to assess the current loads for engineering applications in this paper both the scale effects and the shielding effects on the current loads are investigated the current loads are determined for a lng carrier alone a shuttle tanker alone and both vessels in side by side configuration these vessels are chosen as they are two typical offshore vessels for which stock models were readily available these vessels are similar in size as could occur in a typical ship to ship transfer of oil and gas more importantly due to their similar sizes significant shielding effects occur when one vessel is upstream of the other vessel the current loads are obtained by means of tow tests in a water basin at scale 1 60 and by numerical calculations at model and full scale reynolds number the objective of the measurements was to obtain reference data including shielding effects cfd calculations at model scale reynolds number are carried out and compared with the model test results to determine whether the side by side current load coefficients can be obtained using cfd calculations furthermore cfd calculations at full scale reynolds number are performed to determine the scale effects on the current loads the experimental and numerical uncertainties on the results are determined to be able to state whether the numerical results are validated for this application and whether the observed scale effects are relevant section 2 presents the definitions and sign conventions used in this paper in section 3 the model test set up is described and the experimental uncertainty is derived the results of the model tests are presented in section 4 the numerical set up for the cfd calculations is discussed in section 5 the model scale cfd results are compared with the experimental results in section 6 for the shuttle tanker and the side by side configuration the model scale and full scale cfd results are compared to each other in section 7 for the lng carrier the shuttle tanker and the side by side configuration finally the conclusions and recommendations are discussed in section 8 2 definitions and sign conventions the sign convention adopted is schematically represented in fig 2 and fig 3 a right handed axis system and si units are used the x axis points towards the bow the y axis towards portside and the z axis is pointing upwards this means that 180 corresponds to head on current 135 to bow quartering current and 90 to beam on current it should be noted that for the side by side configuration the lng carrier is positioned upstream of the shuttle tanker for 90 current direction and that it is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker for 270 the dimensionless current coefficients are defined by 1 c x y f x y 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 l r e f t c m z m z 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 l r e f 2 t with the reference length lref taken equal to lpp of the vessel the magnitude of the force coefficient ct and the direction of the resultant force αf are determined from 2 c t c x 2 c y 2 α f arctan c y c x the reynolds number re and froude number fr are defined by 3 re ρ u r e f l r e f μ f r u r e f g l r e f the pressure coefficient cp is defined by 4 c p p p r e f 1 2 ρ u r e f 2 the vorticity vector ω and its norm ω are defined by 5 ω u ω ω 3 model test experiments for side by side current loads the objective of the measurements was to obtain reference current load data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects the current loads were measured in a captive set up in marin s seakeeping and manoeuvring basin which measures 170 m x 40 m x 5 m in this set up the models are fixed to the carriage meaning that the models are restricted in their motion including trim and sinkage the loads were obtained on the lng carrier alone the shuttle tanker alone and on each vessel for the side by side configuration as illustrated in fig 4 both models were tested at one draft and the gap between the models in the side by side configuration was 6 m at full scale bilge keels were present on both models thrusters propellers and rudders were not present as shown in fig 5 and fig 6 the scale of the models was 1 60 and the main particulars of the vessels are defined in table 1 the current velocity tested was 4 m s at full scale the reynolds number is 2 106 at model scale each model was mounted to a 3 component measurement frame to measure the surge and sway forces and the yaw moment on the vessels the measurement frame was fixed to the carriage using a rotating table such that the heading of the models could easily be changed current was simulated by towing the captive models through the basin for different headings and velocities the vessels are symmetric and thus it is assumed that the current loads for the vessels alone are also symmetric for tow angles from starboard and port side to minimize the number of rotations of the models in the basin tests were carried out in forward 180 270 and backward 0 90 towing direction for the lng carrier alone and shuttle tanker alone in steps of 15 for the side by side configuration headings between 0 and 360 were tested in steps of 15 additional headings were added around 90 and 270 to obtain a better resolution the froude number for 180 heading using lref lpp in equation 3 was equal to 0 077 the froude number for 90 using lref b in equation 3 was equal to 0 19 thus for beam on current free surface effects may play a role during the tests no significant waves were observed however inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings although the water levels were not measured during the tests in future work the effect of the free surface on the current loads will be investigated using cfd but this is not included in the present work 3 1 experimental uncertainty various uncertainty sources may contribute to the overall experimental uncertainty for the mean value e g the variability in results between repeat tests the statistical stationarity during a test and the uncertainty of the measurement devices to obtain the overall uncertainty of the derived force coefficients the following uncertainty sources have been identified force f calibration uncertainty based on static loads the calibration uncertainty of the force measurement is determined to be 1 5 force f random uncertainty from repeat tests for a number of headings the tests were repeated the results for cy and cmz deviated by at most 4 between those tests the variation in cx is larger i e up to 10 force f random uncertainty without repeat tests for headings where no repeat tests were performed the repeatability is estimated using the techniques from brouwer et al 2013 using the transient scanning technique of brouwer et al 2015 the random uncertainty of the mean value is determined to be at most 2 however the test length of the basin was not always sufficient to have a truly stationary mean value hence this 2 has to be interpreted as a lower bound to the actual random uncertainty for those tests velocity u based on the position accuracy of the carriage the uncertainty of the velocity measurement is 1 density the variations in density due to temperature are at most 0 3 999 7 kg m3 at 10 c and 997 0 at 25 c during a model test campaign the variation in temperature and thus in density is negligible length lpp and draft t the accuracy of the models is 1 mm at model scale i e the uncertainty for lpp is 0 02 and for t it is 0 5 roll and pitch of the models the models were mounted level with the free surface but deviations up to 0 1 deg may occur it is assumed that the effect of this uncertainty on the current load measurement is at most 0 5 but this should be investigated further the equations for the force coefficients are presented in equation 1 following coleman and steele 2009 the total experimental uncertainty for cx can be determined from the equation below a similar formulation holds for the uncertainty for cy and cmz 6 u c x c x 2 u f x b i a s f x 2 u f x r a n d o m f x 2 u f x b i a s f x 2 u ρ ρ 2 2 u u u 2 u l p p l p p 2 u t t 2 based on the uncertainty sources described above it is concluded that the experimental uncertainty ranges between 3 and 5 for the force coefficients cy and cmz and between 3 and 10 for cx it should be mentioned that following the above procedure the experimental uncertainty is dominated by the random uncertainty of repeat tests 4 model test results for side by side configuration the interaction and shielding effects can be observed by comparing the current loads on the single vessel with the results for the vessel in side by side configuration in fig 7 this comparison is shown for the lng carrier and for the shuttle tanker the trend of the cx coefficient for the lng carrier completely changes when the lng carrier is positioned next to the shuttle tanker as the force in x direction is small even a slight change in direction of the total force can result in a very different cx coefficient when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the cy coefficient on the lng carrier significantly reduces and even changes sign this means that the lng carrier is attracted towards the shuttle tanker a small reduction in cy coefficient for the lng carrier can be observed when the lng carrier is positioned upstream this is probably due to the higher pressure in front of the shuttle tanker thereby reducing the pressure difference over the lng carrier compared with when the lng carrier is alone for cmz the trend is very similar between the lng carrier alone and when it is positioned next to the shuttle tanker the cmz coefficient increases when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the trend of the cx coefficient for the shuttle tanker completely changes when comparing the results in side by side configuration to the results for the shuttle tanker alone again this is due to a small change in direction of the resultant force on the vessel the shielding effect in cy for the shuttle tanker can clearly be observed when the shuttle tanker is in the wake of the lng carrier however the effect is less strong than for the lng carrier this is probably due to the larger draft of the shuttle tanker compared with the draft of the lng carrier resulting in less shielding of the shuttle tanker when it is in the wake of the lng carrier for the cmz coefficient larger differences due to shielding can be observed for the shuttle tanker than for the lng carrier the lng carrier is longer than the shuttle tanker this probably causes more deviations on the incoming flow on the shuttle tanker when it is positioned in the wake of the lng carrier when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker the ends of the lng carrier are sticking out from the bow and stern of the shuttle tanker which causes the largest moments apparently the moments are then comparable in magnitude as when the lng carrier is positioned in free stream the objective of these measurements was to obtain reference current load data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects these results can be used as reference values in side by side mooring studies provided that the ratio in lengths and drafts are similar to the vessels in this paper however when the drafts lengths or the geometry of the vessels change also the shielding effects are expected to change therefore it is recommended to carry out measurements and or calculations for a ballast loaded and loaded ballast configuration when the current coefficients are needed in a mooring investigation 5 numerical set up for cfd calculations cfd calculations are carried out for model and full scale reynolds number for the lng carrier alone the shuttle tanker alone and both vessels in side by side configuration for the cfd calculations the following assumptions are taken the vessels are kept stationary and fixed the vessels are positioned in an uniform inflow velocity field the flow is assumed to be statistically steady i e the flow variables and forces are time averaged quantities the effects of the free water surface are assumed to be negligible and thus the water surface is taken into account as a flat slip wall condition the last two assumptions may not hold for the side by side configuration considered both assumptions need to be investigated further by carrying out unsteady calculations and including the free water surface this will be pursued in a future study and is not investigated in this paper 5 1 cfd code refresco for the calculations the cfd code refresco www refresco org is employed refresco is a community based open usage cfd code aimed at hydrodynamic maritime applications refresco is currently being developed verified and its several applications are validated at marin in the netherlands in collaboration with a number of partners around the world state of the art cfd features such as moving sliding and deforming grids as well as automatic grid adaptation refinement and or coarsening are also available coupling with structural equations of motion rigid body 6dof is possible and fluid structure interaction fsi is being developed for turbulence modelling both rans urans and scale resolving simulations srs models such as sas ddes iddes xles pans and les approaches can be used other special features are also available such as acoustic models coupling with propeller models rans bem coupling fast time simulation tools xmf and wave generation potential flow codes oceanwave3d swash 5 2 mathematical model and settings in refresco the incompressible rans conservation equations are solved for a statistically steady flow these equations can be written as 7 ρ u i x i 0 8 ρ u i u j x j x j μ μ t u i x j u j x i x i p 2 3 ρ k with ρ the fluid density ui the flow velocity in the i direction xi the space coordinate in i direction t the time μ the dynamic viscosity p the pressure relative to the hydrostatic pressure and k the turbulence kinetic energy it should be noted that the boussinesq hypothesis is applied in the equation above which relates the reynolds stress tensor to the eddy viscosity μt in this paper the k ω sst turbulence model is used for which two additional equations are solved for the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent dissipation per unit kinetic energy ω as defined by menter et al 2003 steady state calculations are carried out at model scale and full scale reynolds number i e at 2 106 and 1 109 respectively the equations are discretised using a finite volume approach with cell centered collocated variables in strong conservation form and a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation see klaij and vuik 2013 the non linear system for velocity and pressure is linearised with picard s method and a segregated approach is used for the solution of all equations the implementation is face based which permits grids with elements consisting of an arbitrary number of faces and if needed h refinement hanging nodes the code is parallelised using mpi and sub domain decomposition and runs on linux workstations and hpc clusters the second order upwind quick scheme of leonard 1979 is employed for the space discretization of the momentum equations the momentum and turbulence equations were solved using the generalized minimal residual method gmres of saad and schultz 1986 and the pressure poisson equation was solved using the conjugate gradient method matrix preconditioning was performed using the modified jacobi technique and the extrapolation to the domain boundaries was zero th order more details on those methods can be found in for example ferziger and peric 2002 wall functions are not used as the highest maximum y values are below 2 for all reynolds numbers headings and configurations and the average y values are below 0 7 for all calculations presented in this paper the iterative convergence levels were satisfactory i e a decrease in residuals of 4 orders or more in the l2 norm the calculated total forces became stationary for most angles except for angles with massive flow separation for these headings small oscillations in the calculated forces less than 2 could be observed in those cases the average over the last 1000 iterations was taken 5 3 geometry computational domain and grid the geometry to represent the underwater part of the vessels is shown in fig 8 for the lng carrier and in fig 9 for the shuttle tanker the geometrical features of the vessels include rudder lng carrier in the side by side model tests the rudder of the lng carrier was not present however in the cfd calculations for the side by side configuration the rudder was included as the same geometry for the lng carrier was taken as used in earlier studies presented in fathi et al 2010 koop et al 2013 and koop 2015 the force on the rudder has been calculated separately in the cfd results and only amounts to at most 3 of the total force and moment on the lng carrier furthermore it is assumed that the rudder has a small influence on the overall flow field so that a direct comparison of the cfd results to the experiments is possible rudder head boxes shuttle tanker bilge keels running along part of the side of the hull for both vessels for an efficient calculation of the current loads for different headings a cylindrical computational domain is used with the bottom surface located at 4lpp water depth to mimic deep water this means that the walls of the towing tank are not included in the calculations the blockage effects in the measurements are assumed to be minimal as the side walls in the tests were positioned at least 4lpp away from the models and as deep water is considered for more information on blockage effects on current loads see also koop 2015 the far field boundary where the inflow and outflow boundaries are applied is placed at 4 vessel lengths 4lpp with respect to the centre of the vessel in fig 10 an overview is presented of the computational grid around the side by side configuration the computational grids are constructed with the grid generator software package hexpress 2018 the grid is refined on the hull and appendages of the vessels to be able to capture the geometry and the important flow features the grid around the vessel is refined towards the solid surfaces to capture the boundary layers the number of cells for the different grids and configurations are presented in table 2 5 4 boundary and initial conditions at the inflow an uniform current velocity u is prescribed by u uref cos θ sin θ 0 with θ equal to the current heading for full scale the eddy viscosity ratio is μt μ 10 and the turbulence intensity i is chosen equal to 10 as the flow is fully turbulent at full scale reynolds number for model scale reynolds number these values are 1 and 1 respectively this information is not available from the model tests but as these were carried out by towing the model through still water it is assumed that in the model tests the turbulence levels were very low for the pressure a zero normal gradient condition is imposed at the outflow boundary a constant static pressure is specified equal to pref 0 pa and a zero normal gradient condition is imposed for all quantities at the water surface a free slip wall condition is imposed i e the normal velocity is set to zero at the surfaces of the vessels a no slip boundary condition is imposed a constant static pressure equal to pref is prescribed on the bottom surface of the domain 5 5 numerical uncertainty for validation of the numerical results both the numerical and experimental uncertainty have to be known furthermore to be able to quantify the significance of scale effects the numerical uncertainty should be known for model and full scale reynolds number making this a costly exercise to determine the numerical uncertainty eca and hoekstra 2014 proposed procedures based on grid refinement studies however to obtain global quantities such as force coefficients with a numerical uncertainty of a few percent highly refined grids and good iterative convergence are required as discussed by klaij et al 2014 which are very difficult to obtain on unstructured grids for this study 4 consecutively refined grids were used as presented in table 2 on those grids the results are calculated at model and full scale reynolds number for the vessels alone and for the vessels in side by side configuration for a selection of headings i e 270 180 120 and 90 these headings were selected as 90 and 270 are the headings with the largest cy coefficient and for these headings one vessel is in the wake of the other vessel resulting in the largest shielding effects heading 180 is important to determine the resistance of the vessel and around 120 are the headings with the largest moment coefficient for a single vessel the results for all grids were within 5 from each other even for headings with significant shielding effects following the procedures as described by eca and hoekstra 2014 larger uncertainties are obtained i e around 10 and they vary for different headings this is mostly due to the difficulty to obtain a proper fit of the data an example of the numerical uncertainty for the cx coefficient for the lng carrier at 180 current heading is presented in fig 11 both for model and full scale reynolds number the refined grids are not geometrically similar as this is impossible to construct using unstructured grids also for a number of headings the flow may be unsteady resulting in an iterative convergence that is not good enough to obtain proper uncertainty estimates based on the grid refinement study and the numerical uncertainty analysis the numerical uncertainty is taken to be 10 as these are the highest values found from the numerical uncertainty analysis 6 comparison cfd results at model scale reynolds number and model test results in this section the model scale cfd results are compared with the model test results for the shuttle tanker and for the side by side configuration the objective of these calculations is to investigate whether the current loads can be obtained using cfd calculations for a side by side configuration including shielding effects it should be noted that the comparison for the lng carrier in deep and shallow water was already presented by koop 2015 6 1 results for shuttle tanker the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the shuttle tanker are compared with the model test results in fig 12 the calculated cy and cmz coefficients agree well with the measured coefficients as all calculated values are within 10 from the measured coefficients the calculated cx coefficient differs significantly from the measured coefficient for headings between 90 and 120 the specific reason for this is not clear but for these headings the fx force is small and the fy force is large thus a slight deviation in direction of the total force already results in a large difference in fx force this implies that the fx force has to be measured very accurately furthermore a small deviation of the calculated separation location from the location in the measurements has a significant effect on the fx force both aspects could be the reason for the observed difference 6 2 results for side by side configuration the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the side by side configuration are compared with the model test results in fig 13 for the shuttle tanker and the lng carrier for the shuttle tanker positioned side by side to the lng carrier the calculated cy coefficients agree within 5 with the measured coefficients for all headings except for the headings around 90 where larger differences can be observed this is the heading where the shuttle tanker is located in the wake of the lng carrier the calculated cx coefficients show larger differences with the experiments than obtained for the cy coefficient the calculated cmz coefficients agree within 5 with the measured values for all headings for the lng carrier positioned side by side to the shuttle tanker the calculated cx and cy coefficients agree well with the measured coefficients except for the headings around 270 which is the heading where the lng carrier is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker for the heading range where the lng carrier is located in the wake of the shuttle tanker the calculated cmz coefficients agree within 5 with the measured values however for the range where the lng carrier is upstream of the shuttle tanker the calculated coefficients deviate significantly from the measured values for which the reason is unclear at the moment based on the results presented in this section it is concluded that the side by side current loads can be obtained using cfd calculations with acceptable accuracy as the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings however larger differences may be found for certain headings with significant interaction and shielding effects it should be noted that for beam on current the froude number based on the width of the vessels is around 0 19 which indicates that free surface effects may be important during the tests no significant waves were observed but inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings this is not investigated in the present study but will be investigated further in a future study as free surface effects may be the reason for the observed differences 6 3 results for velocity distribution for side by side configuration in fig 14 the velocity distribution in the water surface around the vessels are presented for the headings 90 135 and 270 illustrating the main flow patterns for 90 and 270 a large region with returning flow with low velocity can be observed behind the two vessels when the lng carrier is upstream i e for 90 this dead water region is larger than when the shuttle tanker is upstream i e for 270 for 135 the flow accelerates and deviates from its main direction due to the orientation of the vessels due to this deviation the wake with lower flow velocities is not immediately downstream of the vessels but located directly behind the stern of the vessels within the gap between the vessels high velocities can be observed as the flow is squeezed through the gap this results in lower pressure inside the gap which may cause the free surface to change 7 comparison numerical results at model and full scale reynolds number to estimate the reynolds scale effects the numerical results at full scale reynolds number are compared in this section with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for both model and full scale reynolds number the numerical uncertainty is estimated to be 10 as discussed in sections 3 1 and 5 5 therefore any difference larger than 10 is considered to be significant concerning reynolds scale effects first the results are presented for the lng carrier alone and the shuttle tanker alone followed by the results for the side by side configuration 7 1 results for lng carrier in fig 15 a d the numerical results at full scale reynolds number are compared with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number for the lng carrier for 180 and 0 the full scale cx value is about 50 lower than the value at model scale reynolds number for these headings the force on the vessel is mainly dominated by the friction of the flow on the vessel as shown in fig 16 a this 50 reduction of cx in head on current at full scale reynolds number corresponds well with values found in extrapolation methods for resistance of vessels in propulsion tests as presented by verhulst 2012 for the other headings the force in x direction is small for the range from 120 to 150 the full scale coefficient is positive whereas the model scale value is negative when comparing the direction of force in fig 15 d it can be observed that the resultant horizontal force is around 90 for model scale it is around 88 thus with a negative x component and for full scale the direction is around 92 thus with a positive x component the total horizontal force in this range is very similar for full scale and model scale reynolds number indicating that the difference in cx for this range is mainly due to a small difference in direction of the resultant force the cy and cmz coefficients are dominated by the pressure force on the vessel for both coefficients it can be observed that the value at full scale reynolds number is slightly smaller than the model scale value i e about 5 10 for cy for current heading 90 and up to 25 for cmz at 120 current heading the lower cy value indicates that also on the pressure component a small reynolds scale effect can be observed mainly due to the smaller wake around and behind the vessel as illustrated in fig 17 for current heading 90 for this heading the bilge keels clearly define the flow separation on the vessel but as can be seen mainly near the skeg of the vessel the separation area at model scale is slightly larger than at full scale resulting in a slightly higher cy coefficient at model scale the lower cmz value at full scale reynolds number is caused by a change of the pressure distribution on the hull of the vessel due to a change in the regions of flow separation as visualized in fig 18 for current heading 120 the locations and size of flow separation are slightly different especially near the bow and stern of the vessel 7 2 results for shuttle tanker the numerical results at full scale reynolds number for the shuttle tanker are compared with the numerical results at model scale reynolds number in fig 15 d f the trends in differences between the model scale and full scale results for the shuttle tanker are very similar to the trends found for the lng carrier as described in the previous section the full scale cx results are generally smaller than the model scale values except for the region between 120 and 150 where the cx values are close to zero and the main difference in the coefficients is due to a small difference in direction of the resultant force the cx coefficient for the shuttle tanker is mainly dominated by the friction force but the contribution from the pressure to the cx coefficient is larger than for the lng carrier as can be seen in fig 16 d the full scale cy and cmz coefficients are lower than the model scale values for cy the difference is 5 10 and for cmz the difference is 30 for headings between 15 and 75 for the other headings the difference in cmz coefficient is small also for the shuttle tanker the cy and cmz coefficient are dominated by the pressure force as can be seen in fig 16 e and f based on the results presented in this section and in the previous section it is concluded that reynolds scale effects may have a significant influence on current loads the effect on friction dominated forces is large i e around 50 the effect on pressure dominated forces is small but present i e 5 10 the effect on cmz coefficient may be large up to 30 lower at full scale due to a change in location and size of the separation regions on the hull resulting in a slightly different pressure distribution on the hull the results for the current coefficients at full scale reynolds number seem to be lower than at model scale reynolds number which implies that results from model tests are conservative for the current loads however current load coefficients may be used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and a lower coefficient implies lower damping this indicates that at full scale reynolds number the hydrodynamic damping would be less than estimated from model test results this is relevant for mooring studies as the motions at full scale may be larger than expected based on model scale damping values 7 3 results for side by side configuration the numerical results at full scale reynolds number for the side by side configuration are compared with the model scale numerical results in fig 19 for the shuttle tanker and the lng carrier when a vessel is upstream of the other vessel i e 270 for the shuttle tanker and 90 for the lng carrier the same trends can be observed as for the vessel alone a significant smaller cx coefficient and slightly smaller cy and cmz coefficients at full scale reynolds number however when the shuttle tanker is positioned in the wake of the lng carrier i e for current heading around 90 the cy coefficient at full scale reynolds number is slightly larger than at model scale reynolds number this can be explained by that at full scale reynolds number the boundary layers and wake behind the lng carrier are smaller than at model scale reynolds number as a consequence the region with shielding effects become smaller and thus the force coefficients for the downstream shuttle tanker become larger at full scale reynolds number when the lng carrier is in the wake of the shuttle tanker this phenomenon is not observed as the cy coefficient is close to zero for both model scale and full scale reynolds number for headings around 270 the shuttle tanker has larger draft than the lng carrier and thus the shuttle tanker is completely blocking the inflow to the lng carrier both at model and full scale reynolds number the result for cmz at 120 on the lng carrier at full scale reynolds number seems to be deviating from the trend when investigating the flow patterns for this heading nothing strange can be observed so it has to be assumed that the calculated value is correct the cmz values around this heading are close to zero for full scale reynolds number and thus small deviations in flow direction around the vessels can result in a different sign for the moment coefficient conclusions and recommendations current load measurements have been carried out on a side by side configuration of a lng carrier positioned close to a shuttle tanker furthermore the current loads on the lng carrier alone and on the shuttle tanker alone have been measured as well the objective of these measurements was to obtain reference data for a side by side configuration including shielding effects this reference data is then used to compare with numerical results at model scale reynolds number these results can be used as reference values in side by side mooring studies provided that the ratio in lengths and drafts are similar to the vessels in this paper however when the drafts lengths or the geometry of the vessels change also the shielding effects are expected to change when the two vessels are positioned next to each other significant shielding or interaction effects can be observed the cx coefficient of the vessel completely changes with another vessel present for the cy coefficient hardly anything changes when the vessel is upstream of the other vessel however when the vessel is in the wake of the other vessel the coefficient can even change sign meaning that the vessel is sucked towards the upstream vessel this effect is stronger for the lng carrier than for the shuttle tanker as the shuttle tanker is the largest vessel of the two for the cmz coefficient a decrease can be observed when the vessel is in the wake of the other vessel in this paper the experimental uncertainty range is estimated to be between 3 and 5 for the force coefficients cy and cmz and between 3 and 10 for cx based on the variability in results between repeat tests the random uncertainty of the mean value and based on the uncertainty of the measurement devices to determine the numerical uncertainty of the calculated results four consecutively refined grids are used for a selected number of headings based on those results the numerical uncertainty is determined to be 10 considering the uncertainties mentioned above a good agreement between experiments and cfd calculations is obtained when the difference is within 10 based on the results presented in this paper it is concluded that the current loads on two vessels in side by side configuration can be obtained using cfd calculations with acceptable accuracy the calculated results are within 10 compared with the measured results for most headings except for certain headings with significant interaction and shielding effects where larger differences can be found it should be noted that for beam on current the froude number based on the width of the vessels is around 0 19 which indicates that free surface effects may be important during the tests no significant waves were observed but inside the gap between the models some small deviation from rest position of the free surface could be observed for some headings this is not investigated in the present study but will be investigated further in a future study as free surface effects may be the reason for the observed differences based on the comparison between the numerical results at full scale and model scale reynolds number it is concluded that reynolds scale effects may have a significant influence on current loads the effect on friction dominated forces is large for cx a reduction up to 50 is observed at full scale reynolds number the effect on pressure dominated forces is smaller the values for cy at full scale reynolds number are 5 10 lower than at model scale reynolds number the moment coefficient cmz is also dominated by the pressure force but up to 30 lower values are found at full scale reynolds number due to a change of location and size of the flow separation regions and the associated pressure distribution on the hull the shielding effects appear to be slightly smaller at full scale reynolds number as the wake from the upstream vessel is slightly smaller in size resulting in larger force coefficients on the downstream vessel the results for the current coefficients at full scale reynolds number are found to be lower than at model scale reynolds number which implies that results from model tests are conservative for the current loads however current load coefficients may be used to estimate hydrodynamic damping and a lower coefficient implies lower damping this indicates that at full scale reynolds number the hydrodynamic damping would be less than estimated from model test results using cfd calculations the current load coefficients can be obtained at full scale reynolds number but as no validation material exists at full scale reynolds number the accuracy of these calculations is unknown therefore as done in this paper it is recommended to carry out calculations at grids with different resolution to determine the numerical uncertainty for both model and full scale reynolds number to obtain confidence in the numerical results then assuming that the differences between model test results and the numerical results at model scale reynolds number can be used for the accuracy of the numerical results at full scale reynolds number the numerical results at full scale reynolds number can be used to assess the current loads for engineering
