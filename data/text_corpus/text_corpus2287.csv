11435,as a mechanism of plants to adapt to soil water deficits promotion of water use efficiency has been the focus of strategies to increase crop tolerance to drought probable improvement of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi funnelliformis mosseae or rhizophagus irregularis for the essential oil and biological yield of watered and rainfed host plants lavender rosemary and thyme are the main aim of this study physiological responses of the host plants to inoculation with two species of fungi were evaluated under different irrigation regimes irrigation at 75 and 50 of field capacity and rainfed a factorial two factors experiment was conducted for two years 2015 2016 based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at urmia university inoculation with these root symbionts increased the colonization of the plants as compared to non inoculated plants the seedlings inoculated with fungi and subjected to water stress had more successful colonization stress reduced biological yield of inoculated and non inoculated plants drought induced reduction of biomass was significantly compensated for by mycorrhizal fungi the highest essential oil percentage was obtained in rainfed condition since water use efficiency is affected by economic performance and volume of used water in different years the results were variable increasing irrigation intervals can help the plants to adapt to water stress and prevent significant reduction in water use efficiency however in general this study showed that inoculation with fungi is effective in alleviating adverse

preparation and treatments application the three levels of irrigation including irrigation at 75 field capacity well watered 75fc 50 field capacity moderate stress 50fc and rainfed severe stress were applied after the last rainfall in both years as the first factor two mycorrhizal fungi species namely funnelliformis mosseae syn glomus mosseae and or rhizophagus irregularis syn glomus intraradices and a non amf inoculated treatment were considered as the second factor the seedlings of lavender rosemary and thyme were transplanted on the 22nd of april 2015 in nine rows 50 cm inter and 45 cm intra row spaces the mycorrhizal inocula initially isolated from the endemic amf community of a maize farm a mixture of sterile sand mycorrhizal hyphae and spores 20 spores g inoculum and colonized root fragments were provided by dr y rezaee danesh department of plant protection urmia university the biological fertilizers amf inocula were incorporated into the soil at depth of 10 30 cm inoculum was placed in the holes 20 g per hole through the plant seedlings roots and lightly covered with soil from the hole on the day of planting only the first year for non amf inoculated plants seedlings were transplanted with no inoculation inoculum potentials were 3400 and 3360 propagules per plant for f mosseae and r irregularis respectively the main soil physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 the plots were set at adequate distances 250 cm from each other with the purpose of triggering no interference weeds were controlled manually during the experiment 2 3 irrigation water calculation the irrigation water supply at each plot was measured with a water counter irrigation water needed prior to irrigation vn is the amount of water needed during irrigation to replenish the soil moisture deficit thereby taking the soil back to the field capacity vn was calculated using eq 1 benami and ofen 1984 1 vn fc wp bd d 1 asm a 100 where vn is the irrigation water needed before irrigation m3 fc is field capacity wp is the wilting point bd is bulk density g cm3 d is the root zone depth m asm is the available soil moisture before irrigation a fraction and a is the area of the field m2 determined with a pressure plate water holding content at field capacity 0 33 kpa was 28 6 and at the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa it was found to be 14 5 based on the above method the amounts of the used irrigation water were 2187 1500 and 0 m3 ha for the first year and 2625 2250 and 0 m3 ha for the second year for irrigation at 75fc 50fc and rainfed condition without irrigation respectively three of the lamiaceae species lavender rosemary and thyme were harvested on the 20th of september of the two years 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 colonization the percentage of plant root colonization was determined in 10 plants per experimental unit to this end fresh roots were cleared in 10 potassium hydroxide koh for 10 min at 90 c and then stained in 0 05 lactic acid glycerol trypan blue phillips and hayman 1970 root colonization was assessed using the gridline intersect method of liu and luo 1994 2 4 2 biological yield at plant maturity the yield was measured from 3 m2 of each experimental plot shoot dry biomass was equal to the sum of aerial vegetative plant parts and was expressed in kg ha flowers leaves and shoots were dried at ambient temperature mean 22 1 c for 96 h 2 4 3 essential oil floral foliage was obtained from 3 m2 of each experimental plot in the flowering stages in thyme mixed of two stage flowering air dried and weighed to extract the essential oil shade drying was done under conventional open air conditions for 96 h dried materials with 14 moisture content from each of these treatments were hydro distilled for 3 h using a clevenger type apparatus the essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and preserved in a sealed vial at 4 c until further analysis the sodium sulfate absorbs any water and clumps together clevenger 1928 the essential oil content was measured as percentage of weight then oil yield was determined using eq 2 2 yield of essential oil yield of dried aerial parts essential oil percentage 2 5 calculation of water use efficiency any concept of efficiency e g water use deals with the output yield obtainable from a given input water according to this concept the water use efficiency wue in the context of agricultural and environmental activities determines the yield y of the relevant plant attribute yields of biological wuebio and essential oil wueoil per unit volume of water w naturally available and added per unit plant growing area according to eq 3 3 wue y w irrigation use efficiency iue is defined in eq 4 4 iue yi wi where yi is the biomass iuebio or essential oil iueoil yield of irrigated crop per unit growing area minus average rainfed data of the treatment and wi is the volume of irrigation water per unit growing area rainfall use efficiency rue is defined in eq 5 5 rue yr wr where yr is the biomass ruebio or essential oil rueoil yield in rainfed conditions farm watered only by rainfall per unit growing area and wr is the seasonal volume of rainfall per unit growing area transpiration use efficiency tue is defined in eq 6 as 6 tue yt wt w here yt is the biomass tuebio or essential oil tueoil produced per unit of water transpired wt by a crop 2 6 determination of evapotranspiration to determine evapotranspiration et soil moisture at three profiles 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm depths was measured gravimetrically before each watering because no runoff was observed during the experiments capillary flow to the root zone and runoff flow were assumed to be negligible in calculating et after a number of soil water content measurements drainage below 90 cm was considered negligible evapotranspiration was measured in each plot based on soil moisture changes however evaporation of microlysimeter eml was calculated using the following relationship 7 eml dm ml aml p where eml soil evaporation measured with microlysimeter mm dmml microlysimeter variation of mass kg aml microlysimeter surface area and p precipitation mm the difference between evapotranspiration and evaporation is converted to transpiration flumignan et al 2012 2 7 statistical analysis the analysis of variance for the two year data was performed using glm procedure sas 9 1 3 sas institute inc cary nc usa as combined over years the effects of irrigation regimes the application of mycorrhiza and interactions of these two factors were analyzed using analysis of variance anova and means were compared using duncan s multiple range test dmrt p 0 05 3 results 3 1 lavandula officinalis the results of combined analysis of 2 year data indicated significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on the root colonization p 0 01 and essential oil percentage p 0 05 of lavender table 2 furthermore the interaction effects of year mycorrhiza on iuebio of lavender p 0 05 was significant this study showed significant effect of mycorrhiza on iueoil table 3 and rueoil table 4 significant effect of irrigation on iuebio table 3 and biological and essential oil yield table 2 inoculated lavender plants were highly mycorrhized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf but non inoculated plants were poorly colonized the highest colonization was observed in 50fc irrigated lavender plant roots inoculated with f mosseae in 2016 the lowest colonization was observed in 75fc irrigated non inoculated plants in 2015 f mosseae started higher colonization from the first year but it advanced only in 50fc moderate stress for r irregularis the root colonization in non inoculated plants had the least percentage for the three irrigation regimes however it increased in the second year up to at least 33 it seems that the presence of lavender root led to the reinforcement of mycorrhization there was a relative stability of high root colonization in the second year regardless of fungal species table 5 in all the highest root colonization was for plants irrigated at 50 fc followed by rainfed condition the lowest was in well irrigated plants root colonization of inoculated plants of both fungal species was higher than that of untreated control plants table 2 a gradual downward trend was observed in essential oil percentage with water deficit especially in severe stress condition the highest essential oil percentage was obtained from the rainfed lavender plants inoculated with r irregularis followed by amf inoculated plants of 50fc and 75fc in the first year similar to non inoculated lavender of all irrigation regimes the lowest essential oil percentage was obtained from plants inoculated with r irregularis at 75fc in the second year despite irrigation the essential oil percentage of amf inoculated plants was equally higher in the two fungal species in the first year though higher percentage of essential oil was obtained from the amf inoculated plants in the first year no superiority was found for them in the second year table 5 the maximum essential oil percentage was obtained under stress 50fc and rainfed condition the essential oil percentage in mycorrhizal plants respectively increased by 16 and 20 for f mosseae and r irregularis table 2 irrigation use efficiency for lavender biological yield significantly reduced with amf inoculation it was the least in the case of r irregularis this reduction did not occur in the second year since more rainfall resulted in low dependence on irrigation moreover inoculation with f mosseae could not change the iuebio table 6 well watered plants had higher iuebio than those with limited irrigation table 3 the mycorization led to a reduction in irrigation use efficiency for essential oil while inoculation with r irregularis maximized rueoil these results prove that a satisfactory symbiotic relationship depending on rainfall the highest rueoil by r irregularis needed no additional irrigation to raise iue table 3 reduction of irrigation intervals from non irrigation rainfed to well watering irrigation at 75 fc led to a significant two fold increase in the biological yield of lavender plants high biological yield in opposition to lower essential oil percentage of irrigated plants resulted in the same values of essential oil yield at two irrigation levels too much reduction of biological yield in the rainfed lavender resulted in the lowest yield of essential oil table 2 iuebio has a high correlation with water consumption and biological yield according to eq 4 a decrease in water due to stress certainly leads to a remarkable biological yield in the current study iuebio of 75fc irrigated lavenders increased by 50 as compared to 50fc irrigated plants due to maximum biological yield table 3 3 2 rosmarinus officinalis a two year data combined analysis of variance showed the significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on root colonization p 0 01 and the significant interaction of year irrigation on the biological yield of rosemary p 0 05 there were significant interaction effects of mycorrhiza irrigation on the essential oil yield wuebio and tuebio p 0 05 wueoil and tueoil of rosemary p 0 01 mycorrhiza had significant effect on iue and rue for biological and essential oil yield and irrigation had significant effect on iuebio and essential oil percentage tables 2 3 and 4 in rosemary irrespective of fungi species increase in irrigation water supply caused a significant reduction in root colonization in both years though in irrigated plants root colonization with f mosseae was twice as much as r irregularis and non inoculated treatments in rainfed rosemary the highest colonization was observed in both fungi species on the other hand there was a significant increase of rosemary root colonization by f mosseae for all irrigation levels table 5 rainfed rosemary plants mycorrhized higher than irrigated ones the percentage of plants colonized by f mosseae and r irregularis was higher than that of non inoculated plants table 2 the essential oil percentage of rosemary plants increased following water limitation in the following order well watered 75fc moderated stress 50fc and rainfed conditions table 2 essential oil yields in irrigated plants were the same for amf inoculated and non inoculated rosemary plants in rainfed condition in spite of an increase in essential oil percentage a biological yield loss of 35 culminated in the lowest essential oil production nevertheless its yield increased to the highest in symbiosis with r irregularis table 7 regardless of the experiment years higher yield in 2016 there was a considerable reduction in the biological yield in the order 75fc 50fc rainfed each year the maximum biological yield was related to rosemary plants irrigated at 75 fc table 8 the highest wuebio and wueoil were obtained from rainfed plants inoculated with r irregularis nonetheless no significant difference was observed between mycorrhizal and non inoculated irrigated 50fc and 75fc plants although the wueoil in all the irrigation treatments were lower than those of non inoculated rainfed rosemary plants table 7 wue for biological and essential oil yield had similar trend and rainfed plants had the highest data table 2 in rosemary the highest iuebio and iueoil were observed in plants inoculated with f mosseae these efficiencies were lower in r irregularis symbiosis as compared to the ones in non inoculated control plants table 3 with regards to the produced biomass the irrigation use efficiency of different irrigation levels was the same it showed that production of 1 kg of biological yield required the same amounts of irrigation water in both 50fc and 75fc treatments table 3 the plants inoculated with r irregularis were the most effective on ruebio and rueoil table 4 rue for biological and essential oil yield against iue revealed that the most useful treatment fungi species for rainfall use efficiency provides the least irrigation use efficiency table 4 severe stress rainfed improved the transpiration use efficiency for biological and essential oil yields of mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal plants with respect to well watered plants and moderate stress in this regard the highest tue biological and essential oil was obtained from rosemary plants inoculated with r irregularis table 7 rainfed plants showed the highest transpiration use efficiency for biological and essential oil yield and the irrigated plants showed similar tue table 2 3 3 thymus vulgaris combined analysis of data indicated significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on the essential oil percentage p 0 05 and significant interaction effects of mycorrhiza irrigation on thyme root colonization biological yield essential oil yield wue tue and iue biological and essential oil yield p 0 01 like the interaction of year irrigation on the essential yield p 0 01 wue and tue for biological p 0 05 and essential oil p 0 01 the effect of year mycorrhiza on iueoil p 0 01 was also significant rue for biological yield was significantly affected by mycorrhiza tables 2 3 and 4 thyme root colonization improved due to the inoculations of two fungi species these improvements differ greatly in each irrigation level root colonization of f mosseae and r irregularis was in the order 75fc and rainfed the same advantage of fungi species was observed in 50fc table 7 inoculated plants significantly exhibited higher levels of root colonization by f mosseae and r irregularis table 2 in plants irrigated at 50 and 75 fc mycorization was not effective on the contrary it even reduced biological yield it appears that the application of mycorrhiza improved biological yield only in rainfed with the superiority of r irregularis table 7 in the first year essential oil percentages of t vulgaris plants were the same and minimum for all irrigation and mycorrhizal treatments like non inoculated control nonetheless in the second year increase in water deficit severity caused an increase growth in essential oil for essential oil percentage there was a superiority of r irregularis in 50fc and f mosseae in rainfed conditions extremely the highest thyme essential oil percentage was obtained from rainfed plants inoculated with f mosseae in 2016 table 5 the increasing water deficit stress led to increase in essential oil percentage amf inoculation led to higher essential oil regardless of irrigation intervals table 2 severe stress significantly reduced biological yield and increased the essential oil yield slightly this increase was not sufficient to compensate for the yield loss due to reduced herbage yield the average values were almost the same for all the treatments table 7 totally the biological yield reduced more in amf inoculated plants with limited irrigation table 2 the results show a decreasing trend in essential oil yield together with the intensification of stress levels as observed in the first year hence it can be concluded that essential oil yield is a function of herbage yield in the three irrigation regimes essential oil yield was found to be relatively higher in 2016 the highest value was found for rainfed due to the maximum essential oil percentage table 8 well watered plants had the highest essential oil yield which was reduced under stress condition table 2 the efficiency of irrigation water iueoil was highest in non inoculated thyme plants for two years but decreased was found to be more pronounced in mycorrhizal plants in the second year due to more rainwater accumulation lower irrigation use efficiency indicated less independency on irrigation proving rainfall benefit table 6 however the maximum irrigation use efficiency iueoil and iuebio in non inoculated 75fc treatment higher dependency to irrigation reduced with moderate stress 50fc and mycorrhizal symbiosis two fungi species with the same iue essential oil and biological yields reduced the need for irrigation for both 75fc and 50fc table 7 iuebio of irrigated plants at 75 fc was higher than that of 50 fc especially in non inoculated plants table 3 there were no significant differences in terms of wuebio between the two fungi species in watered 75fc and 50fc conditions the differences between the two species were pronounced when only the inoculated plants were exposed to severe stress with the superiority of r irregularis hence the highest benefit of wuebio was recorded in mycorrhizal r irregularis rainfed plants near non inoculated well watered thyme plants table 7 in both years the highest wuebio was related to well watered plants 75fc because of maximum biological yield table 7 in spite of the same biological yields increase in wuebio in rainfed occurred due to no irrigation water use tables 2 and 8 with regards to essential oil production water use efficiency did not show a consistent trend in thyme plants it was the highest in plants exposed to severe stress same as non inoculated well watered plants these results indicate the highest degree of wue improvement in mycorrhizal stressed plants despite non significant effect of mycorization on wue in watered plants mycorrhizal plants in rainfed condition was found to be effective in increasing wueoil tables 2 and 7 in both time spans the highest wueoil was observed in rainfed plants in the second year a downward trend in wue for essential oil was observed in watered plants tables 2 and 8 mycorrhizal inoculation by r irregularis significantly stimulated ruebio amf inoculation caused a 35 increase in ruebio as compared to non inoculated control plants table 4 with the same trends for wue the values of tue for biological and essential oil yields significantly decreased in mycorrhizal well watered plants moderate stress 50fc showed no significant differences in mycorrhizal and non inoculated control plants in rainfed thyme plants tueoil was enhanced more effectively than tuebio by mycorrhization r irregularis had the highest benefit in terms of transpiration use efficiency on the other hand during severe drought tue was only enhanced by amf inoculation especially in the case of r irregularis tables 2 and 7 changes in tue biological and essential oils against irrigation were similar to those found in wue a higher biological yield in 75fc and superior essential oil percentage in rainfed increased tue in rainfed plants wue and tue improved because of reduced total water use with irrigation removal tables 2 and 8 4 discussion organisms often react simultaneously to a wide range of stresses and water deficit is one of the main factors affecting the activity of microorganism requena 2012 the results of the current study showed that colonization percentages of amf inoculated plants lavender rosemary and thyme significantly increased particularly during water stressed conditions perhaps high levels of exudates in rhizosphere in water stress caused a plethora of microorganisms to a large extent there were some reports on capsicum annum davies et al 2002 linum usitatissimum rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017b and citrus reticulate sarkar et al 2016 that water stress improved mycorrhizal symbiotic establishment despite having native microorganisms e g arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the field soil an increase in this population could occur as a result of amf inoculation treatments as reported for linum ussitatisimum rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017b and vigna radiate habibzadeh et al 2015 in the three species of lamiaceae lavender rosemary and thyme water deficit stress negatively affected biological yield nevertheless amf inoculation moderates water stress induced negative effect and seems to enhance plant growth through the accumulation of different solutes and enzyme activities hazzoumi et al 2015 rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017a b of course amf stimulates growth and drives the water status in plants to an optimal level hazzoumi et al 2015 this ability may be due to more extension of mycorrhizal hyphae and more availability of macro and micro nutritional elements in soil püschel et al 2016 gupta et al 2002 reported that the inoculation of wild mint mentha arvensis l by rhizoglomus fasciculatum increased its shoot growth negative effect of mycorrhization in biological yields of well watered thyme plants and ineffectiveness on biological yields of rosemary and lavender with an optimal water supply was found one should bear in mind that different species vary in their degree of reactions with mycorrhiza especially in disparate irrigated water supplies habibzadeh et al 2013 2015 with regards to stress more metabolites produced in the plants and substances prevent oxidization in the cells on the other hand essential oil content reduces and or increases under drought due to interaction between the increased essential oil percentage and reduced yield inoculation with amf indicated an eco friendly strategy to enhance the sustainability of the production of bioactive molecules in the investigated lamiaceae species the positive effect of amf inoculation on biomass production or the content of essential oil depends on the species of plant and or fungi tarraf et al 2015 the beneficial roles of amf inoculation on the improvement of quantitative and qualitative yields of essential oil have been reported by previous studies kapoor et al 2002 2004 essential oils are terpenoids that require acetyl coa atp and nadph for synthesis hence the biosynthesis of essential oil is dependent on inorganic phosphorous content of the plant ganjewala and luthra 2007 in the current study the co inoculation of f mosseae and r irregularis might be due to an improvement in plant water and phosphorous uptake artursson et al 2006 habibzadeh et al 2015 relative to non amf inoculated plants which in turn enhanced essential oil content furthermore wue associated with the ability of a plant to absorb higher concentrations of carbon and limited water loss is strongly related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency which is prone to change by irrigation monneveux and ribaut 2006 flexas et al 2013 varying amounts of wue were found for three levels of irrigation and both wuebio and wueoil increased with stress severity the higher wue observed under water deficit stress can be duo to the fact that stressed plants show much greater wilting than well watered ones therefore the plant only assimilates material during periods that the saturation deficit is low and it loses less water for every carbon molecule that it fixes bloch et al 2006 the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be regarded as a biological strategy to improve wue all plant species lavender rosemary and thyme benefited from mycorrhizal association colonized plants produced greater dry matter and lesser water use than non amf inoculated plants overall mycorrhizal plants require lesser water than non inoculated plants to produce 1 kg dry matter it shows that mycorrhizal plants are able to maintain higher tissue water content while imparting greater drought resistance kumar et al 2016 in amf inoculated plants a lesser increase in leaf conductance and transpiration than p and k uptake caused resistance against water deficit stress accordingly the response of plants inoculated with r irregularis to stress and k content are closely related zhang et al 2017 the tue for essential oil and biological yields in stress condition was greater than those in unstressed conditions in the three plants thyme lavender and rosemary the results showed that tue of the rainfed plants was higher as compared to that of irrigated plants showing that irrigation might reduce tue leaf transpiration creates the tension necessary for roots to absorb soil solution containing essential nutrients keller 2005 rainfall use efficiency was found to be a better indicator of the biome sensitivity to water availability huxman et al 2004 ponce campos et al 2013 which was high during the wet year 2016 and low during the dry year 2015 fig 1 rue decreased with increase in water availability in the wet year due to improvements in biomass production 5 conclusions results of the current study clearly show that inoculated plants exhibited a specific response to irrigation levels lavender rosemary and thyme roots were colonized by means of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi positively under stress conditions drought induced a significant increase in essential oil percentages essential oil yields changed in relation to biological yields and essential oil percentages additionally the findings show that some degrees of water deficit could improve wue which could partially be justified in terms of stomatal control on transpiration as an important finding the least root colonization of non inoculated control plants was found in lavender for all the irrigation conditions 75fc 50fc and rainfed and it significantly increased to over 30 in the second year 75fc and 50fc 
11435,as a mechanism of plants to adapt to soil water deficits promotion of water use efficiency has been the focus of strategies to increase crop tolerance to drought probable improvement of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi funnelliformis mosseae or rhizophagus irregularis for the essential oil and biological yield of watered and rainfed host plants lavender rosemary and thyme are the main aim of this study physiological responses of the host plants to inoculation with two species of fungi were evaluated under different irrigation regimes irrigation at 75 and 50 of field capacity and rainfed a factorial two factors experiment was conducted for two years 2015 2016 based on a randomized complete block design with three replications at urmia university inoculation with these root symbionts increased the colonization of the plants as compared to non inoculated plants the seedlings inoculated with fungi and subjected to water stress had more successful colonization stress reduced biological yield of inoculated and non inoculated plants drought induced reduction of biomass was significantly compensated for by mycorrhizal fungi the highest essential oil percentage was obtained in rainfed condition since water use efficiency is affected by economic performance and volume of used water in different years the results were variable increasing irrigation intervals can help the plants to adapt to water stress and prevent significant reduction in water use efficiency however in general this study showed that inoculation with fungi is effective in alleviating adverse effects of water stress keywords colonization essential oil funnelliformis mosseae irrigation rainfed rhizophagus irregularis 1 introduction the lamiaceae family formerly called labiatae with 236

preparation and treatments application the three levels of irrigation including irrigation at 75 field capacity well watered 75fc 50 field capacity moderate stress 50fc and rainfed severe stress were applied after the last rainfall in both years as the first factor two mycorrhizal fungi species namely funnelliformis mosseae syn glomus mosseae and or rhizophagus irregularis syn glomus intraradices and a non amf inoculated treatment were considered as the second factor the seedlings of lavender rosemary and thyme were transplanted on the 22nd of april 2015 in nine rows 50 cm inter and 45 cm intra row spaces the mycorrhizal inocula initially isolated from the endemic amf community of a maize farm a mixture of sterile sand mycorrhizal hyphae and spores 20 spores g inoculum and colonized root fragments were provided by dr y rezaee danesh department of plant protection urmia university the biological fertilizers amf inocula were incorporated into the soil at depth of 10 30 cm inoculum was placed in the holes 20 g per hole through the plant seedlings roots and lightly covered with soil from the hole on the day of planting only the first year for non amf inoculated plants seedlings were transplanted with no inoculation inoculum potentials were 3400 and 3360 propagules per plant for f mosseae and r irregularis respectively the main soil physicochemical properties are presented in table 1 the plots were set at adequate distances 250 cm from each other with the purpose of triggering no interference weeds were controlled manually during the experiment 2 3 irrigation water calculation the irrigation water supply at each plot was measured with a water counter irrigation water needed prior to irrigation vn is the amount of water needed during irrigation to replenish the soil moisture deficit thereby taking the soil back to the field capacity vn was calculated using eq 1 benami and ofen 1984 1 vn fc wp bd d 1 asm a 100 where vn is the irrigation water needed before irrigation m3 fc is field capacity wp is the wilting point bd is bulk density g cm3 d is the root zone depth m asm is the available soil moisture before irrigation a fraction and a is the area of the field m2 determined with a pressure plate water holding content at field capacity 0 33 kpa was 28 6 and at the permanent wilting point 1500 kpa it was found to be 14 5 based on the above method the amounts of the used irrigation water were 2187 1500 and 0 m3 ha for the first year and 2625 2250 and 0 m3 ha for the second year for irrigation at 75fc 50fc and rainfed condition without irrigation respectively three of the lamiaceae species lavender rosemary and thyme were harvested on the 20th of september of the two years 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 colonization the percentage of plant root colonization was determined in 10 plants per experimental unit to this end fresh roots were cleared in 10 potassium hydroxide koh for 10 min at 90 c and then stained in 0 05 lactic acid glycerol trypan blue phillips and hayman 1970 root colonization was assessed using the gridline intersect method of liu and luo 1994 2 4 2 biological yield at plant maturity the yield was measured from 3 m2 of each experimental plot shoot dry biomass was equal to the sum of aerial vegetative plant parts and was expressed in kg ha flowers leaves and shoots were dried at ambient temperature mean 22 1 c for 96 h 2 4 3 essential oil floral foliage was obtained from 3 m2 of each experimental plot in the flowering stages in thyme mixed of two stage flowering air dried and weighed to extract the essential oil shade drying was done under conventional open air conditions for 96 h dried materials with 14 moisture content from each of these treatments were hydro distilled for 3 h using a clevenger type apparatus the essential oil was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and preserved in a sealed vial at 4 c until further analysis the sodium sulfate absorbs any water and clumps together clevenger 1928 the essential oil content was measured as percentage of weight then oil yield was determined using eq 2 2 yield of essential oil yield of dried aerial parts essential oil percentage 2 5 calculation of water use efficiency any concept of efficiency e g water use deals with the output yield obtainable from a given input water according to this concept the water use efficiency wue in the context of

evapotranspiration to determine evapotranspiration et soil moisture at three profiles 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm depths was measured gravimetrically before each watering because no runoff was observed during the experiments capillary flow to the root zone and runoff flow were assumed to be negligible in calculating et after a number of soil water content measurements drainage below 90 cm was considered negligible evapotranspiration was measured in each plot based on soil moisture changes however evaporation of microlysimeter eml was calculated using the following relationship 7 eml dm ml aml p where eml soil evaporation measured with microlysimeter mm dmml microlysimeter variation of mass kg aml microlysimeter surface area and p precipitation mm the difference between evapotranspiration and evaporation is converted to transpiration flumignan et al 2012 2 7 statistical analysis the analysis of variance for the two year data was performed using glm procedure sas 9 1

anova and means were compared using duncan s multiple range test dmrt p 0 05 3 results 3 1 lavandula officinalis the results of combined analysis of 2 year data indicated significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on the root colonization p 0 01 and essential oil percentage p 0 05 of lavender table 2 furthermore the interaction effects of year mycorrhiza on iuebio of lavender p 0 05 was significant this study showed significant effect of mycorrhiza on iueoil table 3 and rueoil table 4 significant effect of irrigation on iuebio table 3 and biological and essential oil yield table 2 inoculated lavender plants were highly mycorrhized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf but non inoculated plants were poorly colonized the highest colonization was observed in 50fc irrigated lavender plant roots inoculated with f mosseae in 2016 the lowest colonization was observed in 75fc irrigated non inoculated plants in 2015 f mosseae started higher colonization from the first year but it advanced only in 50fc moderate stress for r irregularis the root colonization in non inoculated plants had the least percentage for the three irrigation regimes however it increased in the second year up to at least 33 it seems that the presence of lavender root led to the reinforcement of mycorrhization there was a relative stability of high root colonization in the second year regardless of fungal species table 5 in all the highest root colonization was for plants irrigated at 50 fc followed by rainfed condition the lowest was in well irrigated plants root colonization of inoculated plants of both fungal species was higher than that of untreated control plants table 2 a gradual downward trend was observed in essential oil percentage with water deficit especially in severe stress condition the highest essential oil percentage was obtained from the rainfed lavender plants inoculated with r irregularis followed by amf inoculated plants of 50fc and 75fc in the first year similar to non inoculated lavender of all irrigation regimes the lowest essential oil percentage was obtained from plants inoculated with r irregularis at 75fc in the second year despite irrigation the essential oil percentage of amf inoculated plants was equally higher in the two fungal species in the first year though higher percentage of essential oil was obtained from the amf inoculated plants in the first year no superiority was found for them in the second year table 5 the maximum essential oil percentage was obtained under stress 50fc and rainfed condition the essential oil percentage in mycorrhizal plants respectively increased by 16 and 20 for f mosseae and r irregularis table 2 irrigation use efficiency for lavender biological yield significantly reduced with amf inoculation it was the least in the case of r irregularis this reduction did not occur in the second year since more rainfall resulted in low dependence on irrigation moreover inoculation with f mosseae could not change the iuebio table 6 well watered plants had higher iuebio than those with limited irrigation table 3 the mycorization led to a reduction in irrigation use efficiency for essential oil while inoculation with r irregularis maximized rueoil these results prove that a satisfactory symbiotic relationship depending on rainfall the highest rueoil by r irregularis needed no additional irrigation to raise iue table 3 reduction of irrigation intervals from non irrigation rainfed to well watering irrigation at 75 fc led to a significant two fold increase in the biological yield of lavender plants high biological yield in opposition to lower essential oil percentage of irrigated plants resulted in the same values of essential oil yield at two irrigation levels too much reduction of biological yield in the rainfed lavender resulted in the lowest yield of essential oil table 2 iuebio has a high correlation with water consumption and biological yield according to eq 4 a decrease in water due to stress certainly leads to a remarkable biological yield in the current study iuebio of 75fc irrigated lavenders increased by 50 as compared to 50fc irrigated plants due to maximum biological yield table 3 3 2 rosmarinus officinalis a two year data combined analysis of variance showed the significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on root colonization p 0 01 and the significant interaction of year irrigation on the biological yield of rosemary p 0 05 there were significant interaction effects of mycorrhiza irrigation on the essential oil yield wuebio and tuebio p 0 05 wueoil and tueoil of rosemary p 0 01 mycorrhiza had significant effect on iue and rue for biological and essential oil yield and irrigation had significant effect on iuebio and essential oil percentage tables 2 3 and 4 in rosemary irrespective of fungi species increase in irrigation water supply caused a significant reduction in root colonization in both years though in irrigated plants root colonization with f mosseae was twice as much as r irregularis and non inoculated treatments in rainfed rosemary the highest colonization was observed in both fungi species on the other hand there was a significant increase of rosemary root colonization by f mosseae for all irrigation levels table 5 rainfed rosemary plants mycorrhized higher than irrigated ones the percentage of plants colonized by f mosseae and r irregularis was higher than that of non inoculated plants table 2 the essential oil percentage of rosemary plants increased following water limitation in the following order well watered 75fc moderated stress 50fc and rainfed conditions table 2 essential oil yields in irrigated plants were the same for amf inoculated and non inoculated rosemary plants in rainfed condition in spite of an increase in essential oil percentage a biological yield loss of 35 culminated in the lowest essential oil production nevertheless its yield increased to the highest in symbiosis with r irregularis table 7 regardless of the experiment years higher yield in 2016 there was a considerable reduction in the biological yield in the order 75fc 50fc rainfed each year the maximum biological yield was related to rosemary plants irrigated at 75 fc table 8 the highest wuebio and wueoil were obtained from rainfed plants inoculated with r irregularis nonetheless no significant difference was observed between mycorrhizal and non inoculated irrigated 50fc and 75fc plants although the wueoil in all the irrigation treatments were lower than those of non inoculated rainfed rosemary plants table 7 wue for biological and essential oil yield had similar trend and rainfed plants had the highest data table 2 in rosemary the highest iuebio and iueoil were observed in plants inoculated with f mosseae these efficiencies were lower in r irregularis symbiosis as compared to the ones in non inoculated control plants table 3 with regards to the produced biomass the irrigation use efficiency of different irrigation levels was the same it showed that production of 1 kg of biological yield required the same amounts of irrigation water in both 50fc and 75fc treatments table 3 the plants inoculated with r irregularis were the most effective on ruebio and rueoil table 4 rue for biological and essential oil yield against iue revealed that the most useful treatment fungi species for rainfall use efficiency provides the least irrigation use efficiency table 4 severe stress rainfed improved the transpiration use efficiency for biological and essential oil yields of mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal plants with respect to well watered plants and moderate stress in this regard the highest tue biological and essential oil was obtained from rosemary plants inoculated with r irregularis table 7 rainfed plants showed the highest transpiration use efficiency for biological and essential oil yield and the irrigated plants showed similar tue table 2 3 3 thymus vulgaris combined analysis of data indicated significant interaction effects of year irrigation mycorrhiza on the essential oil percentage p 0 05 and significant interaction effects of mycorrhiza irrigation on thyme root colonization biological yield essential oil yield wue tue and iue biological and essential oil yield p 0 01 like the interaction of year irrigation on the essential yield p 0 01 wue and tue for biological p 0 05 and essential oil p 0 01 the effect of year mycorrhiza on iueoil p 0 01 was also significant rue for biological yield was significantly affected by mycorrhiza tables 2 3 and 4 thyme root colonization improved due to the inoculations of two fungi species these improvements differ greatly in each irrigation level root colonization of f mosseae and r irregularis was in the order 75fc and rainfed the same advantage of fungi species was observed in 50fc table 7 inoculated plants significantly exhibited higher levels of root colonization by f mosseae and r irregularis table 2 in plants irrigated at 50 and 75 fc mycorization was not effective on the contrary it even reduced biological yield it appears that the application of mycorrhiza improved biological yield only in rainfed with the superiority of r irregularis table 7 in the first year essential oil percentages of t vulgaris plants were the same and minimum for all irrigation and mycorrhizal treatments like non inoculated control nonetheless in the second year increase in water deficit severity caused an increase growth in essential oil for essential oil percentage there was a superiority of r irregularis in 50fc and f mosseae in rainfed conditions extremely the highest thyme essential oil percentage was obtained from rainfed plants inoculated with f mosseae in 2016 table 5 the increasing water deficit stress led to increase in essential oil percentage amf inoculation led to higher essential oil regardless of irrigation intervals table 2 severe stress significantly reduced biological yield and increased the essential oil yield slightly this increase was not sufficient to compensate for the yield loss due to reduced herbage yield the average values were almost the same for all the treatments table 7 totally the biological yield reduced more in amf inoculated plants with limited irrigation table 2 the results show a decreasing trend in essential oil yield together with the intensification of stress levels as observed in the first year hence it can be concluded that essential oil yield is a function of herbage yield in the three irrigation regimes essential oil yield was found to be relatively higher in 2016 the highest value was found for rainfed due to the maximum essential oil percentage table 8 well watered plants had the highest essential oil yield which was reduced under stress condition table 2 the efficiency of irrigation water iueoil was highest in non inoculated thyme plants for two years but decreased was found to be more pronounced in mycorrhizal plants in the second year due to more rainwater accumulation lower irrigation use efficiency indicated less independency on irrigation proving rainfall benefit table 6 however the maximum irrigation use efficiency iueoil and iuebio in non inoculated 75fc treatment higher dependency to irrigation reduced with moderate stress 50fc and mycorrhizal symbiosis two fungi species with the same iue essential oil and biological yields reduced the need for irrigation for both 75fc and 50fc table 7 iuebio of irrigated plants at 75 fc was higher than that of 50 fc especially in non inoculated plants table 3 there were no significant differences in terms of wuebio between the two fungi species in watered 75fc and 50fc conditions the differences between the two species were pronounced when only the inoculated plants were exposed to severe stress with the superiority of r irregularis hence the highest benefit of wuebio was recorded in mycorrhizal r irregularis rainfed plants near non inoculated well watered thyme plants table 7 in both years the highest wuebio was related to well watered plants 75fc because of maximum biological yield table 7 in spite of the same biological yields increase in wuebio in rainfed occurred due to no irrigation water use tables 2 and 8 with regards to essential oil production water use efficiency did not show a consistent trend in thyme plants it was the highest in plants exposed to severe stress same as non inoculated well watered plants these results indicate the highest degree of wue improvement in mycorrhizal stressed plants despite non significant effect of mycorization on wue in watered plants mycorrhizal plants in rainfed condition was found to be effective in increasing wueoil tables 2 and 7 in both time spans the highest wueoil was observed in rainfed plants in the second year a downward trend in wue for essential oil was observed in watered plants tables 2 and 8 mycorrhizal inoculation by r irregularis significantly stimulated ruebio amf inoculation caused a 35 increase in ruebio as compared to non inoculated control plants table 4 with the same trends for wue the values of tue for biological and essential oil yields significantly decreased in mycorrhizal well watered plants moderate stress 50fc showed no significant differences in mycorrhizal and non inoculated control plants in rainfed thyme plants tueoil was enhanced more effectively than tuebio by mycorrhization r irregularis had the highest benefit in terms of transpiration use efficiency on the other hand during severe drought tue was only enhanced by amf inoculation especially in the case of r irregularis tables 2 and 7 changes in tue biological and essential oils against irrigation were similar to those found in wue a higher biological yield in 75fc and superior essential oil percentage in rainfed increased tue in rainfed plants wue and tue improved because of reduced total water use with irrigation removal tables 2 and 8 4 discussion organisms often react simultaneously to a wide range of stresses and water deficit is one of the main factors affecting the activity of microorganism requena 2012 the results of the current study showed that colonization percentages of amf inoculated plants lavender rosemary and thyme significantly increased particularly during water stressed conditions perhaps high levels of exudates in rhizosphere in water stress caused a plethora of microorganisms to a large extent there were some reports on capsicum annum davies et al 2002 linum usitatissimum rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017b and citrus reticulate sarkar et al 2016 that water stress improved mycorrhizal symbiotic establishment despite having native microorganisms e g arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the field soil an increase in this population could occur as a result of amf inoculation treatments as reported for linum ussitatisimum rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017b and vigna radiate habibzadeh et al 2015 in the three species of lamiaceae lavender rosemary and thyme water deficit stress negatively affected biological yield nevertheless amf inoculation moderates water stress induced negative effect and seems to enhance plant growth through the accumulation of different solutes and enzyme activities hazzoumi et al 2015 rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017a b of course amf stimulates growth and drives the water status in plants to an optimal level hazzoumi et al 2015 this ability may be due to more extension of mycorrhizal hyphae and more availability of macro and micro nutritional elements in soil püschel et al 2016 gupta et al 2002 reported that the inoculation of wild mint mentha arvensis l by rhizoglomus fasciculatum increased its shoot growth negative effect of mycorrhization in biological yields of well watered thyme plants and ineffectiveness on biological yields of rosemary and lavender with an optimal water supply was found one should bear in mind that different species vary in their degree of reactions with mycorrhiza especially in disparate irrigated water supplies habibzadeh et al 2013 2015 with regards to stress more metabolites produced in the plants and substances prevent oxidization in the cells on the other hand essential oil content reduces and or increases under drought due to interaction between the increased essential oil percentage and reduced yield inoculation with amf indicated an eco friendly strategy to enhance the sustainability of the production of bioactive molecules in the investigated lamiaceae species the positive effect of amf inoculation on biomass production or the content of essential oil depends on the species of plant and or fungi tarraf et al 2015 the beneficial roles of amf inoculation on the improvement of quantitative and qualitative yields of essential oil have been reported by previous studies kapoor et al 2002 2004 essential oils are terpenoids that require acetyl coa atp and nadph for synthesis hence the biosynthesis of essential oil is dependent on inorganic phosphorous content of the plant ganjewala and luthra 2007 in the current study the co inoculation of f mosseae and r irregularis might be due to an improvement in plant water and phosphorous uptake artursson et al 2006 habibzadeh et al 2015 relative to non amf inoculated plants which in turn enhanced essential oil content furthermore wue associated with the ability of a plant to absorb higher concentrations of carbon and limited water loss is strongly related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency which is prone to change by irrigation monneveux and ribaut 2006 flexas et al 2013 varying amounts of wue were found for three levels of irrigation and both wuebio and wueoil increased with stress severity the higher wue observed under water deficit stress can be duo to the fact that stressed plants show much greater wilting than well watered ones therefore the plant only assimilates material during periods that the saturation deficit is low and it loses less water for every carbon molecule that it fixes bloch et al 2006 the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can be regarded as a biological strategy to improve wue all plant species lavender rosemary and thyme benefited from mycorrhizal association colonized plants produced greater dry matter and lesser water use than non amf inoculated plants overall mycorrhizal plants require lesser water than non inoculated plants to produce 1 kg dry matter it shows that mycorrhizal plants are able to maintain higher tissue water content while imparting greater drought resistance kumar et al 2016 in amf inoculated plants a lesser increase in leaf conductance and transpiration than p and k uptake caused resistance against water deficit stress accordingly the response of plants inoculated with r irregularis to stress and k content are closely related zhang et al 2017 the tue for essential oil and biological yields in stress condition was greater than those in unstressed conditions in the three plants thyme lavender and rosemary the results showed that tue of the rainfed plants was higher as compared to that of irrigated plants showing that irrigation might reduce tue leaf transpiration creates the tension necessary for roots to absorb soil solution containing essential nutrients keller 2005 rainfall use efficiency was found to be a better indicator of the biome sensitivity to water availability huxman et al 2004 ponce campos et al 2013 which was high during the wet year 2016 and low during the dry year 2015 fig 1 rue decreased with increase in water availability in the wet year due to improvements in biomass production 5 conclusions results of the current study clearly show that inoculated plants exhibited a specific response to irrigation levels lavender rosemary and thyme roots were colonized by means of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi positively under stress conditions drought induced a significant increase in essential oil percentages essential oil yields changed in relation to biological yields and essential oil percentages additionally the findings show that some degrees of water deficit could improve wue which could partially be justified in terms of stomatal control on transpiration as an important finding the least root colonization of non inoculated control plants was found in lavender for all the irrigation conditions 75fc 50fc and rainfed and it significantly increased to over 30 in the second year 75fc and 50fc 
11436,while the benefits of soil water management practices relative to soil erosion have been extensively documented evidence regarding their effect on yields is inconclusive following a strong el niño some regions of ethiopia experienced major droughts during the 2015 16 agricultural season using the propensity scores method on a nationally representative survey in ethiopia this study investigates the effect of two widely adopted soil water management practices terraces and contour bunds on yields and assesses their potential to mitigate the effects of climate change it is shown that at the national level terraced plots have slightly lower yields than non terraced plots however data support the hypothesis that terraced plots acted as a buffer against the 2015 ethiopian drought while contour bunds did not this study provides evidence that terraces have the potential to help farmer deal with current climate risks these results can inform the design of climate change adaptation policies and improve targeting of soil water management practices in ethiopia keywords soil water management practices climate smart agriculture terraces contour bunds drought propensity score matching ethiopia 1 introduction research suggests that conventional agriculture creates unsustainable erosion rates that can result in decreased agricultural potential montgomery 2007 in ethiopia soil erosion is considered a severe constraint for land resource productivity since the 1980s massive soil conservation programs have been carried out by governmental and non governmental organizations following a top down approach soil water management practices have been promoted according to the land s physical limitations and erosion risks these interventions often implemented at the water catchment level are designed to foster community labor mobilization desta et al 2005 climate change is an additional burden to these already prevalent environmental challenges expected changes in the frequency and occurrence of precipitation patterns in ethiopia souverijns et al 2016 are likely to threaten agricultural productivity sultan 2012 in recent years climate smart agriculture has emerged as an approach whose objective is to integrate climate change into the planning and implementation of sustainable agricultural strategies lipper et al 2014 three pillars define this approach sustainable production adapting and building resilience to climate change and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture consequently soil water management practices that sustainably increase productivity and resilience while reducing greenhouse gas emissions certainly qualify as climate smart practices zougmoré et al 2014 although there is considerable interest in understanding farmer s resilience to climate change among different soil water management practices surprisingly little empirical evidence exists the question of whether soil water management practices can increase resilience in the context of climate change can best be assessed through crop yield response to extreme events this article explores two soil water management practices that have been widely adopted in ethiopia terraces and contour bunds farmers implement these practices as an adaptive strategy for agricultural land use in mountainous areas prone to erosion they differ regarding the scale of intervention needed the amount of labor involved and the potential benefits for yields wocat 2003 on the one hand terraces consist of building horizontal human made plots and are thus labor intensive by reducing plot steepness terraces affect soil composition hydrology and thus plant growth a meta analysis found that terracing was on average 11 5 times more efficient at controlling erosion than non terraced plots wei et al 2016 the authors also observe an effect on runoff reduction soil water recharge and nutrient enhancement in ethiopia terraces have been mostly implemented in the form of level ditches where the soil is thrown uphill to form an embankment fanja yuu terraces but stone bunds are also common kato et al 2011 on the other hand contour bunds are a simple agronomic measure that consists of ploughing and planting across the field slope so that it matches contour lines the practice does not lead to changes in the slope profile and can be repeated each cropping season gebreegziabher et al 2009 provide evidence of a positive effect of contour bunds on water utilization and soil conservation as noted by the authors contour bunds are most efficient when used in combination with other soil water management practices previous studies in sub saharan africa have shown mixed evidence regarding the effect of terraces and contour bunds on yields with most but not all studies reporting a positive effect gebremedhin et al 1999 vancampenhout et al 2006 adgo et al 2013 in tanzania raes et al 2007 found that contour bunds appreciably increased the production of rain fed lowland rice one limitation of these studies is that they are conducted on relatively homogenous areas while also relying on small sample sizes raising questions about inferences that can be made another interesting contribution is kato et al 2011 who found that soil water management practices perform differently in the different rainfall regimes of ethiopia while the authors acknowledged a risk reducing effect of stone bunds in low rainfall areas soil bunds were only effective when used in combination with other technologies at present the relationship between soil water management and yield response to extreme events has seldom been examined and no empirical evidence exist for how yields would respond to extreme events in 2015 some regions of ethiopia faced one of the worst drought in decades the zones of tigray and amhara were hit particularly hard see fig a 1 in supplementary material according to un estimates about 10 2 million farmers were in need of food assistance at the end of the 2015 16 meher season wfpe 2016 the pathway through which soil water management practices may offer a buffering effect when a drought occurs is complex studies have demonstrated that at the global level climate variability accounts for one third of observed cereal yields variability lobell and field 2007 ray et al 2015 however due to the predominantly rainfed system of cultivation in sub saharan africa as high as 60 of cereal yield variability could be explained by climate variability ray et al 2015 when rainfall events occur part of the surface water runs off while the rest infiltrates the soil at different levels on mountainous plots water infiltration in the soil is typically limited most of surface water runs off terracing decreases connectivity of overland flow allows enhancing water infiltration and leading to an increase in soil moisture the micro watersheds created by terracing can increase water concentration as well as soil nutrient which in turns provides better water conservation vancampenhout et al 2006 the altered soil structure richer in nutrients can reduce evaporation and consequently have a shock minimizing effect when a drought occur thus it is hypothesized that compared to sites without terraces terracing leads to a yield increase in drought affected areas due to deeper water infiltration soil water availability soil nutrient supply and reduced evaporation this effect is hypothesized to be more important on terraced plots that rely on a structural transformation than on plots where contour bunding was practiced while contour bunds also decrease run off volume the effect on soil nutrient levels is likely more limited gebreegziabher et al 2009 and thus the effect on yields may not be as pronounced as for terracing yields are influenced by several other factors including biophysical factors crop genetics biotic and abiotic stress as well as farm management practices at different phenological stages of plant growth ideally these factors should be accounted for when estimating the effect of soil water management practices on yields this article thus investigates the effect of terraces and contour bunds on yields during the 2015 drought in ethiopia using the propensity matching method the treatment effect of these practices is first estimated across all of ethiopia and then stratified across agro ecological settings furthermore yield response of terraced and contour bunds plots given drought intensity is assessed 2 methods 2 1 data description this study draws from the

chosen randomly in each rural and small town eas fig 1 data were collected from september 2015 to april 2016 datasets are publicly available at http microdata worldbank org index php catalog 2783 for precipitations daily rainfall values from the climate prediction center s cpc unified gauge based analysis available at a 0 5 resolution for ethiopia were extracted using the raincpc package goteti

satellite observations and model forecasts gauge stations outputs are interpolated with consideration of orographic effects as described in xie et al 2007 monthly mean temperature data were obtained from the national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa ghcn cams global land surface temperatures dataset fan and van den dool 2008 also available at a 0 5 resolution for ethiopia rainfall and temperature data were estimated for each field cultivated during the 2015 16 agricultural season by every household from the ess survey using the 0 5 pixel in which each field is located the dataset a

dataset used for analysis 2 2 propensity score matching as farmer adoption of soil water management practices is not random an estimation of the causal effect of adoption would suffer from a selection bias adopters and non adopters differ in observable and non observable characteristics that may also affect the outcome of interest although controlled randomization is desirable in our case such data would be difficult to obtain under non experimental conditions and costly to generate on a large scale here a propensity score matching method is employed in an attempt to approximate the virtues of randomization rosenbaum and rubin 1983 the method is used to match treated plots terraced plots plots with contour bunds with households and fields that have similar observable characteristics but were not treated unterraced plots plots without contour bunds in the matching process all covariates that are likely to affect the selection of a plot in the treatment group as well as covariates likely to influence yields were included heckman et al 1997 covariates that are thought to be affected by treatment were not included matching was performed using 30 covariates that include household environment and plot level characteristics based on a review of the existing literature amsalu and de graaff 2007 abebe and sewnet 2014 in order to match plots that have similar agro ecological settings the ea is used as a covariate in cases where there was no similar but untreated plot available within the ea the spatially closest plot with similar covariates was chosen table a 1 in the supplementary material presents descriptive statistics on the 30 covariates used to create propensity scores it is clear that adopters and non adopters differ regarding their observable characteristics by conditioning matching on these covariates it is argued that the most obvious selection effects are mitigated propensity score matching was conducted using the matching package sekhon 2011 and was estimated using a generalized linear model with logit link treated plots were matched to non treated plots with the closest propensity score on a ratio of 1 1 using the nearest neighbor method algorithm with no replacement the potential average effect of treated plots on yields is estimated by calculating the difference between the yields of treated plots and what the yields would have been if the plot had not been treated this is done by calculating the average treatment on the treated att on matched samples as we are interested in measuring the effect of the treatment of interest t 1 relative to an absence of treatment t 0 given covariates x we want to estimate att e y 1 y 0 x t 1 where y 1 is the yield outcome for treated plots and y 0 is the yield outcome for matched plots the att is first estimated for ethiopia and then by stratifying data into agro ecological settings and drought intensity findings are robust to the use of more restrictive matching methods see table a 3 in supplementary material 2 3 drought exposure two metrics of drought exposure percentage of dry days and percentage of dry spells were computed for each household s location and matched with the planting and harvesting dates provided by the household survey to ensure sufficient plant growth the distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season is of critical importance a proxy that is not captured by the percentage of dry days thus a common indicator of drought consists of measuring dry spells defined here as the occurrence of seven consecutive days with less than 0 3 mm of rain dry spells were identified using the seas packages toews et al 2007 in r to characterize the severity of exposure drought indicators were then ordered into three parts each tercile containing a third of the plots the following categories were used low 48 moderate 48 66 and high 66 percentage of dry days during the growing period and low 13 moderate 13 27 and high 27 percentage of dry spells during growing period 2 4 outcome the primary outcome is change in yields per hectare measured by crop cuts in each eas five crop plots were randomly selected for each crop in cases where there were less than five fields per crop all the plots were selected for crop cutting on the selected plots enumerators were asked to numerate corners starting from the closest north west side the entry point to the crop cut location was then determined using a random table based on the length of the short and long sides of the plot enumerators walked a random distance in the direction of the long side first then in direction of the short side the reached location was then used as a starting point to delimitate the 4 m 4 m quadrant and perform the crop cuts once separated from the straw the grains were dried and weighted the analysis is restricted to crop cutted plots of barley maize teff sorghum and wheat these crops were selected because they represent key crops in the ethiopian agriculture in terms of acreage volume and food security central statistical agency 2016 our final dataset include 1388 households with 2611 plots 3 results at the national level slightly less than one third of sampled plots are terraced this figure is similar for contour bunds tigray and amhara are the two regions where terraces have seen the highest adoption rates with 55 and 46 respectively contour bunds are more important in tigray 41 and snnp regions 40 no significant differences exist in terms of adoption rates between agro ecological areas 3 1 propensity scoring several covariates were associated with treatments table a 1 in supplementary material households that cultivate terraced plots have a better access to extension services 85 vs 78 p 0001 however these household are generally less educated 1 4 years vs 2 years p 0001 have access to credit to a lesser extent 21 vs 27 p 01 and own less oxen 1 37 vs 1 55 p 0001 than household that do not cultivate terraced plots environmental factors associated with terracing include higher altitudes 2090 m vs 2039 m p 01 hotter temperatures 20 3 c vs 19 8 c p 0001 and higher rainfall 481 mm vs 425 mm p 0 0001 regarding plot management terraced plots are usually smaller 1774 m2 vs 2099 m2 p 01 less improved varieties are grown 6 vs 9 p 05 and manure or compost are applied more often 26 vs 21 p 01 households that have adopted contour bunds show completely different characteristics than terracing adopters these households are more educated 2 years vs 1 7 p 05 and own more oxen 1 62 vs 1 43 p 001 they also have a lower access to extension services 78 vs 82 p 05 contour bunds plots are also located at lower altitude 1993 m vs 2086 m p 0001 while being larger 2297 m2 vs 1849 m2 p 0001 contour bunds plots are also more often practiced on vertisol soils 38 vs 33 p 01 analysis using a logistic regression model n 2611 confirmed the association of several household and environmental covariates with both treatments table a 2 in supplementary material only a few covariates related to plot management were associated with the treatments since plot management decisions are important factors in explaining yield variability these covariates were kept to perform matching matching diagnostics available in fig a 1 and a 2 in supplementary material demonstrate that matching has been successful in balancing covariates 3 2 effect of terracing and contour bunds on yields in fig 2 a att estimates for terraces and contour bunds plots are reported using the propensity score matched dataset n 1738 there is a slight but significant reduction in cereal yields between terraced and unterraced plots at the national level 9 5 p 05 this slight yield penalty was also apparent when comparing plots with contour bunds to plots without 7 p 1 as shown in fig 2b however this effect is not robust to the use of a more restrictive caliper table a 3 in supplementary material when broken down by agro ecological areas the difference between terraces and non terraced plots was negative and significant in the highlands 2500 m yields were also significantly higher on contour bunds plots compared to non contour bunds plots in the highlands thus at this stage of analysis there is no evidence that terraced and contour bunds plots perform better in water limited and drought prone areas that are typically found in lowland areas 3 3 yields of terraced and contour bunds plots on drought affected areas fig 3 a shows differences in yields between terraced and matched unterraced plots revealing the treatment effect of terracing when the percentage of dry days is low 14 p 05 intermediate 13 p 05 and high 17 p 1 when taking the consecutive number of dry days into account dry spells the relationship is even more pronounced fig 3b indicates that yields were significantly lower on plots that experienced a low percentage of dry spells 9 p 05 and significantly higher on plots with a high number of dry spells compared to unterraced plots 33 p 01 as it is clear from fig 3c and b no significant relationship was found between contour bunds plots and their control given drought intensity 4 discussion and conclusion in this article the treatment effect of terracing and contour bunds on yields was estimated using propensity score matching on a dataset representative of ethiopia three key insights have emerged from this study first results showed that terraced plots have significantly lower yields than unterraced plots confirming and extending previous findings shiferaw and holden 2001 adimassu et al 2012 this slight yield penalty 9 5 is consistent with the surface reduction occupied by benches or stones second we found little evidence to suggest that treatment effects differ by agro ecological areas a finding that contradicts the results of kato et al 2011 this conflicting finding could be attributed to the difference in proxies used for rainfall amount kato et al 2011 utilized historical rainfall data here rainfall amount is matched with planting and harvesting dates of each surveyed plots another result consistent with kato et al 2011 is that contour bunds have the potential to increase yields in highlands however contour bunds should be used in combination gebreegziabher et al 2009 kato et al 2011 while terracing stands out as a potentially independent practice when terraces are not possible a combination of soil water management practices should thus be recommended when designing climate change adaptation plans third the results support our main hypothesis that terraces carried out primarily to control water runoff and erosion acted as a buffer during the 2015 ethiopian drought contour bunds a less intensive soil water management practice did not minimize drought impacts these findings demonstrate the high relevance of terraces for climate smart agriculture while available evidence suggests that terracing offers benefits for sustainability vancampenhout et al 2006 raes et al 2007 adimassu et al 2012 adgo et al 2013 this study brings further evidence that terraces can help farmers to build resilience in the face of extreme events indeed trade offs exist between the risk mitigation benefits of terracing with the yield reduction in years with adequate rainfall in drought prone areas the practice should be promoted as a way to increase farmer s adaptive capacity this study is not without limitations an obvious concern is that propensity matching is able to control observable characteristics only one cannot be certain regarding unobserved variables since community mobilization and labor investment are important factors for terracing adoption is largely driven by program implementations and is therefore mostly exogenous this minimizes the concern that adoption could suffer from endogeneity bias related to unobserved characteristics this limitation notwithstanding the study has a number of strengths first it relies on a representative dataset of ethiopia and uses a robust measurement methods crop cuts as the outcome metric this measure is arguably more accurate than farmers yield estimates a widely used proxy in the literature in addition rainfall and drought occurrences were precisely matched with plot level crop growing period further several efforts were made in order to create a credible counterfactual the number of covariates as well as matching diagnostics led us to conclude that a proper counterfactual was established sensitivity analysis showed that the estimated effect held regardless of matching within or outside the common support region overall this study contributes to the literature on climate smart practices by providing our best estimation at this point regarding the contribution of soil water management practices to resilience against extreme events given that adaptation benefits from terracing could be larger than previously thought these results can help designing scenarios about climate change impacts bearing in mind that most terraces can be found in the tigray and amhara regions the extension of terraces could also be considered as part of the country s strategy to mitigate effects of extreme events in other regions beyond where they are currently found acknowledgements this study is dedicated to the memory of prof tekalign mamo whose expertise and political

11436,while the benefits of soil water management practices relative to soil erosion have been extensively documented evidence regarding their effect on yields is inconclusive following a strong el niño some regions of ethiopia experienced major droughts during the 2015 16 agricultural season using the propensity scores method on a nationally representative survey in ethiopia this study investigates the effect of two widely adopted soil water management practices terraces and contour bunds on yields and assesses their potential to mitigate the effects of climate change it is shown that at the national level terraced plots have slightly lower yields than non terraced plots however data support the hypothesis that terraced plots acted as a buffer against the 2015 ethiopian drought while contour bunds did not this study provides evidence that terraces have the potential to help farmer deal with current climate risks these results can inform the design of climate change adaptation policies and improve targeting of soil water management practices in ethiopia keywords soil water management practices climate smart agriculture terraces contour bunds drought propensity score matching ethiopia 1 introduction research suggests that conventional agriculture creates unsustainable erosion rates that can result in decreased agricultural potential montgomery 2007 in ethiopia soil erosion is considered a severe constraint for land resource productivity since the 1980s massive soil conservation programs have been carried out by governmental and non governmental organizations following a top down approach soil water management practices have been promoted according to the land s physical limitations and erosion risks these interventions often implemented at the water catchment level are designed to foster community labor mobilization desta et al 2005 climate change is an additional burden to these already prevalent environmental challenges expected changes in the frequency and occurrence of precipitation patterns in ethiopia souverijns et al 2016 are likely to threaten agricultural productivity sultan 2012 in recent years climate smart agriculture has emerged as an approach whose objective is to integrate climate change into the planning and implementation of sustainable agricultural strategies lipper et al 2014 three pillars define this approach sustainable production adapting and building resilience to climate change and developing opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture consequently soil water management practices that sustainably increase productivity and resilience while reducing greenhouse gas emissions certainly qualify as climate smart practices zougmoré et al 2014 although there is considerable interest in understanding farmer s resilience to climate change among different soil water management practices surprisingly little empirical evidence exists the question of whether soil water management practices can increase resilience in the context of climate change can best be assessed through crop yield response to extreme events this article explores two soil water management practices that have been widely adopted in ethiopia terraces and contour bunds farmers implement these practices as an adaptive strategy for agricultural land use in mountainous areas prone to erosion they differ regarding the scale of intervention needed the amount of labor involved and the potential benefits for yields wocat 2003 on the one hand terraces consist of building horizontal human made plots and are thus labor intensive by reducing plot steepness terraces affect soil composition hydrology and thus plant growth a meta analysis found that terracing was on average 11 5 times more efficient at controlling erosion than non terraced plots wei et al 2016 the authors also observe an effect on runoff reduction soil water recharge and nutrient enhancement in ethiopia terraces have been mostly implemented in the form of level ditches where the soil is thrown uphill to form an embankment fanja yuu terraces but stone bunds are also common kato et al 2011 on the other hand contour bunds are a simple agronomic measure that consists of ploughing and planting across the field slope so that it matches contour lines the practice does not lead to changes in the slope profile and can be repeated each cropping season gebreegziabher et al 2009 provide evidence of a positive effect of contour bunds on water utilization and soil conservation as noted by the authors contour bunds are most efficient when used in combination with other soil water management practices previous studies in sub saharan africa have shown mixed evidence regarding the effect of terraces and contour bunds on yields with most but not all studies reporting a positive effect gebremedhin et al 1999 vancampenhout et al 2006 adgo et al 2013 in tanzania raes et al 2007 found that contour bunds appreciably increased the production of rain fed lowland rice one limitation of these studies is that they are conducted on relatively homogenous areas while also relying on small sample sizes raising questions about inferences that can be made another interesting contribution is kato et al 2011 who found that soil water management practices perform differently in the different rainfall regimes of ethiopia while the authors acknowledged a risk reducing effect of stone bunds in low rainfall areas soil bunds were only effective when used in combination with other technologies at present the relationship between soil water management and yield response to extreme events has seldom been examined and no empirical evidence exist for how yields would respond to extreme events in 2015 some regions of ethiopia faced one of the worst drought in decades the zones of tigray and amhara were hit particularly hard see fig a 1 in supplementary material according to un estimates about 10 2 million farmers were in need of food assistance at the end of the 2015 16 meher season wfpe 2016 the pathway through which soil water management practices may offer a buffering effect when a drought occurs is complex studies have demonstrated that at the global level climate variability accounts for one third of observed cereal yields variability lobell and field 2007 ray et al 2015 however due to the predominantly rainfed system of cultivation in sub saharan africa as high as 60 of cereal yield variability could be explained by climate variability ray et al 2015 when rainfall events occur part of the surface water runs off while the rest infiltrates the soil at different levels on mountainous plots water infiltration in the soil is typically limited most of surface water runs off terracing decreases connectivity of overland flow allows enhancing water infiltration and leading to an increase in soil moisture the micro watersheds created by terracing can increase water concentration as well as soil nutrient which in turns provides better water conservation vancampenhout et al 2006 the altered soil structure richer in nutrients can reduce evaporation and consequently have a shock minimizing effect when a drought occur thus it is hypothesized that compared to sites without terraces terracing leads to a yield increase in drought affected areas due to deeper water infiltration soil water availability soil nutrient supply and reduced evaporation this effect is hypothesized to be more important on terraced plots that rely on a structural transformation than on plots where contour bunding was practiced while contour bunds also decrease run off volume the effect on soil nutrient levels is likely more limited gebreegziabher et al 2009 and thus the effect on yields may not be as pronounced as for terracing yields are influenced by several other factors including biophysical factors crop genetics biotic and abiotic stress as well as farm management practices at different phenological stages of plant growth ideally these factors should be accounted for when estimating the effect of soil water management practices on yields this article thus investigates the effect of terraces and contour bunds on yields during the 2015 drought in ethiopia using the propensity matching method the treatment effect of these practices is first estimated across all of ethiopia and then stratified across agro ecological settings furthermore yield response of terraced and contour bunds plots given drought intensity is assessed 2 methods 2 1 data description this study draws from the ethiopian socioeconomic survey ess 2015 16 ess is a large scale survey with a strong focus on agriculture it draws on a nationally and regionally representative sample of 5500 households living in rural and urban areas the survey was implemented by the central statistical agency of ethiopia in collaboration with the world bank living standards measurement study lsms team households were selected for the survey through a random two stage process in the first stage 433 enumeration areas eas were selected with probability proportional to size in the second stage 12 households were

methods see table a 3 in supplementary material 2 3 drought exposure two metrics of drought exposure percentage of dry days and percentage of dry spells were computed for each household s location and matched with the planting and harvesting dates provided by the household survey to ensure sufficient plant growth the distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season is of critical importance a proxy that is not captured by the percentage of dry days thus a common indicator of drought consists of measuring dry spells defined here as the occurrence of seven consecutive days with less than 0 3

where there were less than five fields per crop all the plots were selected for crop cutting on the selected plots enumerators were asked to numerate corners starting from the closest north west side the entry point to the crop cut location was then determined using a random table based on the length of the short and long sides of the plot enumerators walked a random distance in the direction of the long side first then in direction of the short side the reached location was then used as a starting point to delimitate the 4 m 4 m quadrant and perform the crop cuts once separated from the straw the grains were dried and weighted the analysis is restricted to crop cutted plots of barley maize teff sorghum and wheat these crops were selected because they represent key crops in the ethiopian agriculture in terms of acreage volume and food security central statistical agency 2016 our final dataset include 1388 households with 2611 plots 3 results at the national level slightly less than one third of sampled plots are terraced this figure is similar for contour bunds tigray and amhara are the two regions where terraces have seen the highest adoption rates with 55 and 46 respectively contour bunds are more important in tigray 41 and snnp regions 40 no significant differences exist in terms of adoption rates between agro ecological areas 3 1 propensity scoring several covariates were associated with treatments table a 1 in supplementary material households that cultivate terraced plots have a better access to extension services 85 vs 78 p 0001 however these household are generally less educated 1 4 years vs 2 years p 0001 have access to credit to a lesser extent 21 vs 27 p 01 and own less oxen 1 37 vs 1 55 p 0001 than household that do not cultivate

regarding plot management terraced plots are usually smaller 1774 m2 vs 2099 m2 p 01 less improved varieties are grown 6 vs 9 p 05 and manure or compost are applied more often 26 vs 21 p 01 households that have adopted contour bunds show completely different characteristics than terracing adopters these households are more educated 2 years vs 1 7 p 05 and own more oxen 1 62 vs 1 43 p 001 they also have a lower access to extension services 78 vs 82 p 05 contour bunds plots are also located at lower altitude 1993 m vs 2086 m p 0001 while being larger 2297 m2 vs 1849 m2 p 0001 contour bunds plots are also more often practiced on vertisol soils 38 vs 33 p 01 analysis using a logistic regression model n 2611 confirmed the association of several household and environmental covariates with both treatments table a 2 in supplementary material only a few covariates related to plot management were associated with the treatments since plot management decisions are important factors in explaining yield variability these covariates were kept to perform matching matching diagnostics available in fig a 1 and a 2 in supplementary material demonstrate that matching has been successful in balancing covariates 3 2 effect of terracing and contour bunds on yields in fig 2 a att estimates for terraces and contour bunds plots are reported using the propensity score matched dataset n 1738 there is a slight but significant reduction in cereal yields between terraced and unterraced plots at the national level 9 5 p 05 this slight yield penalty was also apparent when comparing plots with contour bunds to plots without 7 p 1 as shown in fig 2b however this effect is not robust to the use of a more restrictive caliper table a 3 in supplementary material when broken down by agro ecological areas the difference between terraces and non terraced plots was negative and significant in the highlands 2500 m yields were also significantly higher on contour bunds plots compared to non contour bunds plots in the highlands thus at this stage of analysis there is no evidence that terraced and contour bunds plots perform better in water limited and drought prone areas that are typically found in lowland areas 3 3 yields of terraced and contour bunds plots on drought affected areas fig 3 a shows differences in yields between terraced and matched unterraced plots revealing the treatment effect of terracing when the percentage of dry days is low 14 p 05 intermediate 13 p 05 and high 17 p 1 when taking the consecutive number of dry days into account dry spells the relationship is even more pronounced fig 3b indicates that yields were significantly lower on plots that experienced a low percentage of dry spells 9 p 05 and significantly higher on plots with a high number of dry spells compared to unterraced plots 33 p 01 as it is clear from fig 3c and b no significant relationship was found between contour bunds plots and their control given drought intensity 4 discussion and conclusion in this article the treatment effect of terracing and contour bunds on yields was estimated using propensity score matching on a dataset representative of ethiopia three key insights have emerged from this study first results showed that terraced plots have significantly lower yields than unterraced plots confirming and extending previous findings shiferaw and holden 2001 adimassu et

11437,as a result of climate change higher irrigation water demands are predicted in the future in pressurized irrigation networks this will result in larger energy requirements and greater co2 emissions levels for irrigation networks powered by pumping systems therefore measures to counteract this growth in energy and co2 emissions in the agri food sector such as energy recovery using hydropower are becoming imperative the bembézar margen izquierda bmi irrigation district in southern spain has been analysed and simulated for several water demand scenarios using a model based on the hydraulic simulator epanet results show that a substantial amount of energy used for the distribution of irrigation water can be recovered flows and heads available at four different locations in the network showed suitability for the installation of one traditional francis turbine and three pumps as turbines pat the methodology used was divided into four phases in the first phase the network was simulated with all hydrants simultaneously open and the best locations to install hpp hydro power plant were assessed in the second phase the maximum minimum and mean flows and available head values per month at each hpp location were obtained using on demand simulations applying the clément methodology in the third phase the flow and net head available in the turbines were transformed into energy in the last phase a feasibility study was carried out through three indices applying this methodology the maximum recoverable energy was estimated as 270 5 mw h and the maximum carbon savings potential was estimated as 108 t eco2 these technologies represent a positive competitive advantage for agricultural production reducing the carbon footprint and therefore improving the sustainability of the agricultural production keywords hydropower energy recovery irrigation network turbines pat 1 introduction in pressurized water distribution systems the dissipation of energy to avoid excess pressure is typically conducted using pressure reducing valves prv or break pressure tanks the fitting of a turbine in a pipe network instead of a prv is an attractive alternative to reducing excess pressure while also generating electricity evidenced since the late 1980 s penche c 1998 recently the concept of energy recovery using micro hydropower has been studied in much more detail by many different authors and primarily in the drinking water supply setting ramos and borga 1999 gaius obaseki 2010 mcnabola et al 2011 carravetta et al 2012 lydon et al 2017a the energy savings potential at an individual excess pressure site is typically small 2 20 kw however many traditional turbine technologies cannot be miniaturized to such capacities without prohibitive costs this drawback has been solved partially with an innovative technology named pump as turbine pat the fundamentals of pat theory are well established in carravetta et al 2018 pats are pumps operating in reverse to produce energy instead of consume it ramos and borga 1999 carravetta et al 2012 fecarotta et al 2015 this is a well known concept in the water industry and is an efficient method of generating power as well as recovering energy while contributing to savings mcnabola et al 2014 although the peak performance of a pat is typically less than that of a conventional turbine the cost can be up to 10 20 times less power et al 2016 from the economical point of view it is often stated that the capital payback period of pats in the range of 5 500 kw is two years or less derakshan and nourbakhsh 2007 carravetta et al 2013 other authors have estimated this value between 2 5 and 6 years marchis et al 2014 and 4 7 years in a recent study lydon et al 2017a the large differences in cost reported in literature are due to the influence of civil works piping and or electronics as well as economies of scale the use of conventional turbines in a micro hydropower mhp setting typically yields a payback of 8 10 years in economically viable cases corcoran et al 2013 all these works have focused on urban water supply networks and not on the irrigation sector which usually has higher fluctuations in water demand as well as different seasonal and daily demand patterns a turbine is often designed to operate at a relatively fixed flow rate and head which correspond to its maximum efficiency as flow or pressure change from this best efficiency point bep the performance of the system is reduced this results in less energy being generated and can increase significantly the payback period of the installation nevertheless most conventional turbines have low sensitivity to changes in flow rates variations of 50 will not imply significant drops efficiency however the range of flow rates over which a single pat can operate is usually much narrower than in a conventional turbine and it should be carefully selected to obtain the best possible efficiency fontana et al 2012 the efficiency of a pat drops abruptly with small flow variations previous research in drinking water supply networks has shown that when the flow deviates 20 from the bep the performance is reduced by up to 22 when the deviation is 20 the performance reduction drops by 70 this aspect highlights the need for pat operation to be controlled close to the bep lydon et al 2017a flow fluctuations of this magnitude 20 are commonly found in irrigation networks preliminary studies were carried out considering the annual average flows estrada and ramos 2015 other researchers analyzed in more detail the flow variations and calculated the maximum theoretical energy recovery coming from the energy dissipated in the network because of friction losses pérez sánchez et al 2016 energy recovery in irrigation has significant relevance to the sector since many farmers cannot apply the full crop water needs due to the high cost of the energy this high cost forces farmers to concentrate the irrigation when the cost of the energy is lower previous investigations have shown that high energy requirements have led farmers to apply less water than the maximum theoretical irrigation needs thus applying deficit irrigation as a strategy to maximize profits versus the traditional maximization of crop yield rodríguez díaz et al 2011 under this scenario methodologies to reduce the energy consumption are critical such as irrigation network sectoring fernández garcía et al 2013 critical hydrant detection rodríguez díaz et al 2012 irrigation scheduling in turns moreno et al 2010 solar pumping mérida garcía et al 2018 or the use of variable speed drives fernández garcía et al 2013 but once these measures are undertaken the recovery of the energy inherent in excess pressure in the network should be investigated hydropower energy recovery in irrigation is still largely unexplored and requires further investigation all these methodologies should be considered as useful tools for both the reduction of energy consumption and the recovery of the excess energy in pressurized irrigation networks this energy generation could contribute to reducing the exploitation costs of these systems increasing the competitiveness of agricultural production and reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops the scope of this work was to quantify the potential of hydropower energy recovery in a pressurized irrigation network assessing its technical and economic feasibility the maximum flow circulating in the network and available head were estimated using statistical methods and computer simulations pressure regulator valves prvs were used to represent the head loss that would be induced by a turbine placed in the network to reduce pressure and recover energy the economic analysis was conducted in terms of power kw energy recovery kw h and potential revenues of recovered energy as well as its economic viability through the payback period the power index kw and the energy index kw h the analysis was applied to a real case study during one irrigation season 2014 2015 in southern spain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the left bank of the bembézar river irrigation district bmi is in the guadalquivir river basin grb near to the city of córdoba andalusia southern spain average annual rainfall in bmi was slightly higher than 500 mm and potential evapotranspiration was around 1400 mm rodríguez díaz et al 2007b the main crops in bmi 4000 ha are citrus 47 maize 26 olive trees 10 and sunflower 3 fernández garcía et al 2014a bmi is characterized by a steep topography with hydrant elevations ranging from 58 m to 103 m fig 2a this branched irrigation network is comprised of 28 hydrants designed to supply 1 2 ls 1 ha 1 with a service pressure of 35 m water is conveyed through 220 pipes with a total length of 32 km currently the irrigation network is operated on demand which means that water is continuously available to farmers this network is an interesting candidate to assess hydropower energy recovery potential due to the difference in elevation within the system the pumping station elevation of 93 masl was originally designed to supply water on demand and is composed of seven split case horizontal centrifugal pumps there are 2 types of pumps a with lower power to supply water when a few hydrants are open and b higher power pumps there are three pumps of type a 315 kw and four of type b 800 kw one of the 315 kw pumps is activated with a variable speed pump vsp and the others operate as fixed speed pumps the sequence of activation is the variable speed pump vsp followed by all a and b pumps consecutively 2 2 methodology the methodology was divided in four phases a schematic representation of the methodology is shown in fig 1 in the first phase the network was simulated with all hydrants simultaneously open and the best locations to install hpp were assessed in the second phase the maximum minimum and mean flows and available head values per month at each turbine location were obtained using 3000 on demand simulations applying the clément methodology clément 1966 this methodology simulated a more realistic scenario than in phase 1 where multiple combinations of open and shut hydrants were simulated across the network yielding a distribution of flow variations based on flow probabilities in the third phase the pat turbine sizing was performed according to the flow rates and excess pressure calculated in the hpp locations after the computer simulations in the last phase a feasibility study was carried out through three indices the payback period and the power and energy index 2 2 1 hpps locations the hydraulic simulator epanet rossman 2000 was used to select the best locations to install the hydropower plants hpps the excess pressures were detected after a simulation considering that all the hydrants were simultaneously open most unfavorable conditions which would rarely occur in practice the locations with the largest excess pressure were selected starting from the pump station higher flows in these locations pressure reduction valves prv were modeled and set at the value that ensured a minimum pressure of 35 m in the most critical hydrant downstream fig 2b prvs were used to represent the head loss which would be induced by a turbine placed in the network to reduce pressure and recover energy the same procedure was used in the different branches of the irrigation scheme to calculate the excess pressure within the network without compromising the service pressure in the most critical hydrants 2 2 2 on demand simulations in the previous phase the best locations were selected considering that all hydrants were simultaneously open however in on demand networks the flows throughout the day are not constant and depend on the number of hydrants that are irrigating at the same time implying that water demand tends to be concentrated in certain hours of the day pereira 1999 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 rodríguez díaz et al 2007a 2009 to take this effect into account clément suggested that two possible states may be considered for each hydrant the outlet is open with a probability p or the outlet is shut with a probability 1 p clément 1966 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 the probability of an open hydrant pim was estimated as the quotient between daily hours needed to irrigate the field associated to each hydrant and month tim and the water availability time in hours ta per day in on demand irrigation systems the water availability ta is 24 h 1 p i m t i m t a the irrigation time required in hours per hydrant and month tim was calculated as follows 2 t i m 1 3600 i n i m q max initially the existing crops associated with each hydrant during the irrigation season were recorded from these data the theoretical daily average irrigation needs per month and hydrant mm were estimated as described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 this was conducted using the computer model cropwat and climate data collected in a local agro climatic station this information in mm can be easily transformed into irrigation needs inim in l ha day on the other hand qmax was the design flow allowed per unit of irrigated area equal to 1 2 l s ha for this network the result of tim is in seconds and the conversion constant 3600 is to transform the units into hours the clément s open hydrant probability was incorporated into the model according to the methodology suggested by carrillo cobo et al 2011 this methodology included an algorithm that established random demand patterns of open and closed hydrants for every month depending on the theoretical irrigation needs inim and the open outlet probability pim the model analyzed the behaviours of the network for a wide range of probabilities sets of operating hydrants were defined by assuming a uniform distribution across the hydrant and generating random numbers r if r was less than or equal to p the hydrant was assumed open if not the hydrant was assumed closed and its base demand was set to zero with this variability in open hydrants a wide range of daily flows were included in these simulations the epanet engine was integrated into an external program matlab vr2012b through its dynamic link library dll 3000 iterations of the probability of open hydrant have been simulated each month during the irrigation season maximum minimum and average daily flows and available head per month in each prv were simulated through this process 2 2 3 pats turbines sizing sizing pats or turbines to recover energy in the irrigation network setting required a balance to be struck in design terms between the variable performance of these devices varying power output with varying flow and pressure input and the very fluctuating nature of flow and pressure in on demand irrigation networks firstly the pats turbines were designed in the hpps points hereafter two flow scenarios were selected taking into account the probability of flow exceedance finally the efficiency of the machine was fixed considering the installation of a by pass ensuring that the turbine worked most of the time near to its bep 2 2 3 1 turbine type pat or traditional turbines were selected for each network location depending on the hydraulic conditions of flow and pressure for power outputs over 100 kw the francis turbine was considered and below this value pats were selected ramos et al 2009 the head losses and flows obtained in each prv after the simulations were transformed into energy power in kw according to eq 3 3 p h t m γ q t m h t m η t m 1000 where t from 1 to 4 is each turbine or pat installed in the irrigation networks γ is the specific weight fluid 9810 n m3 qtm is the average flow in each turbine per month m3 s htm is calculated as the average head loss registered in each prv per month head in the node upstream minus pressure to which the prv is fixed and ηtm is the hydraulic performance in each turbine in each month 2 2 3 2 modeling scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance as a result of their characteristic behaviour pats cannot be designed for the maximum flow rate since the equipment would be oversized working most of the time with lower flows and therefore producing low efficiency values the flow duration curves per month show the exceedance probability for a certain flow rate based on these flow duration curves pats should be designed for average flows encouraging higher efficiencies for the longest period of time in addition the design flow value should have a high probability of exceedance during the months that comprise the irrigation season if the average flow in these months does not have sufficiently high flow exceedance then lower flow values must be considered to increase the efficiency of the turbine the flows were monitored in all the pipes where the prvs were simulated for the purposes of selecting a design flow at each prv two scenarios were considered a the first scenario considered the mean flow value registered during the irrigation season from april to september thus higher flows were expected only during the peak irrigation season but which is the exceedance probability of this flow in each month during the irrigation season this can be addressed with flow duration curves if the probability is low then most of the time the targeted flow is not achieved therefore another scenario was considered b in the second scenario a lower value than the average flow was used the aim was to obtain the maximum values of flow exceedance during a longest period of time during the irrigation season although there is a lower potential for power generation there is a higher probability of flow exceedance in this scenario 2 2 3 3 pat turbine efficiency and power generation the efficiency of a pat drops off abruptly with small flow variations below and above the bep best efficiency point lydon et al 2017a under such conditions a by pass and a flow control regulator valve must be implemented in the system to ensure that the pat works most of the time near to the bep the installation scheme of the pats is shown in fig 3 as it is described by several authors carravetta et al 2012 lydon et al 2017a the bypass system assures the achievement of the following rules 4 if q qd then q1 0 and q2 q 5 if q qd then q1 qd and q2 q qd where q is the pipe flow m3 s qd is the pat design flow rate m3 s q1 is the flow diverted to the pat m3 s and q2 is the flow diverted to the bypass system the global efficiency for pats installation was considered as 0 5 0 65 pats efficiency plus generator 0 95 for the transformer and 0 85 the hydraulic regulation pats have no ability to regulate flow rate or pressure by themselves unlike most conventional turbines the lack of a regulation device means that regulation must be achieved externally hydraulic regulation and some flow must be diverted to maintain the backpressure and to operate the pat close to its best efficiency point in contrast good efficiency in the francis turbine is maintained across significant deviations from its bep this means that good performance is maintained for considerable drops from the nominal flow 40 50 also it has good performance for flows above the design flow 10 the maximum efficiency value for a francis turbine is approximately 85 90 and drops to 75 for a reduction in the flow of about 50 castro 2006 bha 2012 for this study the global plant efficiency for traditional turbines has been estimated as 0 6 turbine efficiency 0 87 generator efficiency 0 85 transformer efficiency 0 95 and hydraulic regulation 0 85 once the type flow design and performance of the different machines were selected the power generation of each one was calculated according to eq 3 2 2 4 economic analysis 2 2 4 1 feasibility study the feasibility of these installations is linked to their economic viability for this analysis the payback period pp and energy index ei have been used as indicators of investment viability pérez sánchez et al 2016 lydon et al 2017b castro 2006 pp and ei are defined in eqs 6 and 7 6 p p t i c a r where pp is payback period years tic is the total installation cost plus the annual maintenance and operation cost 3 of tic and ar is the net annual revenue annum 7 e i t i c e where ei is the energy index kw h or kw and e is the theoretical energy recoverable by the turbine or pat kw h year or kw year 2 2 4 2 installation cost tic carravetta et al 2013 estimated pat unit costs of 230 350 per kw considering only the electro mechanical equipment also ramos et al 2009 estimated the initial investment for a unit of power between 250 and 400 for power outputs up to 40 kw in this study a unit cost of 350 per kw was selected for the pat cost estimation only for the electro mechanical equipment the cost of the total installation followed in this research was defined by lydon et al 2017b the pat and generator were the dominant cost factor accounting for 65 of the installation cost the civil works ground works manhole and foundations represented 25 of the cost the remaining 10 was associated with pipe works fittings and valves in the case of francis turbines ogayar and vidal 2008 formulated equation 8 kw as a function of the power p in kw and net head h in meters 8 c o s t 25698 p 0 560135 h 0 127243 the total cost of the installation also includes the civil works and pipe works among others also a maintenance and operation cost of 3 of the total cost has been considered additional infrastructures required for the use of the recovered energy have not been considered in this study 2 2 5 methodological limitations the proposed methodology has limitations in irrigation networks flow rate variations occur across the long and short term long term changes in flow rate can be influenced by climate change policy factors such as water pricing or land use planning changes in the european agricultural policy or the market prices of agricultural products short term changes arise from irrigation demand patterns which depend on many factors such as inter and intra annual crop rotation climatic data fertigation programs chemical treatments among many others in addition the current energy price has promoted a crop conversion towards more profitable crops which demand higher amounts of water farmer s behaviour tends to adapt to this situation displacing the irrigation when the price of the energy is cheaper thus many factors may influence the irrigation demand over time and only one irrigation season has been modeled in this work since the measurements of the flow are not possible in each pipe the clément methodology has been applied this method has been widely used in the design of irrigation networks and to simulate energy saving scenarios under different approaches such as sectoring and critical point detection optimal operation of the pressurized network or the energy cost optimization lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 rodríguez díaz et al 2009 fernández garcía et al 2014b 3 results the methodology has been applied to the bmi irrigation network during the 2014 2015 season 3 1 hydro power plants hpps location four different locations for hpps installation have been detected within the irrigation network fig 2b the pats turbines installed in the hpps were designed to ensure a minimum of 35 m in the most critical hydrants downstream 3 2 on demand simulation during the irrigation season from april to september the water demand was very high increasing from april until july and decreasing subsequently until september average flows and excess pressures obtained after 3000 simulations for each turbine across each month are summarized in fig 4 the flow for the francis turbine was much higher than for the three pats with maximum values in june and july of 1 7 m3 s for the pats these values were lower with values in june and july between 0 17 and 0 43 m3 s on the other hand the pressure excess was quite constant for each location over the year during the more demanding months the increase of the flow demanded implied higher values of head losses and therefore a decrease of available head for power generation 3 3 pats turbine sizing 3 3 1 turbine type for hpp0 the average flow rate during the irrigation season was 1 25 m3 s with a maximum value of 1 75 m3 s in june and a minimum value of 0 66 m3 s in september the excess of pressure was 26 8 m in this case the equipment that best matched the flow and available head at this particular location was a francis turbine for the remaining hpps the average flow ranged between 0 13 and 0 31 m3 s the average values of pressure excess for hpp1 and hpp2 were 27 2 and 29 2 m respectively while in hpp3 was 12 8 m thus for these three locations a pat system was recommended pat1 pat2 and pat3 respectively in fig 4 the average daily flow values per month were shown but it should be noted that these values are the average of 3000 simulations per month fig 5 shows the variation of flow versus available head for the 3000 simulations for the francis turbine in july and april in july the minimum flow of the simulations was close to 0 5 m3 s and the maximum was over 3 m3 s the average value was 1 7 m3 s the analysis was similar for the available head with variation from 23 to 28 m for the entire simulations 3 3 2 modelling scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance for the hpp0 location considering the average flow during the irrigation season of 1 25 m3 s first scenario the probability of exceedance was 60 during may and august and 85 in june and july i e there was a 60 likelihood in may and august that the daily flow in the network exceeded this average value in april and september the flow exceedance was very low under 10 see fig 6 moreover in these two months the typical flow dropped to almost 50 of the average and therefore the efficiency of the turbine would be very low and has not been considered for power generation the design flow fixed for the second scenario was 1 m3 s the exceedance probability was higher than in scenario one with values around 85 in may and august and 95 in june and july the flow was reduced in april and september by 23 2 and 32 6 respectively although power could be generated with this flow reduction for a traditional turbine the exceedance probability was very low 10 20 and therefore these months have not been considered for power generation the same analysis was carried out for the pats 3 3 3 turbine efficiency and power generation fig 7 shows the potential for power generation kw and energy recovery kw h for both scenarios for scenario one the power generated by the francis turbine hpp0 comes to 191 3 kw for scenario two the potential power generated was 153 0 kw from may to august the total energy recovered considering the irrigation time required to satisfy crop water requirements summed up to 197 9 mw h and 158 3 mw h respectively fig 7 also shows the power generated and recoverable energy for the three pats installed in remaining three hpps locations and for both scenarios for pat1 the power generated for both scenarios were 39 7 and 26 5 kw respectively considering the irrigation time required to satisfy crop water needs the energy recovered amounted to 41 1 and 27 4 mw h respectively for pat2 these figures were 22 8 and 14 2 kw for power generation and 23 5 and 14 7 mw h for energy recovery finally for pat3 the potential for power generation was 7 7 and 4 7 kw and the potential for energy recovery was 7 9 and 4 9 mw h the total power generated by the francis turbine and three pats came to 261 4 and 198 4 kw for both scenarios and the total energy recovered values amounted to 270 5 and 205 3 mw h respectively 73 of recovered energy came from the francis turbines 15 from pat1 9 from pat2 and 3 from pat3 3 4 economic viability 3 4 1 total cost 3 4 1 1 francis turbine table 1 shows the hpps total cost for both scenarios the cost of the electro mechanical equipment was 171198 and 155175 5 for 191 3 and 153 kw of power respectively and 26 m of available head considering pipe works fittings and valves 10 and the cost of the civil works 25 the total cost of the installation was 263382 6 and 238731 5 respectively these values were increased with the maintenance and operation cost of 3 3 4 1 2 pats the total cost of the pats installations is shown in table 1 pat1 plus the generator had a cost of 13707 and 9138 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively the total cost considering pipe works and civil works was 21088 and 14058 on the other hand pat3 the smaller one had a total cost of 4061 and 2499 respectively total cost of pat2 was between the other two 12079 and 7550 3 4 2 installation revenues revenue generated from the installation was directly related to the amount of power produced and the price of this power the price was different if the electricity generated was sold to the electrical grid or used on site in this case study both scenarios have been evaluated to analyze whether the use of the electricity generated directly on site rather than selling to the grid increases the economic viability of the installation the spanish tariff based on 6 periods has been applied to the bmi irrigation district boe 2014 since the irrigation behaviour of each farmer is different and the installation is an on demand irrigation network with a greater flexibility a weighted average value has been used the energy cost kw h used was may 0 0855 june 0 091292 july 0 105888 august 0 0699 in contrast the selling price of the energy for this type of installation is not clearly defined in spain pérez sánchez et al 2016 have established a sales price of 0 0842 kw h castro 2006 which is very small in comparison with some other countries such as ireland with a price fixed of 0 85 kw h or germany with rates over 12 5 cents per kw h fig 7 shows revenues for on site usage or selling to the grid for each hpp location and for both scenarios values show that revenues coming from direct usage for both scenarios 29225 and 22185 were slightly higher than those coming from selling to the grid 27560 and 20921 3 4 3 payback period and energy index to estimate the payback period a 3 of maintenance and operation cost has been added to the total cost eq 6 considering the total cost for the francis turbine installation and annual total revenues the payback periods pp were 12 7 years for self supply and 13 4 years if sold to the grid for scenario 1 these values were 14 4 and 15 2 years for scenario 2 the total cost per kw or power index has been estimated as 1418 and 1607 kw for both scenarios and total cost per kw h or energy index were 1 37 and 1 55 kw h respectively the pats installation payback period for on site usage was 4 9 years for both scenarios the payback period increased to 5 2 if the energy were sold to the grid the power index was 546 7 kw and the energy index 0 53 kw these payback periods match with previous estimations in other non irrigation settings between 2 5 6 years marchis et al 2014 lydon et al 2017a 4 discussion the values of the simulations allow us to make an analysis of the probability of exceedance of a certain flow this information is critical for the design of the turbine and it is shown in the flow duration curves the design flow qd should have a high probability of exceedance meaning that turbines will work with high efficiencies for the longest period of time these probabilities were based on the variables influencing flow in the network such as cropping pattern meteorological conditions on farm irrigation efficiency or farmeŕs behaviour etc the aim of examining two scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance was to highlight the importance of the design flow conditions relative to the actual flow in the network an optimization problem exists here to find the optimal design flow head values for the turbine that maximizes the energy recovered or the payback period of the installation the optimal design conditions and the optimization process should be addressed by future research once it is demonstrated here that potential for energy recovery exists although the computer simulations and the flow duration curves facilitate an optimal design flow rate the irrigation network has important flow fluctuation during the irrigation season under these circumstances the pat turbine must be installed with a bypass system the bypass facilitates that the pat turbine works near to the bep diverting the excess of flow above or below a certain limit of the design flow rate qd the by pass system was described in the methodology and enables the turbine to operate with the maximum efficiency during the maximum period of time this hydraulic regulation is critical not only to achieve high efficiencies values for power generation but also to control the backpressure and to avoid undesirable phenomena such as cavitation as can be seen in fig 4 and table 1 the average flow in may june july and august was higher than the design flow rate qd for both scenarios in all the pats and the turbine during these months the delivery of a flow rate higher than qd to the pat turbine system could result in more energy recovery however these installations also must regulate the backpressure if the flow rate moves away from the bep the pressure downstream the installation would be compromised on the other hand the average flows in april and september are considerably lower than qd implying very low efficiencies and therefore have not been considered for power generation then only during four months from may to august the pat turbines can generate energy under these premises pats installation were viable for both scenarios since the pp is less than six years 4 9 and 5 2 years respectively and the ei smaller than 0 6 kw h 0 53 kw h for both scenarios according to these values the francis turbine installation is not viable economically with pp above 12 years and ie higher than 1 3 kw h for both scenarios however the payback period of the turbine can be reduced by two years if the total installation of the four turbines is considered francis plus the three pats besides the economic viability the environmental aspects should be considered although the economic feasibility of the francis turbine is questionable it could be very valuable from an environmental point of view due to its capability to recover a large amount of energy and therefore reducing co2 emissions the environmental potential of pat installations has previously been estimated by mcnabola et al 2011 considering that the energy produced by the installations could offset some of the energy demand of drinking water supply several authors have used conversion factors to convert kw h of purchased grip electricity to kg of co2 emissions to estimate the potential carbon saving in water supply networks gallagher et al 2015 lydon et al 2017b according to the institute for energy diversification and saving in spain idae 2014 the conversion factor for conventional electricity in spain is 0 399 kg eco2 kw h the estimated potential carbon savings of the total installation would result in between 82 and 108 tonnes eco2 for both scenarios respectively finally a pat turbine installation plays a leading role in the pressure management of any water distribution network which is a main strategy for leakage reduction usually the revenue of recovered water is much larger than the revenue of recovered energy and this could increase the justification of the plant construction especially in semi arid regions such as the south of spain future research should also consider the potential effects of cavitation arising from the installation of turbines in water pipe networks limited research has been conducted to date on the effects of cavitation in water pipe networks where turbines are installed for energy recovery purposes 5 conclusions this work shows theoretically that significant energy savings can be achieved by installing traditional turbines or pats in pressurized irrigation networks from an economic point of view traditional turbines do not seem to be viable with payback periods of over 10 years on the other hand pats have been shown to be very competitive and economically viable with payback period below 6 years and energy index below 0 6 kw h the energy saving coming from this type of installation could translate into a significant reduction in co2 emissions reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops and the agri food industry thus these technologies represent a potential positive competitive advantage for agricultural production improving the exploitation cost reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops and increasing the economic feasibility in agricultural production acknowledgment

11437,as a result of climate change higher irrigation water demands are predicted in the future in pressurized irrigation networks this will result in larger energy requirements and greater co2 emissions levels for irrigation networks powered by pumping systems therefore measures to counteract this growth in energy and co2 emissions in the agri food sector such as energy recovery using hydropower are becoming imperative the bembézar margen izquierda bmi irrigation district in southern spain has been analysed and simulated for several water demand scenarios using a model based on the hydraulic simulator epanet results show that a substantial amount of energy used for the distribution of irrigation water can be recovered flows and heads available at four different locations in the network showed suitability for the installation of one traditional francis turbine and three pumps as turbines pat the methodology used was divided into four phases in the first phase the network was simulated with all hydrants simultaneously open and the best locations to install hpp hydro power plant were assessed in the second phase the maximum minimum and mean flows and available head values per month at each hpp location were obtained using on demand simulations applying the clément methodology in the third phase the flow and net head available in the turbines were transformed into energy in the last phase a feasibility study was carried out through three indices applying this methodology the maximum recoverable energy was estimated as 270 5 mw h and the maximum carbon savings potential was estimated as 108 t eco2 these technologies represent a positive competitive advantage for agricultural production reducing the carbon footprint and therefore improving the sustainability of the agricultural production keywords hydropower energy recovery irrigation network turbines pat 1 introduction in pressurized water distribution systems the dissipation of energy to avoid excess pressure is typically conducted using pressure reducing valves prv or break pressure tanks the fitting of a turbine in a pipe network instead of a prv is an attractive alternative to reducing excess pressure while also generating electricity evidenced since the late 1980 s penche c 1998 recently the concept of energy recovery using micro hydropower has been studied in much more detail by many different authors and primarily in the drinking water supply setting ramos and borga 1999 gaius obaseki 2010 mcnabola et al 2011 carravetta et al 2012 lydon et al 2017a the energy savings potential at an individual excess pressure site is typically small 2 20 kw however many traditional turbine technologies cannot be miniaturized to such capacities without prohibitive costs this drawback has been solved partially with an innovative technology named pump as turbine pat the fundamentals of pat theory are well established in carravetta et al 2018 pats are pumps operating in reverse to produce energy instead of consume it ramos and borga 1999 carravetta et al 2012 fecarotta et al 2015 this is a well known concept in the water industry and is an efficient method of generating power as well as recovering energy while contributing to savings mcnabola et al 2014 although the peak performance of a pat is typically less than that of a conventional turbine the cost can be up to 10 20 times less power et al 2016 from the economical point of view it is often stated that the capital payback period of pats in the range of 5 500 kw is two years or less derakshan and nourbakhsh 2007 carravetta et al 2013 other authors have estimated this value between 2 5 and 6 years marchis et al 2014 and 4 7 years in a recent study lydon et al 2017a the large differences in cost reported in literature are due to the influence of civil works piping and or electronics as well as economies of scale the use of conventional turbines in a micro hydropower mhp setting typically yields a payback of 8 10 years in economically viable cases corcoran et al 2013 all these works have focused on urban water supply networks and not on the irrigation sector which usually has higher fluctuations in water demand as well as different seasonal and daily demand patterns a turbine is often designed to operate at a relatively fixed flow rate and head which correspond to its maximum efficiency as flow or pressure change from this best efficiency point bep the performance of the system is reduced this results in less energy being generated and can increase significantly the payback period of the installation nevertheless most conventional turbines have low sensitivity to changes in flow rates variations of 50 will not imply significant drops efficiency however the range of flow rates over which a single pat can operate is usually much narrower than in a conventional turbine and it should be carefully selected to obtain the best possible efficiency fontana et al 2012 the efficiency of a pat drops abruptly with small flow variations previous research in drinking water supply networks has shown that when the flow deviates 20 from the bep the performance is reduced by up to 22 when the deviation is 20 the performance reduction drops by 70 this aspect highlights the need for pat operation to be controlled close to the bep lydon et al 2017a flow fluctuations of this magnitude 20 are commonly found in irrigation networks preliminary studies were carried out considering the annual average flows estrada and ramos 2015 other researchers analyzed in more detail the flow variations and calculated the maximum theoretical energy recovery coming from the energy dissipated in the network because of friction losses pérez sánchez et al 2016 energy recovery in irrigation has significant relevance to the sector since many farmers cannot apply the full crop water needs due to the high cost of the energy this high cost forces farmers to concentrate the irrigation when the cost of the energy is lower previous investigations have shown that high energy requirements have led farmers to apply less water than the maximum theoretical irrigation needs thus applying deficit irrigation as a strategy to maximize profits versus the traditional maximization of crop yield rodríguez díaz et al 2011 under this scenario methodologies to reduce the energy consumption are critical such as irrigation network sectoring fernández garcía et al 2013 critical hydrant detection rodríguez díaz et al 2012 irrigation scheduling in turns moreno et al 2010 solar pumping mérida garcía et al 2018 or the use of variable speed drives fernández garcía et al 2013 but once these measures are undertaken the recovery of the energy inherent in excess pressure in the network should be investigated hydropower energy recovery in irrigation is still largely unexplored and requires further investigation all these methodologies should be considered as useful tools for both the reduction of energy consumption and the recovery of the excess energy in pressurized irrigation networks this energy generation could contribute to reducing the exploitation costs of these systems increasing the competitiveness of agricultural production and reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops the scope of this work was to quantify the potential of hydropower energy recovery in a pressurized irrigation network assessing its technical and economic feasibility the maximum flow circulating in the network and available head were estimated using statistical methods and computer simulations pressure regulator valves prvs were used to represent the head loss that would be induced by a turbine placed in the network to reduce pressure and recover energy the economic analysis was conducted in terms of power kw energy recovery kw h and potential revenues of recovered energy as well as its economic viability through the payback period the power index kw and the energy index kw h the analysis was applied to a real case study during one irrigation season 2014 2015 in southern spain 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the left bank of the bembézar river irrigation district bmi is in the guadalquivir river basin grb near to the city of córdoba andalusia southern spain average annual rainfall in bmi was slightly higher than 500 mm and potential evapotranspiration was around 1400 mm rodríguez díaz et al 2007b the main crops in bmi 4000 ha are citrus 47 maize 26 olive trees 10 and sunflower 3 fernández garcía et al 2014a bmi is characterized by a steep topography with hydrant elevations ranging from 58 m to 103 m fig 2a this branched irrigation network is comprised of 28 hydrants designed to supply 1 2 ls 1 ha 1 with a service pressure of 35 m water is conveyed through 220 pipes with a total length of 32 km currently the irrigation network is operated on demand which means that water is continuously available to farmers this network is an interesting candidate to assess hydropower energy recovery potential due to the difference in elevation within the system the pumping station elevation of 93 masl was originally designed to supply water on demand and is composed of seven split case horizontal centrifugal pumps there are 2 types of pumps a with lower power to supply water when a few hydrants are open and b higher power pumps there are three pumps of type a 315 kw and four of type b 800 kw one of the 315 kw pumps is activated with a variable speed pump vsp and the others operate as fixed speed pumps the sequence of activation is the variable speed pump vsp followed by all a and b pumps consecutively 2 2 methodology the methodology was divided in four phases a schematic representation of the methodology is shown in fig 1 in the first phase the network was simulated with all hydrants simultaneously open and the best locations to install hpp were assessed in the second phase the maximum minimum and mean flows and available head values per month at each turbine location were obtained using 3000 on demand simulations applying the clément methodology clément 1966 this methodology simulated a more realistic scenario than in phase 1 where multiple combinations of open and shut hydrants were simulated across the network yielding a distribution of flow variations based on flow probabilities in the third phase the pat turbine sizing was performed according to the flow rates and excess pressure calculated in the hpp locations after the computer simulations in the last phase a feasibility study was carried out through three indices the payback period and the power and energy index 2 2 1 hpps locations the hydraulic simulator epanet rossman 2000 was used to select the best locations to install the hydropower plants hpps the excess pressures were detected after a simulation considering that all the hydrants were simultaneously open most unfavorable conditions which would rarely occur in practice the locations with the largest excess pressure were selected starting from the pump station higher flows in these locations pressure reduction valves prv were modeled and set at the value that ensured a minimum pressure of 35 m in the most critical hydrant downstream fig 2b prvs were used to represent the head loss which would be induced by a turbine placed in the network to reduce pressure and recover energy the same procedure was used in the different branches of the irrigation scheme to calculate the excess pressure within the network without compromising the service pressure in the most critical hydrants 2 2 2 on demand simulations in the previous phase the best locations were selected considering that all hydrants were simultaneously open however in on demand networks the flows throughout the day are not constant and depend on the number of hydrants that are irrigating at the same time implying that water demand tends to be concentrated in certain hours of the day pereira 1999 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 rodríguez díaz et al 2007a 2009 to take this effect into account clément suggested that two possible states may be considered for each hydrant the outlet is open with a probability p or the outlet is shut with a probability 1 p clément 1966 lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 the probability of an open hydrant pim was estimated as the quotient between daily hours needed to irrigate the field associated to each hydrant and month tim and the water availability time in hours ta per day in on demand irrigation systems the water availability ta is 24 h 1 p i m t i m t a the irrigation time required in hours per hydrant and month tim was calculated as follows 2 t i m 1 3600 i n i m q max initially the existing crops associated with each hydrant during the irrigation season were recorded from these data the theoretical daily average irrigation needs per month and hydrant mm were estimated as described in fao 56 allen et al 1998 this was conducted using the computer model cropwat and climate data collected in a local agro climatic station this information in mm can be easily transformed into irrigation needs inim in l ha day on the other hand qmax was the design flow allowed per unit of irrigated area equal to 1 2 l s ha for this network the result of tim is in seconds and the conversion constant 3600 is to transform the units into hours the clément s open hydrant probability was incorporated into the model according to the methodology suggested by carrillo cobo et al 2011 this methodology included an algorithm that established random demand patterns of open and closed hydrants for every month depending on the theoretical irrigation needs inim and the open outlet probability pim the model analyzed the behaviours of the network for a wide range of probabilities sets of operating hydrants were defined by assuming a uniform distribution across the hydrant and generating random numbers r if r was less than or equal to p the hydrant was assumed open if not the hydrant was assumed closed and its base demand was set to zero with this variability in open hydrants a wide range of daily flows were included in these simulations the epanet engine was integrated into an external program matlab vr2012b through its dynamic link library dll 3000 iterations of the probability of open hydrant have been simulated each month during the irrigation season maximum minimum and average daily flows and available head per month in each prv were simulated through this process 2 2 3 pats turbines sizing sizing pats or turbines to recover energy in the irrigation network setting required a balance to be struck in design terms between the variable performance of these devices varying power output with varying flow and pressure input and the very fluctuating nature of flow and pressure in on demand irrigation networks firstly the pats turbines were designed in the hpps points hereafter two flow scenarios were selected taking into account the probability of flow exceedance finally the efficiency of the machine was fixed considering the installation of a by pass ensuring that the turbine worked most of the time near to its bep 2 2 3 1 turbine type pat or traditional turbines were selected for each network location depending on the hydraulic conditions of flow and pressure for power outputs over 100 kw the francis turbine was considered and below this value pats were selected ramos et al 2009 the head losses and flows obtained in each prv after the simulations were transformed into energy power in kw according to eq 3 3 p h t m γ q t m h t m η t m 1000 where t from 1 to 4 is each turbine or pat installed in the irrigation networks γ is the specific weight fluid 9810 n m3 qtm is the average flow in each turbine per month m3 s htm is calculated as the average head loss registered in each prv per month head in the node upstream minus pressure to which the prv is fixed and ηtm is the hydraulic performance in each turbine in each month 2 2 3 2 modeling scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance as a result of their characteristic behaviour pats cannot be designed for the maximum flow rate since the equipment would be oversized working most of the time with lower flows and therefore producing low efficiency values the flow duration curves per month show the exceedance probability for a certain flow rate based on these flow duration curves pats should be designed for average flows encouraging higher efficiencies for the longest period of time in addition the design flow value should have a high probability of exceedance during the months that comprise the irrigation season if the average flow in these months does not have sufficiently high flow exceedance then lower flow values must be considered to increase the efficiency of the turbine the flows were monitored in all the pipes where the prvs were simulated for the purposes of selecting a design flow at each prv two scenarios were considered a the first scenario considered the mean flow value registered during the irrigation season from april to september thus higher flows were expected only during the peak irrigation season but which is the exceedance probability of this flow in each month during the irrigation season this can be addressed with flow duration curves if the probability is low then most of the time the targeted flow is not achieved therefore another scenario was considered b in the second scenario a lower value than the average flow was used the aim was to obtain the maximum values of flow exceedance during a longest period of time during the irrigation season although there is a lower potential for power generation there is a higher probability of flow exceedance in this scenario 2 2 3 3 pat turbine efficiency and power generation the efficiency of a pat drops off abruptly with small flow variations below and above the bep best efficiency point lydon et al 2017a under such conditions a by pass and a flow control regulator valve must be implemented in the system to ensure that the pat works most of the time near to the bep the installation scheme of the pats is shown in fig 3 as it is described by several authors carravetta et al 2012 lydon et al 2017a the bypass system assures the achievement of the following rules 4 if q qd then q1 0 and q2 q 5 if q qd then q1 qd and q2 q qd where q is the pipe flow m3 s qd is the pat design flow rate m3 s q1 is the flow diverted to the pat m3 s and q2 is the flow diverted to the bypass system the global efficiency for pats installation was considered as 0 5 0 65 pats efficiency plus generator 0 95 for the transformer and 0 85 the hydraulic regulation pats have no ability to regulate flow rate or pressure by themselves unlike most conventional turbines the lack of a regulation device means that regulation must be achieved externally hydraulic regulation and some flow must be diverted to maintain the backpressure and to operate the pat close to its best efficiency point in contrast good efficiency in the francis turbine is maintained across significant deviations from its bep this means that good performance is maintained for considerable drops from the nominal flow 40 50 also it has good performance for flows above the design flow 10 the maximum efficiency value for a francis turbine is approximately 85 90 and drops to 75 for a reduction in the flow of about 50 castro 2006 bha 2012 for this study the global plant efficiency for traditional turbines has been estimated as 0 6 turbine efficiency 0 87 generator efficiency 0 85 transformer efficiency 0 95 and hydraulic regulation 0 85 once the type flow design and performance of the different machines were selected the power generation of each one was calculated according to eq 3 2 2 4 economic analysis 2 2 4 1 feasibility study the feasibility of these installations is linked to their economic viability for this analysis the payback period pp and energy index ei have been used as indicators of investment viability pérez sánchez et al 2016 lydon et al 2017b castro 2006 pp and ei are defined in eqs 6 and 7 6 p p t i c a r where pp is payback period years tic is the total installation cost plus the annual maintenance and operation cost 3 of tic and ar is the net annual revenue annum 7 e i t i c e where ei is the energy index kw h or kw and e is the theoretical energy recoverable by the turbine or pat kw h year or kw year 2 2 4 2 installation cost tic carravetta et al 2013 estimated pat unit costs of 230 350 per kw considering only the electro mechanical equipment also ramos et al 2009 estimated the initial investment for a unit of power between 250 and 400 for power outputs up to 40 kw in this study a unit cost of 350 per kw was selected for the pat cost estimation only for the electro mechanical equipment the cost of the total installation followed in this research was defined by lydon et al 2017b the pat and generator were the dominant cost factor accounting for 65 of the installation cost the civil works ground works manhole and foundations represented 25 of the cost the remaining 10 was associated with pipe works fittings and valves in the case of francis turbines ogayar and vidal 2008 formulated equation 8 kw as a function of the power p in kw and net head h in meters 8 c o s t 25698 p 0 560135 h 0 127243 the total cost of the installation also includes the civil works and pipe works among others also a maintenance and operation cost of 3 of the total cost has been considered additional infrastructures required for the use of the recovered energy have not been considered in this study 2 2 5 methodological limitations the proposed methodology has limitations in irrigation networks flow rate variations occur across the long and short term long term changes in flow rate can be influenced by climate change policy factors such as water pricing or land use planning changes in the european agricultural policy or the market prices of agricultural products short term changes arise from irrigation demand patterns which depend on many factors such as inter and intra annual crop rotation climatic data fertigation programs chemical treatments among many others in addition the current energy price has promoted a crop conversion towards more profitable crops which demand higher amounts of water farmer s behaviour tends to adapt to this situation displacing the irrigation when the price of the energy is cheaper thus many factors may influence the irrigation demand over time and only one irrigation season has been modeled in this work since the measurements of the flow are not possible in each pipe the clément methodology has been applied this method has been widely used in the design of irrigation networks and to simulate energy saving scenarios under different approaches such as sectoring and critical point detection optimal operation of the pressurized network or the energy cost optimization lamaddalena and sagardoy 2000 rodríguez díaz et al 2009 fernández garcía et al 2014b 3 results the methodology has been applied to the bmi irrigation network during the 2014 2015 season 3 1 hydro power plants hpps location four different locations for hpps installation have been detected within the irrigation network fig 2b the pats turbines installed in the hpps were designed to ensure a minimum of 35 m in the most critical hydrants downstream 3 2 on demand simulation during the irrigation season from april to september the water demand was very high increasing from april until july and decreasing subsequently until september average flows and excess pressures obtained after 3000 simulations for each turbine across each month are summarized in fig 4 the flow for the francis turbine was much higher than for the three pats with maximum values in june and july of 1 7 m3 s for the pats these values were lower with values in june and july between 0 17 and 0 43 m3 s on the other hand the pressure excess was quite constant for each location over the year during the more demanding months the increase of the flow demanded implied higher values of head losses and therefore a decrease of available head for power generation 3 3 pats turbine sizing 3 3 1 turbine type for hpp0 the average flow rate during the irrigation season was 1 25 m3 s with a maximum value of 1 75 m3 s in june and a minimum value of 0 66 m3 s in september the excess of pressure was 26 8 m in this case the equipment that best matched the flow and available head at this particular location was a francis turbine for the remaining hpps the average flow ranged between 0 13 and 0 31 m3 s the average values of pressure excess for hpp1 and hpp2 were 27 2 and 29 2 m respectively while in hpp3 was 12 8 m thus for these three locations a pat system was recommended pat1 pat2 and pat3 respectively in fig 4 the average daily flow values per month were shown but it should be noted that these values are the average of 3000 simulations per month fig 5 shows the variation of flow versus available head for the 3000 simulations for the francis turbine in july and april in july the minimum flow of the simulations was close to 0 5 m3 s and the maximum was over 3 m3 s the average value was 1 7 m3 s the analysis was similar for the available head with variation from 23 to 28 m for the entire simulations 3 3 2 modelling scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance for the hpp0 location considering the average flow during the irrigation season of 1 25 m3 s first scenario the probability of exceedance was 60 during may and august and 85 in june and july i e there was a 60 likelihood in may and august that the daily flow in the network exceeded this average value in april and september the flow exceedance was very low under 10 see fig 6 moreover in these two months the typical flow dropped to almost 50 of the average and therefore the efficiency of the turbine would be very low and has not been considered for power generation the design flow fixed for the second scenario was 1 m3 s the exceedance probability was higher than in scenario one with values around 85 in may and august and 95 in june and july the flow was reduced in april and september by 23 2 and 32 6 respectively although power could be generated with this flow reduction for a traditional turbine the exceedance probability was very low 10 20 and therefore these months have not been considered for power generation the same analysis was carried out for the pats 3 3 3 turbine efficiency and power generation fig 7 shows the potential for power generation kw and energy recovery kw h for both scenarios for scenario one the power generated by the francis turbine hpp0 comes to 191 3 kw for scenario two the potential power generated was 153 0 kw from may to august the total energy recovered considering the irrigation time required to satisfy crop water requirements summed up to 197 9 mw h and 158 3 mw h respectively fig 7 also shows the power generated and recoverable energy for the three pats installed in remaining three hpps locations and for both scenarios for pat1 the power generated for both scenarios were 39 7 and 26 5 kw respectively considering the irrigation time required to satisfy crop water needs the energy recovered amounted to 41 1 and 27 4 mw h respectively for pat2 these figures were 22 8 and 14 2 kw for power generation and 23 5 and 14 7 mw h for energy recovery finally for pat3 the potential for power generation was 7 7 and 4 7 kw and the potential for energy recovery was 7 9 and 4 9 mw h the total power generated by the francis turbine and three pats came to 261 4 and 198 4 kw for both scenarios and the total energy recovered values amounted to 270 5 and 205 3 mw h respectively 73 of recovered energy came from the francis turbines 15 from pat1 9 from pat2 and 3 from pat3 3 4 economic viability 3 4 1 total cost 3 4 1 1 francis turbine table 1 shows the hpps total cost for both scenarios the cost of the electro mechanical equipment was 171198 and 155175 5 for 191 3 and 153 kw of power respectively and 26 m of available head considering pipe works fittings and valves 10 and the cost of the civil works 25 the total cost of the installation was 263382 6 and 238731 5 respectively these values were increased with the maintenance and operation cost of 3 3 4 1 2 pats the total cost of the pats installations is shown in table 1 pat1 plus the generator had a cost of 13707 and 9138 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively the total cost considering pipe works and civil works was 21088 and 14058 on the other hand pat3 the smaller one had a total cost of 4061 and 2499 respectively total cost of pat2 was between the other two 12079 and 7550 3 4 2 installation revenues revenue generated from the installation was directly related to the amount of power produced and the price of this power the price was different if the electricity generated was sold to the electrical grid or used on site in this case study both scenarios have been evaluated to analyze whether the use of the electricity generated directly on site rather than selling to the grid increases the economic viability of the installation the spanish tariff based on 6 periods has been applied to the bmi irrigation district boe 2014 since the irrigation behaviour of each farmer is different and the installation is an on demand irrigation network with a greater flexibility a weighted average value has been used the energy cost kw h used was may 0 0855 june 0 091292 july 0 105888 august 0 0699 in contrast the selling price of the energy for this type of installation is not clearly defined in spain pérez sánchez et al 2016 have established a sales price of 0 0842 kw h castro 2006 which is very small in comparison with some other countries such as ireland with a price fixed of 0 85 kw h or germany with rates over 12 5 cents per kw h fig 7 shows revenues for on site usage or selling to the grid for each hpp location and for both scenarios values show that revenues coming from direct usage for both scenarios 29225 and 22185 were slightly higher than those coming from selling to the grid 27560 and 20921 3 4 3 payback period and energy index to estimate the payback period a 3 of maintenance and operation cost has been added to the total cost eq 6 considering the total cost for the francis turbine installation and annual total revenues the payback periods pp were 12 7 years for self supply and 13 4 years if sold to the grid for scenario 1 these values were 14 4 and 15 2 years for scenario 2 the total cost per kw or power index has been estimated as 1418 and 1607 kw for both scenarios and total cost per kw h or energy index were 1 37 and 1 55 kw h respectively the pats installation payback period for on site usage was 4 9 years for both scenarios the payback period increased to 5 2 if the energy were sold to the grid the power index was 546 7 kw and the energy index 0 53 kw these payback periods match with previous estimations in other non irrigation settings between 2 5 6 years marchis et al 2014 lydon et al 2017a 4 discussion the values of the simulations allow us to make an analysis of the probability of exceedance of a certain flow this information is critical for the design of the turbine and it is shown in the flow duration curves the design flow qd should have a high probability of exceedance meaning that turbines will work with high efficiencies for the longest period of time these probabilities were based on the variables influencing flow in the network such as cropping pattern meteorological conditions on farm irrigation efficiency or farmeŕs behaviour etc the aim of examining two scenarios considering the probability of flow exceedance was to highlight the importance of the design flow conditions relative to the actual flow in the network an optimization problem exists here to find the optimal design flow head values for the turbine that maximizes the energy recovered or the payback period of the installation the optimal design conditions and the optimization process should be addressed by future research once it is demonstrated here that potential for energy recovery exists although the computer simulations and the flow duration curves facilitate an optimal design flow rate the irrigation network has important flow fluctuation during the irrigation season under these circumstances the pat turbine must be installed with a bypass system the bypass facilitates that the pat turbine works near to the bep diverting the excess of flow above or below a certain limit of the design flow rate qd the by pass system was described in the methodology and enables the turbine to operate with the maximum efficiency during the maximum period of time this hydraulic regulation is critical not only to achieve high efficiencies values for power generation but also to control the backpressure and to avoid undesirable phenomena such as cavitation as can be seen in fig 4 and table 1 the average flow in may june july and august was higher than the design flow rate qd for both scenarios in all the pats and the turbine during these months the delivery of a flow rate higher than qd to the pat turbine system could result in more energy recovery however these installations also must regulate the backpressure if the flow rate moves away from the bep the pressure downstream the installation would be compromised on the other hand the average flows in april and september are considerably lower than qd implying very low efficiencies and therefore have not been considered for power generation then only during four months from may to august the pat turbines can generate energy under these premises pats installation were viable for both scenarios since the pp is less than six years 4 9 and 5 2 years respectively and the ei smaller than 0 6 kw h 0 53 kw h for both scenarios according to these values the francis turbine installation is not viable economically with pp above 12 years and ie higher than 1 3 kw h for both scenarios however the payback period of the turbine can be reduced by two years if the total installation of the four turbines is considered francis plus the three pats besides the economic viability the environmental aspects should be considered although the economic feasibility of the francis turbine is questionable it could be very valuable from an environmental point of view due to its capability to recover a large amount of energy and therefore reducing co2 emissions the environmental potential of pat installations has previously been estimated by mcnabola et al 2011 considering that the energy produced by the installations could offset some of the energy demand of drinking water supply several authors have used conversion factors to convert kw h of purchased grip electricity to kg of co2 emissions to estimate the potential carbon saving in water supply networks gallagher et al 2015 lydon et al 2017b according to the institute for energy diversification and saving in spain idae 2014 the conversion factor for conventional electricity in spain is 0 399 kg eco2 kw h the estimated potential carbon savings of the total installation would result in between 82 and 108 tonnes eco2 for both scenarios respectively finally a pat turbine installation plays a leading role in the pressure management of any water distribution network which is a main strategy for leakage reduction usually the revenue of recovered water is much larger than the revenue of recovered energy and this could increase the justification of the plant construction especially in semi arid regions such as the south of spain future research should also consider the potential effects of cavitation arising from the installation of turbines in water pipe networks limited research has been conducted to date on the effects of cavitation in water pipe networks where turbines are installed for energy recovery purposes 5 conclusions this work shows theoretically that significant energy savings can be achieved by installing traditional turbines or pats in pressurized irrigation networks from an economic point of view traditional turbines do not seem to be viable with payback periods of over 10 years on the other hand pats have been shown to be very competitive and economically viable with payback period below 6 years and energy index below 0 6 kw h the energy saving coming from this type of installation could translate into a significant reduction in co2 emissions reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops and the agri food industry thus these technologies represent a potential positive competitive advantage for agricultural production improving the exploitation cost reducing the carbon footprint of irrigated crops and increasing the economic feasibility in agricultural production acknowledgment

important agricultural products for export and domestic consumption pérez moreno et al 2005 and are crops that generate jobs and foreign exchange in the country sagarpa 2004 the habanero chili capsicum chinense jacq is very important in the diet of the population on the yucatan peninsula cázares sánchez and duch 2002 and beyond and has become a symbol for other chili crops due to their high content of capsaicinoids zewdie and bosland 2000 cázares sánchez et al 2005 which provide high levels spiciness or pungency from 200 000 to 500 000 scoville units such spiciness fuels the increase in their demand on national and international markets for such uses as cosmetics production tear gas sauces coating irrigation or electric systems for protection against rodents and their anticorrosion capacity in paints for boats soria fregoso et al 2002 ramírez et al 2005 the increase in demand is a key factor in the allocation of more land for chili production during 2002 2012 the area planted with habanero chilies in mexico increased from 4604 to 8469 ha siap 2016 and this trend is lasting yet rainfall in mexico is not sufficient to meet the water needs of agricultural plants especially from february to may in the dry drought season even if irrigation is a common practice in the production of habanero chilies there is no estimate of the irrigation amount or its effect on fruit yield and quality nor are there estimates of water use efficiency or the content of virtual water factors important in evaluating water use sustainability freshwater scarcity is widely discussed around the world over recent years freshwater consumption has grown at twice the rate of human population growth and there are an increasing number of regions experiencing chronic freshwater shortages unesco 2012 dalin et al 2017 states that a rapid non renewable depletion of aquifers is due to an excessive extraction of water that is used for irrigation in many crop producing regions worldwide that threatens the sustainability of water use and food production not only in the producing regions but also globally due to the international food trade in the last decades new terms have been introduced to determine the efficiency and sustainability of water use hoekstra and hung 2002 introduced the water footprint concept lovarelli et al 2016 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 define it as the volume of water needed for the production of the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the country and they stated that since the goods and services are produced also in other countries the water footprint can be divided in internal water footprint and external water footprint another set of terms closely related is the estimation of the present and future values of virtual water defined as the volume of water consumed and required to produce goods that are exchanged with other nations hanasaki et al 2010 across many sectors of human activity deng et al 2015 according to hoekstra and chapagain 2007 the concept was introduced by allan 1993 1994 in the early 1990 in the agricultural sector virtual water is defined as the amount of water used to produce a unit of biomass or yield sun et al 2013 hoekstra and hung 2002 ridoutt and pfister 2010 and hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 indicated that the agricultural production is the principal responsible for water use and consequently in the last decade the virtual water has been estimated for several crops abu sharar et al 2012 alamilla magaña et al 2016 aldaya et al 2010 vanham 2013 commonly virtual water is divided into green virtual water and blue virtual water defined as rainwater consumed during the production process of a crop and surface water or groundwater consumed during the production process of a crop respectively sun et al 2013 wichelns 2004 concluded that water short countries can import water by importing water intensive crops and then enhance their food security in the same way hoekstra and hung 2002 stated that international trade of commodities brings along international flows of virtual water dalin et al 2017 highlight its relation with groundwater depletion worldwide and concludes that approximately eleven per cent of non renewable groundwater use for irrigation is embedded in international food trade another widely used indicator is water use efficiency wue which is the relationship between the yield of a crop and the amount of water applied to it in turn wue is divided into irrigation water use efficiency iwue and total water use efficiency twue their range of variation has implications related to the sustainability of agriculture and water use in order to improve the sustainable management of irrigation water it is necessary to search for new management approaches so as to increase iwue as well as to reduce the virtual water contained in agricultural products different approaches are used for planning water application estimating the water consumption by plants based on the use of coefficients depending on cultural development kc and soil ks combined with lysimeter measurements or estimation of reference evapotranspiration from meteorological information allen et al 1998 or based on detailed and continuous measurements of the temporal change in soil moisture to perform water balances e g ghiberto et al 2011 both approaches although widely used have the disadvantage of requiring continuous measurements of a large number of climatic or soil variables another alternative which in recent years has taken root in deciding when to initiate irrigation is to use soil moisture tension as an indicator of the need for irrigation soil moisture tension is a major component of the total potential of water in the soil and of the soil hydraulic gradient which when combined with hydraulic conductivity permits calculation of the magnitude of water flow in the soil for plant roots according to the darcy buckingham law gaudin and rapanoelina 2003 the magnitude of the water flow value depends thus on the value for soil moisture tension and its space gradient and therefore this last variable can be related to growth development and crop yield optimum values for soil moisture tension for potatoes carli et al 2014 kang et al 2004 wang et al 2007 bananas orozco romero and pérez zamora 2006 maize elote young green sweet corn rivera hernández et al 2010 rivera hernández et al 2009 rice mahajan et al 2012 sudhir yadav et al 2011 sunflowers grown for flowers carrillo ávila et al 2015 and sugarcane alamilla magaña et al 2016 have been estimated but there is no such work reported for chilies in general capsicum annuum l or for habanero chilies c chinense in particular furthermore as far as virtual water is concerned to date no studies have been reported in the scientific literature in which the magnitude of the green or blue virtual water in chilies crop have been estimated lovarelli et al 2016 made an exhaustive review of studies in which the water footprint and the virtual water have been estimated over the entire world for years 2000 2015 of the 96 scientific articles that they revised concerning agricultural production in none of them an estimate of the water footprint or virtual water for any of the many cultivated species of chilies has been made thus the objectives of this work were to define an objective methodology for applying irrigation to habanero chili cultivation based on soil tensiometry and to determine the values of iwue and virtual water under different values of soil moisture tension used as indicators for the beginning of irrigation in so doing irrigation management schemes can be established for improving crop yield and sustainability indicators thus contributing to more sustainable management of the resource 2 materials and methods two experiments were carried out from july to december 2015 and from january to may 2016 in two plots managed by cooperating habanero chili producers in the state of campeche on the yucatán peninsula mexico under two different climatic conditions rainy and dry seasons respectively both experiments were established in open fields the yucatan peninsula has a karst origin and is one of the world s largest karstic aquifer systems gondwe et al 2010 with little topographic relief with small hills that reach elevations of only four to five hundred meters with a very permeable substrate largely formed of flat lying beds of limestone which dissolve with rainwater forming cavities and underground rivers which connect sometimes to the surface forming cenotes natural wells formed from collapsed sinkholes in the limestone sinkholes or smaller openings gelting 1995 due to the small topographical relief and the multiple small watersheds the peninsular aquifers consist of multiple lenses of fresh water only up to 100 m thick gondwe et al 2010 that constitute the mainly fresh water resource available in the yucatan peninsula here wells are used to extract water for human use and agricultural purposes however in campeche state the extracted water for irrigation and human consumption is still less than the natural recharge rate of aquifers this state is one of the few ones in mexico where still no prohibition for the construction of irrigation wells exist semarnat 2010 since the irrigated area for agricultural production remains low and most of the crops are rainfed managed nevertheless strategies for improving freshwater use efficiency are needed if the resource is to be sustainably managed because in the yucatan peninsula water demands are growing along with threats from organic and chemical contaminant sources of water gondwe et al 2010 one of these sources are agriculture which is being intensified mazzotti 2005 and wastewater that is re injected into the aquifer krekeler et al 2007 2 1 weather the climate is tropical warm sub humid with rainfall averaging 1200 mm per year veleva et al 1997 the geological conditions of the peninsula limit somehow the availability of water for both human consumption and agricultural production gelting 1995 the predominant climate in the state of campeche is warm sub humid with rainfall during summer classified as aw0 according to köppen climatic classification modified by garcía 1973 temperatures are normally stable and high with the hottest months being may and june and the coolest being december and january the average annual temperature is 26 8 c with the highest average temperature in may 29 6 c and the lowest average temperature in january 23 2 c the average annual rainfall is 1099 mm but is irregularly distributed in time between june and november frequent and high intensity rainfall occurs the rainy season in contrast february to april is the dry drought season a period having the lowest rainfall and highest temperatures fig 1 shows the seasonal distribution of rain in the study zone during the experiment period 2 2 geographic location the first experiment was performed from july to december 2015 on a field plot provided by cooperating producers in the community of bethania 19 53 24 n 90 21 16 4 w at 9 masl the second experiment was conducted during january to may 2016 in the community of chemblás 19 55 13 5 n 90 20 29 7 w at 8 masl 2 3 plant material the principal varieties of habanero chilies most frequently planted in the state of campeche are jaguar calakmul naranja and the chichen itzá hybrid this hybrid was used in the present study 2 4 soil type and land preparation soil and subsoil are highly permeable so that rainwater infiltrates quickly into the subsoil and therefore there are no rivers or streams in the northern of the peninsula the landscape is divided in multiple and little watersheds which include some different soil types the cambisols nitisols and luvisols being the main cultivated ones villalobos zapata and mendoza 2010 in both experiments the soil was a chromic luvisol with a clay loam texture and a bulk density between 1 2 and 1 25 g cm 3 despite of having a clay loam texture the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is high as the water quickly infiltrates into the soil profile the field was prepared for planting in june 2015 for the first experiment and in december 2015 for the second experiment in both cases this consisted of cross plowing fallow fields with the final furrows having a distance between them of 1 8 m 2 5 transplantation transplantation was performed after plantlets had presented the fifth true leaf about 45 days after their sowing in trays with cavities having one plantlet each at the beginning of july 2015 for the first experiment and on january 6 2016 for the second experiment plantlets transplanted were placed directly into the furrows with a distance of 60 cm between them and 1 8 m between furrows 2 6 anti insect micro mesh agribón once transplantation was completed anti insect micro mesh was used to protect the plants from insect pests especially sweet potato whitefly bemisia tabaci gennadius and to permit better plant development such micro mesh is commonly used by chili producers in the yucatán peninsula to protect plants during early stages of crop development and is removed when it begins to constitute a physical barrier to plant growth about a month and a half after transplantation subsequently the plants were exposed naturally to pests for the experiments during the rainy season the micro mesh was withdrawn at the end of august 2015 and for the dry season at the end of february 2016 2 7 crop labor the products and doses applied for soil fertilization and control of pests and diseases were the same in both experiments based on the technology for cultivating habanero chilies developed by the instituto tecnológico agropecuario de conkal yucatán conkal agricultural technology institute soria fregoso et al 2002 2 7 1 fertilization fertilizers were used in split applications at different stages of the crop 2 7 2 pest and disease control the presence of pests and diseases was monitored during both experiments the main pests present in the crops for both experiments were the chilean weevil athonomus eugenii cano and the sweet potato white fly bemisia tabaci although during the rainy season in 2015 their incidences were low during the dry season in 2016 the incidence of pests mainly sweet potato white fly a vector of plant viruses was much greater compared to the first experiment due to favorable conditions for their reproduction higher temperatures lower rainfall and lower relative humidity their incidence produced the expression of plant viral disease after removal of the micro mesh which resulted in flower fall reduction in size and number of fruits and shortened the reproductive period significantly affecting crop yield 2 7 3 weed control weeds were removed using a hoe 2 7 4 early plant guidance and strengthening to keep the plants erect rods were installed every two meters and connected with raffia palm fibers to support the plants thus producing a line of connected stakes along each furrow as the plants grew the horizontal fibers were used as vertical growth support 2 7 5 irrigation a drip irrigation system was used with a single tape t tape caliber 0 6 mm per furrow with drip points every 20 centimeters and a water flow application of 800 ml per drip point per hour the irrigation system also was used for application of diluted fertilizers in the water the water for irrigating the crop for both experimental works was extracted from wells whose groundwater depth is about 4 m below the soil surface during the rainy season which descends to about 7 m during the drought season because the amount of water extracted to irrigate the crop was relatively small considering that a drip irrigation system was used the variation of the water table depth due to the extraction of water for irrigation was small barely perceptible from one day to the next one the elevation of the soil surface is between 7 and 9 m above sea level in the two plots used so the current use of irrigation water extracted from the aquifer can be considered within the manageable range to avoid excessive extraction of groundwater 2 8 experimental design and treatments different values of soil moisture tension were used in order to define the beginning of irrigation in a similar way to the works of alamilla magaña et al 2016 carrillo ávila et al 2015 mahajan et al 2012 rivera hernández et al 2010 rivera hernández et al 2009 sudhir yadav et al 2011 and wang et al 2007 values of 10 40 and 70 kpa for soil moisture tension were tested as indicators for initiating irrigation during growth flowering and fruiting and were considered as treatments including irrigation management by the producers as a control a completely randomized experimental design with three replicates was used treatments were randomly assigned to the experimental units which consisted of three 10 m long furrows irrigation was initiated when the value for soil moisture tension reached the designated values for each treatment measured almost daily see fig 2 with irrometer model r tensiometers whose porous capsules were installed at 30 cm soil depth directly below the drip tapes individual valves at the beginning of each drip tape were used to control the irrigation rate in each experimental unit irrigation was maintained until the soil moisture tension returned to a value close to zero saturated soil as far as possible because the irrigation water quickly infiltrated the profile without completely saturating all the porous space to determine the volume of water applied in each irrigation the flow rate of the emitters measured in five emitters per furrow distributed from the beginning to the end of the furrows was first quantified to measure flow rate containers of known volume were placed under each emitter and the time for them to be filled was recorded the flow of the emitter was obtained by dividing the volume of the container between the filling time the time of each irrigation was recorded and the volume of water applied in each irrigation was calculated by multiplying the average flow rate of the emitters by the number of emitters per furrow and by the time spent in each irrigation applied with which an estimation of the irrigation water depth for each treatment was obtained 2 9 response variables in the two experiments during the fruiting phase the number nfp and fresh weight of fruits per plant fwp in each harvest were recorded from six plants selected randomly from each experimental unit a random sample of 20 of the fruits harvested was taken to measure their length fl and diameter fd with the fwp data of all the harvest and the number of plants per hectare crop yield expressed in fresh weight of fruits for each treatment was estimated 2 10 water use efficiency wue for each treatment and experiment the following equations were applied alamilla magaña et al 2016 lu et al 2000 1 i w u e y i w 2 t w u e y t w where iwue irrigation water use efficiency t ha 1 mm 1 iw irrigation depth applied to the crop mm y crop yield t ha 1 twue total water use efficiency

sas statistical analysis system 2003 in cases where significant treatment effects were found a means comparison test was performed using least significant difference comparisons among treatments tukey 1991 with a significance level of α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture tension changes to illustrate the manner in which treatments were applied changes in soil moisture tension in replication 2 for the first experiment above slightly more than a month and in replication 1 for the second below slightly less than a month are illustrated in fig 2 in both cases in the 10 kpa treatment more humid more irrigation water was applied than in the other two treatments with the least irrigation in the driest treatment 70 kpa during the first experiment total rainfall from july to december 2015 was 582 5 mm and soil moisture tension almost never reached values below 70 kpa due to frequent rainfall although some irrigation was necessary producers applied irrigations on a near daily basis without any criteria this was reason why the number of hours of irrigation was almost double the number of hours in the humid treatment 10 kpa and almost seven times greater than in the 70 kpa treatment fig 3 a similar trend was observed for crop irrigation producers applied 188 more irrigation water than that applied to the 10 kpa treatment and 682 more water than in the 70 kpa treatment the common practice of producers irrigating almost every day except for days with abundant rain is reflected in an excessive application of water during the first experiment which did not result in an increased crop yield for the second experiment during the dry season from january to may 2016 there was only 123 mm of rainfall due to higher temperatures and low rainfall the values for soil moisture tension increased more rapidly each day fig 2 such that in some cases the soil moisture tension exceeded values for each treatment as a consequence of less rainfall the irrigation hours and the amount of water applied had less variation among irrigation treatments fig 3 although irrigation time and amount of water applied was greater under the producer management where almost daily irrigations were applied without any criteria concerning crop demand producer irrigation in both experiments was superior to that applied in the wettest treatment 10 kpa a value associated with soil moisture close to saturation 3 2 growth and yield the mean values for the growth variables and their statistical comparisons are shown in table 1 for the rainy above and dry seasons below in the first experiment no statistically significant differences were found for most of the variables except for fruit length fl for which significantly greater values were obtained in the wettest treatment 10 kpa the general absence of treatment effects is attributed to the large amount of rainwater during this experiment 582 5 mm which masked most effects however the use of tensiometers to indicate the beginning of irrigation allowed to substantially reduce the amount of irrigation water in relation to the irrigation depth applied by the producers which did not affect growth or crop yield although during this season no statistical differences were found for nearly every variable all had higher values in the 10 kpa treatment and declined as soil moisture tension increased table 1 during the dry season the values for crop yield in all cases were significantly lower than those for the rainy season table 1 despite of applying irrigation and following the same agronomic management both plots were established at open field conditions and the incidence of pests especially sweet potato white fly bemisia tabaci was much higher during the dry season the infestation presented serious problems of viral infection which reduced the life cycle of the crop increased early flower drop reduced size and weight of fruits and consequently crop yield was reduced with the result that during this season only four chili harvests were carried out however given the observed damages that occurred in all treatments the differences obtained in the variables evaluated can still be attributed to the treatments and consequently the conclusions obtained are still applicable unlike the rainy season there was infrequent light precipitation during the dry season fig 1 which did not mask the effects of irrigation treatments providing statistically higher values for the 10 kpa treatment and for producer management of irrigation control leading to increased number and weight of chilies per plant and crop yield however no effects of treatments were detected on chili length or diameter table 1 3 2 1 number of fruits chilies per plant nfp no statistical differences were found between treatments for nfp during the rainy season although higher values were observed at lower levels of soil moisture tension results similar to those found during the rainy season were reported by borges et al 2010 who evaluated different moisture and nutrient conditions for habanero chilies their results indicated that in general the yield of capsicum declines if nutrition or soil moisture are reduced the highest reported yields were in soils where a high dose of n p2o5 and k2o was applied and with a greater availability of water in the soil during the dry season a significantly lower number of fruits were produced in all treatments due as already mentioned to the high incidence of pests and diseases statistical differences also were found among treatments with the highest mean value in the 10 kpa treatment significantly higher than those obtained in the 40 kpa and 70 kpa treatments but statistically similar to the control during the two evaluated seasons the mean number of fruits tended to be higher with lower soil moisture tension table 1 3 2 2 fruit fresh weight per plant fwp no statistical differences were found in the first experiment although the values obtained declined as soil moisture tension increased with a higher mean weight in the 10 kpa treatment table 1 the values obtained for this season are lower than those reported by quintal et al 2012 who obtained on average 4 9 6 4 kg of fresh fruit per plant from the lowest to highest percentage of irrigation water applied to the crop during the dry season fwp was very low in all treatments including the producer plot control although there were statistical differences between treatments a significantly higher mean was obtained in the 10 kpa treatment which was statistically similar to the value obtained with producer irrigation management control but significantly different from the lower values for the 40 and 70 kpa treatments table 1 3 2 3 yield there were no statistically significant differences among treatments for the first experiment although a decline was observed with increasing soil moisture tension table 1 the yield obtained with the 10 kpa treatment was almost identical to that obtained with producer irrigation management which used a total of 164 h of irrigation on their plot whereas for the 10 kpa treatment only 87 h of irrigation were applied throughout the experiment fig 3 during the second experiment a significantly higher yield was obtained for the wettest treatment 10 kpa followed by the control table 1 similar to mean fruit fresh weight per plant significantly lower values were found for the 40 and 70 kpa treatments with the lowest value 7 59 t ha 1 for the 40 kpa treatment these results are much lower than those obtained during the rainy season which is attributed as already mentioned to the high incidence of pests and diseases at this time during this season producers also applied more water than that applied to the three soil moisture tension treatments the irrigation depth for the 10 40 and 70 kpa treatments were 84 61 and 44 of the irrigation depths applied by the producers even though their yield was less than that for the 10 kpa treatment these results and those obtained for the first experiment stress the need for producers to adopt technology to better manage plot irrigation especially to help them to determine the best moment to initiate irrigation and to define the amount of water that is to be applied 3 2 4 fruit diameter fd no statistically significant effects were found in either experiment although larger values were obtained with lower soil moisture tension table 1 and with slightly higher values in the first experiment the values obtained in both experiments were higher than those reported by tocuch et al 2011 who obtained a range of mean values from 2 43 to 2 54 cm for habanero chilies cultivated with different nitrate ammonium ratios and from 2 3 to 2 5 cm when cultivated in substrates having different particle sizes of tezontle a porous and highly oxidized volcanic rock due to its high levels of iron oxide 3 2 5 fruit length fl this was the only variable during the rainy season for which treatments induced statistically significant differences with higher values observed in the 10 and 40 kpa treatments table 1 during the dry season there were no statistically significant differences with values slightly lower than those obtained during the rainy season 3 3 water use efficiency wue fig 4 shows the estimated values for the irrigation water use efficiency iwue and total water use efficiency twue for the two experiments during the dry season rainfall was only 123 4 mm consequently the irrigation depth for the different treatments increased fig 3 thus because crop yield was much lower the iwue values were much lower in the second experiment although in both experiments the highest values were obtained in the 70 kpa treatment and the significantly lower values with producer management fig 4 due to the greater irrigation depth that did not promote a higher yield on the other hand the reduced yield also affected the twue values in the second experiment which declined in all treatments compared to those obtained for the rainy season during the second experiment the largest value for twue also was observed in the 70 kpa treatment and the lowest in the control producer irrigation management although in this variable no statistical differences were observed between any treatment fig 4 in the control for every millimeter of water applied to the crop irrigation plus rain 23 kg of chilies were obtained and for each millimeter of irrigation water 33 kg of chilies were obtained in the 70 kpa treatment for each millimeter of water applied to the crop irrigation plus rain 33 kg of chilies were harvested and for each millimeter of irrigation water applied 62 kg of chilies were harvested almost twice than that obtained in the control yet in the 10 kpa treatment for which a significantly greater yield was obtained values for iwue and twue were slightly lower than those obtained with the 70 kpa although statistically the two treatments were equal in these variables in this case for every millimeter of water provided irrigation plus rain 30 kg of chilies were harvested and 45 kg of chilies were harvested for each millimeter of irrigation water used in 2016 a similar trend for iwue and twue where higher values were recorded for drier irrigation treatments has also been observed for other crops alamilla magaña et al 2016 this and can be explained by the fact that plants try to make the most of available water when there is shortage of it in the soil these results make evident the need to improve crop water management by producers to make it more sustainable and to avoid a non efficient water management at plot level thus reducing pollution contamination generated by the leaching of agrochemicals 3 4 virtual water the values for both experiments are shown in fig 5 during the dry season they were substantially higher because crop yield was significantly lower i e between 3 8 and 5 8 times lower than that obtained during the rainy season in both experiments the highest values for vw occurred with the controls significantly higher than the value obtained in the 40 kpa treatment in 2015 although statistically equal to the values obtained for irrigation treatments in 2016 in the control 209 and 427 l of water for the rainy and dry seasons were required respectively to produce one kilogram of chilies the lowest values for vw in 2015 rainy season occurred in the 40 kpa and 70 kpa treatments where it was necessary to apply 148 and 154 l of water to obtain the same result respectively for 2016 dry season the lowest values for vw were observed in the 10 kpa and 70 kpa treatments although statistically equal to the other treatments fig 5 the water volume used in the 70 kpa treatment represent approximately 70 of the water volume used in producer irrigation management without significantly reducing crop yield table 1 these results complement those obtained when calculating twue and underline the need to improve agricultural management of irrigation water by producers to increase its sustainability on the other hand the obtained results contrast with those found in other studies where virtual water was assessed in other crops bulsink et al 2010 found in indonesia virtual water values of 514 22907 9414 3474 1958 and 2483 m3 t 1 0 514 22 907 9 414 3 474 1 958 and 2 483 m3 kg 1 for cassava coffe cocoa rice soybeans and maize respectively these are much greater values than those obtained herein although the authors do not specify if the values were calculated on a dry or fresh basis aldaya and hoekstra 2010 reported values of 748 and 114 m3 t 1 0 748 and 0 114 m3 kg 1 for wheat and tomato production in italy calculated in dry and fresh basis respectively and morillo et al 2015 found vw average values of only 70 m3t 1 0 070 m3 kg 1 for strawberries in spain calculated apparently on a fresh basis since the authors do not clearly indicate such details these data are closer but also lower than the values found in this work for habanero chilies calculated on a fresh basis lovarelli et al 2016 indicated that differences in soil type irrigation systems climate protected or unprotected crop systems yield and farming systems are the cause of variations in virtual water values fig 6 shows the trends for the gvw and bvw for the irrigation treatments and controls producer irrigation water management in both experiments given the decomposition of vw into gvw and bvw it is clear that producers use the irrigation water inefficiently out of the 209 l applied by producers to the crop during the rainy season to obtain one kg of fruit 128 l were contributed by rain and 81 by the irrigation system in contrast in the 40 kpa treatment for the same season an amount of 148 l of water was required to produce one kg of chilies of this volume 132 l came from rain 89 green water and only 16 were from irrigation 11 blue water representing only about 20 of the irrigation water applied by producers during the first experiment during the second experiment the contribution of rain to vw was much lower with gvw representing from 39 control producer management to 88 70 kpa treatment of bvw in the control 120 l of rainwater and 307 l of irrigation water were required to produce one kg of chilies while for the 70 kpa treatment 143 l of rainwater 47 green and only 162 l of irrigation water 53 blue were required for the 10 kpa treatment which produced the greatest fruit yield during the dry season 104 l of rainwater 32 green and 224 l of irrigation water 68 blue were required to obtain the same result the results obtained from both experiments again underscore the need for producers to adopt technologies to improve the management of water in their plots when comparing the results obtained herein with those reported in other studies regarding the decomposition of vw into gvw and bvw such values seem to be rather questionable since this decomposition depends basically on climate although the irrigation systems soil fertility farming systems and agricultural techniques used for crop production are also factors that affect this decomposition bulsink et al 2010 found in indonesia that in rice and coffe production vw is composed in 73 and 96 of gvw respectively aldaya and hoekstra 2010 analysed italian industrial tomato production and reported that in their study vw is composed by a 30 of gvw chapagain and hoekstra 2010 for rice production in the 13 most important producing countries found that vw is composed of 48 of gvw dalin et al 2017 estimated the volume of groundwater depletion gwd embedded in the world s food production and international food trade these authors defined gwd as the volume of groundwater that is extracted for irrigation use in excess of the natural recharge rate and irrigation return flow and they calculated a groundwater stress index for the entire world where a value greater than one correspond to zones with groundwater overexploited in our case since the volume of groundwater extracted for irrigating habanero chilies in the yucatán peninsula is still smaller than the natural recharge rate the groundwater stress index is lower than one semarnat 2010 dalin et al 2017 however a fast growth of agricultural production in the peninsula is taking place mazzotti 2005 in particular the cultivated surfaces of habanero chili siap 2016 this trend is due to the growing demand for habanero chilie fruits on the international market thus agricultural water management alternatives to increase water use efficiency and reduce virtual water embedded in the chilie fruits are needed so as to avoid in the near future problems of aquifer depletion and saline intrusion the alternative presented in this work is focused on the issues mentioned before our results can be used in other virtual water trade studies to estimate the international trade of virtual water embedded in the fresh fruits of habanero chilies whose commercialization at international level is increasing however precautions should be taken when interpreting our results obtained for the dry season as a consequence of the damages suffered by the crop in this season due to the incidence of pests and diseases 4 conclusions in our work an estimation of the green and blue virtual water content embedded in the habanero chili production in campeche mexico was made in two different climatic conditions rainy and dry seasons respectively although in the first experiment the interference of the rainy periods masked somehow the effect of the irrigation treatments without obtaining yield differences a different amount of irrigation water was applied in the different treatments this difference in irrigation water applied led to a statistically significant differences in the irrigation water use efficiency and virtual water contents total virtual water content and blue virtual water content that is the significantly highest irrigation water use efficiencies were obtained when the irrigation water was applied to the crop at soil moisture tensions of 40 kpa and 70 kpa also in the 40 kpa treatment a significantly lower virtual water content in chili fruits was obtained in comparison to the value measured with the producer irrigation management this single conclusion implies a positive result even if no statistical differences in crop yield were found and even more important when the virtual water was divided into green and blue it was observed that during the rainy season the producers applied 80 l of irrigation water to produce one kilogram of fruit while in the 70 kpa treatment only 13 l were needed to obtain the same result which is a very significant finding this represents a reduction in irrigation water use by almost 84 a very important result to be highly recommended to reduce the extraction of irrigation water from aquifers and improve the sustainability of this resource concerning the second experiment significant higher values were recorded for crop yield and the number and weight of fruits per plant in the 10 kpa treatment statistically equal to those obtained by the producer a significantly highest irrigation water use efficiency in relation to the producer s irrigation water management was observed in the 70 kpa treatments a significant higher green virtual water content in chili fruits was observed in the 40 kpa treatment although statistically equal to that obtained in the 70 kpa treatment however the highest blue virtual water and the lowest irrigation water use efficiency values were observed with the producer irrigation management in both cases with values significantly equal to those obtained in 10 kpa and 40 kpa treatments all these results are of great interest to make a very valuable contribution towards a more sustainable use of irrigation water in habanero chili production based on this experimental work it can be stated that the regional producers of habanero chilies are currently practicing a non efficient agricultural water management and consequently there is a need for producers in campeche méxico to increase the water use efficiency and to reduce the blue virtual water content embedded in the fruits of habanero chilies which no doubt may result in a more sustainable water management for this the use of tensiometers as indicators of the beginning of the irrigations can be a good alternative to be implemented at commercial scale acknowledgements to the president of the chile product system sisproch

11438,during 2015 and 2016 two experiments were conducted under contrasting climatic conditions rainy and dry seasons respectively in campeche mexico to test various thresholds treatments of soil moisture tension for the beginning of irrigation and their effect on the yield and quality of habanero chilies and also on the efficiency of water use the virtual water content and its blue and green components in both experiments irrigation was initiated when the soil moisture tension measured at 30 cm depth took the values 10 40 and 70 kpa considered as treatments using producer irrigation

virtual water vw green virtual water gvw and blue virtual water bvw were determined and statistically analyzed during 2015 rains masked treatment effects although significant effects were detected for fl iwue vw and bvw in 2016 the different irrigation treatments during the dry season had significant effects on the variables nfp fwp and y with statistically higher values in the 10 kpa treatment and also in iwue gvw and bvw with statistically higher values in the 70 kpa 40 kpa and the control treatments respectively nearly all crop growth and yield related variables had higher values with lower soil moisture tension in both production cycles significantly lowest values for iwue and significantly highest values for bvw were obtained under producer irrigation management controls whereas significantly highest values were recorded for iwue and significantly lowest for bvw in the 40 and 70 kpa treatments it was concluded that the use of tensiometers to define the beginning of irrigation

important agricultural products for export and domestic consumption pérez moreno et al 2005 and are crops that generate jobs and foreign exchange in the country sagarpa 2004 the habanero chili capsicum chinense jacq is very important in the diet of the population on the yucatan peninsula cázares sánchez and duch 2002 and beyond and has become a symbol for other chili crops due to their high content of capsaicinoids zewdie and bosland 2000 cázares sánchez et al 2005 which provide high levels spiciness or pungency from 200 000 to 500 000 scoville units such spiciness fuels the increase in their demand on national and international markets for such uses as cosmetics production tear gas sauces coating irrigation or electric systems for protection against rodents and their anticorrosion capacity in paints for boats soria fregoso et al 2002 ramírez et al 2005 the increase in demand is a key factor in the allocation of more land for chili production during 2002 2012 the area planted with habanero chilies in mexico increased from 4604 to 8469 ha siap 2016 and this trend is lasting yet rainfall in mexico is not sufficient to meet the water needs of agricultural plants especially from february to may in the dry drought season even if irrigation is a common practice in the production of habanero chilies there is no estimate of the irrigation amount or its effect on fruit yield and quality nor are there estimates of water use efficiency or the content of virtual water factors important in evaluating water use sustainability freshwater scarcity is widely discussed around the world over recent years freshwater consumption has grown at twice the rate of human population growth and there are an increasing number of regions experiencing chronic freshwater shortages unesco 2012 dalin et al 2017 states that a rapid non renewable depletion of aquifers is due to an excessive extraction of water that is used for irrigation in many crop producing regions worldwide that threatens the sustainability of water use and food production not only in the producing regions but also globally due to the international food trade in the last decades new terms have been introduced to determine the efficiency and sustainability of water use hoekstra and hung 2002 introduced the water footprint concept lovarelli et al 2016 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 define it as the volume of water needed for the production of the goods and services consumed by the inhabitants of the country and they stated that since the goods and services are produced also in other countries the water footprint can be divided in internal water footprint and external water footprint another set of terms closely related is the estimation of the present and future values of virtual water defined as the volume of water consumed and required to produce goods that are exchanged with other nations hanasaki et al 2010 across many sectors of human activity deng et al 2015 according to hoekstra and chapagain 2007 the concept was introduced by allan 1993 1994 in the early 1990 in the agricultural sector virtual water is defined as the amount of water used to produce a unit of biomass or yield sun et al 2013 hoekstra and hung 2002 ridoutt and pfister 2010 and hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 indicated that the agricultural production is the principal responsible for water use and consequently in the last decade the virtual water has been estimated for several crops abu sharar et al 2012 alamilla magaña et al 2016 aldaya et al 2010 vanham 2013 commonly virtual water is divided into green virtual water and blue virtual water defined as rainwater consumed during the production process of a crop and surface water or groundwater consumed during the production process of a crop respectively sun et al 2013 wichelns 2004 concluded that water short countries can import water by importing water intensive crops and then enhance their food security in the same way hoekstra and hung 2002 stated that international trade of commodities brings along international flows of virtual water dalin et al 2017 highlight its relation with groundwater depletion worldwide and concludes that approximately eleven per cent of non renewable groundwater use for irrigation is embedded in international food trade another widely used indicator is water use efficiency wue which is the relationship between the yield of a crop and the amount of water applied to it in turn wue is divided into irrigation water use efficiency iwue and total water use efficiency twue their range of variation has implications related to the sustainability of agriculture and water use in order to improve the sustainable management of irrigation water it is necessary to search for new management approaches so as to increase iwue as well as to reduce the virtual water contained in agricultural products different approaches are used for planning water application estimating the water consumption by plants based on the use of coefficients depending on cultural development kc and soil ks combined with lysimeter measurements or estimation of reference evapotranspiration from meteorological information allen et al 1998 or based on detailed and continuous measurements of the temporal change in soil moisture to perform water balances e g ghiberto et al 2011 both approaches although widely used have the disadvantage of requiring continuous measurements of a large number of climatic or soil variables another alternative which in recent years has taken root in deciding when to initiate irrigation is to use soil moisture tension as an indicator of the need for irrigation soil moisture tension is a major component of the total potential of water in the soil and of the soil hydraulic gradient which when combined with hydraulic conductivity permits calculation of the magnitude of water flow in the soil for plant roots according to the darcy buckingham law gaudin and rapanoelina 2003 the magnitude of the water flow value depends thus on the value for soil moisture tension and its space gradient and therefore this last variable can be related to growth development and crop yield optimum values for soil moisture tension for potatoes carli et al 2014 kang et al 2004 wang et al 2007 bananas orozco romero and pérez zamora 2006 maize elote young green sweet corn rivera hernández et al 2010 rivera hernández et al 2009 rice mahajan et al 2012 sudhir yadav et al 2011 sunflowers grown for flowers carrillo ávila et al 2015 and sugarcane alamilla magaña et al 2016 have been estimated but there is no such work reported for chilies in general capsicum annuum l or for habanero chilies c chinense in particular furthermore as far as virtual water is concerned to date no studies have been reported in the scientific literature in which the magnitude of the green or blue virtual water in chilies crop have been estimated lovarelli et al 2016 made an exhaustive review of studies in which the water footprint and the virtual water have been estimated over the entire world for years 2000 2015 of the 96 scientific articles that they revised concerning agricultural production in none of them an estimate of the water footprint or virtual water for any of the many cultivated species of chilies has been made thus the objectives of this work were to define an objective methodology for applying irrigation to habanero chili cultivation based on soil tensiometry and to determine the values of iwue and virtual water under different values of soil moisture tension used as indicators for the beginning of irrigation in so doing irrigation management schemes can be established for improving crop yield and sustainability indicators thus contributing to more sustainable management of the resource 2 materials and methods two experiments were carried out from july to december 2015 and from january to may 2016 in two plots managed by cooperating habanero chili producers in the state of campeche on the yucatán peninsula mexico under two different climatic conditions rainy and dry seasons respectively both experiments were established in open fields the yucatan peninsula has a karst origin and is one of the world s largest karstic aquifer systems gondwe et al 2010 with little topographic relief with small hills that reach elevations of only four to five hundred meters with a very permeable substrate largely formed of flat lying beds of limestone which dissolve with rainwater forming cavities and underground rivers which connect sometimes to the surface forming cenotes natural wells formed from collapsed sinkholes in the limestone sinkholes or smaller openings gelting 1995 due to the small topographical relief and the multiple small watersheds the peninsular aquifers consist of multiple lenses of fresh water only up to 100 m thick gondwe et al 2010 that constitute the mainly fresh water resource available in the yucatan peninsula here wells are used to extract water for human use and agricultural purposes however in campeche state the extracted water for irrigation and human consumption is still less than the natural recharge rate of aquifers this state is one of the few ones in mexico where still no prohibition for the construction of irrigation wells exist semarnat 2010 since the irrigated area for agricultural production remains low and most of the crops are rainfed managed nevertheless strategies for improving freshwater use efficiency are needed if the resource is to be sustainably managed because in the yucatan peninsula water demands are growing along with threats from organic and chemical contaminant sources of water gondwe et al 2010 one of these sources are agriculture which is being intensified mazzotti 2005 and wastewater that is re injected into the aquifer krekeler et al 2007 2 1 weather the climate is tropical warm sub humid with rainfall averaging 1200 mm per year veleva et al 1997 the geological conditions of the peninsula limit somehow the availability of water for both human consumption and agricultural production gelting 1995 the predominant climate in the state of campeche is warm sub humid with rainfall during summer classified as aw0 according to köppen climatic classification modified by garcía 1973 temperatures are normally stable and high with the hottest months being may and june and the coolest being december and january the average annual temperature is 26 8 c with the highest average temperature in may 29 6 c and the lowest average temperature in january 23 2 c the average annual rainfall is 1099 mm but is irregularly distributed in time between june and november frequent and high intensity rainfall occurs the rainy season in contrast february to april is the dry drought season a period having the lowest rainfall and highest temperatures fig 1 shows the seasonal distribution of rain in the study zone during the experiment period 2 2 geographic location the first experiment was performed from july to december 2015 on a field plot provided by cooperating producers in the community of bethania 19 53 24 n 90 21 16 4 w at 9 masl the second experiment was conducted during january to may 2016 in the community of chemblás 19 55 13 5 n 90 20 29 7 w at 8 masl 2 3 plant material the principal varieties of habanero chilies most frequently planted in the state of campeche are jaguar calakmul naranja and the chichen itzá hybrid this hybrid was used in the present study 2 4 soil type and land preparation soil and subsoil are highly permeable so that rainwater infiltrates quickly into the subsoil and therefore there are no rivers or streams in the northern of the peninsula the landscape is divided in multiple and little watersheds which include some different soil types the cambisols nitisols and luvisols being the main cultivated ones villalobos zapata and mendoza 2010 in both experiments the soil was a chromic luvisol with a clay loam texture and a bulk density between 1 2 and 1 25 g cm 3 despite of having a clay loam texture the hydraulic conductivity of the soil is high as the water quickly infiltrates into the soil profile the field was prepared for planting in june 2015 for the first experiment and in december 2015 for the second experiment in both cases this consisted of cross plowing fallow fields with the final furrows having a distance between them of 1 8 m 2 5 transplantation transplantation was performed after plantlets had presented the fifth true leaf about 45 days after their sowing in trays with cavities having one plantlet each at the beginning of july 2015 for the first experiment and on january 6 2016 for the second experiment plantlets transplanted were placed directly into the furrows with a distance of 60 cm between them and 1 8 m between furrows 2 6 anti insect micro mesh agribón once transplantation was completed anti insect micro mesh was used to protect the plants from insect pests especially sweet potato whitefly bemisia tabaci gennadius and to permit better plant development such micro mesh is commonly used by chili producers in the yucatán peninsula to protect plants during early stages of crop development and is removed when it begins to constitute a physical barrier to plant growth about a month and a half after transplantation subsequently the plants were exposed naturally to pests for the experiments during the rainy season the micro mesh was withdrawn at the end of august 2015 and for the dry season at the end of february 2016 2 7 crop labor the products and doses applied for soil fertilization and control of pests and diseases were the same in both experiments based on the technology for cultivating habanero chilies developed by the instituto tecnológico agropecuario de conkal yucatán conkal agricultural technology institute soria fregoso et al 2002 2 7 1 fertilization fertilizers were used in split applications at different stages of the crop 2 7 2 pest and disease control the presence of pests and diseases was monitored during both experiments the main pests present in the crops for both experiments were the chilean weevil athonomus eugenii cano and the sweet potato white fly bemisia tabaci although during the rainy season in 2015 their incidences were low during the dry season in 2016 the incidence of pests mainly sweet potato white fly a vector of plant viruses was much greater compared to the first experiment due to favorable conditions for their reproduction higher temperatures lower rainfall and lower relative humidity their incidence produced the expression of plant viral disease after removal of the micro mesh which resulted in flower fall reduction in size and number of fruits and shortened the reproductive period significantly affecting crop yield 2 7 3 weed control weeds were removed using a hoe 2 7 4 early plant guidance and strengthening to keep the plants erect rods were installed every two meters and connected with raffia palm fibers to support the plants thus producing a line of connected stakes along each furrow as the plants grew the horizontal fibers were used as vertical growth support 2 7 5 irrigation a drip irrigation system was used with a single tape t tape caliber 0 6 mm per furrow with drip points every 20 centimeters and a water flow application of 800 ml per drip point per hour the irrigation system also was used for application of diluted fertilizers in the water the water for irrigating the crop for both experimental works was extracted from wells whose groundwater depth is about 4 m below the soil surface during the rainy season which descends to about 7 m during the drought season because the amount of water extracted to irrigate the crop was relatively small considering that a drip irrigation system was used the variation of the water table depth due to the extraction of water for irrigation was small barely perceptible from one day to the next one the elevation of the soil surface is between 7 and 9 m above sea level in the two plots used so the current use of irrigation water extracted from the aquifer can be considered within the manageable range to avoid excessive extraction of groundwater 2 8 experimental design and treatments different values of soil moisture tension were used in order to define the beginning of irrigation in a similar way to the works of alamilla magaña et al 2016 carrillo ávila et al 2015 mahajan et al 2012 rivera hernández et al 2010 rivera hernández et al 2009 sudhir yadav et al 2011 and wang et al 2007 values of 10 40 and 70 kpa for soil moisture tension were tested as indicators for initiating irrigation during growth flowering and fruiting and were considered as treatments including irrigation management by the producers as a control a completely randomized experimental design with three replicates was used treatments were randomly assigned to the experimental units which consisted of three 10 m long furrows irrigation was initiated when the value for soil moisture tension reached the designated values for each treatment measured almost daily see fig 2 with irrometer model r tensiometers whose porous capsules were installed at 30 cm soil depth directly below the drip tapes individual valves at the beginning of each drip tape were used to control the irrigation rate in each experimental unit irrigation was maintained until the soil moisture tension returned to a value close to zero saturated soil as far as possible because the irrigation water quickly infiltrated the profile without completely saturating all the porous space to determine the volume of water applied in each irrigation the flow rate of the emitters measured in five emitters per furrow distributed from the beginning to the end of the furrows was first quantified to measure flow rate containers of known volume were placed under each emitter and the time for them to be filled was recorded the flow of the emitter was obtained by dividing the volume of the container between the filling time the time of each irrigation was recorded and the volume of water applied in each irrigation was calculated by multiplying the average flow rate of the emitters by the number of emitters per furrow and by the time spent in each irrigation applied with which an estimation of the irrigation water depth for each treatment was obtained 2 9 response variables in the two experiments during the fruiting phase the number nfp and fresh weight of fruits per plant fwp in each harvest were recorded from six plants selected randomly from each experimental unit a random sample of 20 of the fruits harvested was taken to measure their length fl and diameter fd with the fwp data of all the harvest and the number of plants per hectare crop yield expressed in fresh weight of fruits for each treatment was estimated 2 10 water use efficiency wue for each treatment and experiment the following equations were applied alamilla magaña et al

sas statistical analysis system 2003 in cases where significant treatment effects were found a means comparison test was performed using least significant difference comparisons among treatments tukey 1991 with a significance level of α 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil moisture tension changes to illustrate the manner in which treatments were applied changes in soil moisture tension in replication 2 for the first experiment above slightly more than a month and in replication 1 for the second below slightly less than a month are illustrated in fig 2 in both cases in the 10 kpa treatment more humid more irrigation water was applied than in the other two treatments with the least irrigation in the driest treatment 70 kpa during the first experiment total rainfall from july to december 2015 was 582 5 mm and soil moisture tension almost never reached values below 70 kpa due to frequent rainfall although some irrigation was necessary producers applied irrigations on a near daily basis without any criteria this was reason why the number of hours of irrigation was almost double the number of hours in the humid treatment 10 kpa and almost seven times greater than in the 70 kpa treatment fig 3 a similar trend was observed for crop irrigation producers applied 188 more irrigation water than that applied to the 10 kpa treatment and 682 more water than in the 70 kpa treatment the common practice of producers irrigating almost every day except for days with abundant rain is reflected in an excessive application of water during the first experiment which did not result in an increased crop yield for the second experiment during the dry season from january to may 2016 there was only 123 mm of rainfall due to higher temperatures and low rainfall the values for soil moisture tension increased more rapidly each day fig 2 such that in some cases the soil moisture tension exceeded values for each treatment as a consequence of less rainfall the irrigation hours and the amount of water applied had less variation among irrigation treatments fig 3 although irrigation time and amount of water applied was greater under the producer management where almost daily irrigations were applied without any criteria concerning crop demand producer irrigation in both experiments was superior to that applied in the wettest treatment 10 kpa a value associated with soil moisture close to saturation 3 2 growth and yield the mean values for the growth variables and their statistical comparisons are shown in table 1 for the rainy above and dry seasons below in the first experiment no statistically significant differences were found for most of the variables except for fruit length fl for which significantly greater values were obtained in the wettest treatment 10 kpa the general absence of treatment effects is attributed to the large amount of rainwater during this experiment 582 5 mm which masked most effects however the use of tensiometers to indicate the beginning of irrigation allowed to substantially reduce the amount of irrigation water in relation to the irrigation depth applied by the producers which did not affect growth or crop yield although during this season no statistical differences were found for nearly every variable all had higher values in the 10 kpa treatment and declined as soil moisture tension increased table 1 during the dry season the values for crop yield in all cases were significantly lower than those for the rainy season table 1 despite of applying irrigation and following the same agronomic management both plots were established at open field conditions and the incidence of pests especially sweet potato white fly bemisia tabaci was much higher during the dry season the infestation presented serious problems of viral infection which reduced the life cycle of the crop increased early flower drop reduced size and weight of fruits and consequently crop yield was reduced with the result that during this season only four chili harvests were carried out however given the observed damages that occurred in all treatments the differences obtained in the variables evaluated can still be attributed to the treatments and consequently the conclusions obtained are still applicable unlike the rainy season there was infrequent light precipitation during the dry season fig 1 which did not mask the effects of irrigation treatments providing statistically higher values for the 10 kpa treatment and for producer management of irrigation control leading to increased number and weight of chilies per plant and crop yield however no effects of treatments were detected on chili length or diameter table 1 3 2 1 number of fruits chilies per plant nfp no statistical differences were found between treatments for nfp during the rainy season although higher values were observed at lower levels of soil moisture tension results similar to those found during the rainy season were reported by borges et al 2010 who evaluated different moisture and nutrient conditions for habanero chilies their results indicated that in general the yield of capsicum declines if nutrition or soil moisture are reduced the highest reported yields were in soils where a high dose of n p2o5 and k2o was applied and with a greater availability of water in the soil during the dry season a significantly lower number of fruits were produced in all treatments due as already mentioned to the high incidence of pests and diseases statistical differences also were found among treatments with the highest mean value in the 10 kpa treatment significantly higher than those obtained in the 40 kpa and 70 kpa treatments but statistically similar to the control during the two evaluated seasons the mean number of fruits tended to be higher with lower soil moisture tension table 1 3 2 2 fruit fresh weight per plant fwp no statistical differences were found in the first experiment although the values obtained declined as soil moisture tension increased with a higher mean weight in the 10 kpa treatment table 1 the values obtained for this season are lower than those reported by quintal et al 2012 who obtained on average 4 9 6 4 kg of fresh fruit per plant from the lowest to highest percentage of irrigation water applied to the crop during the dry season fwp was very low in all treatments including the producer plot control although there were statistical differences between treatments a significantly higher mean was obtained in the 10 kpa treatment which was statistically similar to the value obtained with producer irrigation management control but significantly different from the lower values for the 40 and 70 kpa treatments table 1 3 2 3 yield there were no statistically significant differences among treatments for the first experiment although a decline was observed with increasing soil moisture tension table 1 the yield obtained with the 10 kpa treatment was almost identical to that obtained with producer irrigation management which used a total of 164 h of irrigation on their plot whereas for the 10 kpa treatment only 87 h of irrigation were applied throughout the experiment fig 3 during the second experiment a significantly higher yield was obtained for the wettest treatment 10 kpa followed by the control table 1 similar to mean fruit fresh weight per plant significantly lower values were found for the 40 and 70 kpa treatments with the lowest value 7 59 t ha 1 for the 40 kpa treatment these results are much lower than those obtained during the rainy season which is attributed as already mentioned to the high incidence of pests and diseases at this time during this season producers also applied more water than that applied to the three soil moisture tension treatments the irrigation depth for the 10 40 and 70 kpa treatments were 84 61 and 44 of the irrigation depths applied by the producers even though their yield was less than that for the 10 kpa treatment these results and those obtained for the first experiment stress the need for producers to adopt technology to better manage plot irrigation especially to help them to determine the best moment to initiate irrigation and to define the amount of water that is to be applied 3 2 4 fruit diameter fd no statistically significant effects were found in either experiment although larger values were obtained with lower soil moisture tension table 1 and with slightly higher values in the first experiment the values obtained in both experiments were higher than those reported by tocuch et al 2011 who obtained a range of mean values from 2 43 to 2 54 cm for habanero chilies cultivated with different nitrate ammonium ratios and from 2 3 to 2 5 cm when cultivated in substrates having different particle sizes of tezontle a porous and highly oxidized volcanic rock due to its high levels of iron oxide 3 2 5 fruit length fl this was the only variable during the rainy season for which treatments induced statistically significant differences with higher values observed in the 10 and 40 kpa treatments table 1 during the dry season there were no statistically significant differences with values slightly lower than those obtained during the rainy season 3 3 water use efficiency wue fig 4 shows the estimated values for the irrigation water use efficiency iwue and total water use efficiency twue for the two experiments during the dry season rainfall was only 123 4 mm consequently the irrigation depth for the different treatments increased fig 3 thus because crop yield was much lower the iwue values were much lower in the second experiment although in both experiments the highest values were obtained in the 70 kpa treatment and the significantly lower values with producer management fig 4 due to the greater irrigation depth that did not promote a higher yield on the other hand the reduced yield also affected the twue values in the second experiment which declined in all treatments compared to those obtained for the rainy season during the second experiment the largest value for twue also was observed in the 70 kpa treatment and the lowest in the control producer irrigation management although in this variable no statistical differences were observed between any treatment fig 4 in the control for every millimeter of water applied to the crop irrigation plus rain 23 kg of chilies were obtained and for each millimeter of irrigation water 33 kg of chilies were obtained in the 70 kpa treatment for each millimeter of water applied to the crop irrigation plus rain 33 kg of chilies were harvested and for each millimeter of irrigation water applied 62 kg of chilies were harvested almost twice than that obtained in the control yet in the 10 kpa treatment for which a significantly greater yield was obtained values for iwue and twue were slightly lower than those obtained with the 70 kpa although statistically the two treatments were equal in these variables in this case for every millimeter of water provided irrigation plus rain 30 kg of chilies were harvested and 45 kg of chilies were harvested for each millimeter of irrigation water used in 2016 a similar trend for iwue and twue where higher values were recorded for drier irrigation treatments has also been observed for other crops alamilla magaña et al 2016 this and can be explained by the fact that plants try to make the most of available water when there is shortage of it in the soil these results make evident the need to improve crop water management by producers to make it more sustainable and to avoid a non efficient water management at plot level thus reducing pollution contamination generated by the leaching of agrochemicals 3 4 virtual water the values for both experiments are shown in fig 5 during the dry season they were substantially higher because crop yield was significantly lower i e between 3 8 and 5 8 times lower than that obtained during the rainy season in both experiments the highest values for vw occurred with the controls significantly higher than the value obtained in the 40 kpa treatment in 2015 although statistically equal to the values obtained for irrigation treatments in 2016 in the control 209 and 427 l of water for the rainy and dry seasons were required respectively to produce one kilogram of chilies the lowest values for vw in 2015 rainy season occurred in the 40 kpa and 70 kpa treatments where it was necessary to apply 148 and 154 l of water to obtain the same result respectively for 2016 dry season the lowest values for vw were observed in the 10 kpa and 70 kpa treatments although statistically equal to the other treatments fig 5 the water volume used in the 70 kpa treatment represent approximately 70 of the water volume used in producer irrigation management without significantly reducing crop yield table 1 these results complement those obtained when calculating twue and underline the need to improve agricultural management of irrigation water by producers to increase its sustainability on the other hand the obtained results contrast with those found in other studies where virtual water was assessed in other crops bulsink et al 2010 found in indonesia virtual water values of 514 22907 9414 3474 1958 and 2483 m3 t 1 0 514 22 907 9 414 3 474 1 958 and 2 483 m3 kg 1 for cassava coffe cocoa rice soybeans and maize respectively these are much greater values than those obtained herein although the authors do not specify if the values were calculated on a dry or fresh basis aldaya and hoekstra 2010 reported values of 748 and 114 m3 t 1 0 748 and 0 114 m3 kg 1 for wheat and tomato production in italy calculated in dry and fresh basis respectively and morillo et al 2015 found vw average values of only 70 m3t 1 0 070 m3 kg 1 for strawberries in spain calculated apparently on a fresh basis since the authors do not clearly indicate such details these data are closer but also lower than the values found in this work for habanero chilies calculated on a fresh basis lovarelli et al 2016 indicated that differences in soil type irrigation systems climate protected or unprotected crop systems yield and farming systems are the cause of variations in virtual water values fig 6 shows the trends for the gvw and bvw for the irrigation treatments and controls producer irrigation water management in both experiments given the decomposition of vw into gvw and bvw it is clear that producers use the irrigation water inefficiently out of the 209 l applied by producers to the crop during the rainy season to obtain one kg of fruit 128 l were contributed by rain and 81 by the irrigation system in contrast in the 40 kpa treatment for the same season an amount of 148 l of water was required to produce one kg of chilies of this volume 132 l came from rain 89 green water and only 16 were from irrigation 11 blue water representing only about 20 of the irrigation water applied by producers during the first experiment during the second experiment the contribution of rain to vw was much lower with gvw representing from 39 control producer management to 88 70 kpa treatment of bvw in the control 120 l of rainwater and 307 l of irrigation water were required to produce one kg of chilies while for the 70 kpa treatment 143 l of rainwater 47 green and only 162 l of irrigation water 53 blue were required for the 10 kpa treatment which produced the greatest fruit yield during the dry season 104 l of rainwater 32 green and 224 l of irrigation water 68 blue were required to obtain the same result the results obtained from both experiments again underscore the need for producers to adopt technologies to improve the management of water in their plots when comparing the results obtained herein with those reported in other studies regarding the decomposition of vw into gvw and bvw such values seem to be rather questionable since this decomposition depends basically on climate although the irrigation systems soil fertility farming systems and agricultural techniques used for crop production are also factors that affect this decomposition bulsink et al 2010 found in indonesia that in rice and coffe production vw is composed in 73 and 96 of gvw respectively aldaya and hoekstra 2010 analysed italian industrial tomato production and reported that in their study vw is composed by a 30 of gvw chapagain and hoekstra 2010 for rice production in the 13 most important producing countries found that vw is composed of 48 of gvw dalin et al 2017 estimated the volume of groundwater depletion gwd embedded in the world s food production and international food trade these authors defined gwd as the volume of groundwater that is extracted for irrigation use in excess of the natural recharge rate and irrigation return flow and they calculated a groundwater stress index for the entire world where a value greater than one correspond to zones with groundwater overexploited in our case since the volume of groundwater extracted for irrigating habanero chilies in the yucatán peninsula is still smaller than the natural recharge rate the groundwater stress index is lower than one semarnat 2010 dalin et al 2017 however a fast growth of agricultural production in the peninsula is taking place mazzotti 2005 in particular the cultivated surfaces of habanero chili siap 2016 this trend is due to the growing demand for habanero chilie fruits on the international market thus agricultural water management alternatives to increase water use efficiency and reduce virtual water embedded in the chilie fruits are needed so as to avoid in the near future problems of aquifer depletion and saline intrusion the alternative presented in this work is focused on the issues mentioned before our results can be used in other virtual water trade studies to estimate the international trade of virtual water embedded in the fresh fruits of habanero chilies whose commercialization at international level is increasing however precautions should be taken when interpreting our results obtained for the dry season as a consequence of the damages suffered by the crop in this season due to the incidence of pests and diseases 4 conclusions in our work an estimation of the green and blue virtual water content embedded in the habanero chili production in campeche mexico was made in two different climatic conditions rainy and dry seasons respectively although in the first experiment the interference of the rainy periods masked somehow the effect of the irrigation treatments without obtaining yield differences a different amount of irrigation water was applied in the different treatments this difference in irrigation water applied led to a statistically significant differences in the irrigation water use efficiency and virtual water contents total virtual water content and blue virtual water content that is the significantly highest irrigation water use efficiencies were obtained when the irrigation water was applied to the crop at soil moisture tensions of 40 kpa and 70 kpa also in the 40 kpa treatment a significantly lower virtual water content in chili fruits was obtained in comparison to the value measured with the producer irrigation management this single conclusion implies a positive result even if no statistical differences in crop yield were found and even more important when the virtual water was divided into green and blue it was observed that during the rainy season the producers applied 80 l of irrigation water to produce one kilogram of fruit while in the 70 kpa treatment only 13 l were needed to obtain the same result which is a very significant finding this represents a reduction in irrigation water use by almost 84 a very important result to be highly recommended to reduce the extraction of irrigation water from aquifers and improve the sustainability of this resource concerning the second experiment significant higher values were recorded for crop yield and the number and weight of fruits per plant in the 10 kpa treatment statistically equal to those obtained by the producer a significantly highest irrigation water use efficiency in relation to the producer s irrigation water management was observed in the 70 kpa treatments a significant higher green virtual water content in chili fruits was observed in the 40 kpa treatment although statistically equal to that obtained in the 70 kpa treatment however the highest blue virtual water and the lowest irrigation water use efficiency values were observed with the producer irrigation management in both cases with values significantly equal to those obtained in 10 kpa and 40 kpa treatments all these results are of great interest to make a very valuable contribution towards a more sustainable use of irrigation water in habanero chili production based on this experimental work it can be stated that the regional producers of habanero chilies are currently practicing a non efficient agricultural water management and consequently there is a need for producers in campeche méxico to increase the water use efficiency and to reduce the blue virtual water content embedded in the fruits of habanero chilies which no doubt may result in a more sustainable water management for this the use of tensiometers as indicators of the beginning of the irrigations can be a good alternative to be implemented at commercial scale acknowledgements to the president of the chile product system sisproch

11439,closed surface depressions also known as potholes play an important role in the hydrologic cycle and provide multiple environmental services including flood mitigation water quality improvements and wildlife habitat in the prairie pothole region which covers approximately 715 000 km2 including parts of three canadian provinces saskatchewan manitoba and alberta and five states in the u s minnesota iowa north and south dakota and montana these potholes are typically farmed and are a dominant feature in the landscape in this study we evaluate the annualized agriculture non point source annagnps model for simulating the inundation behavior of two farmed potholes termed bunny and walnut in prairie pothole region ppr of iowa performance analysis considered the entire growing season gs corresponding to the span in which there was observed data and only days in which water storage ws was observed results show that annagnps predicted pothole water depth acceptably but not pothole water volume because of the model s inability to accurately represent the depth volume relationship of a pothole when calibrated to depth nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were 0 77 and 0 24 in the walnut pothole and 0 56 and 0 30 in the bunny pothole for the gs calibration and validation periods respectively our results demonstrate that the annagnps model can be used to predict the inundation depth of drained and farmed potholes which is useful for assessing landscape impacts of these features appropriate applications of this model could include impact of inundation on crop yield or simulations of alternative farm management strategies to compare water delivery to the potholes keywords annagnps closed depressions hydrology potholes prairie pothole region drained wetlands 1 introduction closed surface depressions often called potholes are a dominant landscape feature in areas where they occur with unique hydrologic signatures potholes are hydrologically closed topographic depressions formed in recently glaciated landscapes extending from canada to the united states miller et al 2012 a region known as the prairie pothole region ppr these can vary in size from fraction of a hectare to several hectares and are mostly shallow in depth 0 3 m to 1 5m these morphological characteristics made these features drainable and farmable sloan 1972 in the highly agricultural regions in which they are found most potholes are under agricultural management even though they have been shown to accumulate and retain water during the growing season logsdon 2015 roth and capel 2012 these potholes are classified as palustrine wetlands or wetlands with a small watershed wetland area ratio in iowa an estimated 94 of potholes have been significantly altered by the installation of drainage systems miller et al 2012 a factor in iowa s significant contribution of high nitrogen contributions to the gulf of mexico singh et al 2007 despite the preponderance of these features in iowa and other parts of the ppr relatively little is known about the hydrologic function of these farmed potholes schilling and dinsmore 2018 the ecosystem services provided by potholes have been investigated by numerous researchers de leon and smith 1999 euliss and mushet 1999 however the literature mostly explores the behavior of potholes in their natural state as seasonal wetlands as noted above most of the potholes in agriculturally intense regions have been significantly altered by decades of cultivation and in many cases by the addition of subsurface drainage however it has been observed that even with artificial drainage potholes flood periodically leading them to be classified as ephemeral wetlands serrano 2015 futhermore there is evidence showing that these features do play a role in local ecosystems murphy and dinsmore 2015 investigated the diversity and abundance of waterbirds in drained farmed wetlands during spring migration during the 4 year study they sampled 1913 unique wetlands and tallied 14 968 individuals of 53 waterbird species euliss and mushet 1999 evaluated the influence of intensive agriculture on invertebrate communities of temporary wetlands and found that prairie pothole wetlands have been negatively impacted by human activities questions remain about the role that these features play in overall watershed and ecosystem function the shape of potholes small and shallow with irregular geometry combined with their lack of a readily defined outlet makes their hydrology complex and challenging liu and schwartz 2011 in the absence of observed data on the hydrology of farmed potholes watershed models are an alternative to study these features this type of model is a useful tool in assessment of current conditions as well as in conservation planning of potholes rebelo et al 2015 however few watershed models have been evaluated for their ability to simulate the hydrologic behavior hydroperiod and water level rise and fall of pothole features particularly those that are farmed and drained werner et al 2016 studied the impact of tile drainage on a seasonal wetland basin in south dakota using the wetlandscape model simulations indicate that the placement of tile drains within the wetland watershed could significantly affect hydrologic function hydroperiod mean depth however no field data was available to evaluate these simulations evenson et al 2016 used a modified swat model to represents the watershed scale hydrologic effects of geographically isolated wetlands giws in north dakota these simulation results indicated that the modified model replicates streamflow with very good predictive power and an acceptable degree of uncertainty but the scale of this model makes it not appropriate for in field evaluation of potholes amado et al 2016 developed a fully integrated physically based model based on hydrogeosphere of a drained and farmed wetland complex in the prairie pothole region of iowa to investigate their hydrologic connectivity tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 coupled swat with a puddle delineation pd algorithm to evaluate the impact of depressions on the hydrologic modeling of watersheds in north dakota and found that at the hru scale surface runoff initiation was significantly delayed due to the threshold control of depressions finally tangen and finocchiaro 2017 recently used a catchment water balance model to assess the potential effect of subsurface drainage on wetland hydrology and to assess the efficacy of drainage setbacks for mitigating these effects results suggest that overland precipitation runoff is an important component of the seasonal water balance of prairie pothole region wetlands accounting on average for 34 or 45 of the annual or seasonal input volumes respectively most of these previous studies were conducted at the watershed scale rather than simulating the pothole wetland the wetlands are merely included in the watershed area partly due to inability of models to represent the potholes accurately and also due to lack of data on hydroperiods and water level rise and fall of individual potholes the hydrogeosphere study amado et al 2016 in contrast simulated pothole hydrology at a small scale but the complexity of this model makes it less practical for widespread application than a simpler model empirical approaches have also been used but for identification of potholes in the landscape rather than assessing hydrology wu and lane 2017 used high resolution lidar data and aerial imagery to develop a semi automated framework for identifying nested hierarchical wetland depressions and delineating their corresponding catchments for improving overland flow simulation and hydrologic connectivity analysis previous remote sensing based work on the hydrology of prairie wetlands mainly focused on mapping wetland inundation areas huang et al 2014 vanderhoof et al 2017 or wetland depressions mccauley and anteau 2014 wu and lane 2016 thus there is still a lack of demonstrated simulation of pothole wetland inundation patterns many existing watershed models are not suitable for pothole simulation because in preparation of the topography data they will fill the depressions to guarantee that runoff will flow from upper to lower areas in the watershed another challenge is that potholes are typically fairly small and shallow and many hydrology models are lumped and not suited for the study of small size features such as these therefore there is a call for treating prairie wetlands and catchments as highly integrated hydrological units because the existence of prairie wetlands depends on lateral inputs of runoff water from their catchments in addition to direct precipitation hayashi et al 2016 wu and lane 2017 one model that may be appropriate for this type of investigation is the annualized agriculture non point source annagnps model it is a watershed scale continuous simulation daily time step model annagnps model has a gis based wetland component known as agwet which can be used for identifying and characterizing topographic depressions puddles potholes during dem preprocessing and potential wetland sites can be the first stage in generating watershed wide management plans momm et al 2016 annagnps is well suited to small scale watersheds and is able to produce satisfactory results for the midwestern united states yuan et al 2011 and is relatively straightforward to implement here we assume that the pothole could be simulated as a small wetland to our knowledge this model has not been evaluated for its ability to simulate the inundation of potholes thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the annagnps model for simulating the inundation behavior of drained farmed potholes in prairie pothole region ppr of iowa specifically we attempted to simulate the occurrence depth and duration of ponding in two potholes within a farm field in central iowa usa 2 methods 2 1 site description two potholes located in a single conventional farm field straddling adjacent hydrologic unit code huc 12 watersheds in the prairie pothole region of iowa known as the des moines lobe just outside of ames ia were monitored for water level as described below the pothole positions in relation to the walnut creek and worrell creek huc 12 watersheds are presented in fig 1 the field is managed in a corn soybean rotation with conventional tillage detailed records of the management schedule at this site were not available so we assumed a typical schedule for story county iowa in which the site is located table 1 gives the land management schedule we assumed for this project spanning a total period of two years according to the usda nrcs soil survey the field is 10 okoboji silt clay loam 25 nicollet loam 7 harps clay loam 3 webster clay loam 9 clarion loam 25 canisteo clay loam and 21 clarion loam usda nrcs 2014 except for the clarion and nicollet series the soils are classified as hydric these soils are formed in saturated conditions and could support wetland vegetation species when not drained relevant properties for each soil type are presented in table 2 the potholes which are located in two different huc 12 watersheds fig 1 have different drainage areas and depression volumes and thus the potential to receive and store different volumes of water the pothole in the worrell creek watershed is referred to as bunny and is classified as a second level puddle it is composed of two depressions with a common outlet chu 2015 which are distinct but merge with sufficient inundation the locations of the subsurface drainage lines are largely unknown except where they connect to the surface inlets bunny has two surface inlets connected to the drainage system in the west portion of the pothole the eastern depression in the pothole does not have a surface inlet the pothole located in the walnut creek watershed is referred to as walnut and has a single surface inlet fig 1 2 2 observed data during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 a pressure transducer was installed at the bottom of each pothole fig 1 and the depth of ponded water was derived from the hourly transducer data logsdon 2015 transducers were installed after planting and removed just prior to harvest the water depth was monitored for 85 days 12th june to 4th september in 2010 and 121 days 8th june to 6th october in 2011 in the walnut pothole and 86 days 11th june to 4th september in 2010 and 121 days 8th june to 6th october in 2011 in the bunny pothole additionally the water depth was monitored for 143 days 20th may to 9th october in 2016 in both the potholes however the 2016 data for walnut is not included in this study because additional subsurface drainage was added beneath this pothole in 2015 such that we would not expect the pothole s hydrologic response to be the same as in 2010 11 in order to compare the observed data to the model output which is generated for the end of each simulated day the last hourly record in the observed data was considered to be the water depth for that day depth volume relationships for each pothole were developed from the site topography data in order to translate the observed depth data into estimates of pothole water volume a high resolution digital elevation model dem of the site was generated from light detection and ranging lidar data available from the iowa lidar consortium available at archive http geotree2 geog uni edu lidar the raw data in point cloud format at 1 4 m average bare earth data spacing were in a laser file format las containing x and y coordinates utm zone 15n nad83 orthometric elevation z nadv88 return level 1 2 or 12 and intensity 0 255 the dem was generated according the procedures proposed by gelder gelder 2015 using arcgis 10 4 1 esri 2016 to delineate the pothole extent in the dem we identified depressional areas using the fill tool in arcgis which identifies depressions in the surface and fills them to facilitate delineation of basins and streams pothole extents were then estimated by subtracting the filled dem from the original dem the result of this subtraction is a layer of only the filled areas which we assumed were potholes confirmed with a visual check of the results pothole volume and surface area were computed for each 0 1 m rise in elevation from the bottom lowest elevation of each pothole respectively maximum depth volume and flooded area for each pothole are given in table 3 the area and volume data presented for the bunny pothole is for the union of both depressions together we assumed that the water surface elevation was the same for both depressions in this pothole when the measured water depths was below the elevation of the bottom of the shallower depression the depth volume relationships for the deeper depression was used when the measured depth was above the bottom elevation of the shallower depression volumes for the two depressions were combined based on common elevation intervals of 0 1 m 2 3 annagnps model setup we used the annagnps model version 5 44 annagnps is a watershed scale continuous simulation daily time step model designed to simulate water movement and non point source pollution from agricultural watersheds bingner et al 2015 as such it includes a hydrology component surface and near surface runoff is simulated based on the scs curve number cn method for runoff depth and the extended tr 55 procedure for peak flow rate bosch et al 1998 in the model a user specific cn is an input parameter and the model modifies those cns on a daily basis during the running of the model based on tillage operations soil moisture content and crop stage for purposes of runoff generation and soil water storage the soil profile is divided into two layers the top 200 mm are used as a tillage layer whose properties can change bulk density etc the remaining soil profile comprises the second layer whose properties remain static a daily soil moisture water budget considers applied water rainfall irrigation and snow melt runoff evapotranspiration and percolation bosch et al 1998 actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 and soil moisture content when there is standing water in the wetland et is handled using the potential et and when there is no water in the wetland then et is handled as the amount coming from the soil of the cell the model also considers precipitation to the wetland as a primary water source preliminary water quality sampling serrano 2015 indicated relatively high sediment and phosphorus concentrations paired with relatively low nitrate concentrations suggesting these potholes were predominantly filled by overland flow rather than by a rising water table or in the pothole with surface inlets backflow from the tile drainage system amado et al 2016 also determined that their study potholes were primarily filled by surface flow rather than water table rise this suggests that the cn approach is appropriate for modeling the hydrology of the potholes as it estimates surface and shallow subsurface runoff the first step is to assess the watershed topography of the drainage area for each pothole to generate the hydrological units or cells and the reaches between cells annagnps considers the cells to be independent units where generated runoff will load into the reaches a conceptual map of the cell and reach framework of annagnps is shown in fig 2 development of the cells and reaches is automated through the topographic parameterization program topaz within annagnps as in most watershed models topaz will fill surface depressions in the dem however in this study all the load generated by the cells is delivered into the pothole as the wetland feature is the outlet of the last reach of the pothole watershed the runoff generated from all the cells in a microwatershed will contribute to the potholes and therefore we treated each pothole as a subwatershed outlet that can be represented by a wetland the advanced wetland technology agwet agnps wetland feature within annagnps is used to characterize the pothole in a microwatershed momm et al 2016 after the cells were generated they were populated with soil management and weather information the precipitation data is downloaded from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism datasets prism climate group gathers climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks applies sophisticated quality control measures and develops spatial climate datasets which can be downloaded at any point location or in gridded format for larger areas the other weather parameters maximum temperature minimum temperature dew point temperature wind velocity wind direction and solar radiation data is obtained from the sustaining the earth s watersheds agricultural research data system stewards project which provides access to soil water climate land management and socio economic data from fourteen watersheds it is developed by conservation effects assessment project ceap watershed assessment studies was and is supported by united states department of agriculture usda the stewards weather station used in this assessment was located approximately 5 km from the field site the model allows the user to enter the minimum annagnps cell area that will be treated as a homogeneous unit and the minimum reach length for uniform surface flow these mechanisms denoted as critical source area csa and minimum source channel length mscl allow the user to study spatially variable watersheds of various sizes and the number and division of generated cells is determined by the hydrology patterns suggested by the topography for each cell parameter values describing soil land cover and climate are attributed according to input data described below here csa and mscl values were reduced until a detailed stream network was generated suitable csa and mscl values were selected to generate a small number of cells to characterize the area since the entire drainage area of the potholes was under the same management and comparatively little variability is expected the csa selected was 1 ha and the mscl was 10 m because these values correspond to 10 of the default value we use the term microwatersheds to refer to the drainage area of the potholes in this paper the final delineation resulted in microwatersheds with approximately 9 5 and 40 ha of area for walnut and bunny potholes respectively and the generation of 13 cells and 6 reaches for walnut and 52 cells and 22 reaches for bunny annagnps computes runoff percolation evapotranspiration lateral subsurface flow and tile drainage flows separately then updates daily soil moisture estimates using a water balance approach when there is rainfall surface runoff is computed using the cn method cronshey et al 1985 the cn for average conditions cn2 is defined by the user and based on soil moisture conditions the value for dry cn1 and wet cn3 conditions is computed internally by the model as a function of soil moisture content for that day the remaining soil moisture can be lost by evapotranspiration et or be added to soil moisture for the next day computation reference evapotranspiration eto is computed on a daily basis with the penman monteith equation and is then adjusted for crop evapotranspiration et through a crop coefficient procedure allen et al 1998 one limitation of annagnps is that it considers all the load generated in a given day to be delivered to the outlet while this may not be reasonable for larger watersheds given the small scale of the pothole watersheds this may be more consistent with reality das et al 2008 subsurface flow consists of the sum of lateral subsurface flow and tile drain flow this will only be simulated when either an impervious layer or a subsurface tile drainage system is indicated by the user because of the limitation that annagnps assumes surface runoff and subsurface flow produced by the cells will merge before being loaded into the reaches it is not possible to simulate scenarios with artificially drained cells that represent reality since the water load in the potholes would increase instead of decrease to address this limitation we accounted for the amount of water that is flowing out of the pothole by increasing the infiltration i rate the annagnps wetland component models the pothole as a cuboid pool with a fixed surface area height and weir properties as well as constant infiltration throughout its extent the outflow consists of the water leaving the pothole through a weir going to the downstream reaches the user determines the properties of the weir and its height in relation to the bottom of the pothole according to observed conditions this conceptualization however does not account for common features of farmed potholes such as subsurface drainage systems and surface inlets and a surface area that varies with depth to address the shape limitation we simulated depth and volume variations separately in two different model calibrations 2 4 model parameterization and calibration the parameters adjusted during calibration were the cn which regulates the water load produced by the cells and therefore the load into the potholes and the wetland infiltration rate which influences the rate at which water leaves the system the initial cn considered in the assessment was the straight row crop for poor conditions from there the cn was adjusted upwards evaluation metrics discussed below were computed for the delivery of water to the pothole only and a final calibrated cn was determined based on the best performing cn value once the water load into the potholes was determined by the calibration of the cn then the water retention time was regulated by calibrating the infiltration rate the initial infiltration rate was the default value for loam soils and from there was increased until the model output best matched the drop in observed water depth as the inundation receded because the annagnps representation of potholes assumes that the depth of potholes is linearly related with its volume it is not possible to model both depth and volume variations with a single calibration therefore for the assessment of depth and volume different calibrated values for infiltration rate and cn were determined in the case of the volume based simulation the model output is water depth in the wetland pool simulated depths were converted to simulated volume by multiplying the model depth output by the model wetland area observed depths were converted to observed volume using the lidar based depth volume relationships described above weir height was set as the maximum depth of the potholes weir width and maximum water depth comes into play when the pothole in the model overflows a default value of 10 m was selected for weir width of both the potholes for the depth based simulations wetland area was equivalent to the pothole surface area as determined by using the lidar data for the volume based simulations the area was determined by dividing the lidar derived pothole volume by the maximum water depth table 4 presents model wetland parameters adopted for the calibrations of depth and volume variations in the potholes 2 5 statistical assessment of model performance in the absence of long term records of pothole inundation we used the split sample technique for model calibration and assessment where we divided the observed data collected in 2010 as one part and the data collected in 2011 as another part for the bunny pothole only we also performed leave one out cross validation using 2010 2011 and 2016 data performance analyses were based on two schemes one used the entire growing season gs corresponding to the span in which there was observed data with zero values when there was no inundation the other considered only days in which water storage ws was observed or simulated furthermore we restricted the calibration process to exclude or treat as zero for the gs analysis days when observed or simulated depth was below 0 05 m for non consecutive days we used four evaluation metrics each providing different insights into model performance to evaluate the calibration against the validation data table 5 describes these metrics and their interpretation 3 results 3 1 observed data during the observation period 2010 2011 standing water occurred for 32 days in 2010 and 11 days in 2011 in the walnut pothole and 35 days in 2010 and 14 days in 2011 in the bunny pothole in 2010 there were four to five inundation events whereas in 2011 there were only two these data are also presented in logsdon 2015 in which the walnut and bunny potholes are referred to as south and north respectively during the observation period 2016 standing water occurred for 10 days in the bunny pothole over three events 3 2 volume simulation for the volume simulation calibrated cn values were generally outside the range of published cn values for these land use and soil types and calibrated infiltration rates were very high furthermore the evaluation metrics indicated that the model performance in validation was poor we attempted another calibration approach in which we calibrated distinct cn values for cells inside the pothole extent and those outside the pothole extent and these results were also poor for this reason we conclude that the model is not capable of simulating pothole inundation based on volume the rest of the results will thus focus in greater detail on the depth based simulation 3 3 depth simulation 3 3 1 calibrated cn and infiltration rates the values for the final calibrations of the cn and infiltration according to the depth analysis are illustrated in tables 6 and 7 for the one year and two year calibration respectively for both potholes calibrated values of cn were the same as or close to published values for straight row crop in poor hydrologic condition 81 and 88 for soil groups b and c respectively when 2010 and 2011 were validated against each other calibrated values of infiltration rate were higher at bunny presumably because the observed data reflects the influence of the surface inlets for the two year calibrations at bunny in which the 2016 data were included calibrated infiltration rates were similar or identical to those of the one year calibrations calibrated cn values however varied by which year was left out and did not correspond as well to standard cn values for this land use fig 3 illustrates observed and simulated flooded depth for both potholes for the depth calibration and validation according to pothole properties cn and infiltration values available in tables 4 and 6 respectively 3 3 2 model evaluation tables 8 and 9 show the model evaluation metrics for the various models the two one year calibrations at both walnut and bunny and the three two year calibrations at bunny nash sutcliff efficiency values were higher when the entire observation period gs including all days in which neither the model nor the observations indicated water in the pothole than when the data were restricted to only days in which there was water observed and or simulated ws for the one year calibrations the validation nses were all greater than zero and in some cases greater than 0 5 for gs data using ws data only several nse values were less than zero the differences between the gs and ws results suggest that the model is better able to simulate when there is or is not standing water in the pothole than it is at precisely simulating how deep the standing water is for the two year calibrations at bunny that same trend holds but the nse gs results tend to be lower moriasi et al 2007 suggest nse 0 5 for satisfactory model performance at monthly streamflow simulation while pothole depth and streamflow are quite different using this benchmark we would conclude the model performance is often unsatisfactory at depth simulations when using nse as the metric depending on the calibration and validation data rsr values in validation ranged from 0 42 to 0 87 in the case of rse higher values indicate lesser model performance unlike with nse the rsr ws values were lower and thus more favorable than the rsr gs values using the streamflow recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 that rsr 0 7 is satisfactory and rsr 0 5 is very good we would conclude that when used to simulate non zero inundation depths ws the model performance is very good whereas it is often satisfactory when considering all the data gs pbias values representing a percentage over or underestimation indicate that the model tends to underestimate pothole water depth depending on the calibration and validation data used pbias values were frequently greater in magnitude than the 0 25 recommended for satisfactory model performance and always positive indicating observed values higher than the simulated values using the streamflow modeling criterion we would conclude that the model in general has unsatisfactory underestimation of ponded depth however given the sparser nature of pothole inundation data it is reasonable to use less stringent criteria for determining satisfactory model performance than those for streamflow modeling on the whole we conclude that annagnps has potential in this application but will require further study to determine when and where modeling failure occur some of the reasons for lower model performance are known for one given the interannual variability in precipitation and the very small size of the watersheds being simulated some years generate standing water in the potholes more frequently than others and indeed in some years there may be only one or two occasions where the potholes fill with any observable standing water this makes it difficult to generate a sufficient dataset for model calibration and validation there are also difference between potholes in general the annagnps model gives better performance in the simulation of walnut compared to bunny the probable reason for the better performance in the simulation of walnut pothole is the presence of just one surface inlet which allowed it to be modeled more precisely through infiltration bunny pothole has two surface inlets through which water leaves the pothole another cause might be the size of the microwatersheds and the shape of the potholes walnut microwatershed was smaller than bunny microwatershed and the water load coming to walnut is lower than bunny given the model s tendency to underestimate water depth this underestimation may be more pronounced when the watershed and pothole are larger an example of annagnps performance was assessed in a 45 month simulation in two kansas watersheds annagnps underestimated the extreme runoff generation in comparison to the observed data and another watershed model parajuli et al 2009 this situation was also observed in another study in ontario which investigated the occurrence of high peaks of runoff generation das et al 2008 in this study 2010 was a wet year with recorded rainfall of 1214 mm which is 42 7 more than the average annual rainfall 850 9 mm 1992 2016 given the evidence that annagnps underpredicts runoff under very wet conditions our assessment of the model performance may be complicated by the fact that our dataset particularly ws is dominated by wet conditions because those are the more likely cases for the pothole to fill to a substantial depth in general the model is able to capture the occurrence of ponding as well as the initial depth of ponding in the potholes the model simulated the duration of ponding better than the depth it is likely due to the observed data reflecting the influence of short duration high intensity events whereas the model operates on a daily basis and will assume less intense rainfall events over a 24 h period and potentially divides the rainfalls across multiple days when a single event lasts more than a day taken in total we conclude that annagnps is a useful tool for the determination of inundation and water depth in the potholes but further research is necessary for a better estimation of the runoff generation from the microwatershed 4 conclusions annagnps was capable of simulating inundation of the drained and farmed potholes in this study when comparing model output of ponded depth to observations of the same but was not capable of simulating potholes on a volume basis this suggests that the model may be used for applications such as assessing occurrence of crop failures associated with standing water or investigating agricultural management strategies that would reduce potholes tendency to flood the model cannot however be readily used in applications such as assessing downstream streamflow effects or estimating pollutant loads from spillover or drainage fluxes which rely on accurate estimates of water volumes in such cases water volumes may be estimated by simulating the pothole depth and using terrain data to convert pothole depth to water volume to expand model application to volume based scenarios further development of the annagnps wetland component could include expanded options for wetland or pothole topography so that the depth volume relationship might better represent site characteristics of the pothole this may allow for simultaneous simulation of both depth and volume with a single calibration the variable performance of the model with different calibration data and for different evaluation metrics indicates that longer term datasets will be beneficial in understanding the model s limitations there are a number of factors influencing model performance many of which are areas for further study for example some of our observed data and the work of others eg amado et al 2016 suggests a need to more effectively distinguish between surface runoff and shallow subsurface flow both appear to be influential in filling potholes but the percentages of ponded water deriving from these two pathways with different travel times is not known likewise the role of subsurface drainage and the variability of drainage conditions including extensively drained with multiple surface inlets extensively drained without surface inlets somewhat drained with older drainage lines nearby but perhaps not directly underneath the pothole and not drained at all are largely unknown in terms of their effect on filling and draining the pothole accurately modeling unknown pathways is a significant challenge the role of input data quality including model parameterization as well as driving weather data on model performance and output uncertainty is another area for further study finally further research is needed to expand the simulations to other potholes and in other locations to determine if similar trends are observed funding sources this work was supported by the iowa department of natural resources and the us environmental protection agency 
11439,closed surface depressions also known as potholes play an important role in the hydrologic cycle and provide multiple environmental services including flood mitigation water quality improvements and wildlife habitat in the prairie pothole region which covers approximately 715 000 km2 including parts of three canadian provinces saskatchewan manitoba and alberta and five states in the u s minnesota iowa north and south dakota and montana these potholes are typically farmed and are a dominant feature in the landscape in this study we evaluate the annualized agriculture non point source annagnps model for simulating the inundation behavior of two farmed potholes termed bunny and walnut in prairie pothole region ppr of iowa performance analysis considered the entire growing season gs corresponding to the span in which there was observed data and only days in which water storage ws was observed results show that annagnps predicted pothole water depth acceptably but not pothole water volume because of the model s inability to accurately represent the depth volume relationship of a pothole when calibrated to depth nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values were 0 77 and 0 24 in the walnut pothole and 0 56 and 0 30 in the bunny pothole for the gs calibration and validation periods respectively our results demonstrate that the annagnps model can be used to predict the inundation depth of drained and farmed potholes which is useful for assessing landscape impacts of these features appropriate applications of this model could include impact of inundation on crop yield or simulations of alternative farm management strategies to compare water delivery to the potholes keywords annagnps closed depressions hydrology potholes prairie pothole region drained wetlands 1 introduction closed surface depressions often called potholes are a dominant landscape feature in areas where they occur with unique hydrologic signatures potholes are hydrologically closed topographic depressions formed in recently glaciated landscapes extending from canada to the united states miller et al 2012 a region known as the prairie pothole region ppr these can vary in size from fraction of a hectare to several hectares and are mostly shallow in depth 0 3 m to 1 5m these morphological characteristics made these features drainable and farmable sloan 1972 in the highly agricultural regions in which they are found most potholes are under agricultural management even though they have been shown to accumulate and retain water during the growing season logsdon 2015 roth and capel 2012 these potholes are classified as palustrine wetlands or wetlands with a small watershed wetland area ratio in iowa an estimated 94 of potholes have been significantly altered by the installation of drainage systems miller et al 2012 a factor in iowa s significant contribution of high nitrogen contributions to the gulf of mexico singh et al 2007 despite the preponderance of these features in iowa and other parts of the ppr relatively little is known about the hydrologic function of these farmed potholes schilling and dinsmore 2018 the ecosystem services provided by potholes have been investigated by numerous researchers de leon and smith 1999 euliss and mushet 1999 however the literature mostly explores the behavior of potholes in their natural state as seasonal wetlands as noted above most of the potholes in agriculturally intense regions have been significantly altered by decades of cultivation and in many cases by the addition of subsurface drainage however it has been observed that even with artificial drainage potholes flood periodically leading them to be classified as ephemeral wetlands serrano 2015 futhermore there is evidence showing that these features do play a role in local ecosystems murphy and dinsmore 2015 investigated the diversity and abundance of waterbirds in drained farmed wetlands during spring migration during the 4 year study they sampled 1913 unique wetlands and tallied 14 968 individuals of 53 waterbird species euliss and mushet 1999 evaluated the influence of intensive agriculture on invertebrate communities of temporary wetlands and found that prairie pothole wetlands have been negatively impacted by human activities questions remain about the role that these features play in overall watershed and ecosystem function the shape of potholes small and shallow with irregular geometry combined with their lack of a readily defined outlet makes their hydrology complex and challenging liu and schwartz 2011 in the absence of observed data on the hydrology of farmed potholes watershed models are an alternative to study these features this type of model is a useful tool in assessment of current conditions as well as in conservation planning of potholes rebelo et al 2015 however few watershed models have been evaluated for their ability to simulate the hydrologic behavior hydroperiod and water level rise and fall of pothole features particularly those that are farmed and drained werner et al 2016 studied the impact of tile drainage on a seasonal wetland basin in south dakota using the wetlandscape model simulations indicate that the placement of tile drains within the wetland watershed could significantly affect hydrologic function hydroperiod mean depth however no field data was available to evaluate these simulations evenson et al 2016 used a modified swat model to represents the watershed scale hydrologic effects of geographically isolated wetlands giws in north dakota these simulation results indicated that the modified model replicates streamflow with very good predictive power and an acceptable degree of uncertainty but the scale of this model makes it not appropriate for in field evaluation of potholes amado et al 2016 developed a fully integrated physically based model based on hydrogeosphere of a drained and farmed wetland complex in the prairie pothole region of iowa to investigate their hydrologic connectivity tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 coupled swat with a puddle delineation pd algorithm to evaluate the impact of depressions on the hydrologic modeling of watersheds in north dakota and found that at the hru scale surface runoff initiation was significantly delayed due to the threshold control of depressions finally tangen and finocchiaro 2017 recently used a catchment water balance model to assess the potential effect of subsurface drainage on wetland hydrology and to assess the efficacy of drainage setbacks for mitigating these effects results suggest that overland precipitation runoff is an important component of the seasonal water balance of prairie pothole region wetlands accounting on average for 34 or 45 of the annual or seasonal input volumes respectively most of these previous studies were conducted at the watershed scale rather than simulating the pothole wetland the wetlands are merely included in the watershed area partly due to inability of models to represent the potholes accurately and also due to lack of data on hydroperiods and water level rise and fall of individual potholes the hydrogeosphere study amado et al 2016 in contrast simulated pothole hydrology at a small scale but the complexity of this model makes it less practical for widespread application than a simpler model empirical approaches have also been used but for identification of potholes in the landscape rather than assessing hydrology wu and lane 2017 used high resolution lidar data and aerial imagery to develop a semi automated framework for identifying nested hierarchical wetland depressions and delineating their corresponding catchments for improving overland flow simulation and hydrologic connectivity analysis previous remote sensing based work on the hydrology of prairie wetlands mainly focused on mapping wetland inundation areas huang et al 2014 vanderhoof et al 2017 or wetland depressions mccauley and anteau 2014 wu and lane 2016 thus there is still a lack of demonstrated simulation of pothole wetland inundation patterns many existing watershed models are not suitable for pothole simulation because in preparation of the topography data they will fill the depressions to guarantee that runoff will flow from upper to lower areas in the watershed another challenge is that potholes are typically fairly small and shallow and many hydrology models are lumped and not suited for the study of small size features such as these therefore there is a call for treating prairie wetlands and catchments as highly integrated hydrological units because the existence of prairie wetlands depends on lateral inputs of runoff water from their catchments in addition to direct precipitation hayashi et al 2016 wu and lane 2017 one model that may be appropriate for this type of investigation is the annualized agriculture non point source annagnps model it is a watershed scale continuous simulation daily time step model annagnps model has a gis based wetland component known as agwet which can be used for identifying and characterizing topographic depressions puddles potholes during dem preprocessing and potential wetland sites can be the first stage in generating watershed wide management plans momm et al 2016 annagnps is well suited to small scale watersheds and is able to produce satisfactory results for the midwestern united states yuan et al 2011 and is relatively straightforward to implement here we assume that the pothole could be simulated as a small wetland to our knowledge this model has not been evaluated for its ability to simulate the inundation of potholes thus the objective of this study is to evaluate the annagnps model for simulating the inundation behavior of drained farmed potholes in prairie pothole region ppr of iowa specifically we attempted to simulate the occurrence depth and duration of ponding in two potholes within a farm field in central iowa usa 2 methods 2 1 site description two potholes located in a single conventional farm field straddling adjacent hydrologic unit code huc 12 watersheds in the prairie pothole region of iowa known as the des moines lobe just outside of ames ia were monitored for water level as described below the pothole positions in relation to the walnut creek and worrell creek huc 12 watersheds are presented in fig 1 the field is managed in a corn soybean rotation with conventional tillage detailed records of the management schedule at this site were not available so we assumed a typical schedule for story county iowa in which the site is located table 1 gives the land management schedule we assumed for this project spanning a total period of two years according to the usda nrcs soil survey the field is 10 okoboji silt clay loam 25 nicollet loam 7 harps clay loam 3 webster clay loam 9 clarion loam 25 canisteo clay loam and 21 clarion loam usda nrcs 2014 except for the clarion and nicollet series the soils are classified as hydric these soils are formed in saturated conditions and could support wetland vegetation species when not drained relevant properties for each soil type are presented in table 2 the potholes which are located in two different huc 12 watersheds fig 1 have different drainage areas and depression volumes and thus the potential to receive and store different volumes of water the pothole in the worrell creek watershed is referred to as bunny and is classified as a second level puddle it is composed of two depressions with a common outlet chu 2015 which are distinct but merge with sufficient inundation the locations of the subsurface drainage lines are largely unknown except where they connect to the surface inlets bunny has two surface inlets connected to the drainage system in the west portion of the pothole the eastern depression in the pothole does not have a surface inlet the pothole located in the walnut creek watershed is referred to as walnut and has a single surface inlet fig 1 2 2 observed data during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011 a pressure transducer was installed at the bottom of each pothole fig 1 and the depth of ponded water was derived from the hourly transducer data logsdon 2015 transducers were installed after planting and removed just prior to harvest the water depth was monitored for 85 days 12th june to 4th september in 2010 and 121 days 8th june to 6th october in 2011 in the walnut pothole and 86 days 11th june to 4th september in 2010 and 121 days 8th june to 6th october in 2011 in the bunny pothole additionally the water depth was monitored for 143 days 20th may to 9th october in 2016 in both the potholes however the 2016 data for walnut is not included in this study because additional subsurface drainage was added beneath this pothole in 2015 such that we would not expect the pothole s hydrologic response to be the same as in 2010 11 in order to compare the observed data to the model output which is generated for the end of each simulated day the last hourly record in the observed data was considered to be the water depth for that day depth volume relationships for each pothole were developed from the site topography data in order to translate the observed depth data into estimates of pothole water volume a high resolution digital elevation model dem of the site was generated from light detection and ranging lidar data available from the iowa lidar consortium available at archive http geotree2 geog uni edu lidar the raw data in point cloud format at 1 4 m average bare earth data spacing were in a laser file format las containing x and y coordinates utm zone 15n nad83 orthometric elevation z nadv88 return level 1 2 or 12 and intensity 0 255 the dem was generated according the procedures proposed by gelder gelder 2015 using arcgis 10 4 1 esri 2016 to delineate the pothole extent in the dem we identified depressional areas using the fill tool in arcgis which identifies depressions in the surface and fills them to facilitate delineation of basins and streams pothole extents were then estimated by subtracting the filled dem from the original dem the result of this subtraction is a layer of only the filled areas which we assumed were potholes confirmed with a visual check of the results pothole volume and surface area were computed for each 0 1 m rise in elevation from the bottom lowest elevation of each pothole respectively maximum depth volume and flooded area for each pothole are given in table 3 the area and volume data presented for the bunny pothole is for the union of both depressions together we assumed that the water surface elevation was the same for both depressions in this pothole when the measured water depths was below the elevation of the bottom of the shallower depression the depth volume relationships for the deeper depression was used when the measured depth was above the bottom elevation of the shallower depression volumes for the two depressions were combined based on common elevation intervals of 0 1 m 2 3 annagnps model setup we used the annagnps model version 5 44 annagnps is a watershed scale continuous simulation daily time step model designed to simulate water movement and non point source pollution from agricultural watersheds bingner et al 2015 as such it includes a hydrology component surface and near surface runoff is simulated based on the scs curve number cn method for runoff depth and the extended tr 55 procedure for peak flow rate bosch et al 1998 in the model a user specific cn is an input parameter and the model modifies those cns on a daily basis during the running of the model based on tillage operations soil moisture content and crop stage for purposes of runoff generation and soil water storage the soil profile is divided into two layers the top 200 mm are used as a tillage layer whose properties can change bulk density etc the remaining soil profile comprises the second layer whose properties remain static a daily soil moisture water budget considers applied water rainfall irrigation and snow melt runoff evapotranspiration and percolation bosch et al 1998 actual evapotranspiration is a function of potential evapotranspiration calculated using the penman equation penman 1948 and soil moisture content when there is standing water in the wetland et is handled using the potential et and when there is no water in the wetland then et is handled as the amount coming from the soil of the cell the model also considers precipitation to the wetland as a primary water source preliminary water quality sampling serrano 2015 indicated relatively high sediment and phosphorus concentrations paired with relatively low nitrate concentrations suggesting these potholes were predominantly filled by overland flow rather than by a rising water table or in the pothole with surface inlets backflow from the tile drainage system amado et al 2016 also determined that their study potholes were primarily filled by surface flow rather than water table rise this suggests that the cn approach is appropriate for modeling the hydrology of the potholes as it estimates surface and shallow subsurface runoff the first step is to assess the watershed topography of the drainage area for each pothole to generate the hydrological units or cells and the reaches between cells annagnps considers the cells to be independent units where generated runoff will load into the reaches a conceptual map of the cell and reach framework of annagnps is shown in fig 2 development of the cells and reaches is automated through the topographic parameterization program topaz within annagnps as in most watershed models topaz will fill surface depressions in the dem however in this study all the load generated by the cells is delivered into the pothole as the wetland feature is the outlet of the last reach of the pothole watershed the runoff generated from all the cells in a microwatershed will contribute to the potholes and therefore we treated each pothole as a subwatershed outlet that can be represented by a wetland the advanced wetland technology agwet agnps wetland feature within annagnps is used to characterize the pothole in a microwatershed momm et al 2016 after the cells were generated they were populated with soil management and weather information the precipitation data is downloaded from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism datasets prism climate group gathers climate observations from a wide range of monitoring networks applies sophisticated quality control measures and develops spatial climate datasets which can be downloaded at any point location or in gridded format for larger areas the other weather parameters maximum temperature minimum temperature dew point temperature wind velocity wind direction and solar radiation data is obtained from the sustaining the earth s watersheds agricultural research data system stewards project which provides access to soil water climate land management and socio economic data from fourteen watersheds it is developed by conservation effects assessment project ceap watershed assessment studies was and is supported by united states department of agriculture usda the stewards weather station used in this assessment was located approximately 5 km from the field site the model allows the user to enter the minimum annagnps cell area that will be treated as a homogeneous unit and the minimum reach length for uniform surface flow these mechanisms denoted as critical source area csa and minimum source channel length mscl allow the user to study spatially variable watersheds of various sizes and the number and division of generated cells is determined by the hydrology patterns suggested by the topography for each cell parameter values describing soil land cover and climate are attributed according to input data described below here csa and mscl values were reduced until a detailed stream network was generated suitable csa and mscl values were selected to generate a small number of cells to characterize the area since the entire drainage area of the potholes was under the same management and comparatively little variability is expected the csa selected was 1 ha and the mscl was 10 m because these values correspond to 10 of the default value we use the term microwatersheds to refer to the drainage area of the potholes in this paper the final delineation resulted in microwatersheds with approximately 9 5 and 40 ha of area for walnut and bunny potholes respectively and the generation of 13 cells and 6 reaches for walnut and 52 cells and 22 reaches for bunny annagnps computes runoff percolation evapotranspiration lateral subsurface flow and tile drainage flows separately then updates daily soil moisture estimates using a water balance approach when there is rainfall surface runoff is computed using the cn method cronshey et al 1985 the cn for average conditions cn2 is defined by the user and based on soil moisture conditions the value for dry cn1 and wet cn3 conditions is computed internally by the model as a function of soil moisture content for that day the remaining soil moisture can be lost by evapotranspiration et or be added to soil moisture for the next day computation reference evapotranspiration eto is computed on a daily basis with the penman monteith equation and is then adjusted for crop evapotranspiration et through a crop coefficient procedure allen et al 1998 one limitation of annagnps is that it considers all the load generated in a given day to be delivered to the outlet while this may not be reasonable for larger watersheds given the small scale of the pothole watersheds this may be more consistent with reality das et al 2008 subsurface flow consists of the sum of lateral subsurface flow and tile drain flow this will only be simulated when either an impervious layer or a subsurface tile drainage system is indicated by the user because of the limitation that annagnps assumes surface runoff and subsurface flow produced by the cells will merge before being loaded into the reaches it is not possible to simulate scenarios with artificially drained cells that represent reality since the water load in the potholes would increase instead of decrease to address this limitation we accounted for the amount of water that is flowing out of the pothole by increasing the infiltration i rate the annagnps wetland component models the pothole as a cuboid pool with a fixed surface area height and weir properties as well as constant infiltration throughout its extent the outflow consists of the water leaving the pothole through a weir going to the downstream reaches the user determines the properties of the weir and its height in relation to the bottom of the pothole according to observed conditions this conceptualization however does not account for common features of farmed potholes such as subsurface drainage systems and surface inlets and a surface area that varies with depth to address the shape limitation we simulated depth and volume variations separately in two different model calibrations 2 4 model parameterization and calibration the parameters adjusted during calibration were the cn which regulates the water load produced by the cells and therefore the load into the potholes and the wetland infiltration rate which influences the rate at which water leaves the system the initial cn considered in the assessment was the straight row crop for poor conditions from there the cn was adjusted upwards evaluation metrics discussed below were computed for the delivery of water to the pothole only and a final calibrated cn was determined based on the best performing cn value once the water load into the potholes was determined by the calibration of the cn then the water retention time was regulated by calibrating the infiltration rate the initial infiltration rate was the default value for loam soils and from there was increased until the model output best matched the drop in observed water depth as the inundation receded because the annagnps representation of potholes assumes that the depth of potholes is linearly related with its volume it is not possible to model both depth and volume variations with a single calibration therefore for the assessment of depth and volume different calibrated values for infiltration rate and cn were determined in the case of the volume based simulation the model output is water depth in the wetland pool simulated depths were converted to simulated volume by multiplying the model depth output by the model wetland area observed depths were converted to observed volume using the lidar based depth volume relationships described above weir height was set as the maximum depth of the potholes weir width and maximum water depth comes into play when the pothole in the model overflows a default value of 10 m was selected for weir width of both the potholes for the depth based simulations wetland area was equivalent to the pothole surface area as determined by using the lidar data for the volume based simulations the area was determined by dividing the lidar derived pothole volume by the maximum water depth table 4 presents model wetland parameters adopted for the calibrations of depth and volume variations in the potholes 2 5 statistical assessment of model performance in the absence of long term records of pothole inundation we used the split sample technique for model calibration and assessment where we divided the observed data collected in 2010 as one part and the data collected in 2011 as another part for the bunny pothole only we also performed leave one out cross validation using 2010 2011 and 2016 data performance analyses were based on two schemes one used the entire growing season gs corresponding to the span in which there was observed data with zero values when there was no inundation the other considered only days in which water storage ws was observed or simulated furthermore we restricted the calibration process to exclude or treat as zero for the gs analysis days when observed or simulated depth was below 0 05 m for non consecutive days we used four evaluation metrics each providing different insights into model performance to evaluate the calibration against the validation data table 5 describes these metrics and their interpretation 3 results 3 1 observed data during the observation period 2010 2011 standing water occurred for 32 days in 2010 and 11 days in 2011 in the walnut pothole and 35 days in 2010 and 14 days in 2011 in the bunny pothole in 2010 there were four to five inundation events whereas in 2011 there were only two these data are also presented in logsdon 2015 in which the walnut and bunny potholes are referred to as south and north respectively during the observation period 2016 standing water occurred for 10 days in the bunny pothole over three events 3 2 volume simulation for the volume simulation calibrated cn values were generally outside the range of published cn values for these land use and soil types and calibrated infiltration rates were very high furthermore the evaluation metrics indicated that the model performance in validation was poor we attempted another calibration approach in which we calibrated distinct cn values for cells inside the pothole extent and those outside the pothole extent and these results were also poor for this reason we conclude that the model is not capable of simulating pothole inundation based on volume the rest of the results will thus focus in greater detail on the depth based simulation 3 3 depth simulation 3 3 1 calibrated cn and infiltration rates the values for the final calibrations of the cn and infiltration according to the depth analysis are illustrated in tables 6 and 7 for the one year and two year calibration respectively for both potholes calibrated values of cn were the same as or close to published values for straight row crop in poor hydrologic condition 81 and 88 for soil groups b and c respectively when 2010 and 2011 were validated against each other calibrated values of infiltration rate were higher at bunny presumably because the observed data reflects the influence of the surface inlets for the two year calibrations at bunny in which the 2016 data were included calibrated infiltration rates were similar or identical to those of the one year calibrations calibrated cn values however varied by which year was left out and did not correspond as well to standard cn values for this land use fig 3 illustrates observed and simulated flooded depth for both potholes for the depth calibration and validation according to pothole properties cn and infiltration values available in tables 4 and 6 respectively 3 3 2 model evaluation tables 8 and 9 show the model evaluation metrics for the various models the two one year calibrations at both walnut and bunny and the three two year calibrations at bunny nash sutcliff efficiency values were higher when the entire observation period gs including all days in which neither the model nor the observations indicated water in the pothole than when the data were restricted to only days in which there was water observed and or simulated ws for the one year calibrations the validation nses were all greater than zero and in some cases greater than 0 5 for gs data using ws data only several nse values were less than zero the differences between the gs and ws results suggest that the model is better able to simulate when there is or is not standing water in the pothole than it is at precisely simulating how deep the standing water is for the two year calibrations at bunny that same trend holds but the nse gs results tend to be lower moriasi et al 2007 suggest nse 0 5 for satisfactory model performance at monthly streamflow simulation while pothole depth and streamflow are quite different using this benchmark we would conclude the model performance is often unsatisfactory at depth simulations when using nse as the metric depending on the calibration and validation data rsr values in validation ranged from 0 42 to 0 87 in the case of rse higher values indicate lesser model performance unlike with nse the rsr ws values were lower and thus more favorable than the rsr gs values using the streamflow recommendations of moriasi et al 2007 that rsr 0 7 is satisfactory and rsr 0 5 is very good we would conclude that when used to simulate non zero inundation depths ws the model performance is very good whereas it is often satisfactory when considering all the data gs pbias values representing a percentage over or underestimation indicate that the model tends to underestimate pothole water depth depending on the calibration and validation data used pbias values were frequently greater in magnitude than the 0 25 recommended for satisfactory model performance and always positive indicating observed values higher than the simulated values using the streamflow modeling criterion we would conclude that the model in general has unsatisfactory underestimation of ponded depth however given the sparser nature of pothole inundation data it is reasonable to use less stringent criteria for determining satisfactory model performance than those for streamflow modeling on the whole we conclude that annagnps has potential in this application but will require further study to determine when and where modeling failure occur some of the reasons for lower model performance are known for one given the interannual variability in precipitation and the very small size of the watersheds being simulated some years generate standing water in the potholes more frequently than others and indeed in some years there may be only one or two occasions where the potholes fill with any observable standing water this makes it difficult to generate a sufficient dataset for model calibration and validation there are also difference between potholes in general the annagnps model gives better performance in the simulation of walnut compared to bunny the probable reason for the better performance in the simulation of walnut pothole is the presence of just one surface inlet which allowed it to be modeled more precisely through infiltration bunny pothole has two surface inlets through which water leaves the pothole another cause might be the size of the microwatersheds and the shape of the potholes walnut microwatershed was smaller than bunny microwatershed and the water load coming to walnut is lower than bunny given the model s tendency to underestimate water depth this underestimation may be more pronounced when the watershed and pothole are larger an example of annagnps performance was assessed in a 45 month simulation in two kansas watersheds annagnps underestimated the extreme runoff generation in comparison to the observed data and another watershed model parajuli et al 2009 this situation was also observed in another study in ontario which investigated the occurrence of high peaks of runoff generation das et al 2008 in this study 2010 was a wet year with recorded rainfall of 1214 mm which is 42 7 more than the average annual rainfall 850 9 mm 1992 2016 given the evidence that annagnps underpredicts runoff under very wet conditions our assessment of the model performance may be complicated by the fact that our dataset particularly ws is dominated by wet conditions because those are the more likely cases for the pothole to fill to a substantial depth in general the model is able to capture the occurrence of ponding as well as the initial depth of ponding in the potholes the model simulated the duration of ponding better than the depth it is likely due to the observed data reflecting the influence of short duration high intensity events whereas the model operates on a daily basis and will assume less intense rainfall events over a 24 h period and potentially divides the rainfalls across multiple days when a single event lasts more than a day taken in total we conclude that annagnps is a useful tool for the determination of inundation and water depth in the potholes but further research is necessary for a better estimation of the runoff generation from the microwatershed 4 conclusions annagnps was capable of simulating inundation of the drained and farmed potholes in this study when comparing model output of ponded depth to observations of the same but was not capable of simulating potholes on a volume basis this suggests that the model may be used for applications such as assessing occurrence of crop failures associated with standing water or investigating agricultural management strategies that would reduce potholes tendency to flood the model cannot however be readily used in applications such as assessing downstream streamflow effects or estimating pollutant loads from spillover or drainage fluxes which rely on accurate estimates of water volumes in such cases water volumes may be estimated by simulating the pothole depth and using terrain data to convert pothole depth to water volume to expand model application to volume based scenarios further development of the annagnps wetland component could include expanded options for wetland or pothole topography so that the depth volume relationship might better represent site characteristics of the pothole this may allow for simultaneous simulation of both depth and volume with a single calibration the variable performance of the model with different calibration data and for different evaluation metrics indicates that longer term datasets will be beneficial in understanding the model s limitations there are a number of factors influencing model performance many of which are areas for further study for example some of our observed data and the work of others eg amado et al 2016 suggests a need to more effectively distinguish between surface runoff and shallow subsurface flow both appear to be influential in filling potholes but the percentages of ponded water deriving from these two pathways with different travel times is not known likewise the role of subsurface drainage and the variability of drainage conditions including extensively drained with multiple surface inlets extensively drained without surface inlets somewhat drained with older drainage lines nearby but perhaps not directly underneath the pothole and not drained at all are largely unknown in terms of their effect on filling and draining the pothole accurately modeling unknown pathways is a significant challenge the role of input data quality including model parameterization as well as driving weather data on model performance and output uncertainty is another area for further study finally further research is needed to expand the simulations to other potholes and in other locations to determine if similar trends are observed funding sources this work was supported by the iowa department of natural resources and the us environmental protection agency
