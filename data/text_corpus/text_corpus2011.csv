10055,soil matric potential smp is usually monitored by a tensiometer for managing irrigation in forest plantations so determining where to install the tensiometer is important for improving irrigation efficiency however such work has never been conducted for border irrigation which is commonly used in the intensive cultivation of forest plantations in a border irrigated populus tomentosa plantation on sandy loam soil we monitored the daily changes of smp at eighteen different positions in soil wetting volume wv expressed in px y x means distance from the trunk in cm y means soil depth in cm transpiration t and stem growth rate gr in a growing season the fine root distribution was also investigated in two successive growing seasons the result of time stability analysis showed that among the eighteen positions the annual absolute mean relative difference rd and the standard deviation of the rd of smp at p25 40 were not the lowest but its root mean square error of the smp relative deviation reached the lowest in the growing season the root water uptake at p10 10 had the highest influence on t rate r 2 0 220 p 0 01 and gr r 2 0 112 p 0 05 the fine roots distribution changed greatly with the stand development but its pattern within the wv was relatively consistent in different years there were three dense fine roots zones located around p10 10 p40 10 and p10 50 consequently it was suggested to place tensiometers at two positions i e p25 40 and p10 10 with the former being used for estimating irrigation amount and the latter for triggering irrigation this recommended tensiometer placement strategy will not only help to improve the irrigation efficiency in p tomentosa plantation but also provide a reference for the irrigation management in stands of

introduction populus tomentosa is one of the main tree species for developing fast growing and high yielding forest plantations in china according to the ninth forest resources report the total area of poplar plantations in china has reached 7 57 million ha ranking fifth among all forest plantations of which 4 45 million ha are timber forests accounting for 6 54 of the national timber forest area forest resources management division 2018 this species plays a vital role in solving the domestic wood shortage problem furthermore it is the primary tree species for forest shelters and urban landscaping and has obvious effects on windbreak sand fixation and waste gas absorption poplar plantations must rely on fast tree growth and high quality to perform these functions however lack of effective management practices could lead to a mismatch between the actual and potential productivity of poplar plantations as well as low stand quality fang et al 2008 shikai 2006 xi et al 2013 water shortage is one of the main factors limiting the yield and quality of poplar stands in many parts of china hogg et al 2013 xi et al 2016 thus irrigation can effectively increase the performance of poplar plantations by improving soil moisture and is widely used in northern china xi et al 2013 yang et al 2019 the irrigation time and amount needed by trees to minimize water loss should be considered in effective irrigation management conversely tree growth may be under drought stress despite irrigation yang et al 2019 according to our questionnaire survey findings on the irrigation management situation of poplar plantations in northern china current methods for determining irrigation time and irrigation amount are still dependent on experience li et al 2020 yang et al 2019 soil matric potential smp is a realistic criterion and is always used as a soil based indicator for scheduling irrigation as it can reflect the difficulty of plants in absorbing soil water and indirectly indicate the amount of water remaining in the soil kukal et al 2014 smp has been used in many studies to optimize irrigation scheduling and to investigate how irrigation can save water increase water quality and maximize yield li et al 2020 viswanatha et al 2002 the tensiometer is the most commonly used device for monitoring smp it has the advantages of stability low cost and no need for site specific calibration hoppula and salo 2007 liu and li 2010 additionally because the tensiometer is installed in the soil within the plant root zone it can indirectly illustrate whether the plant is experiencing water stress without measuring plant water status therefore many studies have used tensiometers to monitor smp to determine the time and amount of irrigation hodnett et al 1990 hoppula and salo 2007 liu and li 2010 shock et al 2000 some researchers have also proposed that using tensiometers to construct irrigation schedules would reduce water loss caused by excessive irrigation and deep percolation liu and li 2010 olson and rhoads 2017 yang et al 2019 however it should be noted that the use of a tensiometer to monitor soil water status has a time lag and limited measurement range and temperature changes also affect its accuracy kirkham 2005 shock and wang 2011 one key to making an effective irrigation scheduling based on tensiometer measured smp is to determine suitable installation positions of tensiometer within the soil wetting volume liu and li 2010 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 firstly this is because soil moisture is heterogeneous in both horizontal and vertical directions under partial root zone irrigation conditions such as border furrow or drip irrigation so the tensiometer should be set in neither a too wet nor too dry position kang et al 2004 liu and li 2010 yang et al 2019 otherwise the measured smp value cannot reflect the average water status within the soil wetting volume where in fact distributed most of the plant roots yang et al 2019 besides the availability of soil water within the soil wetting volume can determine the plant water status and the overall soil water supply ability because plant roots mainly concentrate there as mentioned above and the non wetted soil volume always keeps dry yang et al 2019 therefore finding suitable tensiometer placement positions to monitor soil moisture dynamics to timely and accurately irrigate specific crops or forests is a critical issue however it has still not been completely solved many studies have been carried out on the installation locations of tensiometers but most were for agricultural and horticultural crops e g corn watermelon potato sugarcane onion strawberry and tomato hodnett et al 1990 hoppula and salo 2007 li et al 2020 liu and li 2010 phene and beale 1976 pier and doerge 1995 shalhevet et al 1983 shock et al 2000 obviously the findings from crops cannot be applied directly to guide the tensiometer installation for forest irrigation since the root distribution and water use characteristics of crops and trees are different noordwijk et al 2015 yang et al 2019 recently yang et al 2019 derived the optimal placement of tensiometers for scheduling drip irrigation in a poplar plantation which provides a good reference for installing tensiometers to refine irrigation management in a forest however the best tensiometer placement may differ under different irrigation methods due to their different irrigation water infiltration and redistribution patterns in addition the application of drip irrigation in poplar plantations has increased in the past two decades o neill et al 2010 xi et al 2014 he et al 2015 yan et al 2018 but traditional irrigation methods such as border irrigation still dominate due to their lower cost and easier operation jing et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 therefore in order to improve the border irrigation management level in poplar plantations by introducing a tensiometer to monitor the soil water status it is necessary to investigate the optimal tensiometer placement for this specific irrigation method however there is still no such kind of study for poplars and other tree species meanwhile there is also a lack of systematic understanding of the differences in the best tensiometer placement under different irrigation methods for the same plant species and the same soil type at present there are four main methods to determine the optimal placement of tensiometers or soil water sensors the first method is to find a position where its smp can explain plant transpiration variation to the most significant degree liu and li 2010 the second one is to install the tensiometer in a zone with the densest root distribution or and the highest root water uptake coats 2014 coelho et al 2007 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 using temporal stability analysis to find a position where the smp is mostly close to the average smp within the soil wetting volume and has the lowest variation is the third commonly applied method barker et al 2017 cosh et al 2008 grayson and western 1998 hu et al 2010 mubarak et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 pachepsky et al 2005 the last one is determining the optimal placement by numerical simulation of soil water dynamics under different scenarios dabach et al 2015 müller et al 2016 however different optimal placement positions of tensiometers may be derived when using different methods mentioned above coelho et al 2007 consequently it is vital to use multiple methods to explore the optimal tensiometer placement however such kind of study is minimal except for yang et al 2019 populus tomentosa as a native poplar species endemic to china plays a crucial role in developing the fast growing and high yielding forest plantations in the north china plain in order to derive vital information for scheduling smp based border irrigation in p tomentosa plantations and also provide a good reference for irrigation management in plantations of other tree species this study was conducted in a border irrigated p tomentosa plantation with four specific objectives 1 to investigate the variation in smp at different locations within the soil wetting volume around the tree 2 to find the positions that best represent the average smp within the soil wetting volume 3 to investigate the correlations between transpiration rate diameter growth of the trunk and smp at different positions and 4 to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots distribution besides we proposed two hypotheses 1 the best position determined from the correlations between transpiration stem growth and smp coincides with that derived by temporal stability analysis and 2 it is also the zone with the densest fine roots 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site description the study site is located in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province china 36 81 n 116 09 e it belongs to the yellow river alluvial plain with flat terrain and an average elevation of 32 m the climate type is a monsoon climate in a warm temperate zone it is windy and rainless in spring hot and humid in summer sunny and calm in autumn and cold and dry in winter the annual temperature is 13 2 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperatures of 41 2 c and 20 8 c respectively the average annual rainfall is 545 mm and the average annual free water surface evaporation is 1880 mm the soil is sandy loam at a depth of 0 140 cm and silt loam at 140 300 cm depth according to the usda soil texture classification system mellert et al 1974 the average groundwater level is about 6 m the experimental plantation was established in april 2015 using the p tomentosa clone b301 p tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa with a spacing of 2 m 3 m and a planting density of 1666 trees ha 1 there were five irrigation treatments in our experimental plantation with six replicates each replicated plot area was 24 m 18 m and included 72 trees details of which can be referred to yang et al 2019 in this study only the full border irrigation treatment was used in this treatment the irrigation border was 1 m wide 0 2 m deep and 20 m long trees were planted in the center of the irrigation border fig 1 and were fully irrigated roughly every five days during the growing season this design was to ensure that the soil was always under well water conditions the irrigation duration was 1 h each time with an irrigation amount of about 45 mm according to the field observation the infiltration depth of irrigation water was about 70 cm under this irrigation scheduling thus the soil wetting volume wv perpendicular to the tree row is approximated to be a rectangle of 1 m wide and 70 cm deep 2 2 field experiment measurements 2 2 1 soil matric potential and precipitation four sample trees were randomly selected in the third replicated plot to layout one smp monitoring profile around each of them according to the above mentioned shape and size of the wv eighteen vacuum gauge tensiometers sten 30 90 sinton technology ltd beijing china of varying lengths were installed in the monitoring profile with a drilling device and placed at different depths and distances from the trunk fig 1 the measurement range of the tensiometer was 85 0 kpa with a resolution of 1 kpa the smp data monitored by the tensiometers were recorded manually at about 8 00 a m every day from 10 april until early october in 2019 during the experimental period precipitation mm d 1 was monitored using an automatic weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk located about 900 m away from the experimental plantation 2 2 2 transpiration trunk sap flow was measured in four selected sample trees during the study period for each tree one set of thermal dissipation probes tdp30 dynamax inc houston tx usa were inserted into the sapwood on the north side of the trunk at the height of about 1 3 m above the ground sap flow data was registered every 10 s and the average data calculated every 10 min was stored in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc north logan ut usa then the sap flow density sap flux per unit area j s cm s 1 was estimated according to granier 1987 1 j s 0 0119 t max t t 1 231 where δt is the temperature difference between the heated and reference probes c and δt max is the daily maximal temperature difference between these two probes then the j s was converted into transpiration t mm d 1 according to the sapwood area and the average land area 6 m2 occupied by each tree the sapwood area was determined with an allometric equation between sapwood area and trunk diameter which was established for p tomentosa by our team li et al 2021 2 2 3 tree growth rate three sample trees from the four sap flow measurement trees were selected to measure tree growth rate during the study one dendrometer tdf10 sinton technology ltd beijing china was installed 1 5 m above the ground in the east west direction of the trunk and connected to a data logger g01014 i logger sinton technology ltd beijing china to record automatically the stem diameter every 10 min the difference between the maximum daily trunk diameters between two successive days was the daily tree growth rate gr μm d 1 2 2 4 fine roots distribution in june september and november of 2016 and june 2017 three sample trees were selected from different replicated plots a total of twelve trees to investigate the distribution of fine roots 2 mm soil samples were then collected around each tree by the soil coring method in 2016 a soil corer with a diameter of 6 cm was used to sample at 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 120 and 140 cm horizontal distances from the trunk whereas in 2017 a larger soil corer with 10 cm diameter was used to take samples at 10 30 50 80 110 and 140 cm horizontal distances all samples were collected every 10 cm depth and the maximum sampling depth reached 150 and 200 cm in 2016 and 2017 respectively all fine roots 2 mm obtained from soil cores were washed to separate roots from soil particles and organic materials live roots were manually picked out and distinguished from dead roots by their lighter color and greater resilience and were taken to the laboratory and frozen until being scanned some sampled roots selected from different depths and horizontal distances were carefully scanned without root overlapping and crossing using an epson twain pro high quality scanner seiko epson corporation suwa shi nagano japan at 400 dpi then the winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec qc canada was used to determine the root length of the samples all root samples were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed linear regression equations r 2 0 82 0 86 with root dry weight as the independent variable were established using the root length and dry weight data of the scanned root samples after that these equations were used to estimate the root length of other samples the fine root length density was estimated by dividing root length by the soil sample volume 2 3 data presentation and statistical analysis the strong influences of irrigation and precipitation on the soil water status within the wv make it improper to directly investigate the correlations between tree growth rate or transpiration rate and smp thus following the method of yang et al 2019 we calculated the root water uptake activity rwua kpa d 1 indicator for each tensiometer placement position shown in fig 1 then linear regression was used to analyze daily growth and transpiration rate responses to rwua at different positions yang et al 2019 found in the same experimental site that the growth rate of p tomentosa was greatly determined by its transpiration on the previous day yang et al 2019 so there was a one day lag between the two datasets used to investigate the relationship between tree growth rate and rwua we used time stability analysis to determine the representative position where the smp was consistently closer to the average smp within the wv thus two relevant indices i e the mean relative difference mrd and the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd vachaud et al 1985 were adopted in this study the position with small sdrd and near zero mrd was regarded as a time stable position so tensiometers can be placed there to monitor smp for scheduling irrigation the above two indices were calculated using eqs 2 4 besides the relationship between smp at the time stable position and the average smp within the wv was investigated with the linear regression the relative difference rd of the smp at the ith position in the wv at the jth day rd j i was calculated by eq 2 2 rd j i sm p j i sm p j sm p j where sm p j is the average smp within the wv on the jth day and was estimated using the arithmetic mean of smp at eighteen positions for the ith position the mrd of its smp mrd i was calculated by eq 3 3 mrd i 1 n j 1 n rd j i where n is the number of smp measurement days during a specific period one month or a growing season the standard deviation of the rd of smp at the ith position sdrd i was calculated by eq 4 4 sdrd i 1 n 1 j 1 n rd j i mrd i 2 the root mean square error rmse of the relative deviation of smp at the jth position was calculated by eq 5 this index can be used to reduce systematic bias and accurately estimate the mean smp and the lowest rmse value indicates the strongest time stability hu et al 2012 jacobs et al 2004 5 rmse j mrd j 2 sdrd j 2 in this study linear regressions were conducted with spss statistics 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa time stability analysis was undertaken using the relevant matlab code given in hu et al 2012 all figures were prepared using origin 2017 originlab northampton massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 dynamics and temporal stability analysis of soil matric potential the smp was significantly affected by horizontal distance soil depth and their interaction p 0 0001 indicating there was a strong heterogeneity in soil water status within the wv soil matric potential at all positions within the wv was highly sensitive to irrigation fig 2 the variation amplitude of smp was similar at different horizontal distances at the same depth but it decreased gradually with depth at any distance the daily rd of smp in different positions within the wv differ greatly fig 3 among the eighteen placement positions smp at five positions p10 50 p25 70 p40 20 p40 50 p40 70 was lower than the growing season average smp of the wv for most of the time while reverse results were observed at eight positions p10 40 p10 70 p25 10 p25 20 p25 30 p25 50 p40 10 p40 30 there are five positions p10 10 p10 20 p10 30 p25 40 p40 40 with daily smp being close to the average smp in the wv and fluctuating around it with different degrees the rank of all positions in monthly mrd showed a markedly temporal variation fig 3 however on average the lowest rank was detected at p25 40to be 3 6 indicating the monthly average smp at this position was closest to the smp averaged throughout the wv that is to say the smp at p25 40 could best represent the average soil water status in the wv the annual mrd of all positions is shown in fig 4 the mrd in most positions above 40 cm depth was negative ten out of twelve positions while that in the soil below 40 cm depth was often positive four out of six positions this suggests that the 0 40 cm soil layer was wetter than the average soil water status in the wv on the growing season scale but a large part of the soil layer below 40 cm depth was drier annual absolute mrd 0 0004 0 0181 of smp in four p10 10 p10 20 p10 30 p25 40 out of eighteen positions kept similar and was very close to zero however among these four positions the sdrd varied greatly from 0 0591 to 0 1259 with the lowest value observed at p25 40 furthermore with the perspective that the minimum rmse position was the best time stability position the appropriate position was p25 40 table 1 3 2 rwua transpiration and growth rate as shown in figs 5a and s1 on the scale of growing season from april to september t was significantly correlated with the rwua at nearly one third of positions five positions within the wv p 0 05 and the highest correlation was detected at p10 10 indicating tree water use was most sensitive to the soil water variation around this position in contrast there was no relationship between gr and rwua at most positions p 0 05 figs 5b and s2 however gr was significantly correlated with the rwua at p10 10 and p25 10 during the growing season p 0 05 with the r 2 of the former correlation being higher this suggests that soil water variation at p10 10 also exhibited a significant influence on tree growth 3 3 fine roots distribution the two dimensional distribution of fine roots in the wv kept similar in different years but that within the whole root zone differed distinctly from 2016 to 2017 fig 6 the fine roots gradually concentrated towards the trees and became more evenly distributed over time in 2016 87 of the fine roots were distributed above 70 cm soil depth while in 2017 this proportion increased to 94 throughout the whole root zone more than half of the fine roots were distributed within the wv and this proportion increased slightly from 58 in 2016 to 61 in 2017 there were two dense fine roots distribution zones within the wv in 2016 fig 6a they were located at about 40 50 cm distance from the trunk in the surface 10 cm soil layer and at about 0 10 cm distance in the 35 45 cm soil layer a similar result was also observed in 2017 but another dense roots distribution zone occurred at 0 10 cm distance within the top 10 cm soil fig 6b besides the dense roots zone in the deeper soil layer moved down to about 45 55 cm depth in 2017 4 discussion when the tensiometer is used to schedule irrigation the smp at installation positions of the tensiometer should markedly fluctuate and be sensitive to irrigation dabach et al 2015 müller et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 wang and kang 2005 in our experiment smp at eighteen positions within the wv exhibited different responses to irrigation fig 2 so all of these positions have the potential for installing a tensiometer to manage border irrigation a similar result was also observed in our p tomentosa stand under surface drip irrigation conditions yang et al 2019 however it should be noted that not all positions within the soil wetting zone are potentially suitable for installing tensiometers to monitor the smp as the irrigation method irrigation amount and soil type change these factors can affect the soil water movement and the water redistribution patterns within the soil wetting zone it is a good way to use time stability analysis to determine the position where the soil water status has the best representation of the water status averaged over the whole field hu et al 2012 yetbarek and ojha 2020 therefore many studies have used this method to find the optimal soil water monitoring positions for scheduling irrigation barker et al 2017 mubarak et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 yang et al 2019 to do this mrd and sdrd are two commonly used time stability indices yang et al 2019 mubarak et al 2016 and the position with the lowest absolute value of both mrd and sdrd is most suitable for monitoring soil water status hu et al 2012 however such requirements cannot always be met in the field which also occurred in our experiment fig 4 thus some authors made a trade off when applying these two indices for example mubarak et al 2016 selected a position where mrd was close to 0 but the absolute value of sdrd was not the lowest to manage sprinkler irrigation for corn and soybean similarly in a drip irrigated poplar plantation yang et al 2019 selected one position with the smallest mrd but relatively larger absolute sdrd to monitor the average soil water within the wv different from these studies we used the comprehensive indicator rmse which combines mrd and sdrd to determine the position with the best time stability i e with the lowest rmse hu et al 2012 because there did not exist a position with the lowest mrd and sdrd as mentioned above in this study p25 40 has the lowest rmse so the position at 25 cm depth and 40 cm distant from the trunk is a good place to install a tensiometer to maximize water use efficiency we should detect the occurrence of water stress at the first time and then use irrigation to promote plant growth greatly the prerequisite of achieving this target is determining the soil zone where the water availability can exhibit significant influences on plant growth and transpiration understanding the correlations between soil water at different positions and plant growth or water use can facilitate finding such kind of soil zone but it was only applied in a few cases such as in liu and li 2010 for subsurface drip irrigated tomato and yang et al 2019 for surface drip irrigated poplar plantation after adopting this method in the present study we made a thorough analysis of the responses of t and gr to smp variations i e rwua at different positions within the wv and we found that both tree growth and water use were most sensitive to the rwua in surface 10 cm soil this was consistent with the findings of yang et al 2019 and xi et al 2016 2017 that the soil water availability in shallow soil layers shows great control on p tomentosa growth and transpiration according to the variations of t and gr that can be explained by rwua p10 10 can be considered as an appropriate placement for installing a tensiometer it is because soil water variation at this position could significantly influence both tree growth and water use fig 5 therefore monitoring soil water at p10 10 can give a sensitive indication of tree water stress and subsequently maintaining optimal soil water status at this position will favor tree performance fine roots spatial distribution determines the pattern of plant root water uptake so the dense fine roots zone is the critical zone for roots to absorb water especially under well watered conditions clothier and green 1994 xi et al 2013 thus it is often recommended to place the soil water sensor within the dense roots zone to monitor soil water coats 2014 coelho et al 2007 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 the spatial distribution of tree roots reveals high plasticity and can change greatly with irrigation method and irrigation amount smit et al 2000 xi et al 2019 li et al 2020 this also applies to our result which showed that the fine roots distribution of p tomentosa under border irrigation was obviously different from that under drip irrigation yang et al 2019 therefore it was necessary to first investigate the roots distribution pattern before determining the optimal soil water sensor installation regime in our experimental stand there was two main dense fine roots zone in 2016 but it became three in 2017 indicating that the root distribution can vary greatly with stand development fig 6 therefore in theory tensiometers can be installed in all of these three zones however since the dense root zone around p40 10 was located near the boundary of the irrigation border and its soil water status can be greatly influenced by the dry soil outside the border installing a tensiometer there cannot provide a stable indication of the soil water variation within the wv in addition compared with the dense root zone around p10 40 and p10 50 the soil zone around p10 10 had much higher fine roots density therefore from the perspective of root distribution pattern p10 10 is the optimal place to install a tensiometer for scheduling irrigation the best placement of soil water sensors can change when different judgment methods are used this phenomenon has been observed for different tree species under different irrigation methods such as in micro sprinkler irrigated citrus orchard coelho et al 2007 and in drip irrigated poplar plantation yang et al 2019 consistent with them there was also no agreement among the results derived by three methods in the present study to be specific our first hypothesis was denied while the second was verified to be true therefore it is essential to determine the optimal soil water measurement position by synthesizing the results from different methods according to the results discussed above tensiometers should be placed in two positions within the wv for scheduling irrigation in border irrigated p tomentosa plantation the first one should be at p10 10 for the purpose of triggering irrigation because the soil water availability at this position can timely indicate tree water status and maintaining good soil water there can bring growth promotion benefits and increase root water uptake amount the second one should be positioned at p25 40 the purpose of which is to track the dynamics of the average soil water status within the wv so that the irrigation amount for each irrigation event can be accurately estimated this recommendation differs from that in drip irrigated p tomentosa plantation in the same study site where the soil water at the recommended position not only greatly control tree growth and water use but also best represent the mean soil water condition within the wv yang et al 2019 the difference in the optimal tensiometer placement strategies among various irrigation methods may be mainly attributed to the different patterns of both soil water movement and fine roots distribution different from annual crops the irrigation management for perennial plants may last for many years or throughout their whole life cycle as the physiological traits roots system and canopy structure of perennial plants can change markedly with stand development christian et al 2011 di et al 2018 xi 2019 the irrigation regime of tree plantations should be dynamic i e different aged tree plantations should have different irrigation regimes this subsequently raises a critical question for scheduling tree irrigation based on swp measured by tensiometer whether the tensiometer placement should also change with stand development unfortunately it is difficult to gain such information from existing relevant studies as all of them were conducted within a single growing season for fruit trees or annual crops wang and kang 2005 coelho et al 2007 liu and li 2010 müller et al 2016 with the help of hydrus simulation our previous study demonstrated for the first time that the optimal tensiometer placement would not vary with stand age for drip irrigated p tomentosa plantations yang et al 2019 based on this result and considering the similar roots distribution within the wv in different years and the relatively stable soil water variation and distribution within the wv due to the constant irrigation scheduling we believed that our derived optimal tensiometer placement could also be applied in border irrigated p tomentosa stands at other ages soil water infiltration redistribution and variation are determined mainly by soil texture which can also influence the temporal spatial distribution of roots di et al 2018 zou et al 2019 therefore it is still unknown whether our finding obtained on sandy loam soil will be applicable to other soil types but our results provide one key irrigation management information for different plant species under border irrigation soil water sensor may need to be placed at more than one position when using it to schedule high efficient border irrigation 5 conclusions this is the first study that comprehensively uses different methods to investigate where to monitor the soil water status for scheduling border irrigation in tree plantations partially consistent with our hypotheses the optimal tensiometer placement position determined by time stability analysis was different from that derived according to the fine root distribution and the correlation between tree growth water use and soil water variation consequently a two position placement strategy was proposed to install tensiometers in a border irrigated p tomentosa stand to be specific one tensiometer is recommended to place at 40 cm depth and 25 cm distance from the trunk this helps obtain the average water status within the soil wetted volume to estimate the precise irrigation amount another tensiometer should be approximately placed at 10 cm depth and 10 cm distance from the trunk to trigger irrigation adopting this strategy the measured soil matric potential variation will sensitively indicate the change of tree water status and bring growth promotion benefits our recommended tensiometer placement will not only help to manage irrigation in a water saving and high efficient way for p tomentosa but will also provide a reference for the irrigation management in plantations of other tree species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10055,soil matric potential smp is usually monitored by a tensiometer for managing irrigation in forest plantations so determining where to install the tensiometer is important for improving irrigation efficiency however such work has never been conducted for border irrigation which is commonly used in the intensive cultivation of forest plantations in a border irrigated populus tomentosa plantation on sandy loam soil we monitored the daily changes of smp at eighteen different positions in soil wetting volume wv expressed in px y x means distance from the trunk in cm y means soil depth in cm transpiration t and stem growth rate gr in a growing season the fine root distribution was also investigated in two successive growing seasons the result of time stability analysis showed that among the eighteen positions the annual absolute mean relative difference rd and the standard deviation of the rd of smp at p25 40 were not the lowest but its root mean square error of the smp relative deviation reached the lowest in the growing season the root water uptake at p10 10 had the highest influence on t rate r 2 0 220 p 0 01 and gr r 2 0 112 p 0 05 the fine roots distribution changed greatly with the stand development but its pattern within the wv was relatively consistent in different years there were three dense fine roots zones located around p10 10 p40 10 and p10 50 consequently it was suggested to place tensiometers at two positions i e p25 40 and p10 10 with the former being used for estimating irrigation amount and the latter for triggering irrigation this recommended tensiometer placement strategy will not only help to improve the irrigation efficiency in p tomentosa plantation but also provide a reference for the irrigation management in stands of

introduction populus tomentosa is one of the main tree species for developing fast growing and high yielding forest plantations in china according to the ninth forest resources report the total area of poplar plantations in china has reached 7 57 million ha ranking fifth among all forest plantations of which 4 45 million ha are timber forests accounting for 6 54 of the national timber forest area forest resources management division 2018 this species plays a vital role in solving the domestic wood shortage problem furthermore it is the primary tree species for forest shelters and urban landscaping and has obvious effects on windbreak sand fixation and waste gas absorption poplar plantations must rely on fast tree growth and high quality to perform these functions however lack of effective management practices could lead to a mismatch between the actual and potential productivity of poplar plantations as well as low stand quality fang et al 2008 shikai 2006 xi et al 2013 water shortage is one of the main factors limiting the yield and quality of poplar stands in many parts of china hogg et al 2013 xi et al 2016 thus irrigation can effectively increase the performance of poplar plantations by improving soil moisture and is widely used in northern china xi et al 2013 yang et al 2019 the irrigation time and amount needed by trees to minimize water loss should be considered in effective irrigation management conversely tree growth may be under drought stress despite irrigation yang et al 2019 according to our questionnaire survey findings on the irrigation management situation of poplar plantations in northern china current methods for determining irrigation time and irrigation amount are still dependent on experience li et al 2020 yang et al 2019 soil matric potential smp is a realistic criterion and is always used as a soil based indicator for scheduling irrigation as it can reflect the difficulty of plants in absorbing soil water and indirectly indicate the amount of water remaining in the soil kukal et al 2014 smp has been used in many studies to optimize irrigation scheduling and to investigate how irrigation can save water increase water quality and maximize yield li et al 2020 viswanatha et al 2002 the tensiometer is the most commonly used device for monitoring smp it has the advantages of stability low cost and no need for site specific calibration hoppula and salo 2007 liu and li 2010 additionally because the tensiometer is installed in the soil within the plant root zone it can indirectly illustrate whether the plant is experiencing water stress without measuring plant water status therefore many studies have used tensiometers to monitor smp to determine the time and amount of irrigation hodnett et al 1990 hoppula and salo 2007 liu and li 2010 shock et al 2000 some researchers have also proposed that using tensiometers to construct irrigation schedules would reduce water loss caused by excessive irrigation and deep percolation liu and li 2010 olson and rhoads 2017 yang et al 2019 however it should be noted that the use of a tensiometer to monitor soil water status has a time lag and limited measurement range and temperature changes also affect its accuracy kirkham 2005 shock and wang 2011 one key to making an effective irrigation scheduling based on tensiometer measured smp is to determine suitable installation positions of tensiometer within the soil wetting volume liu and li 2010 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 firstly this is because soil moisture is heterogeneous in both horizontal and vertical directions under partial root zone irrigation conditions such as border furrow or drip irrigation so the tensiometer should be set in neither a too wet nor too dry position kang et al 2004 liu and li 2010 yang et al 2019 otherwise the measured smp value cannot reflect the average water status within the soil wetting volume where in fact distributed most of the plant roots yang et al 2019 besides the availability of soil water within the soil wetting volume can determine the plant water status and the overall soil water supply ability because plant roots mainly concentrate there as mentioned above and the non wetted soil volume always keeps dry yang et al 2019 therefore finding suitable tensiometer placement positions to monitor soil moisture dynamics to timely and accurately irrigate specific crops or forests is a critical issue however it has still not been completely solved many studies have been carried out on the installation locations of tensiometers but most were for agricultural and horticultural crops e g corn watermelon potato sugarcane onion strawberry and tomato hodnett et al 1990 hoppula and salo 2007 li et al 2020 liu and li 2010 phene and beale 1976 pier and doerge 1995 shalhevet et al 1983 shock et al 2000 obviously the findings from crops cannot be applied directly to guide the tensiometer installation for forest irrigation since the root distribution and water use characteristics of crops and trees are different noordwijk et al 2015 yang et al 2019 recently yang et al 2019 derived the optimal placement of tensiometers for scheduling drip irrigation in a poplar plantation which provides a good reference for installing tensiometers to refine irrigation management in a forest however the best tensiometer placement may differ under different irrigation methods due to their different irrigation water infiltration and redistribution patterns in addition the application of drip irrigation in poplar plantations has increased in the past two decades o neill et al 2010 xi et al 2014 he et al 2015 yan et al 2018 but traditional irrigation methods such as border irrigation still dominate due to their lower cost and easier operation jing et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 therefore in order to improve the border irrigation management level in poplar plantations by introducing a tensiometer to monitor the soil water status it is necessary to investigate the optimal tensiometer placement for this specific irrigation method however there is still no such kind of study for poplars and other tree species meanwhile there is also a lack of systematic understanding of the differences in the best tensiometer placement under different irrigation methods for the same plant species and the same soil type at present there are four main methods to determine the optimal placement of tensiometers or soil water sensors the first method is to find a position where its smp can explain plant transpiration variation to the most significant degree liu and li 2010 the second one is to install the tensiometer in a zone with the densest root distribution or and the highest root water uptake coats 2014 coelho et al 2007 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 using temporal stability analysis to find a position where the smp is mostly close to the average smp within the soil wetting volume and has the lowest variation is the third commonly applied method barker et al 2017 cosh et al 2008 grayson and western 1998 hu et al 2010 mubarak et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 pachepsky et al 2005 the last one is determining the optimal placement by numerical simulation of soil water dynamics under different scenarios dabach et al 2015 müller et al 2016 however different optimal placement positions of tensiometers may be derived when using different methods mentioned above coelho et al 2007 consequently it is vital to use multiple methods to explore the optimal tensiometer placement however such kind of study is minimal except for yang et al 2019 populus tomentosa as a native poplar species endemic to china plays a crucial role in developing the fast growing and high yielding forest plantations in the north china plain in order to derive vital information for scheduling smp based border irrigation in p tomentosa plantations and also provide a good reference for irrigation management in plantations of other tree species this study was conducted in a border irrigated p tomentosa plantation with four specific objectives 1 to investigate the variation in smp at different locations within the soil wetting volume around the tree 2 to find the positions that best represent the average smp within the soil wetting volume 3 to investigate the correlations between transpiration rate diameter growth of the trunk and smp at different positions and 4 to determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of fine roots distribution besides we proposed two hypotheses 1 the best position determined from the correlations between transpiration stem growth and smp coincides with that derived by temporal stability analysis and 2 it is also the zone with the densest fine roots 2 materials and methods 2 1 research site description the study site is located in gaotang county liaocheng city shandong province china 36 81 n 116 09 e it belongs to the yellow river alluvial plain with flat terrain and an average elevation of 32 m the climate type is a monsoon climate in a warm temperate zone it is windy and rainless in spring hot and humid in summer sunny and calm in autumn and cold and dry in winter the annual temperature is 13 2 c with extreme maximum and minimum temperatures of 41 2 c and 20 8 c respectively the average annual rainfall is 545 mm and the average annual free water surface evaporation is 1880 mm the soil is sandy loam at a depth of 0 140 cm and silt loam at 140 300 cm depth according to the usda soil texture classification system mellert et al 1974 the average groundwater level is about 6 m the experimental plantation was established in april 2015 using the p tomentosa clone b301 p tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa with a spacing of 2 m 3 m and a planting density of 1666 trees ha 1 there were five irrigation treatments in our experimental plantation with six replicates each replicated plot area was 24 m 18 m and included 72 trees details of which can be referred to yang et al 2019 in this study only the full border irrigation treatment was used in this treatment the irrigation border was 1 m wide 0 2 m deep and 20 m long trees were planted in the center of the irrigation border fig 1 and were fully irrigated roughly every five days during the growing season this design was to ensure that the soil was always under well water conditions the irrigation duration was 1 h each time with an irrigation amount of about 45 mm according to the field observation the infiltration depth of irrigation water was about 70 cm under this irrigation scheduling thus the soil wetting volume wv perpendicular to the tree row is approximated to be a rectangle of 1 m wide and 70 cm deep 2 2 field experiment measurements 2 2 1 soil matric potential and precipitation four sample trees were randomly selected in the third replicated plot to layout one smp monitoring profile around each of them according to the above mentioned shape and size of the wv eighteen vacuum gauge tensiometers sten 30 90 sinton technology ltd beijing china of varying lengths were installed in the monitoring profile with a drilling device and placed at different depths and distances from the trunk fig 1 the measurement range of the tensiometer was 85 0 kpa with a resolution of 1 kpa the smp data monitored by the tensiometers were recorded manually at about 8 00 a m every day from 10 april until early october in 2019 during the experimental period precipitation mm d 1 was monitored using an automatic weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk located about 900 m away from the experimental plantation 2 2 2 transpiration trunk sap flow was measured in four selected sample trees during the study period for each tree one set of thermal dissipation probes tdp30 dynamax inc houston tx usa were inserted into the sapwood on the north side of the trunk at the height of about 1 3 m above the ground sap flow data was registered every 10 s and the average data calculated every 10 min was stored in a data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc north logan ut usa then the sap flow density sap flux per unit area j s cm s 1 was estimated according to granier 1987 1 j s 0 0119 t max t t 1 231 where δt is the temperature difference between the heated and reference probes c and δt max is the daily maximal temperature difference between these two probes then the j s was converted into transpiration t mm d 1 according to the sapwood area and the average land area 6 m2 occupied by each tree the sapwood area was determined with an allometric equation between sapwood area and trunk diameter which was established for p tomentosa by our team li et al 2021 2 2 3 tree growth rate three sample trees from the four sap flow measurement trees were selected to measure tree growth rate during the study one dendrometer tdf10 sinton technology ltd beijing china was installed 1 5 m above the ground in the east west direction of the trunk and connected to a data logger g01014 i logger sinton technology ltd beijing china to record automatically the stem diameter every 10 min the difference between the maximum daily trunk diameters between two successive days was the daily tree growth rate gr μm d 1 2 2 4 fine roots distribution in june september and november of 2016 and june 2017 three sample trees were selected from different replicated plots a total of twelve trees to investigate the distribution of fine roots 2 mm soil samples were then collected around each tree by the soil coring method in 2016 a soil corer with a diameter of 6 cm was used to sample at 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 120 and 140 cm horizontal distances from the trunk whereas in 2017 a larger soil corer with 10 cm diameter was used to take samples at 10 30 50 80 110 and 140 cm horizontal distances all samples were collected every 10 cm depth and the maximum sampling depth reached 150 and 200 cm in 2016 and 2017 respectively all fine roots 2 mm obtained from soil cores were washed to separate roots from soil particles and organic materials live roots were manually picked out and distinguished from dead roots by their lighter color and greater resilience and were taken to the laboratory and frozen until being scanned some sampled roots selected from different depths and horizontal distances were carefully scanned without root overlapping and crossing using an epson twain pro high quality scanner seiko epson corporation suwa shi nagano japan at 400 dpi then the winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec qc canada was used to determine the root length of the samples all root samples were dried at 75 c to a constant weight and weighed linear regression equations r 2 0 82 0 86 with root dry weight as the independent variable were established using the root length and dry weight data of the scanned root samples after that these equations were used to estimate the root length of other samples the fine root length density was estimated by dividing root length by the soil sample volume 2 3 data presentation and statistical analysis the strong influences of irrigation and precipitation on the soil water status within the wv make it improper to directly investigate the correlations between tree growth rate or transpiration rate and smp thus following the method of yang et al 2019 we calculated the root water uptake activity rwua kpa d 1 indicator for each tensiometer placement position shown in fig 1 then linear regression was used to analyze daily growth and transpiration rate responses to rwua at different positions yang et al 2019 found in the same experimental site that the growth rate of p tomentosa was greatly determined by its transpiration on the previous day yang et al 2019 so there was a one day lag between the two datasets used to investigate the relationship between tree growth rate and rwua we used time stability analysis to determine the representative position where the smp was consistently closer to the average smp within the wv thus two relevant indices i e the mean relative difference mrd and the standard deviation of relative difference sdrd vachaud et al 1985 were adopted in this study the position with small sdrd and near zero mrd was regarded as a time stable position so tensiometers can be placed there to monitor smp for scheduling irrigation the above two indices were calculated using eqs 2 4 besides the relationship between smp at the time stable position and the average smp within the wv was investigated with the linear regression the relative difference rd of the smp at the ith position in the wv at the jth day rd j i was calculated by eq 2 2 rd j i sm p j i sm p j sm p j where sm p j is the average smp within the wv on the jth day and was estimated using the arithmetic mean of smp at eighteen positions for the ith position the mrd of its smp mrd i was calculated by eq 3 3 mrd i 1 n j 1 n rd j i where n is the number of smp measurement days during a specific period one month or a growing season the standard deviation of the rd of smp at the ith position sdrd i was calculated by eq 4 4 sdrd i 1 n 1 j 1 n rd j i mrd i 2 the root mean square error rmse of the relative deviation of smp at the jth position was calculated by eq 5 this index can be used to reduce systematic bias and accurately estimate the mean smp and the lowest rmse value indicates the strongest time stability hu et al 2012 jacobs et al 2004 5 rmse j mrd j 2 sdrd j 2 in this study linear regressions were conducted with spss statistics 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa time stability analysis was undertaken using the relevant matlab code given in hu et al 2012 all figures were prepared using origin 2017 originlab northampton massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 dynamics and temporal stability analysis of soil matric potential the smp was significantly affected by horizontal distance soil depth and their interaction p 0 0001 indicating there was a strong heterogeneity in soil water status within the wv soil matric potential at all positions within the wv was highly sensitive to irrigation fig 2 the variation amplitude of smp was similar at different horizontal distances at the same depth but it decreased gradually with depth at any distance the daily rd of smp in different positions within the wv differ greatly fig 3 among the eighteen placement positions smp at five positions p10 50 p25 70 p40 20 p40 50 p40 70 was lower than the growing season average smp of the wv for most of the time while reverse results were observed at eight positions p10 40 p10 70 p25 10 p25 20 p25 30 p25 50 p40 10 p40 30 there are five positions p10 10 p10 20 p10 30 p25 40 p40 40 with daily smp being close to the average smp in the wv and fluctuating around it with different degrees the rank of all positions in monthly mrd showed a markedly temporal variation fig 3 however on average the lowest rank was detected at p25 40to be 3 6 indicating the monthly average smp at this position was closest to the smp averaged throughout the wv that is to say the smp at p25 40 could best represent the average soil water status in the wv the annual mrd of all positions is shown in fig 4 the mrd in most positions above 40 cm depth was negative ten out of twelve positions while that in the soil below 40 cm depth was often positive four out of six positions this suggests that the 0 40 cm soil layer was wetter than the average soil water status in the wv on the growing season scale but a large part of the soil layer below 40 cm depth was drier annual absolute mrd 0 0004 0 0181 of smp in four p10 10 p10 20 p10 30 p25 40 out of eighteen positions kept similar and was very close to zero however among these four positions the sdrd varied greatly from 0 0591 to 0 1259 with the lowest value observed at p25 40 furthermore with the perspective that the minimum rmse position was the best time stability position the appropriate position was p25 40 table 1 3 2 rwua transpiration and growth rate as shown in figs 5a and s1 on the scale of growing season from april to september t was significantly correlated with the rwua at nearly one third of positions five positions within the wv p 0 05 and the highest correlation was detected at p10 10 indicating tree water use was most sensitive to the soil water variation around this position in contrast there was no relationship between gr and rwua at most positions p 0 05 figs 5b and s2 however gr was significantly correlated with the rwua at p10 10 and p25 10 during the growing season p 0 05 with the r 2 of the former correlation being higher this suggests that soil water variation at p10 10 also exhibited a significant influence on tree growth 3 3 fine roots distribution the two dimensional distribution of fine roots in the wv kept similar in different years but that within the whole root zone differed distinctly from 2016 to 2017 fig 6 the fine roots gradually concentrated towards the trees and became more evenly distributed over time in 2016 87 of the fine roots were distributed above 70 cm soil depth while in 2017 this proportion increased to 94 throughout the whole root zone more than half of the fine roots were distributed within the wv and this proportion increased slightly from 58 in 2016 to 61 in 2017 there were two dense fine roots distribution zones within the wv in 2016 fig 6a they were located at about 40 50 cm distance from the trunk in the surface 10 cm soil layer and at about 0 10 cm distance in the 35 45 cm soil layer a similar result was also observed in 2017 but another dense roots distribution zone occurred at 0 10 cm distance within the top 10 cm soil fig 6b besides the dense roots zone in the deeper soil layer moved down to about 45 55 cm depth in 2017 4 discussion when the tensiometer is used to schedule irrigation the smp at installation positions of the tensiometer should markedly fluctuate and be sensitive to irrigation dabach et al 2015 müller et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 wang and kang 2005 in our experiment smp at eighteen positions within the wv exhibited different responses to irrigation fig 2 so all of these positions have the potential for installing a tensiometer to manage border irrigation a similar result was also observed in our p tomentosa stand under surface drip irrigation conditions yang et al 2019 however it should be noted that not all positions within the soil wetting zone are potentially suitable for installing tensiometers to monitor the smp as the irrigation method irrigation amount and soil type change these factors can affect the soil water movement and the water redistribution patterns within the soil wetting zone it is a good way to use time stability analysis to determine the position where the soil water status has the best representation of the water status averaged over the whole field hu et al 2012 yetbarek and ojha 2020 therefore many studies have used this method to find the optimal soil water monitoring positions for scheduling irrigation barker et al 2017 mubarak et al 2016 nolz and loiskandl 2017 yang et al 2019 to do this mrd and sdrd are two commonly used time stability indices yang et al 2019 mubarak et al 2016 and the position with the lowest absolute value of both mrd and sdrd is most suitable for monitoring soil water status hu et al 2012 however such requirements cannot always be met in the field which also occurred in our experiment fig 4 thus some authors made a trade off when applying these two indices for example mubarak et al 2016 selected a position where mrd was close to 0 but the absolute value of sdrd was not the lowest to manage sprinkler irrigation for corn and soybean similarly in a drip irrigated poplar plantation yang et al 2019 selected one position with the smallest mrd but relatively larger absolute sdrd to monitor the average soil water within the wv different from these studies we used the comprehensive indicator rmse which combines mrd and sdrd to determine the position with the best time stability i e with the lowest rmse hu et al 2012 because there did not exist a position with the lowest mrd and sdrd as mentioned above in this study p25 40 has the lowest rmse so the position at 25 cm depth and 40 cm distant from the trunk is a good place to install a tensiometer to maximize water use efficiency we should detect the occurrence of water stress at the first time and then use irrigation to promote plant growth greatly the prerequisite of achieving this target is determining the soil zone where the water availability can exhibit significant influences on plant growth and transpiration understanding the correlations between soil water at different positions and plant growth or water use can facilitate finding such kind of soil zone but it was only applied in a few cases such as in liu and li 2010 for subsurface drip irrigated tomato and yang et al 2019 for surface drip irrigated poplar plantation after adopting this method in the present study we made a thorough analysis of the responses of t and gr to smp variations i e rwua at different positions within the wv and we found that both tree growth and water use were most sensitive to the rwua in surface 10 cm soil this was consistent with the findings of yang et al 2019 and xi et al 2016 2017 that the soil water availability in shallow soil layers shows great control on p tomentosa growth and transpiration according to the variations of t and gr that can be explained by rwua p10 10 can be considered as an appropriate placement for installing a tensiometer it is because soil water variation at this position could significantly influence both tree growth and water use fig 5 therefore monitoring soil water at p10 10 can give a sensitive indication of tree water stress and subsequently maintaining optimal soil water status at this position will favor tree performance fine roots spatial distribution determines the pattern of plant root water uptake so the dense fine roots zone is the critical zone for roots to absorb water especially under well watered conditions clothier and green 1994 xi et al 2013 thus it is often recommended to place the soil water sensor within the dense roots zone to monitor soil water coats 2014 coelho et al 2007 müller et al 2016 wang and kang 2005 the spatial distribution of tree roots reveals high plasticity and can change greatly with irrigation method and irrigation amount smit et al 2000 xi et al 2019 li et al 2020 this also applies to our result which showed that the fine roots distribution of p tomentosa under border irrigation was obviously different from that under drip irrigation yang et al 2019 therefore it was necessary to first investigate the roots distribution pattern before determining the optimal soil water sensor installation regime in our experimental stand there was two main dense fine roots zone in 2016 but it became three in 2017 indicating that the root distribution can vary greatly with stand development fig 6 therefore in theory tensiometers can be installed in all of these three zones however since the dense root zone around p40 10 was located near the boundary of the irrigation border and its soil water status can be greatly influenced by the dry soil outside the border installing a tensiometer there cannot provide a stable indication of the soil water variation within the wv in addition compared with the dense root zone around p10 40 and p10 50 the soil zone around p10 10 had much higher fine roots density therefore from the perspective of root distribution pattern p10 10 is the optimal place to install a tensiometer for scheduling irrigation the best placement of soil water sensors can change when different judgment methods are used this phenomenon has been observed for different tree species under different irrigation methods such as in micro sprinkler irrigated citrus orchard coelho et al 2007 and in drip irrigated poplar plantation yang et al 2019 consistent with them there was also no agreement among the results derived by three methods in the present study to be specific our first hypothesis was denied while the second was verified to be true therefore it is essential to determine the optimal soil water measurement position by synthesizing the results from different methods according to the results discussed above tensiometers should be placed in two positions within the wv for scheduling irrigation in border irrigated p tomentosa plantation the first one should be at p10 10 for the purpose of triggering irrigation because the soil water availability at this position can timely indicate tree water status and maintaining good soil water there can bring growth promotion benefits and increase root water uptake amount the second one should be positioned at p25 40 the purpose of which is to track the dynamics of the average soil water status within the wv so that the irrigation amount for each irrigation event can be accurately estimated this recommendation differs from that in drip irrigated p tomentosa plantation in the same study site where the soil water at the recommended position not only greatly control tree growth and water use but also best represent the mean soil water condition within the wv yang et al 2019 the difference in the optimal tensiometer placement strategies among various irrigation methods may be mainly attributed to the different patterns of both soil water movement and fine roots distribution different from annual crops the irrigation management for perennial plants may last for many years or throughout their whole life cycle as the physiological traits roots system and canopy structure of perennial plants can change markedly with stand development christian et al 2011 di et al 2018 xi 2019 the irrigation regime of tree plantations should be dynamic i e different aged tree plantations should have different irrigation regimes this subsequently raises a critical question for scheduling tree irrigation based on swp measured by tensiometer whether the tensiometer placement should also change with stand development unfortunately it is difficult to gain such information from existing relevant studies as all of them were conducted within a single growing season for fruit trees or annual crops wang and kang 2005 coelho et al 2007 liu and li 2010 müller et al 2016 with the help of hydrus simulation our previous study demonstrated for the first time that the optimal tensiometer placement would not vary with stand age for drip irrigated p tomentosa plantations yang et al 2019 based on this result and considering the similar roots distribution within the wv in different years and the relatively stable soil water variation and distribution within the wv due to the constant irrigation scheduling we believed that our derived optimal tensiometer placement could also be applied in border irrigated p tomentosa stands at other ages soil water infiltration redistribution and variation are determined mainly by soil texture which can also influence the temporal spatial distribution of roots di et al 2018 zou et al 2019 therefore it is still unknown whether our finding obtained on sandy loam soil will be applicable to other soil types but our results provide one key irrigation management information for different plant species under border irrigation soil water sensor may need to be placed at more than one position when using it to schedule high efficient border irrigation 5 conclusions this is the first study that comprehensively uses different methods to investigate where to monitor the soil water status for scheduling border irrigation in tree plantations partially consistent with our hypotheses the optimal tensiometer placement position determined by time stability analysis was different from that derived according to the fine root distribution and the correlation between tree growth water use and soil water variation consequently a two position placement strategy was proposed to install tensiometers in a border irrigated p tomentosa stand to be specific one tensiometer is recommended to place at 40 cm depth and 25 cm distance from the trunk this helps obtain the average water status within the soil wetted volume to estimate the precise irrigation amount another tensiometer should be approximately placed at 10 cm depth and 10 cm distance from the trunk to trigger irrigation adopting this strategy the measured soil matric potential variation will sensitively indicate the change of tree water status and bring growth promotion benefits our recommended tensiometer placement will not only help to manage irrigation in a water saving and high efficient way for p tomentosa but will also provide a reference for the irrigation management in plantations of other tree species declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10056,in this paper we modeled water trading in southern alberta by incorporating irrigation technologies and crop choices we consider six irrigation technologies and twelve crops with a variation in land quality to examine the adoption gains from water trading the results are summarized to account for the gains from water trading and the probability of farmers switching to efficient irrigation technologies to cultivate profitable crops simulation results suggest that famers are more likely to follow rational adoption approach in using the gain from water trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies this is more likely to occur when the net gain is higher than the cost of adopting an irrigation technology however sensitivity analysis shows that high crop price regimes and provision of subsidies on the impact of water trading on technology adoptions could encourage farmers to adopt improved irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops effective policies to provide incentives to farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies and to improve crop yields may be necessary for the study area keywords heterogeneity land quality profit function water price

lies in the northern part of the province awpa 2020 babkir 2018 farmers in the southern part of the province mainly depend on irrigation for crop production as irrigation accounts for 71 of surface water allocation in the province alberta environment 2008 in addition unstable economic growth and increasing urbanization rates have intensified industrial and municipal water demand pressures much of it bearing on southern part of the province aside from unequal distribution of water alberta is also approaching full allocation of water supply in the south and policies are required to address water management issues in response to this unequal spatial distribution of water and the challenge of developing sustainable measures to manage water in the southern part of the province alberta s water for life strategy was formulated in 2003 and renewed in 2008 this strategy envisions a holistic approach towards managing provincial water by addressing present and future water scarcity challenges this policy document outlines key water management recommendations one of which is to achieve efficiency and productivity of water use in alberta through the application of economic instruments alberta environment 2008 previously the benefits of economic instruments such as water trading had been given policy recognition in the water act alberta 2000a section 81 and in the irrigation district act alberta 2000b section 11 these policy documents stressed on the need to adopt water management principles with a focus on ensuring more effective and efficient use of water and to enhance water transfer system that support economic development alberta water council 2017 water trading is a feasible strategy to achieve efficiency and productivity of water however potential benefits from water trading at the farm level occur when irrigators use the gains from trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies or shift to crops that require less water adopting efficient irrigation technologies such as sprinkler low pressure or micro drip technologies lead to a higher proportion of applied water getting to the root zones of crops essentially the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies at the farm level could improve yields and reduce production and energy costs schuck et al 2005 as well as potentially conserving quantities of water for alternative uses in the south saskatchewan river basin ssrb which is the main watershed in southern alberta farmers have the consumptive right to most of the water they are allowed to divert to their farms achieving an efficient market for water is problematic because of transaction costs inadequate number of willing buyers and sellers and water transportation constraints livingston 1995 nicol and klein 2006 palomo hierro et al 2015 thus it is important to understand farmers decision making processes in terms of impacts on the gains from water trading irrigation technology adoption and crop choices there is an extensive literature on the economics of irrigated agriculture water trading and the gains from irrigation technology studies by adamowicz and horbulyk 1996 nicol and klein 2006 nicol et al 2008 for example have focused on estimating gains associated with introducing water markets and pricing systems in southern alberta mahan et al 2002 cutlac et al 2006 cutlac and horbulyk 2011 and he et al 2012 examined efficiency gains from water trading however these studies do not capture farm level incentives for irrigation technology adoption crop choices or heterogeneity issues differences in land quality among farmers has been observed as an important factor in determining adoption decisions for both irrigation technologies and crop choices at the farm level caswell and zilberman 1986 farm level profit models allowing for heterogeneity in land quality have been used to examine gains from irrigation technology adoption caswell and zilberman 1986 external effects of input use and environmental policies in resources conservation and pollution reduction caswell et al 1990 these models have also been used to investigate the diffusion of resource quality augmenting irrigation technologies under output supply and input demand effects caswell et al 1993 again these studies do not consider the potential of trading water rights as an incentive to encourage efficient water use the existing literature on water trading and technology adoption focuses on drainage reduction dinar and letey 1991 and price uncertainty carey and zilberman 2002 dridi and khanna 2005 considered water allocation water trading and irrigation technology adoption in the presence of imperfect information but only for a single crop little attention has been given to the investigation of gains from farmers switching among different irrigation technologies and or crops to adopt more profitable combinations of irrigation technologies and crops after water trading typically farmers are faced with several combinations of irrigation technology and crop choices and it is not a simple decision to choose an efficient technology to produce a profitable crop however it is conceivable that after water trading farmers will consider the profitability of alternative technology and crop selection decisions in this situation it is possible to examine the gains under the different switching regimes after water trading the purpose of this study is to calibrate a farm based profit equation model and use it to simulate irrigation technology decisions by southern alberta crop farmers in order to 1 account for the probability of farmers switching from a less efficient to a more efficient irrigation technology to produce profitable crops after trading 2 estimate the probabilities of farmers switching from lower valued crops to the higher valued crops after trading and 3 examine gains of water trading in the presence of alternative water conservation policies specifically the caswell and zilberman 1986 modeling approach is applied to southern alberta the analysis in this paper however extends the caswell and zilberman 1986 model to simulate water trading between two representative farmers by 1 including six main irrigation technologies and 12 crops 2 accounting for water trading irrigation technology adoption and crop choices under drought conditions 3 modifying the production function to reflect actual crop yields in the study area by incorporating average annual precipitation spring soil moisture and potential crop evapotranspiration with the intent of providing accurate measure of water use and 4 applying the model to examine possible future water allocation policies in southern alberta the rest of the paper is organized as follows the next section provides a discussion of the theoretical modeling framework this is followed by a brief description of the study area we then present the stylized results of the model and the water trading simulation results the last section deals with the policy conclusions and limitations of the study 2 theoretical model consider that there are n farmers potentially producing c different crops using different irrigation technologies and water as inputs let p c be the exogenous output price for the c th crop land quality for the i th farmer denoted by θ i is heterogeneous and is distributed with a density f θ i and a cumulative distribution f θ i over the range θ θ farmers choose from m feasible irrigation technologies and the variations in the technologies based on their application efficiency of water use the amount of water applied and effective water used i e actual consumption per crop per hectare for irrigation technology t and crop c are denoted as w i t c and e i t c respectively irrigation effectiveness is the ratio of effective water used to the applied water and is represented by a land quality augmenting function h i t θ i such that effective water is defined as the function h t is the percentage of water effectively used by the crop and takes a value from 0 to 1 to illustrate the effect of land quality and irrigation technology choices assume that there are two irrigation technologies an efficient technology t 2 and an inefficient technology t 1 the efficient irrigation technology is assumed to have higher irrigation effectiveness than the inefficient irrigation technology 1 1 first and second derivatives of the function with respective to land quality h t θ i 0 h t θ i 0 implying positive but decreasing marginal gains in irrigation effectiveness with improved land quality the relationship between the two irrigation technologies is such that h 2 θ i h 1 θ i θ for 0 θ i 1 while h 2 0 0 and h 2 1 1 the above relationships imply that the gap between h 2 and h 1 decreases with improved land quality the land quality parameter which differentiates farmers is given as θ θ θ and h t θ θ α t is the definition of irrigation technology effectiveness and α t is elasticity of irrigation with respect to land quality 2 2 this measures how responsive the land is to further irrigation practically this means that an increase in land quality results in a reduction in the price of effective irrigation and assuming decreasing marginal productivity the optimal amount of effective water has increased leading to an increase in both output and quasi rent per ha caswell and zilberman 1986 adoption of the least efficient irrigation technology corresponds to α t 1 while the efficient irrigation technology is represented by α t 0 1 2 1 production function in applied production economic analysis it is often necessary to select a functional form to describe the underlying technology irrigation technology adoption studies often incorporate flexible functional forms such as a quadratic function carey and zilberman 2002 koundouri et al 2006 for example the quadratic function has the ability to model multiple stages of production and varying degrees of input substitutability this study employs an augmented quadratic production function which depends on effectiveness of irrigation water as a function of land quality unlike other studies this production function takes effective irrigation actual and potential evapotranspiration and moisture availability let y i t c be the actual yield per crop per hectare we define y i t c f z where z is defined as ratio of moisture use by crops and moisture availability the specific relationship of this ratio can be given as uma 1982 irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 z e t a w i t c h i t θ i e t p i c e t p c is the amount of evaporation from soil and transpiration from crops which occurs given sufficient moisture availability uma 1982 moisture availability is comprised of spring soil moisture ssm effective precipitation prcp and effective irrigation w i t c h i t θ i however actual evapotranspiration e t a is estimated as the sum of ssm and prcp prcp is the effective precipitation used in the growing season in the form of rain or snow with a 10 adjustment to account for drainage losses when soil moisture levels are near optimal uma 1982 ssm is further defined as the spring soil moisture available at the start of a growing season which depends on the amount of moisture stored in the soil at the end of the previous season plus winter precipitation uma 1982 the production function for farmer i can be formulated as 1 y i t c a 0 a 1 e t a e i t c e t p i c a 2 e t a e i t c e t p i c 2 y p c where y p c is the potential yield per crop per hectare and a 1 0 a 2 0 and a 0 0 are crop specific regression coefficients as specified the production function has the properties of a neoclassical production function that is concavity and the marginal productivity of effective water is assumed to be nonnegative but declining i e y i t c 0 y i t c 0 this means that in the economic production range of water use marginal productivity of water is positive and increasing with the amount of effective water 2 2 irrigation technology costs total irrigation costs per hectare are t c i t c g t w i t c k t c where g t variable cost in dollars per millimeter of water applied per hectare and k t is the fixed irrigation cost per dollar per hectare the fixed cost does not depend on the energy requirements of the irrigation technology or land quality further it is assumed that the investment costs associated with adopting an efficient irrigation technology are higher than the investment costs of an inefficient irrigation technology k 2 c k 1 c 2 3 profit maximization 3 3 not all costs are considered by the profit function in eq 2 because of data unavailability and mathematical complexities therefore the term profit as used in this paper refers to quasi rent or short run profit in the absence of any market restrictions a profit maximizing farmer is assumed to take land quality and crop prices as given and chooses the quantity of water to be applied irrigation technology and crop through a two stage profit maximization procedure in the first stage the farmer decides on the optimal amount of water to be applied for a given combination of crop and irrigation technology the combination of crop and irrigation technology that leads to the higher profit is then chosen let π i t c denote quasi rent per ha at this stage for irrigation technology t and crop c where 2 π i t c w i t c h i t θ i max w i t c p c y i t c w i t c h i t θ i g t w i t c k t c the interior solution to eq 2 that is the optimal quantity of water use w i t c can be derived as 3 w i t c a 1 e t p i c 2 a 2 h i t θ i e t p i c 2 g t 2 a 2 p c h i t θ i 2 e t a h i t θ i in the second stage the farmer compares quasi rent per ha for alternative combinations of irrigation technology and crop choosing the combination that maximizes profit the adoption of a more efficient irrigation technology occurs when its quasi rent is positive and larger than that of the less efficient irrigation technology 2 4 water allocation and bilateral trading in southern alberta voluntary transfers of water allocations are allowed within the irrigation districts water transfers within the districts are governed by the irrigation district act of 2000 alberta 2000a 2000b which allows an allocation of water held under a license to be transferred from one parcel of land to another as long as the transfer does not have a detrimental impact on another water user or on the aquatic environment alberta environment 2008 transfer of water allocations can be temporary or permanent temporary transfer or trade refers to the sale of annual allocation of water while permanent trade refers to the sale of water license the model developed here applies to both systems but the simulation results focus on temporary trading in reality there has been very little permanent trading in southern alberta much of the trading in the region has been on temporary trading of water allocation which occurred in 2001 due to a severe drought in this model water trading occurs when there is a difference between the annual quantity allocated and the amount of water needed to produce a particular crop or during drought conditions allowing for the trade off between the cost of water and the value of water some farmers act as buyers and others as sellers the decision to be a seller or buyer depends on the marginal benefits and differences in land quality of the parties in the market after trading the effect of water markets on the adoption of more efficient irrigation technology can be observed by farmers gains from market activities this is based on the economic theory that water markets are responsible for evidencing the true value of water market price for all irrigators decreasing water marginal productivity for buyers i e decreasing buyers demand for more efficient irrigation technology and increasing water marginal productivity for sellers i e increasing sellers demand for more efficient irrigation technology the sequential modeling approach is used to estimate the gains from water trading and the potential impact on crop choice and irrigation technology 4 4 it is also possible to examine this problem using a simultaneous profit maximization approach the sequential approach is selected because the aim of this paper is to determine the probability of farmers switching among irrigation technologies after water trading this method is consistent with previous studies on irrigation technology adoption and water trading including caswell and zilberman 1986 caswell et al 1990 caswell et al 1993 dinar and zilberman 1991 khanna et al 2002 green et al 1996 moreno and sunding 2005 schoengold and sunding 2011 suppose farmers i and j own transferrable rights to their annual water allocation given as w i and w j respectively using the farm based profit function for farmer i and farmer j and their marginal benefit functions it is possible to examine whether or not there are trading opportunities for these farmers from eq 2 the profit maximization decision making processes before water trading for farmers i and j can be specified as 4 π i t c w i h i t θ i p i c y i t c w i h i t θ i g i t w i k i t c 5 π j t c w j h j t θ j p j c y j t c w j h j t θ j g j t w j k j t c the first order conditions from eqs 4 and 5 are 6 π i t c w i p i c a 1 i e t p i

this model is that a farmer with a higher marginal benefit for water tends to have a greater incentive to purchase water from a farmer with lower marginal benefit thus water trading rules can be simplified as 5 5 the farmers involved in trading may have different crops in situations where the crops are the same the differences between farmers would be captured by the variation in land quality if π i t i c i w i π j t j c j w j there are mutually beneficial trade opportunities assuming transaction cost is zero 6 6 it should be noted that it is not necessary for all such derivatives to be unequal just the two derivatives representing the pre trade optimal decisions for the two trading farmers suppose that π i t i c i w i π j t j c j w j in this case farmer i buys water from farmer j if trade occurs between these farmers the amount of water traded x j i between i and j is determined by 7 7 as these traders contemplate a potential trade of water they are assumed to each actively consider their optimized post trade choice of crop and technology for possible levels of x j i the bounds on how much each would be prepared to bid or accept for each marginal unit of water x j i are defined with reference to all possible crops and irrigation technology choices 8 π i t i c i w i x j i w i π j t j c j w j x j i w j by combining eqs 1 3 5 as well as 6 8 the solution for the amount of water traded x j i is given in eq 9 below 9 x j i a 1 i p i c i h i t i θ i e t p i c i a 1 j p j c j h j t j θ j e t p j c j β 1 2 e t a β 2 g j t j g i t i 2 a 2 i p i c i h i t i θ i e t p i c i

functions π i t c π j t c for farmers i and j can be expressed as 12 π i t c x j i h i t θ i p i c a 0 a 1 δ i a 2 δ i 2 y p i c g i t w i t c x j i k i t c u j i x j i 13 π j t c x j i h j t θ j p j

decision making processes for the traders three additional constraints are required as follows 16 π i t c x j i θ i θ j h i t θ i π i t c w i t c h i t θ i 17 π j t c x j i θ i θ j h j t θ j π j t c w j t c h j t θ j 18 0 x j i θ i θ j w j constraints 16 and 17 ensure the trading parties achieve a level of profit at least equal to the profit they had before initiating any water trading constraint 18 limits the volume of trade to be no greater than the water allocation w j of the seller for the amount of water traded to be feasible it has to be accompanied by a monetary transfer determined through negotiations between the trading parties as follows 19 u j i x j i p i c a 0 a 1 δ i a 2 δ i 2 y p i c g i t w i t c x j i k i t c π i t c 20 u j i x j i π j t c p j c a 0 a 1 δ j a 2 δ j 2 y p j c g j t w j t c x j i k j t c where w t c is the optimal water use and π t c is post trade profit as defined previously after trading it is expected that both the buyer and seller will be willing to invest potential trading gains in farm improvements in the form of irrigation technologies these irrigation technologies can improve both crop yield and farm profit if accompanied by better farm management practices this suggests that for trading to be a beneficial strategy to manage water allocation the farmer with lower land quality must be selling to a farmer with higher land quality it is expected that the selling farmers will adopt efficient irrigation technologies when post trade incremental net benefit of the efficient irrigation technology exceed its cost such that 21 p i c w i 1 c

satisfied both the seller and buyer are expected to adopt efficient irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops they may also decide on the choice of crop that makes the technology profitable under prevailing market conditions implicit in the previous discussion is an assumption that there exists an interior solution for water demand specifically it is assumed that for θ θ θ the interior solution for water demand is w i t c a 1 e t p i c 2 a 2 h i t θ i and that total demand exceeds supply furthermore it is assumed that w i t c a 1 e t p i c 4 a 2 h i t θ i for all farmers technology and crop and that water use decreases with respect to the farmer s land quality w i t c θ i θ i 0 also it is assumed that efficiency of water use must hold when this condition is satisfied a 1 e t p i

river basin ssrb in southern alberta canada there are 13 irrigation districts in the study area and the irrigation authorities set the rules on water allocation the irrigation districts control 80 of the water used to irrigate approximately 1 4 million acres of crops per year in the ssrb alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 these irrigable lands are used to cultivate a variety of crop types including forages 33 9 cereals 31 5 oil seeds 11 1 specialty crops 21 6 and others 2 0 alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 the variety of crops grown across the districts illustrate the heterogeneity in terms of farmers and farm characteristics production and irrigation technology adoption patterns vary across districts as well but about 80 of the farmers in the ssrb use pivot sprinkler irrigation technologies alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 as noted earlier an augmented quadratic production function eq 1 is used to represent crop water yield functions uma 1982 used experimental approach to estimate crop specific coefficients for major irrigated crops with the ratio of actual yield y t c to potential yield y p c being represented as a second degree polynomial function this study generated crop specific regression coefficients and these coefficients are incorporated into the model and presented in table 1 data for e t a e t p c and y p c were collected for 12 main crops table 1 these 12 crops represent about 62 of the total irrigated area under cultivation in the ssrb alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 typically the growing season e t a for southern alberta ranges from 225 to 300 mm for most irrigated crops uma 1982 bennett and harms 2011 and these values were used in the calibration and simulation nominal price data were also obtained for these crops prices were gathered from reports such as the alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 alberta agriculture yearbook 2018 and agriculture financial services corporation commodity 2018 irrigation water management study committee 2002 a corn silage price at 60 moisture was taken from the agriculture financial services corporation commodity afsc price survey 2018 to reduce price trend variability the series is converted to 2012 dollars per ha using the alberta consumer price index the expected price is then calculated as a simple average of the price series table 1 3 1 calibration of land quality and fixed cost of irrigation technologies it is challenging to obtain the distribution of land quality for each farmer in the study area thus alberta s land capability classification system is used to calibrate the proportional distribution of farmers using different irrigation technologies as a function of the land quality parameter this approach is appropriate as it is based on the land classification system and the distribution of the irrigation technologies in the study area in addition alberta has a legislation that provides minimum requirements for any piece of land to be classified as irrigable for farming purposes pannu 2016 the classification depends on soil rating and topographic assessment and the essence is to determine the general capability of land for irrigation use in its present state there are seven land classes in the study area pannu 2016 classes 1 4 are suitable for irrigation effective irrigation cannot be achieved on lands which are not classified as irrigable because of these legislative requirements and district authorities will not supply water to farmers on lands outside this classification this land classification system is adopted and we assumed that for farming to be profitable it must be done on irrigable lands thus farmers are more likely to irrigate on a land which is classified as suitable for irrigation to ensure positive profits consider the ssrb as the irrigation district with heterogeneous land quality this results in different productivities for alternative crops or land uses following the tradition of land use share models lichtenberg 1989 caswell and zilberman 1986 dridi and khanna 2005 feng and babcock 2010 lankoski et al 2010 lankoski and ollikainen 2011 it is assumed that land quality is represented by a parameter normalized into the interval 0 1 with 0 for the worst land i e class 4 and 1 for the best land quality class 1 subsequently the land quality augmenting function h t is calibrated to replicate the distribution of irrigation technologies in the study area in the ssrb there are six main irrigation technologies table 2 these irrigation technologies occupy the total land area for irrigation to index the distribution of farmers with irrigation technologies the percentage share of land occupied by each irrigation technology is calculated the land area occupied by each irrigation technology is divided by the total area occupied by all the irrigation technologies in the study area this value is converted to percentage shares for each irrigation technology table 2 the calibrated value is then used to derive a proportional relationship between the efficiency of water use for each irrigation technology and land quality which is subsequently used in the production function the land quality parameter is then calibrated to replicate the baseline values of irrigated areas under each technology in the ssrb sprinkler low irrigation technology is the dominant technology in the ssrb table 2 based on the percentage share calculations this technology takes about 50 of the land used for irrigation in the ssrb thus this share is used to determine the relative distribution of other irrigation technologies in the ssrb table 2 the values for all irrigation technologies were calibrated with respect to land quality and are shown in table 2 after calibrating for land quality annualized irrigation technology fixed costs k t c are determined fixed cost estimates were obtained from the irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 however using these values to parameterize the model yielded negative profits for most of crops given an assumption of rational behavior by agricultural producers this result did not seem reasonable therefore an alternative approach was used after the calibration of land quality values θ i discussed earlier the fixed costs are then chosen to ensure that the profits generated by the actual outcomes are not negative 8 8 this is consistent with calibration methods used in studies such as howitt 1995 liang 2010 roberts 1994 and cho and cooley 1994 the lower and upper bounds on selected fixed costs of irrigation technologies values used in the model are presented in table 2 after calibrating land quality fixed cost values are then used to estimate optimal water use crop yields and profit per ha for six irrigation technologies and 12 crops data for variable costs of irrigation for each irrigation technology table 2 were obtained from the irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 4 water trading simulation a water trading simulation is conducted for two representative farmers in an irrigation district eqs 2 3 6 7 9 16 20 as well as 21 and 22 are combined to examine the gains from water trading these equations are also used to estimate the probabilities of farmers switching among irrigation technologies and profitable crops after water trading given land quality for the buyer θ i and seller θ j since land quality is random a stochastic simulation is used to examine gains from water trading based on the simulation results and given the range of values assumed for land quality in the study area i e the interval 0 1 beta distribution is used to model land quality this distribution is appropriate because there is limited data on land quality that would be of sufficient quality to empirically estimate a distribution for a farmer as well beta distribution is bounded unlike a normal distribution lastly the results from the simulation are consistent with empirical evidence of technology adoption decisions reported in these previous studies khanna et al 2002 eugene et al 2002 hennessy 2009 nadarajah and kotz 2004 when water trading occurs between the farmers the amount of water exchanged depends on the irrigation technologies and crops of both farmers this means that w j i is a matrix with 144 possible combinations of irrigation technologies and crops in matlab all equations and the optimal conditions are defined as functions the programming is done in such a manner that all the equations and optimal conditions are linked and nested together as functions i e spiral coding this is done to save time in computation of optimal values the approach used to implement the computation of w j i is based on kronecker product of matrices matlab has a built in function kron that can be used as k kron a b alternatively sizes can be created for the individual matrices before performing the matrix multiplication the second approach of creating different sizes for the matrices was adopted because the kron a b syntax was not sufficient when the size of matrices are more than 50 by 50 which was the case in this thesis at the end of trading the price of water u i j is determined as defined and explained earlier similarly the marginal benefit functions of the parties before trade are used to set the upper bound on the price of water this condition defines the upper bound on the price of water above which trading is not beneficial to both parties the upper bound on the price of water is denoted as u furthermore it is assumed that the probability of u i j being greater than u is insignificant and therefore the analysis is restricted to the range of prices for which the farm produces maximum output with any technology and crop combinations carey and zilberman 2002 subsequently eqs 16 and 17 are used to ensure that profits from producing must be greater than or equal to the profit without water trading thus for each technology and crop the farm s decision to produce is determined by the total profit condition eqs 19 and 20 in each case the cutoff is the same for buyers and seller but varies with irrigation technology and crops as well as land quality both the price of water and the amount of water exchanged depend on the random variable of land quality given all the other parameters of the model there is a unique price u i j and quantity of water w j i exchanged that maximizes both traders profits so that eqs 16 and 17 are satisfied in matlab two functions were created to search for the price of water and the amount of water exchanged u i j w j i that satisfied profit maximizing conditions specified earlier and subsequently conditions 16 and 17 the simulation finds the price and quantity of water exchanged that generate post trade profit for both parties that is equal to or greater than pre trade profit eqs 16 and 17 the theoretical foundation of this approach is based on the irrigation technology adoption literature such as caswell and zilberman 1986 dinar and zilberman 1991 khanna et al 2002 dridi and khanna 2005 alberta agriculture yearbook 2018 dinar and letey 1991 carey and zilberman 2002 after the computations of water price and the amount of water exchanged the simulation analysis is used to estimate the potential gains from trade and to generate probability estimates of the frequency with which water trading results in sufficient producer gains for changes to occur in optimal irrigation technology or crop choice the stochastic simulation entails drawing random land quality values for the buyer and the seller in each period of water trading the water trading simulation results are summarized as transition probabilities to show the likelihood of a buyer or a seller moving from one irrigation technology to another post trade collins 1973 anderson and goodman 1957 gains from water trading irrigation technology adoption and switching regimes of crops were simulated based on 10 000 iterations the simulation was done in matlab under two scenarios in the ssrb the districts have established the maximum amount of water that may be supplied to each acre for irrigation activities these amounts of water differ across districts but in general the annual allocation is in the range of 18 24 in per acre eid 2002 when water is allocated it is the farmers responsibility to decide on how to use their water for crop production if farmers adopt efficient irrigation technologies or change their farm management practices to save water they can sell the extra water to other farmers within the same district this is the base scenario and assumes that farmers have their full annual allocation of water the second scenario is formulated such that farmers are not able to receive the required annual water entitlement this situation may occur when there is a drought for instance in 2001 the allocations within the districts were reduced to nine inches per acre and in some districts it was 12 in per acre the limit set by the districts during drought years is used in this second scenario in both scenarios the decision is made based on the minimum of allocation and the optimal water quantity derived in eq 3 the second scenario is selected to represent the future water scarcity market in the study area 4 1 simulation results the results on hypothetical performance of the water market simulated are presented to illustrate the volumes of water exchanged market prices reached and features characterizing more active agents buyers and sellers typically the gains from trade for each combination of irrigation technology and crop should be provided however there are computational issues associated with this since the simulation of gains is done using stochastic methods to illustrate potential gains the mean differences of pre trade and post trade profits are utilized also these results are presented for three levels of land quality low 0 25 medium 0 5 and high 0 75 table 3 as expected the potential gains from trade increase for both traders with increasing land quality these results suggest that under high land quality both traders find water trading to be profitable it is possible that farmers decision making follow rational adoption assumption in deciding on how to use the gains from water trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies additionally these results provide an indication of the potential gains from trade that farmers under different land qualities may obtain and their implications for irrigation technology adoption and crop choices the final level of monetary exchange is obtained through negotiation between the traders and cannot be determined within the framework presented in this paper nevertheless for various potential water trade levels that induce efficient irrigation technology adoption the potential monetary exchange is shown in table 3 which indicates that there are positive gains from trade the potential gains estimated from the simulation are dependent on the price of water amount of water exchanged and the irrigation technologies as well as crop choices all these values also depend on the level of land quality for simplicity we present the summary statistics of the mean values of price and amount of water exchanged during water trading table 4 the simulation results reveal a mean price of water as 4 11 ha mm and the mean amount of water exchanged to be 236 73 mm 4 1 1 results from scenarios one and two potential gains from irrigation technology adoption simulation results are presented in this section to indicate the likelihood of farmers switching among different irrigation technologies post trade transition probabilities are used to summarize the results a strictly positive probability indicates the existence of gains from switching among the irrigation technologies transition probabilities represent the likelihood of a buyer or a seller switching to other irrigation technologies post trade they are derived by dividing the number of times a given farmer with a technology or a crop switch from current technology to any other technology by the total number of occurrences of that technology or crop this normalizes each row so that it sums to one and the value represents the gain of a farmer switching from one irrigation technology to another in the transition probability matrix the columns refer to the current irrigation technology being used while the rows identify irrigation technology adopted at the end of trading in this analysis the diagonal elements of the transition matrix represent the probabilities of retaining the same irrigation technology going across a particular row indicates the transition probability of using existing technology to the transition probability of using a new technology post trade the simulation results show that under no scarcity conditions there are limited opportunities for both traders to switch to a more efficient irrigation technology if the initial technology is gravity developed both traders are more likely to switch back to gravity flood technology than any other option that is shift to a less efficient technology table 5 similarly in cases when the initial technology is sprinkler high pressure there is a significant probability for both the seller 75 and buyer 100 to change to gravity flood irrigation technology under scarcity conditions both water trading parties are more likely to switch to other irrigation technologies table 6 however there is no consistent pattern in terms of the direction of the switch for traders initially using gravity flood developed technology both buyers and sellers there is approximately a 50 probability of switching to a more efficient technology similarly for buyers who are initially using sprinkler wheel move technology there is approximately a 55 probability of switching to technology that is more efficient with other scenarios however both buyers and sellers have greater probabilities of either switching to less efficient irrigation technology or staying with the same irrigation technology table 6 these results suggest that the decision for a farmer to adopt efficient irrigation technology does not only depend on the gain from water trading dinar and letey 1991 also post trade it is possible that the benefits of increased irrigation efficiency do not outweigh the higher investment costs as represented by the fixed costs seo et al 2008 schaible et al 1991 and water trading may discourage the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies feng and eduardo 1992 found that about 11 of all the farmers in southern high plains of texas are likely to switch from conventional sprinkler system to gravity systems and concluded that the low transition probability of farmers to efficient irrigation technologies may be due to economic and marginal gains in water efficiency also these results tend to support the survey evidence of private irrigators in southern alberta private irrigators are not willing to adopt efficient irrigation technologies unless the benefits are greater than the costs of adoption these farmers also believed that they already used all the water saving irrigation technologies that are practical for their farming purposes nicol et al 2010 results presented in this section are also consistent with previous theoretical and empirical studies on irrigation technology adoption and water trading dridi and khanna 2005 found that water trading occurs between traders with high land quality and it is possible for water trading to discourage the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies there is a strong evidence to support this empirically caswell and zilberman 1986 lichtenberg 1989 for high quality land the gain from adopting efficient irrigation technologies cannot offset the higher level of fixed costs and this indicates that less efficient irrigation technology may be profitable at high quality land these results are consistent with previous study on irrigation technology adoption and investment options in the us by carey and zilberman 2002 who found that with water trading farmers have the option to wait and invest in efficient irrigation technologies at a later stage they also found that farmers are more likely to use the additional water to augment their current water supplies and not necessary adopt efficient irrigation technologies these results may also be at least partly a function of model assumptions and the calibration done for irrigation fixed costs the fixed costs per ha used in the analysis should reflect the cost of investing in alternative technologies it is conceivable that simply substituting one fixed cost for another does not accurately capture the economics of making that type of investment disinvestment decision the analysis also does not incorporate risk in comprehensive fashion a complete risk analysis would incorporate the level of risk endogenously in the modeling of water trading and technology adoption which is not done in the current analysis finally there is ambiguity of the direction of technology adoption induced by water trading given the outcomes of the simulation it is possible that both sellers and buyers do not know the distribution of gains from water trading this aversion could affect the parties decision to adopt efficient irrigation technologies post trade farmers may have in mind a reference gain from the irrigation technology based on expectations if the reference gain is higher than the gains obtained with the new irrigation technology farmers may perceive the technology as involving losses if this ambiguity is present then the effect of non rational choice on technology adoption could work against rational adoption approach and slow the adoption of efficient technologies the studies on effect of ambiguity on technology choice problem revealed mixed results warnick et al 2011 found that ambiguity aversion leads to a lower adoption of a new crop diversification in peru barham et al 2014 found that ambiguity aversion speeds up the adoption of gm corn in the us although risks and ambiguity are not explicitly captured with the current model there is the need to assess how these factors affect the technology choice problem and the impact of water trading on technology adoptions 4 1 2 modified water trading model restricted opportunity to change irrigation technology the results in the previous section suggest limitations associated with the water trading analysis since irrigators make the choice about the irrigation technology to adopt they can decide to change current technology for a more efficient or less efficient technology depending on the effect of these changes on their expected profits as a result a revised water trading simulation is conducted in which the same two water allocation scenarios are modeled but the model is restricted in the sense that the only opportunities for switching technology are to move to more efficient technologies it should be noted that the revised model suffers from the same limitations in terms of modeling fixed costs and investment requirements the intent of the scenario is to support the current government policy of encouraging farmers to adopt only efficient irrigation technologies in southern alberta 4 1 3 simulation results for restricted scenario one potential gains from irrigation technology adoption the simulation results table 7 show that with full water allocation there are limited incentives to adopt technology that is more efficient there are positive transition probabilities for farmers both buyers and sellers initially using gravity developed technology to switch to more efficient technology similarly for water sellers initially using sprinkler high pressure technology there is a positive probability of switching to sprinkler low technology post trade table 7 in all other cases there is a 100 probability of retention of the initial irrigation technology these results appear to suggest that there are limited incentives for either party to switch from current technologies to the most efficient technologies after trading this is despite the fact that there are gains in terms of increased yield and the possibility of using the saved water to irrigate other farmlands the results tend to confirm previous studies examining adoption of improved irrigation technologies in southern alberta nicol et al 2008 and other irrigation areas such the pacific northwest schaible et al 1991 and colorado bauder et al 1997 while it is possible for farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies the simulation results show that less adoption may occur when water is not scarce and that an improved technology is more likely to be adopted when it is practical economically feasible and during drought conditions marques et al 2005 4 1 4 simulation results for restricted scenario two potential gains from irrigation technology adoption the simulation results show that under scarcity conditions there is more potential for movement from less efficient to more efficient irrigation technology post trade table 8 for example in the case of a seller who initially uses gravity developed technology the transition probabilities show that there is a 41 chance of switching to sprinkler irrigation technologies table 8 however there is a 100 probability of retention of initial technology in the case of gravity flood based on the results for the transition probability matrix in table 8 there is a significant likelihood of the sellers and buyers switching to other irrigation technologies suggesting that the economic benefits outweigh the costs of converting switching technology post trade these results show that if the benefits that come out from water trading simulations were sustained then it would encourage investments in efficient irrigation technologies 4 1 5 results from restricted scenarios one and two potential gains from crop switching after water trading in this section simulation results are presented and discussed for the two water trading scenarios full allocation and water scarcity allowing producers to both switch from their current irrigation technology and to choose another crop post trade as with the previous simulation model scenarios buyers and sellers are restricted to either keep their current irrigation technology or switch to a more efficient technology with regard to no scarcity conditions the simulation results reveal that both parties are likely to remain with these crops after water trading 9 9 thus these results are not presented however under scarcity conditions the simulation results indicate that there is a greater potential for both parties to switch from potatoes to other crops the simulation results show that the buyer has 80 chance of still growing potatoes a 5 chance to switch to alfalfa a 13 chance to switch to dry beans and sugar beets while a 2 chance of switching to some other crop the seller has a 57 chance of still growing potatoes a 23 chance of switching from potatoes to sugar beets or dry beans a 12 chance of switching to alfalfa and 8 chance of still growing crops such as wheat barley and flaxseed these results are as expected since buyers tend to grow high valued crops such as potatoes and sugar beets it is not surprising to observe that they are likely to remain with current crop after water trading specialty crops such as potatoes and sugar beets require more water for optimal production and higher profits these conditions are necessary for both parties to ensure that there is adequate water to produce these crops 4 2 strategies to stimulate irrigation technology adoption the simulation analysis suggests limited potential for switching to more efficient irrigation technology under full water allocation therefore if policy makers identify improved efficiency in water use as an important policy goal it may be necessary to consider policy instruments to induce farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops during times when water scarcity is not imminent the two main strategies selected to stimulate the impact of water trading on the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies are 1 a subsidy on the cost of adopting efficient irrigation technology and 2 an increase in crop prices if processing facilities are available these strategies were selected because they are the main economic factors that are likely to influence a farmer who is contemplating adopting an efficient irrigation technology scheierling et al 2006 moreover farmers in the study area reported these factors as the main constraints to adopting an efficient irrigation technology nicol et al 2008 2010 4 2 1 subsidy on irrigation technology adoption in assessing the possibility of subsidizing irrigation technology adoption the implicit assumption regarding farmers adoption behavior is that they may switch to an improved irrigation technology when expected net returns under the subsidy approach are greater than would be the case from continuing with the existing irrigation practice in order to encourage the farmer to adopt an efficient irrigation technology a minimum public cost share would be needed to subsidize adoption costs to examine the effect of different cost sharing arrangements on the impact of water trading on irrigation technology adoption a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the annualized irrigation technology set up cost paid by the farmer and a potential public agency responsible for providing the subsidy a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the level of subsidy that could encourage a farmer to adopt an efficient irrigation technology to produce high valued crops specifically the percentage of capital cost paid by the public agency is parametrically increased from zero to 80 in 20 increments for the restricted technology adoption scenarios the sensitivity analysis shows that with a subsidy of 20 40 both the seller and buyer are likely to remain with their current level of irrigation technology adoption however the sensitivity analysis indicates a significant variation on the impact of water trading on efficient irrigation technology adoptions when the subsidy level is at 60 as reported in table 9 at this level of subsidy both the seller and the buyer are more likely to switch from wheel move irrigation technology to the sprinkler irrigation technologies the buyer is more likely to switch from wheel move irrigation technology to sprinkler low irrigation than the seller table 9 in all scenarios considered both the seller and buyer are likely to remain with gravity developed irrigation technology it appears that a subsidy is still limited in terms of the impact of water trading to induce adoption of these irrigation technologies the above simulation results suggest that with the provision of a sufficient level of subsidy farmers would have incentives to switch to an improved irrigation technology under no scarcity conditions 4 2 2 crop output price increase the theoretical model is used to examine whether increased crop prices over the 2012 base reference prices could encourage farmers in the ssrb to adopt an efficient irrigation technology the initial simulation analysis assumes constant real prices for the crops considered in the study the implicit assumption is that when a farmer decides to switch to an efficient irrigation technology to cultivate a high valued crop such as potatoes there will be a processing facility nearby to absorb the produce or a better marketing system to support the delivery of the produce to the consumers in reality high valued crops such as potatoes are produced on a contract basis with processing companies in the study area and given the limits on capacity not all producers would be able to grow this crop as a first step the restricted version of the water trading profit model is solved to establish the base case with no price increase the sensitivity analysis performed on crop price variable increased crop prices by 30 in 10 increments the analysis shows that increasing crop prices by 30 given the base year prices could lead to a 42 probability of conversion from gravity developed to sprinkler high and sprinkler low irrigation technologies for the buyer while the seller has a 32 chance of switching to these irrigation technologies 10 10 the results do not change for 10 and 20 increases in crop prices the results for the price change scenarios are not provided in tabular form the analysis shows that the buyer is more likely to remain with crops such as potatoes and sugar beets than the seller potatoes and sugar beets are among the highest valued crops in the ssrb and it would be beneficial for farmers with poor quality land to adopt efficient technologies for these crops with the assurance of a better marketing system 5 policy conclusions this paper applies a microeconomic modeling framework to quantitatively analyze the gains from water trading and the opportunities for farmers to adopt an efficient irrigation technology to produce the most profitable crops post trade a short run profit model was calibrated and simulated for two main policy scenarios of water allocation conditions under restricted and unrestricted models simulation results of the unrestricted model under no scarcity conditions show that both traders are likely to remain with their current irrigation technologies under scarcity conditions the simulation results show that water traders are more likely to switch to less efficient irrigation technologies after water trading these results suggest that water trading provides relatively limited incentive for a farmer to switch post trade to an improved irrigation system this could be due to the high cost of switching from an inefficient to an efficient irrigation technology furthermore results from strategies necessary to stimulate the impact of water trading on the adoption of improved irrigation technologies under no scarcity conditions of the restricted model show that farmers are more likely to switch to an improved irrigation technology under subsidy considerations and higher crop price regimes change the simulation results of the restricted model reveal that farmers are more likely to use their improved irrigation technologies to cultivate high valued crops overall the results show that if the benefits that come out from water trading were sustained then it would encourage investments in efficient irrigation technologies and crop choices in conclusion water trading under restricted conditions high crop price regimes and provision of subsidies on the impact of water trading on technology adoptions could encourage farmers to adopt improved irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops consequently adopting improved irrigation technologies allow farmers to cultivate high valued crops which require more water and increase irrigated areas in order to improve profits the theoretical model does not include extensive margin effects as the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies could lead to increased use of water this is because these strategies do not provide economic incentive to reduce the acreage irrigated reduce water use or encourage farmers to switch to less water consuming crops when irrigated acreage is unlimited the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies are likely to lead to more water usage and these could lead to a situation in which irrigated land expands while water resources are overexploited this is evident in previous studies in the us which found that the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies resulted in increased use of water pfeiffer and cynthia lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 thus policies necessary to provide incentives to farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies and to improve crop yields may be supported by controlling water usage and the expansion of irrigated acreage berbel et al 2015 in retrospect there are some limitations associated with this research which should be addressed as a means of improvement for further studies some of these i e risk treatment of fixed costs and investment requirements have been discussed earlier an additional limitation is with respect to the effect of transaction costs and water trading transaction costs have been cited as a reason that more water transfers do not take place even when large price differences exist among alternative users young 1986 nicol and klein 2006 nicol et al 2008 carey et al 2002 livingston 1995 it would be beneficial if this model could be adapted to capture this aspect transaction costs were not included in the current model due to data limitations the model assumed that a farmer would select an efficient irrigation technology to produce the most profitable crop in practice a farmer is likely to cultivate a range of crops on his farm future studies could extend this model to capture the adoption decisions of a farmer to cultivate a mixture of crops the analysis undertaken here does not allow for a single market price but instead assumes prices for individual transactions being based on own benefits from the trade if there is a significant volume of trade in any given irrigation district it would be expected that a single price may be established for water the results presented in this paper may be more representative of situations where the market for water remains thin or during drought regimes where buyers and sellers simultaneously exchange water without a market price as well one contribution of this analysis is the impact of water trading on cropping and irrigation technology decisions this result is not dependent on the existence of a formal water market and associated market prices a modeling framework that simultaneously incorporates individual producer decisions and market prices for water is possible but is beyond the scope of this paper the model focuses on water trading between farmers in ssrb and intent to capture optimal allocation of limited water resources in the farmland the model results show that farmers are not likely to move to high water saving technology and it is possible that both the buyer and the seller confront the same situation although there may be difference in land quality crops etc a future scenario will be to explore the benefit of water trading between different water use sectors e g between agriculture and industry in this case the farmer should see long term benefit despite the weather condition and would prefer to high technology water saving method despite the high fixed investment the potential efficient outcomes notwithstanding water utilization and allocation have a number of important social implications necessitating social policy interventions due to the public nature of water resource and pollution costs farmers often do not internalize all costs in essence all these costs may require public monitoring and enforcement policy the divergence in these social and private outcomes may result in situations where allocation may not be done based on the most efficient outcomes for example although allocating water to the most efficient or highest value crop may be the most efficient private outcome social policy may dictate otherwise after the internalization of benefits and costs often not considered by private end users such as farmers the design of optimal water use policy may need to consider a combination of both private and socially relevant factors it is important to stress that though there are some private gains to adopt efficient irrigation technologies these gains may be insufficient to induce socially desirable levels of adoption from public policy perspectives if it is socially desirable to increase the irrigation effectiveness in order to reduce water use or improve the environment it may be relevant for the government to encourage efficient irrigation technology adoption in this regard the government can support policies that promote adoption by subsidizing all or part of the fixed costs of efficient irrigation technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

10056,in this paper we modeled water trading in southern alberta by incorporating irrigation technologies and crop choices we consider six irrigation technologies and twelve crops with a variation in land quality to examine the adoption gains from water trading the results are summarized to account for the gains from water trading and the probability of farmers switching to efficient irrigation technologies to cultivate profitable crops simulation results suggest that famers are more likely to follow rational adoption approach in using the gain from water trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies this is more likely to occur when the net gain is higher than the cost of adopting an irrigation technology however sensitivity analysis shows that high crop price regimes and provision of subsidies on the impact of water trading on technology adoptions could encourage farmers to adopt improved irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops effective policies to provide incentives to farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies and to improve crop yields may be necessary for the study area keywords heterogeneity land quality profit function water price simulation water trading 1 background and justification water scarcity is a major concern at both national and global levels the urgency of this issue has become more pertinent because of increasing populations urbanization oil exploration and highly variable flows of water alberta is among the jurisdictions in the world that are concerned with managing limited water supply issues as it deals with recurrent droughts climate variabilities and unequal water distribution amec 2014 about 80 of the demand for water in alberta comes from the southern part of the province but majority of water lies in the northern part of the province awpa 2020 babkir 2018 farmers in the southern part of the province mainly depend on irrigation for crop production as irrigation accounts for 71 of surface water allocation in the province alberta environment 2008 in addition unstable economic growth and increasing urbanization rates have intensified industrial and municipal water demand pressures much of it bearing on southern part of the province aside from unequal distribution of water alberta is also approaching full allocation of water supply in the south and policies are required to address water management issues in response to this unequal spatial distribution of water and the challenge of developing sustainable measures to manage water in the southern part of the province alberta s water for life strategy was formulated in 2003 and renewed in 2008 this strategy envisions a holistic approach towards managing provincial water by addressing present and future water scarcity challenges this policy document outlines key water management recommendations one of which is to achieve efficiency and productivity of water use in alberta through the application of economic instruments alberta environment 2008 previously the benefits of economic instruments such as water trading had been given policy recognition in the water act alberta 2000a section 81 and in the irrigation district act alberta 2000b section 11 these policy documents stressed on the need to adopt water management principles with a focus on ensuring more effective and efficient use of water and to enhance water transfer system that support economic development alberta water council 2017 water trading is a feasible strategy to achieve efficiency and productivity of water however potential benefits from water trading at the farm level occur when irrigators use the gains from trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies or shift to crops that require less water adopting efficient irrigation technologies such as sprinkler low pressure or micro drip technologies lead to a higher proportion of applied water getting to the root zones of crops essentially the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies at the farm level could improve yields and reduce production and energy costs schuck et al 2005 as well as potentially conserving quantities of water for alternative uses in the south saskatchewan river basin ssrb which is the main watershed in southern alberta farmers have the consumptive right to most of the water they are allowed to divert to their farms achieving an efficient market for water is problematic because of transaction costs inadequate number of willing buyers and sellers and water transportation constraints livingston 1995 nicol and klein 2006 palomo hierro et al 2015 thus it is important to understand farmers decision making processes in terms of impacts on the gains from water trading irrigation technology adoption and crop choices there is an extensive literature on the economics of irrigated agriculture water trading and the gains from irrigation technology studies by adamowicz and horbulyk 1996 nicol and klein 2006 nicol et al 2008 for example have focused on estimating gains associated with introducing water markets and pricing systems in southern alberta mahan et al 2002 cutlac et al 2006 cutlac and horbulyk 2011 and he et al 2012 examined efficiency gains from water trading however these studies do not capture farm level incentives for irrigation technology adoption crop choices or heterogeneity issues differences in land quality among farmers has been observed as an important factor in determining adoption decisions for both irrigation technologies and crop choices at the farm level caswell and zilberman 1986 farm level profit models allowing for heterogeneity in land quality have been used to examine gains from irrigation technology adoption caswell and zilberman 1986 external effects of input use and environmental policies in resources conservation and pollution reduction caswell et al 1990 these models have also been used to investigate the diffusion of resource quality augmenting irrigation technologies under output supply and input demand effects caswell et al 1993 again these studies do not consider the potential of trading water rights as an incentive to encourage efficient water use the existing literature on water trading and technology adoption focuses on drainage reduction dinar and letey 1991 and price uncertainty carey and zilberman 2002 dridi and khanna 2005 considered water allocation water trading and irrigation technology adoption in the presence of imperfect information but only for a single crop little attention has been given to the investigation of gains from farmers switching among different irrigation technologies and or crops to adopt more profitable combinations of irrigation technologies and crops after water trading typically farmers are faced with several combinations of irrigation technology and crop choices and it is not a simple decision to choose an efficient technology to produce a profitable crop however it is conceivable that after water trading farmers will consider the profitability of alternative technology and crop selection decisions in this situation it is possible to examine the gains under the different switching regimes after water trading the purpose of this study is to calibrate a farm based profit equation model and use it to simulate irrigation technology decisions by southern alberta crop farmers in order to 1 account for the probability of farmers switching from a less efficient to a more efficient irrigation technology to produce profitable crops after trading 2 estimate the probabilities of farmers switching from lower valued crops to the higher valued crops after trading and 3 examine gains of water trading in the presence of alternative water conservation policies specifically the caswell and zilberman 1986 modeling approach is applied to southern alberta the analysis in this paper however extends the caswell and zilberman 1986 model to simulate water trading between two representative farmers by 1 including six main irrigation technologies and 12 crops 2 accounting for water trading irrigation technology adoption and crop choices under drought conditions 3 modifying the production function to reflect actual crop yields in the study area by incorporating average annual precipitation spring soil moisture and potential crop evapotranspiration with the intent of providing accurate measure of water use and 4 applying the model to examine possible future water allocation policies in southern alberta the rest of the paper is organized as follows the next section provides a discussion of the theoretical modeling framework this is followed by a brief description of the study area we then present the stylized results of the model and the water trading simulation results the last section deals with the policy conclusions and limitations of the study 2 theoretical model consider that there are n farmers potentially producing c different crops using different irrigation technologies and water as inputs let p c be the exogenous output price for the c th crop land quality for the i th farmer denoted by θ i is heterogeneous and is distributed with a density f θ i and a cumulative distribution f θ i over the range θ θ farmers choose from m feasible irrigation technologies and the variations in the technologies based on their application efficiency of water use the amount of water applied and effective water used i e actual consumption per crop per hectare for irrigation technology t and crop c are denoted as w i t c and e i t c respectively irrigation effectiveness is the ratio of effective water used to the applied water and is represented by a land quality augmenting function h i t θ i such that effective water is defined as the function h t is the percentage of water effectively used by the crop and takes a value from 0 to 1 to illustrate the effect of land quality and irrigation technology choices assume that there are two irrigation technologies an efficient technology t 2 and an inefficient technology t 1 the efficient irrigation technology is assumed to have higher irrigation effectiveness than the inefficient irrigation technology 1 1 first and second derivatives of the function with respective to land quality h t θ i 0 h t θ i 0 implying positive but decreasing marginal gains in irrigation effectiveness with improved land quality the relationship between the two irrigation technologies is such that h 2 θ i h 1 θ i θ for 0 θ i 1 while h 2 0 0 and h 2 1 1 the above relationships imply that the gap between h 2 and h 1 decreases with improved land quality the land quality parameter which differentiates farmers is given as θ θ θ and h t θ θ α t is the definition of irrigation technology effectiveness and α t is elasticity of irrigation with respect to land quality 2 2 this measures how responsive the land is to further irrigation practically this means that an increase in land quality results in a reduction in the price of effective irrigation and assuming decreasing marginal productivity the optimal amount of effective water has increased leading to an increase in both output and quasi rent per ha caswell and zilberman 1986 adoption of the least efficient irrigation technology corresponds to α t 1 while the efficient irrigation technology is represented by α t 0 1 2 1 production function in applied production economic analysis it is often necessary to select a functional form to describe the underlying technology irrigation technology adoption studies often incorporate flexible functional forms such as a quadratic function carey and zilberman 2002 koundouri et al 2006 for example the quadratic function has the ability to model multiple stages of production and varying degrees of input substitutability this study employs an augmented quadratic production function which depends on effectiveness of irrigation water as a function of land quality unlike other studies this production function takes effective irrigation actual and potential evapotranspiration and moisture availability let y i t c be the actual yield per crop per hectare we define y i t c f z where z is defined as ratio of moisture use by crops and moisture availability the specific relationship of this ratio can be given as uma 1982 irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 z e t a w i t c h i t θ i e t p i c e t p c is the amount of evaporation from soil and transpiration from crops which occurs given sufficient moisture availability uma 1982 moisture availability is comprised of spring soil moisture ssm effective precipitation prcp and effective irrigation w i t c h i t θ i however actual evapotranspiration e t a is estimated as the sum of ssm and prcp prcp is the effective precipitation used in the growing season in the form of rain or snow with a 10 adjustment to account for drainage losses when soil moisture levels are near optimal uma 1982 ssm is further defined as the spring soil moisture available at the start of a growing season which depends on the amount of moisture stored in the soil at the end of the previous season plus winter precipitation uma 1982 the production function for farmer i can be formulated as 1 y i t c a 0 a 1 e t a e i t c e t p i c a 2 e t a e i t c e t p i c 2 y p c where y p c is the potential yield per crop per hectare and a 1 0 a 2 0 and a 0 0 are crop specific regression coefficients as specified the production function has the properties of a neoclassical production function that is concavity and the marginal productivity of effective water is assumed to be nonnegative but declining i e y i t c 0 y i t c 0 this means that in the economic production range of water use marginal productivity of water is positive and increasing with the amount of effective water 2 2 irrigation technology costs total irrigation costs per hectare are t c i t c g t w i t c k t c where g t variable cost in dollars per millimeter of water applied per hectare and k t is the fixed irrigation cost per dollar per hectare the fixed cost does not depend on the energy requirements of the irrigation technology or land quality further it is assumed that the investment costs associated with adopting an efficient irrigation technology are higher than the investment costs of an inefficient irrigation technology k 2 c k 1 c 2 3 profit maximization 3 3 not all costs are considered by the profit function in eq 2 because of data unavailability and mathematical complexities therefore the term profit as used in this paper refers to quasi rent or short run profit in the absence of any market restrictions a profit maximizing farmer is assumed to take land quality and crop prices as given and chooses the quantity of water to be applied irrigation technology and crop through a two stage profit maximization procedure in the first stage the farmer decides on the optimal amount of water to be applied for a given combination of crop and irrigation technology the combination of crop and irrigation technology that leads to the higher profit is then chosen let π i t c denote quasi rent per ha at this stage for irrigation technology t and crop c where 2 π i t c w i t c h i t θ i max w i t c p c y i t c w i t c h i t θ i g t w i t c k t c the interior solution to eq 2 that is the optimal quantity of water use w i t c can be derived as 3 w i t c a 1 e t p i c 2 a 2 h i t θ i e t p i c 2 g t 2 a 2 p c h i t θ i 2 e t a h i t θ i in the second stage the farmer compares quasi rent per ha for alternative combinations of irrigation technology and crop choosing the combination that maximizes profit the adoption of a more efficient irrigation technology occurs when its quasi rent is positive and larger than that of the less efficient irrigation technology 2 4 water allocation and bilateral trading in southern alberta voluntary transfers of water allocations are allowed within the irrigation districts water transfers within the districts are governed by the irrigation district act of 2000 alberta 2000a 2000b which allows an allocation of water held under a license to be transferred from one parcel of land to another as long as the transfer does not have a detrimental impact on another water user or on the aquatic environment alberta environment 2008 transfer of water allocations can be temporary or permanent temporary transfer or trade refers to the sale of annual allocation of water while permanent trade refers to the sale of water license the model developed here applies to both systems but the simulation results focus on temporary trading in reality there has been very little permanent trading in southern alberta much of the trading in the region has been on temporary trading of water allocation which occurred in 2001 due to a severe drought in this model water trading occurs when there is a difference between the annual quantity allocated and the amount of water needed to produce a particular crop or during drought conditions allowing for the trade off between the cost of water and the value of water some farmers act as buyers and others as sellers the decision to be a seller or buyer depends on the marginal benefits and differences in land quality of the parties in the market after trading the effect of water markets on the adoption of more efficient irrigation technology can be observed by farmers gains from market activities this is based on the economic theory that water markets are responsible for evidencing the true value of water market price for all irrigators decreasing water marginal productivity for buyers i e decreasing buyers demand for more efficient irrigation technology and increasing water marginal productivity for sellers i e increasing sellers demand for more efficient irrigation technology the sequential modeling approach is used to estimate the gains from water trading and the potential impact on crop choice and irrigation technology 4 4 it is also possible to examine this problem using a simultaneous profit maximization approach the sequential approach is selected because the aim of this paper is to determine the probability of farmers switching among irrigation technologies after water trading this method is consistent with previous studies on irrigation technology adoption and water trading including caswell and zilberman 1986 caswell et al 1990 caswell et al 1993 dinar and zilberman 1991 khanna et al 2002 green et al 1996 moreno and sunding 2005 schoengold and sunding 2011 suppose farmers i and j own transferrable rights to their annual water allocation given as w i and w j respectively using the farm based profit function for farmer i and farmer j and their marginal benefit functions it is possible to examine whether or not there are trading opportunities for these farmers from eq 2 the profit maximization decision making processes before water trading for farmers i and j can be specified as 4 π i t c w i h i t θ

this model is that a farmer with a higher marginal benefit for water tends to have a greater incentive to purchase water from a farmer with lower marginal benefit thus water trading rules can be simplified as 5 5 the farmers involved in trading may have different crops in situations where the crops are the same the differences between farmers would be captured by the variation in land quality if π i t i c i w i π j t j c j w j there are mutually beneficial trade opportunities assuming transaction cost is zero 6 6 it should be noted that it is not necessary for all such derivatives to be unequal just the two derivatives representing the pre trade optimal decisions for the two trading farmers suppose that π i t i c i w i π j t j c j w j in this case farmer i buys water from farmer j if trade occurs between these farmers the amount of water traded x j i between i and j is determined by 7 7 as these traders contemplate a potential trade of water they are assumed to each actively consider their optimized post trade choice of crop and technology for possible levels of x j i the bounds on how much each would be prepared to bid or accept for each marginal unit of water x j i are defined with reference to all possible crops and irrigation technology choices 8 π i t i c i w i x j i w i π j t j c j w j x j i w j by combining eqs 1 3 5 as well as 6 8 the solution for the amount

18 limits the volume of trade to be no greater than the water allocation w j of the seller for the amount of water traded to be feasible it has to be accompanied by a monetary transfer determined

to invest potential trading gains in farm improvements in the form of irrigation technologies these irrigation technologies can improve both crop yield and farm profit if accompanied by better farm management practices this suggests that for trading to be a beneficial strategy to manage water allocation the farmer with lower land quality must be selling to a farmer with higher land quality it is expected that the selling farmers will adopt efficient irrigation technologies when post trade incremental net benefit of the efficient irrigation technology exceed its cost such that 21 p i c w i 1 c

satisfied both the seller and buyer are expected to adopt efficient irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops they may also decide on the choice of crop that makes the technology profitable

river basin ssrb in southern alberta canada there are 13 irrigation districts in the study area and the irrigation authorities set the rules on water allocation the irrigation districts control 80 of the water used to irrigate approximately 1 4 million acres of crops per year in the ssrb alberta agriculture and forestry 2018 these irrigable lands are used to cultivate a variety of crop types including forages 33 9 cereals 31 5 oil seeds 11 1 specialty crops 21 6 and others 2 0 alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 the variety of crops grown across the districts illustrate the heterogeneity in terms of farmers and farm characteristics production and irrigation technology adoption patterns vary across districts as well but about 80 of the farmers in the ssrb use pivot sprinkler irrigation technologies alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 as noted earlier an augmented quadratic production function eq 1 is used to represent crop water yield functions uma 1982 used experimental approach to estimate crop specific coefficients for major irrigated crops with the ratio of actual yield y t c to potential yield y p c being represented as a second degree polynomial function this study generated crop specific regression coefficients and these coefficients are incorporated into the model and presented in table 1 data for e t a e t p c and y p c were collected for 12 main crops table 1 these 12 crops represent about 62 of the total irrigated area under cultivation in the ssrb alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 typically the growing season e t a for southern alberta ranges from 225 to 300 mm for most irrigated crops uma 1982 bennett and harms 2011 and these values were used in the calibration and simulation nominal price data were also obtained for these crops prices were gathered from reports such as the alberta agriculture and forestry 2019 alberta agriculture yearbook 2018 and agriculture financial services corporation commodity 2018 irrigation water management study committee 2002 a corn silage price at 60 moisture was taken from the agriculture financial services corporation commodity afsc price survey 2018 to reduce price trend variability the series is converted to 2012 dollars per ha using the alberta consumer price index the expected price is then calculated as a simple average of the price series table 1 3 1 calibration of land quality and fixed cost of irrigation technologies it is challenging to obtain the distribution of land quality for each farmer in the study area thus alberta s land capability classification system is used to calibrate the proportional distribution of farmers using different irrigation technologies as a function of the land quality parameter this approach is appropriate as it is based on the land classification system and the distribution of the irrigation technologies in the study area in addition alberta has a legislation that provides minimum requirements for any piece of land to be classified as irrigable for farming purposes pannu 2016 the classification depends on soil rating and topographic assessment and the essence is to determine the general capability of land for irrigation use in its present state there are seven land classes in the study area pannu 2016 classes 1 4 are suitable for irrigation effective irrigation cannot be achieved on lands which are not classified as irrigable because of these legislative requirements and district authorities will not supply water to farmers on lands outside this classification this land classification system is adopted and we assumed that for farming to be profitable it must be done on irrigable lands thus farmers are more likely to irrigate on a land which is classified as suitable for irrigation to ensure positive profits consider the ssrb as the irrigation district with heterogeneous land quality this results in different productivities for alternative crops or land uses following the tradition of land use share models lichtenberg 1989 caswell and zilberman 1986 dridi and khanna 2005 feng and babcock 2010 lankoski et al 2010 lankoski and ollikainen 2011 it is assumed that land quality is represented by a parameter normalized into the interval 0 1 with 0 for the worst land i e class 4 and 1 for the best land quality class 1 subsequently the land quality augmenting function h t is calibrated to replicate the distribution of irrigation technologies in the study area in the ssrb there are six main irrigation technologies table 2 these irrigation technologies occupy the total land area for irrigation to index the distribution of farmers with irrigation technologies the percentage share of land occupied by each irrigation technology is calculated the land area occupied by each irrigation technology is divided by the total area occupied by all the irrigation technologies in the study area this value is converted to percentage shares for each irrigation technology table 2 the calibrated value is then used to derive a proportional relationship between the efficiency of water use for each irrigation technology and land quality which is subsequently used in the production function the land quality parameter is then calibrated to replicate the baseline values of irrigated areas under each technology in the ssrb sprinkler low irrigation technology is the dominant technology in the ssrb table 2 based on the percentage share calculations this technology takes about 50 of the land used for irrigation in the ssrb thus this share is used to determine the relative distribution of other irrigation technologies in the ssrb table 2 the values for all irrigation technologies were calibrated with respect to land quality and are shown in table 2 after calibrating for land quality annualized irrigation technology fixed costs k t c are determined fixed cost estimates were obtained from the irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 however using these values to parameterize the model yielded negative profits for most of crops given an assumption of rational behavior by agricultural producers this result did not seem reasonable therefore an alternative approach was used after the calibration of land quality values θ i discussed earlier the fixed costs are then chosen to ensure that the profits generated by the actual outcomes are not negative 8 8 this is consistent with calibration methods used in studies such as howitt 1995 liang 2010 roberts 1994 and cho and cooley 1994 the lower and upper bounds on selected fixed costs of irrigation technologies values used in the model are presented in table 2 after calibrating land quality fixed cost values are then used to estimate optimal water use crop yields and profit per ha for six irrigation technologies and 12 crops data for variable costs of irrigation for each irrigation technology table 2 were obtained from the irrigation water management study committee 2002 vol 5 4 water trading simulation a water trading simulation is conducted for two representative farmers in an irrigation district eqs 2 3 6 7 9 16 20 as well as 21 and 22 are combined to examine the gains from water trading these equations are also used to estimate the probabilities of farmers switching among irrigation technologies and profitable crops after water trading given land quality for the buyer θ i and seller θ j since land quality is random a stochastic simulation is used to examine gains from water trading based on the simulation results and given the range of values assumed for land quality in the study area i e the interval 0 1 beta distribution is used to model land quality this distribution is appropriate because there is limited data on land quality that would be of sufficient quality to empirically estimate a distribution for a farmer as well beta distribution is bounded unlike a normal distribution lastly the results from the simulation are consistent with empirical evidence of technology adoption decisions reported in these previous studies khanna et al 2002 eugene et al 2002 hennessy 2009 nadarajah and kotz 2004 when water trading occurs between the farmers the amount of water exchanged depends on the irrigation technologies and crops of both farmers this means that w j i is a matrix with 144 possible combinations of irrigation technologies and crops in matlab all equations and the optimal conditions are defined as functions the programming is done in such a manner that all the equations and optimal conditions are linked and nested together as functions i e spiral coding this is done to save time in computation of optimal values the approach used to implement the computation of w j i is based on kronecker product of matrices matlab has a built in function kron that can be used as k kron a b alternatively sizes can be created for the individual matrices before performing the matrix multiplication the second approach of creating different sizes for the matrices was adopted because the kron a b syntax was not sufficient when the size of matrices are more than 50 by 50 which was the case in this thesis at the end of trading the price of water u i j is determined as defined and explained earlier similarly the marginal benefit functions of the parties before trade are used to set the upper bound on the price of water this condition defines the upper bound on the price of water above which trading is not beneficial to both parties the upper bound on the price of water is denoted as u furthermore it is assumed that the probability of u i j being greater than u is insignificant and therefore the analysis is restricted to the range of prices for which the farm produces maximum output with any technology and crop combinations carey and zilberman 2002 subsequently eqs 16 and 17 are used to ensure that profits from producing must be greater than or equal to the profit without water trading thus for each technology and crop the farm s decision to produce is determined by the total profit condition eqs 19 and 20 in each case the cutoff is the same for buyers and seller but varies with irrigation technology and crops as well as land quality both the price of water and the amount of water exchanged depend on the random variable of land quality given all the other parameters of the model there is a unique price u i j and quantity of water w j i exchanged that maximizes both traders profits so that eqs 16 and 17 are satisfied in matlab two functions were created to search for the price of water and the amount of water exchanged u i j w j i that satisfied profit maximizing conditions specified earlier and subsequently conditions 16 and 17 the simulation finds the price and quantity of water exchanged that generate post trade profit for both parties that is equal to or greater than pre trade profit eqs 16 and 17 the theoretical foundation of this approach is based on the irrigation technology adoption literature such as caswell and zilberman 1986 dinar and zilberman 1991 khanna et al 2002 dridi and khanna 2005 alberta agriculture yearbook 2018 dinar and letey 1991 carey and zilberman 2002 after the computations of water price and the amount of water exchanged the simulation analysis is used to estimate the potential gains from trade and to generate probability estimates of the frequency with which water trading results in sufficient producer gains for changes to occur in optimal irrigation technology or crop choice the stochastic simulation entails drawing random land quality values for the buyer and the seller in each period of water trading the water trading simulation results are summarized as transition probabilities to show the likelihood of a buyer or a seller moving from one irrigation technology to another post trade collins 1973 anderson and goodman 1957 gains from water trading irrigation technology adoption and switching regimes of crops were simulated based on 10 000 iterations the simulation was done in matlab under two scenarios in the ssrb the districts have established the maximum amount of water that may be supplied to each acre for irrigation activities these amounts of water differ across districts but in general the annual allocation is in the range of 18 24 in per acre eid 2002 when water is allocated it is the farmers responsibility to decide on how to use their water for crop production if farmers adopt efficient irrigation technologies or change their farm management practices to save water they can sell the extra water to other farmers within the same district this is the base scenario and assumes that farmers have their full annual allocation of water the second scenario is formulated such that farmers are not able to receive the required annual water entitlement this situation may occur when there is a drought for instance in 2001 the allocations within the districts were reduced to nine inches per acre and in some districts it was 12 in per acre the limit set by the districts during drought years is used in this second scenario in both scenarios the decision is made based on the minimum of allocation and the optimal water quantity derived in eq 3 the second scenario is selected to represent the future water scarcity market in the study area 4 1 simulation results the results on hypothetical performance of the water market simulated are presented to illustrate the volumes of water exchanged market prices reached and features characterizing more active agents buyers and sellers typically the gains from trade for each combination of irrigation technology and crop should be provided however there are computational issues associated with this since the simulation of gains is done using stochastic methods to illustrate potential gains the mean differences of pre trade and post trade profits are utilized also these results are presented for three levels of land quality low 0 25 medium 0 5 and high 0 75 table 3 as expected the potential gains from trade increase for both traders with increasing land quality these results suggest that under high land quality both traders find water trading to be profitable it is possible that farmers decision making follow rational adoption assumption in deciding on how to use the gains from water trading to adopt efficient irrigation technologies additionally these results provide an indication of the potential gains from trade that farmers under different land qualities may obtain and their implications for irrigation technology adoption and crop choices the final level of monetary exchange is obtained through negotiation between the traders and cannot be determined within the framework presented in this paper nevertheless for various potential water trade levels that induce efficient irrigation technology adoption the potential monetary exchange is shown in table 3 which indicates that there are positive gains from trade the potential gains estimated from the simulation are dependent on the price of water amount of water exchanged and the irrigation technologies as well as crop choices all these values also depend on the level of land quality for simplicity we present the summary statistics of the mean values of price and amount of water exchanged during water trading table 4 the simulation results reveal a mean price of water as 4 11 ha mm and the mean amount of water exchanged to be 236 73 mm 4 1 1 results from scenarios one and two potential gains from irrigation technology adoption simulation results are presented in this section to indicate the likelihood of farmers switching among different irrigation technologies post trade transition probabilities are used to summarize the results a strictly positive probability indicates the existence of gains from switching among the irrigation technologies transition probabilities represent the likelihood of a buyer or a seller switching to other irrigation technologies post trade they are derived by dividing the number of times a given farmer with a technology or a crop switch from current technology to any other technology by the total number of occurrences of that technology or crop this normalizes each row so that it sums to one and the value represents the gain of a farmer switching from one irrigation technology to another in the transition probability matrix the columns refer to the current irrigation technology being used while the rows identify irrigation technology adopted at the end of trading in this analysis the diagonal elements of the transition matrix represent the probabilities of retaining the same irrigation technology going across a particular row indicates the transition probability of using existing technology to the transition probability of using a new technology post trade the simulation results show that under no scarcity conditions there are limited opportunities for both traders to switch to a more efficient irrigation technology if the initial technology is gravity developed both traders are more likely to switch back to gravity flood technology than any other option that is shift to a less efficient technology table 5 similarly in cases when the initial technology is sprinkler high pressure there is a significant probability for both the seller 75 and buyer 100 to change to gravity flood irrigation technology under scarcity conditions both water trading parties are more likely to switch to other irrigation technologies table 6 however there is no consistent pattern in terms of the direction of the switch for traders initially using gravity flood developed technology both buyers and sellers there is approximately a 50 probability of switching to a more efficient technology similarly for buyers who are initially using sprinkler wheel move technology there is approximately a 55 probability of switching to technology that is more efficient with other scenarios however both buyers and sellers have greater probabilities of either switching to less efficient irrigation technology or staying with the same irrigation technology table 6 these results suggest that the decision for a farmer to adopt efficient irrigation technology does not only depend on the gain from water trading dinar and letey 1991 also post trade it is possible that the benefits of increased irrigation efficiency do not outweigh the higher investment costs as represented by the fixed costs seo et al 2008 schaible et al 1991 and water trading may discourage the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies feng and eduardo 1992 found that about 11 of all the farmers in southern high plains of texas are likely to switch from conventional sprinkler system to gravity systems and concluded that the low transition probability of farmers to efficient irrigation technologies may be due to economic and marginal gains in water efficiency also these results tend to support the survey evidence of private irrigators in southern alberta private irrigators are not willing to adopt efficient irrigation technologies unless the benefits are greater than the costs of adoption these farmers also believed that they already used all the water saving irrigation technologies that are practical for their farming purposes nicol et al 2010 results presented in this section are also consistent with previous theoretical and empirical studies on irrigation technology adoption and water trading dridi and khanna 2005 found that water trading occurs between traders with high land quality and it is possible for water trading to discourage the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies there is a strong evidence to support this empirically caswell and zilberman 1986 lichtenberg 1989 for high quality land the gain from adopting efficient irrigation technologies cannot offset the higher level of fixed costs and this indicates that less efficient irrigation technology may be profitable at high quality land these results are consistent with previous study on irrigation technology adoption and investment options in the us by carey and zilberman 2002 who found that with water trading farmers have the option to wait and invest in efficient irrigation technologies at a later stage they also found that farmers are more likely to use the additional water to augment their current water supplies and not necessary adopt efficient irrigation technologies these results may also be at least partly a function of model assumptions and the calibration done for irrigation fixed costs the fixed costs per ha used in the analysis should reflect the cost of investing in alternative technologies it is conceivable that simply substituting one fixed cost for another does not accurately capture the economics of making that type of investment disinvestment decision the analysis also does not incorporate risk in comprehensive fashion a complete risk analysis would incorporate the level of risk endogenously in the modeling of water trading and technology adoption which is not done in the current analysis finally there is ambiguity of the direction of technology adoption induced by water trading given the outcomes of the simulation it is possible that both sellers and buyers do not know the distribution of gains from water trading this aversion could affect the parties decision to adopt efficient irrigation technologies post trade farmers may have in mind a reference gain from the irrigation technology based on expectations if the reference gain is higher than the gains obtained with the new irrigation technology farmers may perceive the technology as involving losses if this ambiguity is present then the effect of non rational choice on technology adoption could work against rational adoption approach and slow the adoption of efficient technologies the studies on effect of ambiguity on technology choice problem revealed mixed results warnick et al 2011 found that ambiguity aversion leads to a lower adoption of a new crop diversification in peru barham et al 2014 found that ambiguity aversion speeds up the adoption of gm corn in the us although risks and ambiguity are not explicitly captured with the current model there is the need to assess how these factors affect the technology choice problem and the impact of water trading on technology adoptions 4 1 2 modified water trading model restricted opportunity to change irrigation technology the results in the previous section suggest limitations associated with the water trading analysis since irrigators make the choice about the irrigation technology to adopt they can decide to change current technology for a more efficient or less efficient technology depending on the effect of these changes on their expected profits as a result a revised water trading simulation is conducted in which the same two water allocation scenarios are modeled but the model is restricted in the sense that the only opportunities for switching technology are to move to more efficient technologies it should be noted that the revised model suffers from the same limitations in terms of modeling fixed costs and investment requirements the intent of the scenario is to support the current government policy of encouraging farmers to adopt only efficient irrigation technologies in southern alberta 4 1 3 simulation results for restricted scenario one potential gains from irrigation technology adoption the simulation results table 7 show that with full water allocation there are limited incentives to adopt technology that is more efficient there are positive transition probabilities for farmers both buyers and sellers initially using gravity developed technology to switch to more efficient technology similarly for water sellers initially using sprinkler high pressure technology there is a positive probability of switching to sprinkler low technology post trade table 7 in all other cases there is a 100 probability of retention of the initial irrigation technology these results appear to suggest that there are limited incentives for either party to switch from current technologies to the most efficient technologies after trading this is despite the fact that there are gains in terms of increased yield and the possibility of using the saved water to irrigate other farmlands the results tend to confirm previous studies examining adoption of improved irrigation technologies in southern alberta nicol et al 2008 and other irrigation areas such the pacific northwest schaible et al 1991 and colorado bauder et al 1997 while it is possible for farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies the simulation results show that less adoption may occur when water is not scarce and that an improved technology is more likely to be adopted when it is practical economically feasible and during drought conditions marques et al 2005 4 1 4 simulation results for restricted scenario two potential gains from irrigation technology adoption the simulation results show that under scarcity conditions there is more potential for movement from less efficient to more efficient irrigation technology post trade table 8 for example in the case of a seller who initially uses gravity developed technology the transition probabilities show that there is a 41 chance of switching to sprinkler irrigation technologies table 8 however there is a 100 probability of retention of initial technology in the case of gravity flood based on the results for the transition probability matrix in table 8 there is a significant likelihood of the sellers and buyers switching to other irrigation technologies suggesting that the economic benefits outweigh the costs of converting switching technology post trade these results show that if the benefits that come out from water trading simulations were sustained then it would encourage investments in efficient irrigation technologies 4 1 5 results from restricted scenarios one and two potential gains from crop switching after water trading in this section simulation results are presented and discussed for the two water trading scenarios full allocation and water scarcity allowing producers to both switch from their current irrigation technology and to choose another crop post trade as with the previous simulation model scenarios buyers and sellers are restricted to either keep their current irrigation technology or switch to a more efficient technology with regard to no scarcity conditions the simulation results reveal that both parties are likely to remain with these crops after water trading 9 9 thus these results are not presented however under scarcity conditions the simulation results indicate that there is a greater potential for both parties to switch from potatoes to other crops the simulation results show that the buyer has 80 chance of still growing potatoes a 5 chance to switch to alfalfa a 13 chance to switch to dry beans and sugar beets while a 2 chance of switching to some other crop the seller has a 57 chance of still growing potatoes a 23 chance of switching from potatoes to sugar beets or dry beans a 12 chance of switching to alfalfa and 8 chance of still growing crops such as wheat barley and flaxseed these results are as expected since buyers tend to grow high valued crops such as potatoes and sugar beets it is not surprising to observe that they are likely to remain with current crop after water trading specialty crops such as potatoes and sugar beets require more water for optimal production and higher profits these conditions are necessary for both parties to ensure that there is adequate water to produce these crops 4 2 strategies to stimulate irrigation technology adoption the simulation analysis suggests limited potential for switching to more efficient irrigation technology under full water allocation therefore if policy makers identify improved efficiency in water use as an important policy goal it may be necessary to consider policy instruments to induce farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops during times when water scarcity is not imminent the two main strategies selected to stimulate the impact of water trading on the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies are 1 a subsidy on the cost of adopting efficient irrigation technology and 2 an increase in crop prices if processing facilities are available these strategies were selected because they are the main economic factors that are likely to influence a farmer who is contemplating adopting an efficient irrigation technology scheierling et al 2006 moreover farmers in the study area reported these factors as the main constraints to adopting an efficient irrigation technology nicol et al 2008 2010 4 2 1 subsidy on irrigation technology adoption in assessing the possibility of subsidizing irrigation technology adoption the implicit assumption regarding farmers adoption behavior is that they may switch to an improved irrigation technology when expected net returns under the subsidy approach are greater than would be the case from continuing with the existing irrigation practice in order to encourage the farmer to adopt an efficient irrigation technology a minimum public cost share would be needed to subsidize adoption costs to examine the effect of different cost sharing arrangements on the impact of water trading on irrigation technology adoption a sensitivity analysis is conducted on the annualized irrigation technology set up cost paid by the farmer and a potential public agency responsible for providing the subsidy a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the level of subsidy that could encourage a farmer to adopt an efficient irrigation technology to produce high valued crops specifically the percentage of capital cost paid by the public agency is parametrically increased from zero to 80 in 20 increments for the restricted technology adoption scenarios the sensitivity analysis shows that with a subsidy of 20 40 both the seller and buyer are likely to remain with their current level of irrigation technology adoption however the sensitivity analysis indicates a significant variation on the impact of water trading on efficient irrigation technology adoptions when the subsidy level is at 60 as reported in table 9 at this level of subsidy both the seller and the buyer are more likely to switch from wheel move irrigation technology to the sprinkler irrigation technologies the buyer is more likely to switch from wheel move irrigation technology to sprinkler low irrigation than the seller table 9 in all scenarios considered both the seller and buyer are likely to remain with gravity developed irrigation technology it appears that a subsidy is still limited in terms of the impact of water trading to induce adoption of these irrigation technologies the above simulation results suggest that with the provision of a sufficient level of subsidy farmers would have incentives to switch to an improved irrigation technology under no scarcity conditions 4 2 2 crop output price increase the theoretical model is used to examine whether increased crop prices over the 2012 base reference prices could encourage farmers in the ssrb to adopt an efficient irrigation technology the initial simulation analysis assumes constant real prices for the crops considered in the study the implicit assumption is that when a farmer decides to switch to an efficient irrigation technology to cultivate a high valued crop such as potatoes there will be a processing facility nearby to absorb the produce or a better marketing system to support the delivery of the produce to the consumers in reality high valued crops such as potatoes are produced on a contract basis with processing companies in the study area and given the limits on capacity not all producers would be able to grow this crop as a first step the restricted version of the water trading profit model is solved to establish the base case with no price increase the sensitivity analysis performed on crop price variable increased crop prices by 30 in 10 increments the analysis shows that increasing crop prices by 30 given the base year prices could lead to a 42 probability of conversion from gravity developed to sprinkler high and sprinkler low irrigation technologies for the buyer while the seller has a 32 chance of switching to these irrigation technologies 10 10 the results do not change for 10 and 20 increases in crop prices the results for the price change scenarios are not provided in tabular form the analysis shows that the buyer is more likely to remain with crops such as potatoes and sugar beets than the seller potatoes and sugar beets are among the highest valued crops in the ssrb and it would be beneficial for farmers with poor quality land to adopt efficient technologies for these crops with the assurance of a better marketing system 5 policy conclusions this paper applies a microeconomic modeling framework to quantitatively analyze the gains from water trading and the opportunities for farmers to adopt an efficient irrigation technology to produce the most profitable crops post trade a short run profit model was calibrated and simulated for two main policy scenarios of water allocation conditions under restricted and unrestricted models simulation results of the unrestricted model under no scarcity conditions show that both traders are likely to remain with their current irrigation technologies under scarcity conditions the simulation results show that water traders are more likely to switch to less efficient irrigation technologies after water trading these results suggest that water trading provides relatively limited incentive for a farmer to switch post trade to an improved irrigation system this could be due to the high cost of switching from an inefficient to an efficient irrigation technology furthermore results from strategies necessary to stimulate the impact of water trading on the adoption of improved irrigation technologies under no scarcity conditions of the restricted model show that farmers are more likely to switch to an improved irrigation technology under subsidy considerations and higher crop price regimes change the simulation results of the restricted model reveal that farmers are more likely to use their improved irrigation technologies to cultivate high valued crops overall the results show that if the benefits that come out from water trading were sustained then it would encourage investments in efficient irrigation technologies and crop choices in conclusion water trading under restricted conditions high crop price regimes and provision of subsidies on the impact of water trading on technology adoptions could encourage farmers to adopt improved irrigation technologies to produce profitable crops consequently adopting improved irrigation technologies allow farmers to cultivate high valued crops which require more water and increase irrigated areas in order to improve profits the theoretical model does not include extensive margin effects as the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies could lead to increased use of water this is because these strategies do not provide economic incentive to reduce the acreage irrigated reduce water use or encourage farmers to switch to less water consuming crops when irrigated acreage is unlimited the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies are likely to lead to more water usage and these could lead to a situation in which irrigated land expands while water resources are overexploited this is evident in previous studies in the us which found that the adoption of efficient irrigation technologies resulted in increased use of water pfeiffer and cynthia lin 2014 ward and pulido velazquez 2008 thus policies necessary to provide incentives to farmers to adopt efficient irrigation technologies and to improve crop yields may be supported by controlling water usage and the expansion of irrigated acreage berbel et al 2015 in retrospect there are some limitations associated with this research which should be addressed as a means of improvement for further studies some of these i e risk treatment of fixed costs and investment requirements have been discussed earlier an additional limitation is with respect to the effect of transaction costs and water trading transaction costs have been cited as a reason that more water transfers do not take place even when large price differences exist among alternative users young 1986 nicol and klein 2006 nicol et al 2008 carey et al 2002 livingston 1995 it would be beneficial if this model could be adapted to capture this aspect transaction costs were not included in the current model due to data limitations the model assumed that a farmer would select an efficient irrigation technology to produce the most profitable crop in practice a farmer is likely to cultivate a range of crops on his farm future studies could extend this model to capture the adoption decisions of a farmer to cultivate a mixture of crops the analysis undertaken here does not allow for a single market price but instead assumes prices for individual transactions being based on own benefits from the trade if there is a significant volume of trade in any given irrigation district it would be expected that a single price may be established for water the results presented in this paper may be more representative of situations where the market for water remains thin or during drought regimes where buyers and sellers simultaneously exchange water without a market price as well one contribution of this analysis is the impact of water trading on cropping and irrigation technology decisions this result is not dependent on the existence of a formal water market and associated market prices a modeling framework that simultaneously incorporates individual producer decisions and market prices for water is possible but is beyond the scope of this paper the model focuses on water trading between farmers in ssrb and intent to capture optimal allocation of limited water resources in the farmland the model results show that farmers are not likely to move to high water saving technology and it is possible that both the buyer and the seller confront the same situation although there may be difference in land quality crops etc a future scenario will be to explore the benefit of water trading between different water use sectors e g between agriculture and industry in this case the farmer should see long term benefit despite the weather condition and would prefer to high technology water saving method despite the high fixed investment the potential efficient outcomes notwithstanding water utilization and allocation have a number of important social implications necessitating social policy interventions due to the public nature of water resource and pollution costs farmers often do not internalize all costs in essence all these costs may require public monitoring and enforcement policy the divergence in these social and private outcomes may result in situations where allocation may not be done based on the most efficient outcomes for example although allocating water to the most efficient or highest value crop may be the most efficient private outcome social policy may dictate otherwise after the internalization of benefits and costs often not considered by private end users such as farmers the design of optimal water use policy may need to consider a combination of both private and socially relevant factors it is important to stress that though there are some private gains to adopt efficient irrigation technologies these gains may be insufficient to induce socially desirable levels of adoption from public policy perspectives if it is socially desirable to increase the irrigation effectiveness in order to reduce water use or improve the environment it may be relevant for the government to encourage efficient irrigation technology adoption in this regard the government can support policies that promote adoption by subsidizing all or part of the fixed costs

10057,pakistan is among the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts in particular the agricultural areas found in the worlds largest contiguous irrigation system the indus river basin irb this study assesses the impacts of two climate change scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 on soil evaporation and transpiration rates crop water productivity cwp and wheat and sugarcane yields over the 21st century under two irrigation schedules less more frequent irrigation and higher lower volume for six locations along the sindh and punjab provinces maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase across the study area over the course of the 21st century additionally precipitation is projected to increase decrease along the southernmost northernmost areas during the summer rainy season from june to september to evaluate the crop water productivity of wheat and sugarcane we used the aquacrop model in the six selected locations for assessing the goodness of model validation and calibration different statistical indicators are considered for comparing simulated and observed inter annual yield variability e g nrmse of 12 4 and 12 1 for wheat and sugarcane average values of the calibration and validation process our results show that wheat yields are likely to remain constant over time across the study areas whereas sugarcane yields are expected to experience a decline in the sindh province and an exponential increase in the punjab province up to 2080 then yields will start to decline in addition our results reveal that both crops perform better in terms of cwp under low frequent irrigation and higher volumes of water overall the findings of this work also support policymakers and project developers to implement adaptation strategies to cope with changing environmental conditions in a country where pressure on water resources is expected to continue to grow keywords wheat sugarcane evaporation transpiration water use efficiency climate change impacts 1 introduction according to the global climate risk index pakistan is ranked 5th among the countries experiencing highest number of extreme weather events during the 1999 2018 period eckstein et al 2019 while the impacts of the 2018 2019 drought and cold wave are still ongoing august 2020 was considered the wettest year in record for pakistan affecting 77 000 ha of agricultural land mostly along the sindh province concurrently a desert locust outbreak affected 46 districts across major agricultural provinces of the irb wmo 2020 as a result the impacts of climate change are anticipated to have a considerable impact on the country s agri food systems due to more frequent and severe heat stress conditions as well as from changes in water availability which are expected to shift the spatial boundaries of crops besides changing its productivity while the country s population is estimated to increase from 216 to 338 million by 2050 compared to 2019 climate change is likely to negatively affect crop productivity and ultimately increase food insecurity nationally tariq et al 2014 un 2019 according to the national nutrition survey in 2018 37 of the population faced food insecurity and this number is likely to rise if climate related impacts on the agriculture sector are not properly addressed wfp 2018 the agricultural sector contributes to 25 of the gross domestic product gdp while irrigation accounts for up to 70 of water withdrawn as a percentage of total renewable resources particularly along the irb where pressure on water resources and dependency ratio is highest fao 2016 the irb is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world however the inter annual variability of agricultural value added to the gdp and its high dependency on weather suggests that the irb is among the most vulnerable regions to climate risks worldwide twb 2016 hence there is a need to increase the understanding of future climate impacts on agricultural systems and implement measures to increase the efficiency and productivity of agricultural water use in response to climate change growing demographic pressure and finite water resources richey et al 2015 since 1960 the mean annual temperature in pakistan has risen by 0 47 c with a projected increase of 3 c by the end of the century relative to 1961 1990 chaudhry et al 2009 total annual precipitation is more erratic over large parts of pakistan when compared to the historical average with increasing number of intensified climatological and hydrological events e g droughts and flooding houze et al 2011 adnan et al 2016 du et al 2019 in pakistan precipitation changes are driven by the heating of the tibetan plateau which forces monsoon variability within the region hijioka et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the drivers greenhouse gases and impacts of climate change rainfall variability and increasing temperatures are projected to evolve with time thereby determining their effect on plant s phenology and yield production is likely to become more complex into the future liancourt et al 2012 poulter et al 2013 in 2018 pakistan reported harvested areas for wheat and sugarcane of 8 80 and 1 10 million hectares ha equivalent to 47 of the country s total agricultural land respectively and yields of 2 85 and 60 96 tons t ha 1 fao 2018 various studies have examined the effect of high temperature thresholds for these two crops the optimal and maximum temperature thresholds of wheat s different phenological phases are 22 0 32 7 c emergence 4 9 15 7 c vernalization 21 0 31 0 c anthesis and 20 7 35 4 c grain filling phase respectively porter and gawith 1999 additional studies looking at the effect of changes in temperatures 3 4 and 5 c and precipitation 10 and 10 with doubling co2 concentrations conclude that wheat yields are likely to remain similar to current levels by 2060 janjua et al 2010 in addition sugarcane s c4 crop optimal growing temperatures range between 33 and 38 c displaying a higher sensitivity to heat stress conditions though having a higher temperature optimum when compared to c3 crops sanghera et al 2019 wahid and close 2007 not only the difference in temperature optimum but the different mechanisms for fixing co2 into biomass between c3 and c4 plants is another distinct physiological response which can among crops having a rapid stomata closure translate into a reduction of water loss although increases in atmospheric co2 and air temperatures can be beneficial for c3 crops wheat increasing temperatures are expected to result in higher water requirements due to increasing evapotranspiration rates kimball 1983 bowes 1991 poorter 1993 climate change is projected to have a negative impact on c4 crops mainly grown along tropical and subtropical regions zhao and li 2015 for instance in pakistan the yields of sugarcane are expected to decrease by 10 for every 1 c increase afghan and ijaz 2015 crop models are useful tools for assessing water limited crop yields under a wide range of environmental and management conditions for instance the aquacrop model is a crop water productivity model that can be run with future meteorological data together with projected co2 levels for assessing crop s responses to future climatic conditions vanuytrecht and raes 2011 in pakistan the aquacrop model has already been used to examine the impacts of water management on salinization along cultivated areas of faisalabad macaigne et al 2018 simulations with aquacrop on sugar beet production under different irrigation schedules mulching conditions and furrow systems have also been run along semi arid regions of pakistan malik et al 2017 additionally the swap93 model has been used to simulate the soil water balance of sugarcane in order to develop an efficient irrigation scheduling for the sindh province qureshi et al 2002 to date there are not yet any studies assessing the combined effect of changing temperatures and precipitation and elevated co2 concentrations on the performance of wheat and sugarcane using the aquacrop model in pakistan for sugarcane farooq and gheewala 2020 have assessed the second growing season of sugarcane but not the first growing season as done in this study the present study calibrates and validates the aquacrop model and evaluates the impacts of changing temperature and precipitation patterns on crop s performance in terms of soil evaporation transpiration cwp and yield given that the irb is the largest irrigation system in the world and is considered a vulnerable region to climate risks this study focuses on the sindh and punjab provinces additional practical applications of this study include the development of different irrigation schedules for maximizing crop production across these two provinces 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the sindh and punjab provinces are located within the irb and along the easternmost parts of pakistan bordering india fig 1 the climate along low lying areas is characterized as semi arid 100 500 mm year with warm mean annual temperatures 25 c towards the northern parts of the punjab province the climate becomes milder reaching dry winter and hot summer conditions towards the foothills of the himalaya s the irb covers approximately half million km2 of pakistan 65 particularly along the sindh and punjab provinces to finally flow out into the arabian sea due to the long term deposition of sediments old alluvial soils are found along the sindh and punjab provinces these types of soils mainly loam give the irb one of the richest soil types and suitable growing conditions for a myriad of crops 2 2 aquacrop input requirements 2 2 1 weather data inputs local projections of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature were obtained from six weather stations within the network of the pakistan meteorological department pmd the latter information was used in this work by means of statistical downscaling sd which allows to translate the low spatial resolution of the global climate simulations provided by earth system models esms to the local regional scale needed for climate impact assessments sd was performed following the perfect prognosis approach under which a statistical model was calibrated by defining the relationship between local scale observations e g precipitation and a set of quasi observed large scale atmospheric predictors e g sea level pressure or winds from a reanalysis over a historical period subsequently the model was applied to the coarse esm predictors as given by different future emission scenarios to obtain the corresponding local downscaled climate change projections for the future see manzanas et al 2020 and references therein for the calibration phase era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 were used for the projection phase four esms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 table 1 were considered under two representative concentration pathways rcps accounting for different socio economic and future emission scenarios namely the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 550 and 1000 co2 ppm by 2100 respectively clarke et al 2007 riahi et al 2007 to downscale precipitation the present study used the nearest analog technique zorita et al 1995 in which the local values for any future atmospheric configuration as given by esm predictors were estimated from the local observations corresponding to most similar or analog historic configuration as represented by era interim alternatively to downscale maximum and minimum temperature a multiple linear regression mlr was applied an extension of simple linear regression that attempts to model the relationship between predictors and a response variable e g predictand by fitting a linear equation to the observed data the fit is determined here based on era interim predictors by minimizing the sum of the residuals between the regression line and the observed data helsel and hirsch 2002 the analog technique was not suitable for temperatures given its inability to extrapolate values out of the observed range in the historical period which may constitute an important issue in the context of a changing climate gutiérrez et al 2013 for precipitation temperatures the leading 30 15 principal components preisendorfer and mobley 1988 of a combination of sea level pressure geopotential height at 250 hpa temperature meridional winds and relative humidity at 850 hpa which are the main drivers of the local climate were used as predictors in this work these were defined over a 2 regular grid covering the domain 60 78 e 23 37 n 2 2 2 crop and soil information inputs historical yield data 2006 2015 for wheat and sugarcane was provided by the ministry of national food security and research mnfsr for two locations badin sindh and multan punjab additional information on management practices e g sowing and harvesting date and sowing method and crop development parameters e g time and duration of flowering maximum canopy cover physiological maturity were shared by the mnfsr for the sindh and punjab provinces table 2 the cane fresh yield was converted into dry yield by first calculating the stalk dry weight fresh weight 0 30 which was then added to the proportion of trash dry weight 0 65 stalk dry weight as calculated from thompson 1978 and later modified by irvine 1983 the crop calendars of wheat and sugarcane along the sindh and punjab provinces were shown in fig 2 while there was only one growing season for wheat nov apr sugarcane was either planted in fall sep oct or just before the start of the spring feb mar however in the present study only the first sowing season was analyzed sep oct the soil texture information for each location was retrieved from research literature having badin and multan loam and clay loam soil textures respectively isric 2020 uaf 2020 2 3 the aquacrop model the fao aquacrop model simulates crop yield in different steps i crop development ii crop transpiration iii biomass production and iv yield formation the calculation of evapotranspiration within the model is divided into transpiration and soil evaporation transpiration is directly related to the canopy cover cc whereas evaporation is proportional to the bare soil for calculating the potential crop transpiration the cc is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration eto determined by the fao 56 penman monteith equation and by the crop coefficient kc then the actual transpiration ta is calculated from potential evapotranspiration in addition ta is used for calculating crop biomass b which is computed by multiplying actual transpiration by the water productivity wp eq 1 the harvest index hi allows to obtain the crop yield y by the crop biomass b eq 2 raes et al 2018 1 crop biomass b as kg ha ta wp 2 crop yield y as kg ha hi b 2 3 1 simulation outputs the yearly evapotranspiration et was determined by the aquacrop model using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 for rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and two irrigation schedules table 3 for the six pmd stations fig 1 over the 21st century the analysis of vegetation transpiration t and soil evaporation se was conducted separately as each of these variables could play a key role on determining the crop water productivity cwp the cwp eq 3 was used to describe the trade offs between water loss and carbon sequestration in the plant photosynthesis and carbon assimilation process climatic factors affecting crop s potential evapotranspiration were assessed to describe the way specific temperature thresholds reduced the cwp due to increased rates of evapotranspiration then sugarcane and wheat yields were examined to better understand if elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations had a positive or negative impact on c3 and c4 plants by reducing photorespiration besides enhancing photosynthetic co2 exchange 3 crop water productivity cwp as kg m 3 b tr where b is the estimated above ground biomass in kg and tr the cumulative amount of water transpired in m3 respectively 2 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop the fao aquacrop model was calibrated and validated using 10 year yield data 2006 2015 of wheat and sugarcane for badin sindh and multan punjab afterwards annual simulations were run until the end of the century using the downscaled meteorological inputs obtained from the esms under the two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 two irrigation schedules table 3 and four additional locations fig 1 one along the sindh province karachi and three extra locations across the punjab province faisalabad dera ismail khan and bahawal pur the aquacrop s performance to simulate observed yield for the period 2006 2015 was evaluated using the standard and normalized root mean square errors rmse and nrmse respectively mean absolute percentage error mape and wilmott s index of agreement d the rmse nrmse mape and wilmott s index of agreement were calculated as in eqs 4 7 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n oi pi 2 5 nrmse rmse o ˆ 100 6 mape i 1 n oi pi oi 2 100 7 d 1 i 1 n oi pi 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 where o i and pi corresponded to the observed and simulated values respectively o i oi o ˆ and p i pi p ˆ showed the differences between an observed and or simulated value with the observed and simulated means and n is the number of treatments rmse had the same units as that of the variable being simulated ton ha 1 whereas nrmse was expressed as a percentage the closer the values were to zero the higher the model s performance we considered that the aquacrop model was well calibrated if the nrmse was lower than 15 and highly performant if lower than 5 raes et al 2018 2 4 irrigation schedules the generation of irrigation schedules was necessary to plan a potential irrigation strategy in the irb aiming at optimizing yields with lower applications of water although crop parameters and initial soil conditions remained similar for the validation of wheat two irrigation schedules for the 2006 2015 period were proposed in order to best fit the observed inter annual precipitation variability and its impacts on observed yields in multan table 3 this was necessary under rainfed conditions as sporadic heavy rains reported along the punjab province disturbed the planned irrigation treatments for that reason the present study followed the approach of sandhu et al 2015 for rice along the punjab region of india and that of andarzian et al 2011 for wheat in iran with different irrigation scenarios according to the observed precipitation while sandhu et al 2015 tested four different irrigation schedules for the validation of rice with aquacrop this work embraced two irrigation schedules for the validation of wheat in multan as a result the present study defined different irrigation schedules based on the average precipitation observed 77 8 mm during wheat s growing season in multan during the 2006 2015 period therefore 77 8 mm was considered the threshold between a drier or wetter than usual dry season consequently triggering different types of irrigation schedules during the calibration process in order to enhance the cwp and the economic yield per unit of water used by the crop an additional irrigation schedule was proposed for karachi sindh province the irrigation method used both for the calibration and validation of wheat was surface irrigation on furrows and the time criteria was fixed intervals with a fixed net application for the calibration of sugarcane in badin the irrigation schedule was set every 7 days with 29 mm 870 mm in total whereas for the validation multan every 10 days with 41 mm 861 mm in total since these irrigation schedules had a similar amount of water application they were both tested in future simulations to assess the cwp of sugarcane under changing climate conditions for sugarcane sprinkler irrigation was the method selected where 100 of the soil surface was watered at each irrigation event the selected time criteria was fixed intervals with a fixed net application 3 results 3 1 climatic trends 3 1 1 precipitation impacts on wheat and sugarcane the downscaled projections show a slight increase 2 7 mm month in average rainfall during oct dec for the period 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps over the six locations fig 3 hence rainfall changes are likely to have no impacts on early growing stages of wheat a similar behavior is projected for flowering and maturity of wheat jan mar with a small decrease 0 5 mm month in average rainfall during jan mar for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps over the six locations conversely sugarcane will be affected at senescence by a notable decrease 10 2 mm month in average rainfall during jul sep for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps particularly along bahawal pur dera ismail khan and multan on the contrary badin will experience an increase in precipitation 13 1 mm month over jul sep 3 1 2 temperature impacts on wheat and sugarcane regarding critical temperature thresholds for crop development all sites will experience a considerable increase in the number of days per month with maximum temperatures tmax above 32 c it is likely that early vegetative stages of wheat oct dec will be affected by heat stress conditions if sowing is carried out early in october 32 7 c is considered the maximum temperature threshold for wheat at emergence for instance in karachi and badin the number of days with tmax above 32 c will rise from 25 to 30 days per month by 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 under rcp 8 5 fig 3 more importantly wheat will be affected by heat stress conditions if flowering occurs in march 31 0 c is considered the maximum threshold for wheat at anthesis however the current growing calendar shows that flowering of wheat currently occurs in january when temperatures across all study areas are at its lowest the highest temperature increase during mid growing stages of wheat jan mar is projected to occur over the punjab province where the average tmax mean of four locations will likely increase from 25 6 to 29 8 c for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 under rcp 8 5 even though the average tmax will remain below 30 c during jan mar it is projected that the number of days per month with tmax above 32 c will exceed 15 and 25 days month respectively under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by the end of the century furthermore if the sowing date of wheat remains the same it is likely that increasing temperatures will shorten the crop s growing cycle hence reducing the probability of being affected by heat stress conditions at flowering in aquacrop the heat units were expressed as growing degree days gdd and increasing temperatures have demonstrated a key role on crop development the previous is reflected in the emerging findings where wheat is likely to reach maturity 20 30 days earlier at the end of the century when comparing the observed values for the 2006 2015 period 150 days against the projected ones fig 5 additionally sugarcane does not display any changes over time because of the type of calibration used for the crop parameters in days after sowing das rather than in gdd as done for wheat therefore the length and duration of sugarcane s development stages were not adjusted to the temperature regimes of distinctive years and as a consquence do not display any changes over time for sugarcane the highest temperature increase is expected to occur between apr jun when the average tmax will likely rise from 40 9 to 43 5 c when comparing the 2020 2039 and 2080 2099 periods under both rcps across the six locations hence exceeding sugarcane s optimal growing temperatures established at 33 38 c the average tmax during oct dec will also experience a notable increase along the sindh province from 33 0 to 35 2 c when 2020 2039 and 2090 2099 periods are compared 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated for wheat and sugarcane based on the available yield information for badin and multan over the period 2006 2015 the calibration and validation results in aquacrop for wheat yields were as follows nrmse 10 9 and 13 9 rmse 0 30 and 0 42 t ha mape 9 3 and 12 44 and wilmott s index of agreement d 0 96 both for the calibration and validation although aquacrop slightly overestimated the observed wheat yields during the first half 2006 2010 of the calibration period 4 8 average difference between simulated and observed yields the model was capable of simulating well the inter annual variability of yields fig 6 throughout the entire calibration period 2006 2015 because of the high rainfall variability in multan and its impacts on wheat yields it was challenging for the model to simulate inter annual yield fluctuations during the validation process in badin furthermore the calibration and validation results in aquacrop for sugarcane were as follows nrmse 12 5 and 11 6 rmse 3 57 and 2 59 t ha mape 11 2 and 10 2 and wilmott s index of agreement d 0 89 and 0 90 respectively hence for both crops the statistics showed nrmse values below 15 indicating a good calibration and validation of the aquacrop model 3 3 wheat 3 3 1 soil evaporation and transpiration the present findings reveal a strong relationship between high soil evaporation se and different irrigation schedules along the punjab province although sites along the punjab province 5 days 10 mm total 270 297 mm received 50 additional irrigation than those found in the sindh province 7 days 10 mm total 190 210 mm the se values of punjab province dera ismail khan total se 264 mm tripled those of sindh province karachi total se 90 mm average of both rcps fig 7 overall soil evaporation rates behaved similarly under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with a decreasing trend over time along faisalabad bahawal pur karachi and badin for transpiration t t rates were lower under frequent and low irrigation volumes with a moderate decrease in t rates overtime being higher under rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 fig 8 the greatest t decline was reported in dera ismail khan from 236 mm in 2010 2019 161 mm in 2090 2099 under rcp 8 5 large t differences were reported when averaging the long time series of karachi 287 mm and badin 99 mm for different irrigation schedules under both rcps finally the effect of heat stress was simulated in aquacrop using the temperature stress coefficient for crop transpiration kstr for wheat the average temperature stress affecting crop transpiration was close to 0 0 07 of the growing period for both rcps across all study areas and under different irrigation schemes 3 3 2 yields and crop water productivity wheat yields are expected to remain constant over the 21st century along dera ismail khan avg 2 36 ton ha faisalabad avg 1 67 ton ha and bahawal pur avg 1 65 ton ha under frequent and low irrigation schemes 5days 10 mm total 270 292 mm for both rcps fig 9 however a notable yield increase is depicted when comparing the previous irrigation scheme with less frequent applications but higher amounts 7 days 13 mm total 312 325 mm with yields improving as follows dera ismail khan avg 3 97 ton ha faisalabad avg 2 80 ton ha and bahawal pur avg 2 87 ton ha in fact with similar high atmospheric evaporative demand and 10 increase between the two irrigation schemes the percentage of water stress reducing leaf expansion is 76 4 under 5days 10 mm and 65 3 under 7days 13 mm average of both rcps as a result the cumulative amount of water transpired increased fig 8 translating into a higher water productivity fig 10 along the sindh province e g karachi yields are also expected to rise from 4 40 ton ha to 5 17 17 5 and 6 50 ton ha 47 7 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively when the 2010 2019 and 2080 2099 periods are compared regarding the crop water productivity cwp all of the targeted locations are expected to experience an increase in cwp except multan under the irrigation schedule 5 days 10 mm the station reporting the highest cwp is karachi under rcp 8 5 and irrigation schedule 8 days 14 mm with a cwp increase from 1 11 kg m3 to 1 79 kg m3 respectively from 2010 2019 to 2090 2099 fig 10 3 4 sugarcane 3 4 1 soil evaporation and transpiration the soil evaporation se values are higher 396 mm on avg for the complete time series in the punjab province under rcp 8 5 and irrigation schedule 7 days 29 mm when compared to the sindh province 281 mm on avg for the complete time series for rcp 4 5 and irrigation schedule 10 days 41 mm fig 11 there is an increase in se particularly towards the northern parts of the country dera ismail khan and faisalabad with the highest rate of se increase under rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 for transpiration t higher t values are projected in the sindh province 674 mm on avg for the complete time series when compared to the punjab province 573 mm on avg for the complete time series for both irrigation schedules and rcps fig 12 however spatial differences on t trends were observed particularly among southernmost sindh province and northernmost areas punjab province while karachi and badin will experience a decrease in t overtime from the start of the simulations all punjab sites except bahawal pur report an exponential increase in t up until 2080 increasing t trends is tightly related to temperature increase during jan mar the thermal increase along the punjab province coincides with the mid growing stages of sugarcane if sown in november as done herein when kc are highest 1 25 consequently enhancing t rates on the other hand temperatures along karachi and badin remain similar over time fig 4 and therefore t rates slightly decrease rather than increase fig 12 aquacrop simulations have shown that sugarcane will be susceptible to increasing temperatures particularly along the punjab province where the average temperature stress affecting crop transpiration kstr is expected to be of 13 1 avg values for the 2010 2099 period throughout the growing season 3 4 2 yields and water use efficiency sugarcane yields display a similar behavior to that of transpiration t over time across the different locations rcps and irrigation schedules fig 13 this is due to the direct relationship between yields and biomass production which depend on t while sugarcane yields experience a notable decrease 14 7 over time along the sindh province from 28 6 ton ha mnfsr avg observed values in karachi between 2006 and 2015 to 24 4ton ha simulated values for the period 2090 2099 for the two locations rcps and irrigation schedules yields are projected to increase over the punjab province for the latter sugarcane yields are expected to increase by 13 0 from 22 2 ton ha mnfsr avg observed values in multan between 2006 and 2015 to 25 1 ton ha in 2070 2080 avg simulated yield values in the four locations rcps and irrigation schedules afterwards yields are projected to decline even though yield trends have a similar behavior in all locations over time and for both rcps yields are estimated to be higher 8 3 under the irrigation schedule 10 days 41 mm 861 mm in total when compared to 7 days 29 mm 870 mm fig 13 for the complete time series 2010 2099 the average crop water productivity cwp in sindh province is of 2 38 and of 2 66 kg m3 11 8 when 7 days 29 mm with 10 days 41 mm are respectively compared fig 14 a similar pattern is observed over the punjab province where the cwp is of 2 47 and 2 86 kg m3 17 when 7 days 29 mm with 10 days 41 mm are respectively compared overall the cwp is projected to decrease over time across the sindh and punjab provinces with a greater rate of decrease under rcp 8 5 for instance the cwp is likely to decline from 2 65 kg m3 to 2 48 kg m3 6 4 under rcp 8 5 when the 2010 2019 and 2080 2099 periods are compared for both irrigation schemes 4 discussion while the simulations present in this study show that wheat will not be adversely impacted by increasing temperatures and co2 concentrations if sowing continues to take place on the 1st of november negative impacts are expected for sugarcane depending on the time horizon and location for wheat as reported in sections 3 1 2 and 3 3 2 the growing cycle will be shortened by 20 30 days because of an increase in the accumulated heat units during a day gdd as a result heat stress conditions 31 0 and 35 4 c are considered the critical temperature thresholds at anthesis and grain filling phase occurring in march and april will be avoided porter and gawith 1999 hence the pollination of wheat and the grain filling phase will not be hindered by the exposure to heat stress conditions while 51 of the indo gangetic plains will be reclassified as heat stress zones by 2050 ortiz et al 2008 several studies including this one suggest a reduction on the duration of the growing season of wheat under changing climatic conditions valizadeh et al 2014 despite the fact that the grain filling phase will be shortened rezaei et al 2015 the present study reveals that an acceleration of wheat s phenological phases under irrigated conditions due to rising temperatures will not result in a reduction of wheat yields in pakistan the simulations of the present study show a stabilization of yields over time fig 8 and therefore our results contrast other studies acknowledging a 20 31 decline in yields when sowing occurs in november sultana et al 2009 ahmad et al 2015 khan et al 2020 this can be explained by the fact that the previous studies do not thoroughly examine indicators such as gdd in crop development nevertheless the present study is in harmony to that of janjua et al 2010 also conducted in pakistan the findings of the latter show that in all co2 temperature and precipitation scenarios wheat will be positively affected and the production will double by 2060 as compared to the present yield levels while sugarcane yields are expected to increase along the punjab province up until 2080 a 2 3 c increase in mean tmax between 2020 and 2039 and 2080 2099 periods in central and southernmost parts of the country karachi badin and bahawal pur will have a negative impact on sugarcane yields the findings of this work for the latter locations are in line with those of afghan and ijaz 2015 acknowledging a 10 decrease in sugarcane yields for every 1 c increase even though aquacrop simulations show a decline in yields along the punjab province from mid end century onwards the present study shows that the rate of decrease will be lower to that reported by akbar and gheewala 2020 in the punjab province 16 a recent publication farooq and gheewala 2020 on cropwat and aquacrop in faisalabad and rahim yar khan has shown a similar yield trend to that of this study where production is expected to increase up until 2080 then decrease by 0 6 under rcp 8 5 when comparing to the baseline period 1981 2005 in both studies results revealed a growth in the crop water requirements due to rising soil evaporation and transpiration with a subsequent increase in irrigation demand however the latter study reports much higher irrigation requirements 1740 2145 mm when sowing between 15 02 and 12 03 in faisalabad to that of this study when sowing occurs on the 01 09 861 mm an increase in temperature under changing climatic conditions will alter soil evaporation and might cause water stress and as consequence the need to apply higher amounts of water to meet sugarcane s evapotranspiration demand hussain et al 2018 even though our findings are in line with the latter study more frequent irrigation 7 days 29 mm rather than 10 days 41 mm will substantially increase the losses derived from direct soil evaporation consequently in order to optimize the use of water resources and increase the yields of sugarcane less frequent but higher water applications is recommended 10 days 41 mm this is particularly important across certain regions in pakistan where agricultural water is used with low efficiency among high water consuming crops sugarcane if promoted the dual challenge of increasing sugarcane production and farm income while saving water will be achieved 5 conclusion agricultural production is affected by a number of climate factors including rainfall patterns temperature rise change in sowing and harvesting dates water availability and evapotranspiration and land suitability the future crop water requirements cwp of wheat and sugarcane in pakistan are likely to increase with time nevertheless water resources can be optimized if appropriate irrigation and planting scheduling under changing climate and environmental conditions are applied the results of this work can inform medium to long term national adaptation priority actions for planning in the agriculture sector in pakistan by enhancing water resource management throughout the country the results provide decision makers and project developers with a robust scientific evidence based for actions related to water allocation and related water policies this study presents the following conclusions a slight increase in projected precipitation 2 7 mm month for oct dec at early growing stages of wheat will have minimal impact on the performance of the crop the slight increase in precipitation will be offset by increasing soil evaporation and transpiration rates due to rising temperatures 2 3 and 4 0 c under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by 2080 2099 an increase in the accumulated heat units during a day gdd will shorten the growing cycle of wheat by 20 30 days as a result the exposure of wheat to heat stress conditions at anthesis and ripening phase will be reduced consequently we recommend maintaining the current calendars for wheat in the region wheat yields are expected to remain constant along all study areas except for karachi where yields will likely notably increase by 17 5 and 47 7 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively wheat has higher cwp under less frequent but higher water applications 8 days 14 mm and 7days 13 mm along sindh and punjab province respectively sugarcane is projected to be adversely affected by increasing temperatures mean tmax during apr jun is expected to increase from 40 9 to 43 5 c when compared to the 2020 2039 and 2080 2099 periods across the six the locations under both rcps as a result the exposure of sugarcane to heat stress conditions will be of 13 1 along the entire growing period in order to select the optimal growing period for sugarcane further research needs to be conducted testing different sowing dates and irrigation schedules while transpiration of sugarcane will exponentially increase along the northernmost parts of the country it will remain constant and or slightly decrease in central and southernmost areas over time our results reveal that sugarcane yields will decline from the present onwards in central and southernmost parts of the country however northernmost parts will experience a notable increase up until 2080 after which yields will start to decline compared to wheat sugarcane will perform better in terms of cwp under less frequent but higher volumes of irrigation 10 days 41 mm overall aquacrop was particularly useful to better understand crop s responses to environmental change identify constraints to crop production and water

this study assesses the impacts of two climate change scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps 4 5 and 8 5 on soil evaporation and transpiration rates crop water productivity cwp and wheat and sugarcane yields over the 21st century under two irrigation schedules less more frequent irrigation and higher lower volume for six locations along the sindh and punjab provinces maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase across the study area over the course of the 21st century additionally precipitation is projected to increase decrease along the southernmost northernmost areas during the summer rainy season from june to september to evaluate the crop water productivity of wheat and sugarcane we used the aquacrop model in the six selected locations for assessing the goodness of model validation and calibration different statistical indicators are considered for comparing simulated and observed inter annual yield variability e g nrmse of 12 4 and 12 1 for wheat and sugarcane average values of the calibration and validation process our results show that wheat yields are likely to remain constant over time across the study areas whereas sugarcane yields are expected to experience a decline in the sindh province and an exponential increase in the punjab province up to 2080 then yields will start to decline in addition our results reveal that both crops perform better in terms of cwp under low frequent irrigation and higher volumes of water overall the findings of this work also support policymakers and project developers to implement adaptation strategies to cope with changing environmental conditions in a country where pressure on water resources is expected to continue to grow keywords wheat sugarcane evaporation transpiration water use efficiency climate change impacts 1 introduction according to the global climate risk index pakistan is ranked 5th among the countries experiencing highest number of extreme weather events during the 1999 2018 period eckstein et al 2019 while the impacts of the 2018 2019 drought and cold wave are still ongoing august 2020 was considered the wettest year in record for pakistan affecting 77 000 ha of agricultural land mostly along the sindh province concurrently a desert locust outbreak affected 46 districts across major agricultural provinces of the irb wmo 2020 as a result the impacts of climate change are anticipated to have a considerable impact on the country s agri food systems due to more frequent and severe heat stress conditions as well as from changes in water availability which are expected to shift the spatial boundaries of crops besides changing its productivity while the country s population is estimated to increase from 216 to 338 million by 2050 compared to 2019 climate change is likely to negatively affect crop productivity and ultimately increase food insecurity nationally tariq et al 2014 un 2019 according to the national nutrition survey in 2018 37 of the population faced food insecurity and this number is likely to rise if climate related impacts on the agriculture sector are not properly addressed wfp 2018 the agricultural sector contributes to 25 of the gross domestic product gdp while irrigation accounts for up to 70 of water withdrawn as a percentage of total renewable resources particularly along the irb where pressure on water resources and dependency ratio is highest fao 2016 the irb is the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world however the inter annual variability of agricultural value added to the gdp and its high dependency on weather suggests that the irb is among the most vulnerable regions to climate risks worldwide twb 2016 hence there is a need to increase the understanding of future climate impacts on agricultural systems and implement measures to increase the efficiency and productivity of agricultural water use in response to climate change growing demographic pressure and finite water resources richey et al 2015 since 1960 the mean annual temperature in pakistan has risen by 0 47 c with a projected increase of 3 c by the end of the century relative to 1961 1990 chaudhry et al 2009 total annual precipitation is more erratic over large parts of pakistan when compared to the historical average with increasing number of intensified climatological and hydrological events e g droughts and flooding houze et al 2011 adnan et al 2016 du et al 2019 in pakistan precipitation changes are driven by the heating of the tibetan plateau which forces monsoon variability within the region hijioka et al 2014 wang et al 2019 the drivers greenhouse gases and impacts of climate change rainfall variability and increasing temperatures are projected to evolve with time thereby determining their effect on plant s phenology and yield production is likely to become more complex into the future liancourt et al 2012 poulter et al 2013 in 2018 pakistan reported harvested areas for wheat and sugarcane of 8 80 and 1 10 million hectares ha equivalent to 47 of the country s total agricultural land respectively and yields of 2 85 and 60 96 tons t ha 1 fao 2018 various studies have examined the effect of high temperature thresholds for these two crops the optimal and maximum temperature thresholds of wheat s different phenological phases are 22 0 32 7 c emergence 4 9 15 7 c vernalization 21 0 31 0 c anthesis and 20 7 35 4 c grain filling phase respectively porter and gawith 1999 additional studies looking at the effect of changes in temperatures 3 4 and 5 c and precipitation 10 and 10 with doubling co2 concentrations conclude that wheat yields are likely to remain similar to current levels by 2060 janjua et al 2010 in addition sugarcane s c4 crop optimal growing temperatures range between 33 and 38 c displaying a higher sensitivity to heat stress conditions though having a higher temperature optimum when compared to c3 crops sanghera et al 2019 wahid and close 2007 not only the difference in temperature optimum but the different mechanisms for fixing co2 into biomass between c3 and c4 plants is another distinct physiological response which can among crops having a rapid stomata closure translate into a reduction of water loss although increases in atmospheric co2 and air temperatures can be beneficial for c3 crops wheat increasing temperatures are expected to result in higher water requirements due to increasing evapotranspiration rates kimball 1983 bowes 1991 poorter 1993 climate change is projected to have a negative impact on c4 crops mainly grown along tropical and subtropical regions zhao and li 2015 for instance in pakistan the yields of sugarcane are expected to decrease by 10 for every 1 c increase afghan and ijaz 2015 crop models are useful tools for assessing water limited crop yields under a wide range of environmental and management conditions for instance the aquacrop model is a crop water productivity model that can be run with future meteorological data together with projected co2 levels for assessing crop s responses to future climatic conditions vanuytrecht and raes 2011 in pakistan the aquacrop model has already been used to examine the impacts of water management on salinization along cultivated areas of faisalabad macaigne et al 2018 simulations with aquacrop on sugar beet production under different irrigation schedules mulching conditions and furrow systems have also been run along semi arid regions of pakistan malik et al 2017 additionally the swap93 model has been used to simulate the soil water balance of sugarcane in order to develop an efficient irrigation scheduling for the sindh province qureshi et al 2002 to date there are not yet any studies assessing the combined effect of changing temperatures and precipitation and elevated co2 concentrations on the performance of wheat and sugarcane using the aquacrop model in pakistan for sugarcane farooq and gheewala 2020 have assessed the second growing season of sugarcane but not the first growing season as done in this study the present study calibrates and validates the aquacrop model and evaluates the impacts of changing temperature and precipitation patterns on crop s performance in terms of soil evaporation transpiration cwp and yield given that the irb is the largest irrigation system in the world and is considered a vulnerable region to climate risks this study focuses on the sindh and punjab provinces additional practical applications of this study include the development of different irrigation schedules for maximizing crop production across these two provinces 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the sindh and punjab provinces are located within the irb and along the easternmost parts of pakistan bordering india fig 1 the climate along low lying areas is characterized as semi arid 100 500 mm year with warm mean annual temperatures 25 c towards the northern parts of the punjab province the climate becomes milder reaching dry winter and hot summer conditions towards the foothills of the himalaya s the irb covers approximately half million km2 of pakistan 65 particularly along the sindh and punjab provinces to finally flow out into the arabian sea due to the long term deposition of sediments old alluvial soils are found along the sindh and punjab provinces these types of soils mainly loam give the irb one of the richest soil types and suitable growing conditions for a myriad of crops 2 2 aquacrop input requirements 2 2 1 weather data inputs local projections of precipitation maximum and minimum temperature were obtained from six weather stations within the network of the pakistan meteorological department pmd the latter information was used in this work by means of statistical downscaling sd which allows to translate the low spatial resolution of the global climate simulations provided by earth system models esms to the local regional scale needed for climate impact assessments sd was performed following the perfect prognosis approach under which a statistical model was calibrated by defining the relationship between local scale observations e g precipitation and a set of quasi observed large scale atmospheric predictors e g sea level pressure or winds from a reanalysis over a historical period subsequently the model was applied to the coarse esm predictors as given by different future emission scenarios to obtain the corresponding local downscaled climate change projections for the future see manzanas et al 2020 and references therein for the calibration phase era interim reanalysis dee et al 2011 were used for the projection phase four esms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 table 1 were considered under two representative concentration pathways rcps accounting for different socio economic and future emission scenarios namely the rcp4 5 and the rcp8 5 550 and 1000 co2 ppm by 2100 respectively clarke et al 2007 riahi et al 2007 to downscale precipitation the present study used the nearest analog technique zorita et al 1995 in which the local values for any future atmospheric configuration as given by esm predictors were estimated from the local observations corresponding to most similar or analog historic configuration as represented by era interim alternatively to downscale maximum and minimum temperature a multiple linear regression mlr was applied an extension of simple linear regression that attempts to model the relationship between predictors and a response variable e g predictand by fitting a linear equation to the observed data the fit is determined here based on era interim predictors by minimizing the sum of the residuals between the regression line and the observed data helsel and hirsch 2002 the analog technique was not suitable for temperatures given its inability to extrapolate values out of the observed range in the historical period which may constitute an important issue in the context of a changing climate gutiérrez et al 2013 for precipitation temperatures the leading 30 15 principal components preisendorfer and mobley 1988 of a combination of sea level pressure geopotential height at 250 hpa temperature meridional winds and relative humidity at 850 hpa which are the main drivers of the local climate were used as predictors in this work these were defined over a 2 regular grid covering the domain 60 78 e 23 37 n 2 2 2 crop and soil information inputs historical yield data 2006 2015 for wheat and sugarcane was provided by the ministry of national food security and research mnfsr for two locations badin sindh and multan punjab additional information on management practices e g sowing and harvesting date and sowing method and crop development parameters e g time and duration of flowering maximum canopy cover physiological maturity were shared by the mnfsr for the sindh and punjab provinces table 2 the cane fresh yield was converted into dry yield by first calculating the stalk dry weight fresh weight 0 30 which was then added to the proportion of trash dry weight 0 65 stalk dry weight as calculated from thompson 1978 and later modified by irvine 1983 the crop calendars of wheat and sugarcane along the sindh and punjab provinces were shown in fig 2 while there was only one growing season for wheat nov apr sugarcane was either planted in fall sep oct or just before the start of the spring feb mar however in the present study only the first sowing season was analyzed sep oct the soil texture information for each location was retrieved from research literature having badin and multan loam and clay loam soil textures respectively isric 2020 uaf 2020 2 3 the aquacrop model the fao aquacrop model simulates crop yield in different steps i crop development ii crop transpiration iii biomass production and iv yield formation the calculation of evapotranspiration within the model is divided into transpiration and soil evaporation transpiration is directly related to the canopy cover cc whereas evaporation is proportional to the bare soil for calculating the potential crop transpiration the cc is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration eto determined by the fao 56 penman monteith equation and by the crop coefficient kc then the actual transpiration ta is calculated from potential evapotranspiration in addition ta is used for calculating crop biomass b which is computed by multiplying actual transpiration by the water productivity wp eq 1 the harvest index hi allows to obtain the crop yield y by the crop biomass b eq 2 raes et al 2018 1 crop biomass b as kg ha ta wp 2 crop yield y as kg ha hi b 2 3 1 simulation outputs the yearly evapotranspiration et was determined by the aquacrop model using the fao 56 penman monteith method allen et al 1998 for rcps 4 5 and 8 5 and two irrigation schedules table 3 for the six pmd stations fig 1 over the 21st century the analysis of vegetation transpiration t and soil evaporation se was conducted separately as each of these variables could play a key role on determining the crop water productivity cwp the cwp eq 3 was used to describe the trade offs between water loss and carbon sequestration in the plant photosynthesis and carbon assimilation process climatic factors affecting crop s potential evapotranspiration were assessed to describe the way specific temperature thresholds reduced the cwp due to increased rates of evapotranspiration then sugarcane and wheat yields were examined to better understand if elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations had a positive or negative impact on c3 and c4 plants by reducing photorespiration besides enhancing photosynthetic co2 exchange 3 crop water productivity cwp as kg m 3 b tr where b is the estimated above ground biomass in kg and tr the cumulative amount of water transpired in m3 respectively 2 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop the fao aquacrop model was calibrated and validated using 10 year yield data 2006 2015 of wheat and sugarcane for badin sindh and multan punjab afterwards annual simulations were run until the end of the century using the downscaled meteorological inputs obtained from the esms under the two rcps 4 5 and 8 5 two irrigation schedules table 3 and four additional locations fig 1 one along the sindh province karachi and three extra locations across the punjab province faisalabad dera ismail khan and bahawal pur the aquacrop s performance to simulate observed yield for the period 2006 2015 was evaluated using the standard and normalized root mean square errors rmse and nrmse respectively mean absolute percentage error mape and wilmott s index of agreement d the rmse nrmse mape and wilmott s index of agreement were calculated as in eqs 4 7 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n oi pi 2 5 nrmse rmse o ˆ 100 6 mape i 1 n oi pi oi 2 100 7 d 1 i 1 n oi pi 2 i 1 n p i o i 2 where o i and pi corresponded to the observed and simulated values respectively o i oi o ˆ and p i pi p ˆ showed the differences between an observed and or simulated value with the observed and simulated means and n is the number of treatments rmse had the same units as that of the variable being simulated ton ha 1 whereas nrmse was expressed as a percentage the closer the values were to zero the higher the model s performance we considered that the aquacrop model was well calibrated if the nrmse was lower than 15 and highly performant if lower than 5 raes et al 2018 2 4 irrigation schedules the generation of irrigation schedules was necessary to plan a potential irrigation strategy in the irb aiming at optimizing yields with lower applications of water although crop parameters and initial soil conditions remained similar for the validation of wheat two irrigation schedules for the 2006 2015 period were proposed in order to best fit the observed inter annual precipitation variability and its impacts on observed yields in multan table 3 this was necessary under rainfed conditions as sporadic heavy rains reported along the punjab province disturbed the planned irrigation treatments for that reason the present study followed the approach of sandhu et al 2015 for rice along the punjab region of india and that of andarzian et al 2011 for wheat in iran with different irrigation scenarios according to the observed precipitation while sandhu et al 2015 tested four different irrigation schedules for the validation of rice with aquacrop this work embraced two irrigation schedules for the validation of wheat in multan as a result the present study defined different irrigation schedules based on the average precipitation observed 77 8 mm during wheat s growing season in multan during the 2006 2015 period therefore 77 8 mm was considered the threshold between a drier or wetter than usual dry season consequently triggering different types of irrigation schedules during the calibration process in order to enhance the cwp and the economic yield per unit of water used by the crop an additional irrigation schedule was proposed for karachi sindh province the irrigation method used both for the calibration and validation of wheat was surface irrigation on furrows and the time criteria was fixed intervals with a fixed net application for the calibration of sugarcane in badin the irrigation schedule was set every 7 days with 29 mm 870 mm in total whereas for the validation multan every 10 days with 41 mm 861 mm in total since these irrigation schedules had a similar amount of water application they were both tested in future simulations to assess the cwp of sugarcane under changing climate conditions for sugarcane sprinkler irrigation was the method selected where 100 of the soil surface was watered at each irrigation event the selected time criteria was fixed intervals with a fixed net application 3 results 3 1 climatic trends 3 1 1 precipitation impacts on wheat and sugarcane the downscaled projections show a slight increase 2 7 mm month in average rainfall during oct dec for the period 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps over the six locations fig 3 hence rainfall changes are likely to have no impacts on early growing stages of wheat a similar behavior is projected for flowering and maturity of wheat jan mar with a small decrease 0 5 mm month in average rainfall during jan mar for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps over the six locations conversely sugarcane will be affected at senescence by a notable decrease 10 2 mm month in average rainfall during jul sep for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 for both rcps particularly along bahawal pur dera ismail khan and multan on the contrary badin will experience an increase in precipitation 13 1 mm month over jul sep 3 1 2 temperature impacts on wheat and sugarcane regarding critical temperature thresholds for crop development all sites will experience a considerable increase in the number of days per month with maximum temperatures tmax above 32 c it is likely that early vegetative stages of wheat oct dec will be affected by heat stress conditions if sowing is carried out early in october 32 7 c is considered the maximum temperature threshold for wheat at emergence for instance in karachi and badin the number of days with tmax above 32 c will rise from 25 to 30 days per month by 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 under rcp 8 5 fig 3 more importantly wheat will be affected by heat stress conditions if flowering occurs in march 31 0 c is considered the maximum threshold for wheat at anthesis however the current growing calendar shows that flowering of wheat currently occurs in january when temperatures across all study areas are at its lowest the highest temperature increase during mid growing stages of wheat jan mar is projected to occur over the punjab province where the average tmax mean of four locations will likely increase from 25 6 to 29 8 c for 2080 2099 as compared to 2020 2039 under rcp 8 5 even though the average tmax will remain below 30 c during jan mar it is projected that the number of days per month with tmax above 32 c will exceed 15 and 25 days month respectively under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by the end of the century furthermore if the sowing date of wheat remains the same it is likely that increasing temperatures will shorten the crop s growing cycle hence reducing the probability of being affected by heat stress conditions at flowering in aquacrop the heat units were expressed as growing degree days gdd and increasing temperatures have demonstrated a key role on crop development the previous is reflected in the emerging findings where wheat is likely to reach maturity 20 30 days earlier at the end of the century when comparing the observed values for the 2006 2015 period 150 days against the projected ones fig 5 additionally sugarcane does not display any changes over time because of the type of calibration used for the crop parameters in days after sowing das rather than in gdd as done for wheat therefore the length and duration of sugarcane s development stages were not adjusted to the temperature regimes of distinctive years and as a consquence do not display any changes over time for sugarcane the highest temperature increase is expected to occur between apr jun when the average tmax will likely rise from 40 9 to 43 5 c when comparing the 2020 2039 and 2080 2099 periods under both rcps across the six locations hence exceeding sugarcane s optimal growing temperatures established at 33 38 c the average tmax during oct dec will also experience a notable increase along the sindh province from 33 0 to 35 2 c when 2020 2039 and 2090 2099 periods are compared 3 2 calibration and validation of aquacrop the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated for wheat and sugarcane based on the available yield information for badin and multan over the period 2006 2015 the calibration and validation results in aquacrop for wheat yields were as follows nrmse 10 9 and 13 9 rmse 0 30 and 0 42 t ha mape 9 3 and 12 44 and wilmott s index of agreement d 0 96 both for the calibration and validation although aquacrop slightly overestimated the observed wheat yields during the first half 2006 2010 of the calibration period 4 8 average difference between simulated and observed yields the model was capable of simulating well the inter annual variability of yields fig 6 throughout the entire calibration period 2006 2015 because of the high rainfall variability in multan and its impacts on wheat yields it was challenging for the model to simulate inter annual yield fluctuations during the validation process in badin furthermore the calibration and validation results in aquacrop for sugarcane were as follows nrmse 12 5 and 11 6 rmse 3 57 and 2 59 t ha mape 11 2 and 10 2 and wilmott s index of agreement d 0 89 and 0 90 respectively hence for both crops the statistics showed nrmse values below 15 indicating a good calibration and validation of the aquacrop model 3 3 wheat 3 3 1 soil evaporation and transpiration the present findings reveal a strong relationship between high soil evaporation se and different irrigation schedules along the punjab province although sites along the punjab province 5 days 10 mm total 270 297 mm received 50 additional irrigation than those found in the sindh province 7 days 10 mm total 190 210 mm the se values of punjab province dera ismail khan total se 264 mm tripled those of sindh province karachi total se 90 mm average of both rcps fig 7 overall soil evaporation rates behaved similarly under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 with a decreasing trend over time along faisalabad bahawal pur karachi and badin for transpiration t t rates were lower under frequent and low irrigation volumes with a moderate decrease in t rates overtime being higher under rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 fig 8 the greatest t decline was reported in dera ismail khan from 236 mm in 2010 2019 161 mm in 2090 2099 under rcp 8 5 large t differences were reported when averaging the long time series of karachi 287 mm and badin 99 mm for different irrigation schedules under both rcps finally the effect of heat stress was simulated in aquacrop using the temperature stress coefficient for crop transpiration kstr for wheat the average temperature stress affecting crop transpiration was close to 0 0 07 of the growing period for both rcps across all study areas and under different irrigation schemes 3 3 2 yields and crop water productivity wheat yields are expected to remain constant over the 21st century along dera ismail khan avg 2 36 ton ha faisalabad avg 1 67 ton ha and bahawal pur avg 1 65 ton ha under frequent and low irrigation schemes 5days 10 mm total 270 292 mm for both rcps fig 9 however a notable yield increase is depicted when comparing the previous irrigation scheme with less frequent applications but higher amounts 7 days 13 mm total 312 325 mm with yields improving as follows dera ismail khan avg 3 97 ton ha faisalabad avg 2 80 ton ha and bahawal pur avg 2 87 ton ha in fact with similar high atmospheric evaporative demand and 10 increase between the two irrigation schemes the percentage of water stress reducing leaf expansion is 76 4 under 5days 10 mm and 65 3 under 7days 13 mm average of both rcps as a result the cumulative amount of water transpired increased fig 8 translating into a higher water productivity fig 10 along the sindh province e g karachi yields are also expected to rise from 4 40 ton ha to 5 17 17 5 and 6 50 ton ha 47 7 under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively when the 2010 2019 and 2080 2099 periods are compared regarding the crop water productivity cwp all of the targeted locations are expected to experience an increase in cwp except multan under the irrigation schedule 5 days 10 mm the station reporting the highest cwp is karachi under rcp 8 5 and irrigation schedule 8 days 14 mm with a cwp increase from 1 11 kg m3 to 1 79 kg m3 respectively from 2010 2019 to 2090 2099 fig 10 3 4 sugarcane 3 4 1 soil evaporation and transpiration the soil evaporation se values are higher 396 mm on avg for the complete time series in the punjab province under rcp 8 5 and irrigation schedule 7 days 29 mm when compared to the sindh province 281 mm on avg for the complete time series for rcp 4 5 and irrigation schedule 10 days 41 mm fig 11 there is an increase in se particularly towards the northern parts of the country dera ismail khan and faisalabad with the highest rate of se increase under rcp 8 5 when compared to rcp 4 5 for transpiration t higher t values are projected in the sindh province 674 mm on avg for the complete time series when compared to the punjab province 573 mm on avg for the complete time series for both irrigation schedules and rcps fig 12 however spatial differences on t trends were observed particularly among southernmost sindh province and northernmost areas punjab province while karachi and badin will experience a decrease in t overtime from the start of the simulations all punjab sites except bahawal pur report an exponential increase in t up until 2080 increasing t trends is tightly related to temperature increase during jan mar the thermal increase along the punjab province coincides with the mid growing stages of sugarcane if sown in november as done herein when kc are highest 1 25 consequently enhancing t rates on the other hand temperatures along karachi and badin remain similar over time fig 4 and therefore t rates slightly decrease rather than increase fig 12 aquacrop simulations have shown that sugarcane will be susceptible to increasing temperatures particularly along the punjab province where the average temperature stress affecting crop transpiration kstr is expected to be of 13 1 avg values for the 2010 2099 period throughout the growing season 3 4 2 yields and water use efficiency sugarcane yields display a similar behavior to that of transpiration t over time across the different locations rcps and irrigation schedules fig 13 this is due to the direct relationship between yields and biomass production which depend on t while sugarcane yields experience a notable decrease 14 7 over time along the sindh province from 28 6 ton ha mnfsr avg observed values in karachi between 2006 and 2015 to 24 4ton ha simulated values for the period 2090 2099 for the two locations rcps and irrigation schedules yields are projected to increase over the punjab province for the latter sugarcane yields are expected to increase by 13 0 from 22 2 ton ha mnfsr avg observed values in multan between 2006 and 2015 to 25 1 ton ha in 2070 2080 avg simulated yield values in the four locations rcps and irrigation schedules afterwards yields are projected to decline even though yield trends have a similar behavior in all locations over time and for both rcps yields are estimated to be higher 8 3 under the irrigation schedule 10 days 41 mm 861 mm in total when compared to 7 days 29 mm 870 mm fig 13 for the complete time series 2010 2099 the average crop water productivity cwp in sindh province is of 2 38 and of 2 66 kg m3 11 8 when 7 days 29 mm with 10 days 41 mm are respectively compared fig 14 a similar pattern is observed over the punjab province where the cwp is of 2 47 and 2 86 kg m3 17 when 7 days 29 mm with 10 days 41 mm are respectively compared overall the cwp is projected to decrease over time across the sindh and punjab provinces with a greater rate of decrease under rcp 8 5 for instance the cwp is likely to decline from 2 65 kg m3 to 2 48 kg m3 6 4 under rcp 8 5 when the 2010 2019 and 2080 2099 periods are compared for both irrigation schemes 4 discussion while the simulations present in this study show that wheat will not be adversely impacted by increasing temperatures and co2 concentrations if sowing continues to take place on the 1st of november negative impacts are expected for sugarcane depending on the time horizon and location for wheat as reported in sections 3 1 2 and 3 3 2 the growing cycle will be shortened by 20 30 days because of an increase in the accumulated heat units during a day gdd as a result heat stress conditions 31 0 and 35 4 c are considered the critical temperature thresholds at anthesis and grain filling phase occurring in march and april will be avoided porter and gawith 1999 hence the pollination of wheat and the grain filling phase will not be hindered by the exposure to heat stress conditions while 51 of the indo gangetic plains will be reclassified as heat stress zones by 2050 ortiz et al 2008 several studies including this one suggest a reduction on the duration of the growing season of wheat under changing climatic conditions valizadeh et al 2014 despite the fact that the grain filling phase will be shortened rezaei et al 2015 the present study reveals that an acceleration of wheat s phenological phases under irrigated conditions due to rising temperatures will not result in a reduction of wheat yields in pakistan the simulations of the present study show a stabilization of yields over time fig 8 and therefore our results contrast other studies acknowledging a 20 31 decline in yields when sowing occurs in november sultana et al 2009 ahmad et al 2015 khan et al 2020 this can be explained by the fact that the previous studies do not thoroughly examine indicators such as gdd in crop development nevertheless the present study is in harmony to that of janjua et al 2010 also conducted in pakistan the findings of the latter show that in all co2 temperature and precipitation scenarios wheat will be positively affected and the production will double by 2060 as compared to the present yield levels while sugarcane yields are expected to increase along the punjab province up until 2080 a 2 3 c increase in mean tmax between 2020 and 2039 and 2080 2099 periods in central and southernmost parts of the country karachi badin and bahawal pur will have a negative impact on sugarcane yields the findings of this work for the latter locations are in line with those of afghan and ijaz 2015 acknowledging a 10 decrease in sugarcane yields for every 1 c increase even though aquacrop simulations show a decline in yields along the punjab province from mid end century onwards the present study shows that the rate of decrease will be lower to that reported by akbar and gheewala 2020 in the punjab province 16 a recent publication farooq and gheewala 2020 on cropwat and aquacrop in faisalabad and rahim yar khan has shown a similar yield trend to that of this study where production is expected to increase up until 2080 then decrease by 0 6 under rcp 8 5 when comparing to the baseline period 1981 2005 in both studies results revealed a growth in the crop water requirements due to rising soil evaporation and transpiration with a subsequent increase in irrigation demand however the latter study reports much higher irrigation requirements 1740 2145 mm when sowing between 15 02 and 12 03 in faisalabad to that of this study when sowing occurs on the 01 09 861 mm an increase in temperature under changing climatic conditions will alter soil evaporation and might cause water stress and as consequence the need to apply higher amounts of water to meet sugarcane s evapotranspiration demand hussain et al 2018 even though our findings are in line with the latter study more frequent irrigation 7 days 29 mm rather than 10 days 41 mm will substantially increase the losses derived from direct soil evaporation consequently in order to optimize the use of water resources and increase the yields of sugarcane less frequent but higher water applications is recommended 10 days 41 mm this is particularly important across certain regions in pakistan where agricultural water is used with low efficiency among high water consuming crops sugarcane if promoted the dual challenge of increasing sugarcane production and farm income while saving water will be achieved 5 conclusion agricultural production is affected by a number of climate factors including rainfall patterns temperature rise change in sowing and harvesting dates water availability and evapotranspiration and land suitability the future crop water requirements cwp of wheat and sugarcane in pakistan are likely to increase with time nevertheless water resources can be optimized if appropriate irrigation and planting scheduling under changing climate and environmental conditions are applied the results of this work can inform medium to long term national adaptation priority actions for planning in the agriculture sector in pakistan by enhancing water resource management throughout the country the results provide decision makers and project developers with a robust scientific evidence based for actions related to water allocation and related water policies this study presents the following conclusions a slight increase in projected precipitation 2 7 mm month for oct dec at early growing stages of wheat will have minimal impact on the performance of the crop the slight increase in precipitation will be offset by increasing soil evaporation and transpiration rates due to rising temperatures 2 3 and 4 0 c under rcp 4 5 and 8 5 by 2080 2099 an increase in the accumulated heat units during a day gdd will shorten the growing cycle of wheat by 20 30 days as a result the exposure of wheat to heat stress conditions at anthesis and ripening phase will be reduced consequently we recommend maintaining the current calendars for wheat in the region wheat yields are expected to remain constant along all study areas except for karachi where yields will likely notably increase by 17 5 and 47 7 under rcps 4 5 and 8 5 respectively wheat has higher cwp under less frequent but higher water applications 8 days 14 mm and 7days 13 mm along sindh and punjab province respectively sugarcane is projected to be adversely affected by increasing temperatures mean tmax during apr jun is expected to increase from 40 9 to 43 5 c when compared to the 2020 2039 and 2080 2099 periods across the six the locations under both rcps as a result the exposure of sugarcane to heat stress conditions will be of 13 1 along the entire growing period in order to select the optimal growing period for sugarcane further research needs to be conducted testing different sowing dates and irrigation schedules while transpiration of sugarcane will exponentially increase along the northernmost parts of the country it will remain constant and or slightly decrease in central and southernmost areas over time our results reveal that sugarcane yields will decline from the present onwards in central and southernmost parts of the country however northernmost parts will experience a notable increase up until 2080 after which yields will start to decline compared to wheat sugarcane will perform better in terms of cwp under less frequent but higher volumes of irrigation 10 days 41 mm overall aquacrop was particularly useful to better understand crop s responses to environmental change identify constraints to crop production and water

contribution yield and wp of winter wheat triticum aestivum l compared with conventional high yield cultivation sd1w3 the water saving cultivation sd3w1 obtained a comparable yield meanwhile improved the wp in the range of 14 2 39 2 the non significant change in the yield under sd3w1 was primarily due to the increasing seeding density under w1 irrigation treatment which improved the spike number and grains per unit area especially the main stem spike and had no significant effect on the thousand kernel weight tkw increases in grain yield was generally caused by increases in cap by constructing a reasonable canopy architecture with higher leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the total canopy and upper strata especially the spike area index sai of the upper strata therefore more light was intercepted by spikes which improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to yield increasing the seeding density also improved the assimilate remobilization contribution rc of pre anthesis and decreased the post anthesis leaf photosynthesis contribution to yield increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the root length density rld especially in 120 200 cm soil layer which increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture and improved wp overall when sowing time from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density of approximately 525 600

production in north china plain ncp zhang et al 2010 ma et al 2018 therefore developing a water saving irrigation scheme is important for thoroughly resolving water scarcity wang et al 2006 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a the crop water productivity wp is a measure that is commonly used by agronomists as a metric of agricultural water use heydari 2014 improving the wp by maintaining or increasing grain production and simultaneously reducing the use of irrigation water is crucial in the ncp lu et al 2016 the conventional high yield cultivation practices used for winter wheat depend on early sowing and large amounts of fertilizer and water input at a low seeding density to promote the development of individual plants wang et al 2006 liu et al 2016 under this planting pattern plants generally have large single leaf areas and more secondary roots the large upper leaves decrease the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the lower strata leaves and accelerate the rate of leaf senescence which results in decreased radiation use efficiency rue total canopy photosynthesis and biomass austin et al 1976 liu et al 2016 moreover because the leaves are more sensitive to adversity the photosynthetic function of the leaves decreases rapidly when high temperature and drought stress occurs at the later stage which leads to lower spike weights and yields xue et al 2006 secondary roots are primarily distributed throughout the upper layer of soil and cannot easily adapt to arid environments at the later stage so a continuous water and fertilizer supply is needed to maintain the leaf function wang et al 2001 manske and vlek 2002 deep root systems have been demonstrated to be an important trait for water absorption by wheat from deep soil especially during the later stage when water is used for maintaining photosynthetic production and the sink activity of the grain pask and reynolds 2013 ma et al 2018 li et al 2019 severini et al 2020 controlling soil water before jointing not only can stimulate wheat roots to grow into deeper soil layers wang et al 2006 dai et al 2014 xu et al 2016 but also control the size of the leaf and the number of tillers and reduce the unnecessary consumption of water and fertilizer jones and kirby 1977 in the cultivation practices seeding density and irrigation are two important factors affecting the population architecture and yield formation of wheat a suitable seeding density can relieve the competition between populations and individuals and assist in the construction of a reasonable population architecture zhang et al 1999 ma et al 2018 water can control the leaf area and improve the leaf quality xu et al 2016 identifying the primary characteristics of a reasonable population is important under limited irrigation and a suitable seeding density the crop canopy architecture influences the leaf area index light penetration into the canopy and rue which has a close relationship to the photosynthetic efficiency of the population dong 1994 liu et al 2016 richards et al 2019 considering the photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area especially for the flag leaf instead of full canopy photosynthesis is a historical misunderstanding about the relationship between photosynthesis and crop yields zelitch 1982 although improving the photosynthetic efficiency played only a minor role in the remarkable yield increases that occurred during the green revolution further increases in yield potentials will still largely rely on improved photosynthesis ray et al 2012 zhu et al 2010 the near term opportunities include improving the canopy structure to prevent the light saturation of individual leaves and optimizing the canopy chlorophyll content zhu et al 2010 therefore constructing a favorable crop population architecture is the foundation for improving photosynthesis saving water and obtaining high yields and high water productivity wheat leaves are the key organs for photosynthesis assimilate however spike also have real or potential photosynthetic capabilities zhang et al 2011 compared with the leaf the spike organs have strong resistance to drought and high temperatures through delaying spike senescence abbad et al 2004 maintaining higher water potential for spikelets under water stress tambussi et al 2005 2007 and they also have better photosynthetic performance araus et al 1993 and higher water productivity tambussi et al 2007 moreover the spike can partially refix respiratory co2 by grain respiration during grain filling thereby reducing respiratory loss and increasing the transpiration efficiency of the organ araus et al 1993 vicente et al 2018 the relative contribution of the spike photosynthesis relative to the grain yield varied from 10 to 76 depending on the genotype experimental procedures and the environment biscoe et al 1975 araus et al 1993 many methodologies have been designed to estimate the photosynthetic contribution of different plant organs to filling grains including shading the spikes thorne 1963 application of photosynthesis inhibitor sanchez bragado et al 2016 defoliating leaf blades ahmadi et al 2009 and the stable carbon isotope signature or in its natural abundance sanchez bragado et al 2014 shading techniques have been used by many investigators since they were first introduced identifying the spike photosynthesis contribution to filling grains is important under the increasing seeding density and limited irrigation to date there have been studies on the interaction effect of the sowing time and seeding density seeding density and row spacing on the population character and yield formation of wheat and the canopy architecture has primarily been focused on the leaf size leaf posture and light interception fischer et al 1976 dai et al 2017 ma et al 2018 fischer et al 2019 fewer studies have been conducted to study the non leaf green organ character canopy apparent photosynthesis cap and photosynthetic contribution of each organ instead we believe that increasing seeding density under limited irrigation could help establish a favorable crop population architecture with high photosynthetic efficiency at the later stage and low water consumption improve the photosynthesis contribution from remobilization and spike which is beneficial for increasing the grain yield and water productivity to test this hypothesis a three year experiment with different seeding density and irrigation treatments was conducted in the ncp and the population architectures and cap as well as their effects on the photosynthesis contribution grain yield and water productivity were investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental design the field experiments were conducted during the

delayed to october 21 and the seeding density increased accordingly all the treatments received 100 mm of irrigation water after the summer maize harvest approximately 10 d later we sampled the soil water content and sowed the winter wheat the irrigation treatments included w0 without irrigation after sowing w1 irrigated with an additional 75 mm at jointing stage and w3 irrigated with an additional 75 mm at turning green jointing and anthesis stages respectively the w3 treatment was a sufficient irrigation scheme applied to traditional wheat production by local farmers the w0 and w1

with two battery powered 50 w fans installed within it to maintain interior airflow the chamber was tall enough to contain plants for cap measurements without affecting the canopy structure the chamber was covered with 0 2 mm thick polyethylene terephthalate pet or mylar which permits sunlight to enter at up to 95 of its natural intensity the measurements were taken on a sunny day from 9 00 a m to 11 30 a m at each stage the cap is measured by monitoring the net exchange of co2 from the canopy to the atmosphere when the plants are enclosed in a chamber the plants were enclosed inside the chamber and the co2 concentration was measured continuously for 5 min the chamber was then lifted for another 5 min for gas exchange these measurements were repeated 3 times after measuring the cap an opaque black cloth was used to shade the chamber to measure the soil respiration rates in a nearby plot the plants at the plot were cut off at ground level and removed the cap and soil respiration

99 confidence levels all the figures were created using origin pro 2019 origin lab corporation northampton ma 3 results 3 1 yield traits the anova showed that seeding density and irrigation had significant effects on the yield spike number kernels per spike and grains per unit area and their interaction had a significant effect on the yield spike number and grains per unit area table 1 an increasing seeding density significantly improved the grain yields under the w0 and w1 treatments from 2015 to 2018 and the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w1 condition from 2016 to 2018 and the w0 condition during the 2017 2018 growing season however increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the yield under the w3 treatment fig 1a c compared with the conventional high yield cultivation sd1w3 the water saving cultivation sd3w1 obtained a comparable yield increasing the seeding density improved the spike number and decreased the kernels per spike during the 2015 2018 growing seasons however the difference in spike numbers was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 treatment the grains per unit area was improved with the increased seeding density under the w0 and w1 treatments in 2015 2018 and the difference was not significant between the sd3 and sd4 treatments under the w3 treatment sd2 had the highest grains per unit area and with the increase in the density the grains per unit area decreased but the difference was not significant increasing the seeding density improved the ratio of the main stem spikes to the total spike number fig s2 however increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the thousand kernel weight tkw except for a slight reduction in 2017 2018 table 2 increasing irrigation improved the spike number and kernels per spike and thus the grains per unit area increased table 2 but there was a decrease in the ratio of the main stem spikes to the total spike number fig s2 increasing the irrigation improved the tkw in 2016 2017 and decreased the tkw during the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 growing seasons table 2 3 2 canopy apparent photosynthesis cap during the 2016 2018 growing seasons the maximum cap values occurred at anthesis and decreased thereafter table 3 sd3 and sd4 had a higher cap than sd1 sd2 at the later grain filling stage under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments from 2016 to 2018 table 3 however sd4 had a lowest cap at anthesis and the middle of the grain filling stage under the w3 irrigation treatment during the 2016 2018 seasons at heading stage sd2 had a highest cap than sd3 and sd4 under w1 and w3 irrigation treatments table 3 a pearson s correlation analysis showed that the grain yield was positively correlated with the cap

middle of the grain filling stage in 2016 2017 r 2 0 937 p 0 01 r 2 0 936 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with the cap measured at the later grain filling stage during the 2017 2018 season r 2 0 902 p 0 01 table 4 3 3 canopy architecture 3 3 1 the area and ratio of green organs for individual stems irrigation had a significant effect on the area and ratio of the effective photosynthetic green organs from 2015 to 2018 the seeding density had a significant effect on this factor from 2015 to 2017 but their interaction had no significant effect on the area of the leaf and individual stem over the 2015 2018 growing seasons table 5 the leaf blades are the major photosynthetic organs and had the maximum photosynthetic area and ratio at anthesis and spikes displayed the minimum area and ratio table 5 during the 2015 2017 seasons the effective photosynthetic green organ area for individual stems decreased with the increased seeding density irrespective of the irrigation scheme among these parameters the area of the leaf decreased much more quickly than that of the non leaf organ shoot and spike areas from 2015 2017 increasing the seeding density decreased the area and ratio of the leaf and improved the non leaf organ ratio especially that of the shoot and the spike retained an unchanged ratio and a decreased area table 5 increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the area and ratio of green organs for 2017 2018 due to the small difference in the seeding densities and the high rainfall increasing irrigation increased the area of the effective photosynthetic green organs for individual stems especially the leaf and decreased the proportion of non leaf organ area table 5 3 3 2 area index for canopy green organs seeding density and irrigation both had significant effects on the green organ area index for the total canopy and upper strata including the spike rachis internode and flag leaf from 2016 to 2018 and their interaction was significant during the 2015 2017 season tables 6 and 7 increasing the seeding density and irrigation improved the total green area index tgai leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the total canopy and upper strata during the 2016 2018 growing seasons tables 6 and 7 especially the sai additionally the sai was larger than the lai of the upper strata during 2016 2018 except w3 irrigation treatment in 2017 2018 table 7 3 3 3 light interception and distribution in the canopy the total light interception by the wheat canopy increased with the increased seeding density and irrigation and it ranged from 75 2 to 97 9 during the 2016 2018 growing seasons fig 2 the light interception fraction by the spikes were from 22 5 to 47 4 and the range for the remaining canopy was 46 2 58 2 the spikes intercepted the most energy because they were located at the top of the canopy the light interception by spikes improved with the increased seeding density and irrigation fig 2 increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on light interception by flag leaf penultimate leaf and the remaining leaves under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments but there was decreased light interception by the penultimate and remaining leaves under the w3 condition during the 2016 2018 seasons fig 2 increasing irrigation improved light interception by flag leaves but decreased light interception by the remaining leaves fig 2 3 4 contribution of remobilization of dry matter pre anthesis spike and leaf photosynthesis of post anthesis to grain the anova showed that the seeding density had significant effects on the biomass dry matter remobilization amount ra before anthesis and the grain weight of shaded spike irrigation treatment had significant effects on the biomass and the grain weight of shaded spike and non shaded spike table 1 increasing the seeding density improved the biomass in 2015 2017 and the ra in 2015 2018 seasons irrespective of the irrigation scheme and the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 irrigation treatment during 2016 2017 fig s3 increasing seeding density decreased the grain weight of shaded spike in 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 and the grain weight under the w3 treatment in 2016 2017 fig 3a c compared with non shaded spike spike shading after anthesis reduced grain weight significantly in both irrigation and density treatments fig 3 increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of dry matter remobilization before anthesis to grain rc during the 2015 2018 growing season and there was no significant difference between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 treatment in 2016 2017 season fig 4d f the estimated contribution of remobilization rc ranging from 9 9 to 35 5 with an average of 22 7 in the three years the contribution of spikes photosynthesis to grain estimated from these data tended to increase with more irrigation and with higher sowing density except for sd1 and sd2 under w0 in 2016 2017 fig 4a c the estimated contribution of spikes photosynthesis ranged from 11 3 to 31 5 excepted the sd3 and sd4 under w0 treatment in 2016 2017 with an average of 21 4 in the three years increasing seeding density decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to grain except for the w0 treatment in 2016 2017 fig 4g i the estimated contribution of leaf photosynthesis ranged from 46 0 to 69 0 with an average of 57 5 in the three years 3 5 root group architecture the primary root number per plant for the wheat variety nongda399 was 6 for the three growing seasons irrespective of the seeding density the total primary root number per land area increased significantly with the increased seeding density fig s4 the primary root number per spike was increased with the increased seeding density and reduced with the increased irrigation fig s5 the roots were able to extend to 200 cm during the wheat growing season the root length density rld significantly declined as the soil layer depth increased the primary area of root distribution for different irrigation and seeding density treatments was in the 0 100 cm soil layers with the increase in seeding density under the w1 irrigation treatment from 2015 to 2016 and under the w0 treatment for 2017 2018 the rld in the 0 200 cm soil layers increased significantly especially in the 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm layers fig 5a c during the 2016 2017 season the rld in the 0 200 cm soil layers increased with the irrigation increase under the sd1 seeding density increasing the irrigation times improved the rld markedly in the 0 80 cm soil layers and decreased the rld in the 140 200 cm layer fig 5b 3 6 soil water content et and water productivity wp the anova showed that the seeding density and irrigation had significant effects on the et and wp and their interaction was significant for the wp during the 2015 2018 growing seasons table 1 the high population density of sd3 and sd4 decreased the et in 2015 2016 under the w1 treatment and the et in 2017 2018 irrespective of the irrigation scheme fig 1d f increasing the seeding density improved the soil water content of each layer at jointing stage in the 0 140 cm soil layer especially in 2015 2017 seasons and had no effect on the soil water content at deeper layers fig 6b e h at maturity the soil water content was lower at 140 200 cm with the increase of seeding density in 2015 2017 especially in 180 200 cm fig 6c f i the reduction in the et over the growing season under a high density was primarily due to the lower water consumption from the sowing to jointing stages but the water consumption from the jointing to maturity stages increased in the high seeding density treatment during the 2015 2017 growing seasons fig s6 therefore the wp was increased with the increasing seeding density but the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 during the 2016 2018 seasons fig 1g h i increasing irrigation improved the et during the 2015 2018 growing seasons the wp was improved with the increase in irrigation in 2015 2016 irrespective of the seeding density and in 2016 2017 under the sd1 and sd2 densities fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 increasing seeding density optimized the canopy architecture and improved yield tilman et al 2011 forecasted that global crop production from 2005 to 2050 would require a 100 110 increase to meet the needs of a growing population meeting the challenge of doubling global food production will require increasing crop canopy photosynthesis zhu et al 2010 2012 in our study pearson s correlation analysis showed that the cap measured at the later grain filling stage was positively correlated with the grain yield during the 2016 2018 growing seasons table 4 this finding was consistent with the previous results by dong 1994 and liu et al 2016 dong 1991 1994 shown that lower seeding density decreased the cap before jointing stage but increased it after anthesis under an adequate supply of water and fertilizer however this cultivation techniques requires a large amount of water and fertilizer input to promote the growth of individuals and form strong seedlings to improve photosynthesis at the later stage this is not suitable for the water shortage situation in the ncp in our study increasing seeding density improved the cap at the later of the grain filling stage under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments from 2016 to 2018 table 3 under limited irrigation the plants tended to senescence more quickly at the later grain filling stage and the green leaf area decreased significantly the leaf photosynthetic rate decreased rapidly but the non leaf organs could still cover a large green area and stay green for a long time wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 in our study increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the canopy and upper strata tables 6 and 7 especially the spike area index sai of the upper strata table 7 thus the light interception by the spike was improved fig 2 the spike intercepted the most energy because the spike organs are nearly cylindrical in shape and are distributed vertically in the canopy and they can fully intercept solar radiation at different times of the day and absorb the higher concentrations of co2 flowing above the canopy wang et al 2006 in our study increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to grain because the high spike density resulted in a higher sai and higher fraction of spike light interception and photosynthesis in a population this trend was consistent with previous reports arduini et al 2006 wheat yield comes primarily from the photosynthetic production after anthesis but high seeding density could decrease the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the lower strata leaves and cause premature senescence of wheat population under the condition the remobilization of dry matter pre anthesis stored in vegetative organs is an important source for grain filling tahir and nakata 2005 in our study increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of remobilization of pre anthesis dry matter to grain rc and decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to grain fig 4 the analysis of yield components showed that the higher grain yield was primarily due to the higher number of kernels per unit area directly related to the number of spikes per unit area and secondly to the higher mean kernel weight arduini et al 2006 kernel weight seems to be less affected by seed rate hiltbrunner et al 2005 this was consistent with our studies however fischer et al 1976 2019 revealed little response in yield under densities from 80 to 300 plants m 2 or row spacing ranging from 10 to 40 cm with optimum planting dates in north west mexico the primary reason for this difference is that the experiments were conducted under high water and fertilizer conditions and irrigation was applied every 15 35 days after sowing with sufficient frequency to avoid any visible signs of plant water stress which is different from the water scarcity of the ncp in which increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation can improve the yield in the ncp when sowing from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density was approximately 525 600 plants m 2 under 75 mm of irrigation at the jointing stage 4 2 increasing seeding density increased the deeper root systems and improved water productivity wp deeper rooting has been demonstrated to be an important trait for capturing water stored at depth which is especially important during later stages when water is used for grain filling hendriks et al 2016 severini et al 2020 our study showed that increasing seeding density under limited irrigation increased the root length density rld in the 0 200 cm soil layer especially at 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm fig 5 duggan et al 2005 and hendriks et al 2016 used tin tillering inhibition containing nils near isogenic lines of wheat and found that reduced tillers increased the total root length root biomass and root to shoot ratio at early stem elongation due to the surplus assimilate available for extra root growth because tillers did not develop water deficit before jointing can also control the size of the leaf and decrease the number of tillers jones and kirby 1977 deeper wheat root systems primarily consist of the primary roots and in our study increasing the seeding density improved the number of primary roots in the root system and the primary root number per spike figs s4 and s5 our study showed that with the increase in seeding density the et and water consumption prior to the jointing stage decreased but the water consumption after jointing was improved fig s6 in our water saving cultivation practice winter wheat was sowed at an appropriately late time to reduce the number of tillers and the water consumption the 3 5 5 5 main stem leaf ages accumulated temperature 380 530 c before the wintering stage were used as the age standard for healthy seedlings under late sowing wang et al 2016 in general a large proportion of the available water is lost in soil evaporation with estimates ranging from 20 to 70 of the total available water boogaard et al 1996 from the sowing to jointing stages the growth period lasts approximately 180 days the plant grows slowly due to the lower temperature and there is a large amount of soil exposed to the air so soil evaporation is greater than plant transpiration boogaard et al 1996 increasing the seeding density resulted in faster biomass production and earlier canopy closure which decreased the amount of radiation that reached the soil and reduced the soil evaporation lascano et al 1994 boogaard et al 1996 hernández et al 2020 therefore the soil water content of each layer at jointing stage in the 0 140 cm soil layer was increased with the increased seeding density fig 6 from jointing to maturity the growth period is more than 50 days the plant is growing rapidly and biomass accumulation is faster and the primary soil water consumption is transpiration boogaard et al 1996 in our study at maturity increasing seeding density increased the rld in the 120 200 cm layer and decreased the soil water content in the 140 200 cm layer figs 5 and 6 this is due to increasing seeding density intensified the soil water competition among plants and stimulated the roots to grow into deeper soil layers increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture especially in environments prone to end of season drought or terminal drought zhang et al 2011 xu et al 2016 the canopy temperature has been used as a surrogate for stomatal conductance that controls the exchange of water for co2 in the plant canopy rebetzke et al 2017 li et al 2019 showed that the rooting depth was significantly negatively correlated with the canopy temperature at the later stage deep roots accessing soil water may maintain more open stomata and will have cooler canopies which improves transpiration and leads to high wp 5 conclusion increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the yield by increasing the spike number and grains per unit area and had no significant effect on the tkw increases in grain yield was generally caused by increases in cap at the later stage through improving the lai and nlai especially the sai of the upper strata thus more light was intercepted by spikes which improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to grain yield increasing the seeding density also improved the contribution of dry matter remobilization of pre anthesis to yield and decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to yield the measured average contribution of spike photosynthesis to yield was 21 4 the contribution of remobilization pre anthesis to yield was 22 7 and the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to yield was 57 5 increasing the seeding density improved the rld in the 0 200 cm layer especially at 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm which increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture and improved water productivity overall a reasonable canopy architecture and deep root systems played an important role in improving the photosynthetic potential and water absorption capacity from the deeper soil at the later of grain filling when sowing time from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density of approximately 525 600 plants m 2 with 75 mm of irrigation at the jointing stage was the best cultivation practice for saving water and

station from 2015 to 2018 using the nongda399 wheat variety under the four seeding density and three irrigation schemes to explore the population architecture canopy apparent photosynthesis cap organ contribution yield and wp of winter wheat triticum aestivum l compared with conventional high yield cultivation sd1w3 the water saving cultivation sd3w1 obtained a comparable yield meanwhile improved the wp in the range of 14 2 39 2 the non significant change in the yield under sd3w1 was primarily due to the increasing seeding density under w1 irrigation treatment which improved the spike number and grains per unit area especially the main stem spike and had no significant effect on the thousand kernel weight tkw increases in grain yield was generally caused by increases in cap by constructing a reasonable canopy architecture with higher leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the total canopy and upper strata especially the spike area index sai of the upper strata therefore more light was intercepted by spikes which improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to yield increasing the seeding density also improved the assimilate remobilization contribution rc of pre anthesis and decreased the post anthesis leaf photosynthesis contribution to yield increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the root length density rld especially in 120 200 cm soil layer which increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture and improved wp overall when sowing time from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density of approximately 525 600

production in north china plain ncp zhang et al 2010 ma et al 2018 therefore developing a water saving irrigation scheme is important for thoroughly resolving water scarcity wang et al 2006 xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020a the crop water productivity wp is a measure that is commonly used by agronomists as a metric of agricultural water use heydari 2014 improving the wp by maintaining or increasing grain production and simultaneously reducing the use of irrigation water is crucial in the ncp lu et al 2016 the conventional high yield cultivation practices used for winter wheat depend on early sowing and large amounts of fertilizer and water input at a low seeding density to promote the development of individual plants wang et al 2006 liu et al 2016 under this planting pattern plants generally have large single leaf areas and more secondary roots the large upper leaves decrease the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the lower strata leaves and accelerate the rate of leaf senescence which results in decreased radiation use efficiency rue total canopy photosynthesis and biomass austin et al 1976 liu et al 2016 moreover because the leaves are more sensitive to adversity the photosynthetic function of the leaves decreases rapidly when high temperature and drought stress occurs at the later stage which leads to lower spike weights and yields xue et al 2006 secondary roots are primarily distributed throughout the upper layer of soil and cannot easily adapt to arid environments at the later stage so a continuous water and fertilizer supply is needed to maintain the leaf function wang et al 2001 manske and vlek 2002 deep root systems have been demonstrated to be an important trait for water absorption by wheat from deep soil especially during the later stage when water is used for maintaining photosynthetic production and the sink activity of the grain pask and reynolds 2013 ma et al 2018 li et al 2019 severini et al 2020 controlling soil water before jointing not only can stimulate wheat roots to grow into deeper soil layers wang et al 2006 dai et al 2014 xu et al 2016 but also control the size of the leaf and the number of tillers and reduce the unnecessary consumption of water and fertilizer jones and kirby 1977 in the cultivation practices seeding density and irrigation are two important factors affecting the population architecture and yield formation of wheat a suitable seeding density can relieve the competition between populations and individuals and assist in the construction of a reasonable population architecture zhang et al 1999 ma et al 2018 water can control the leaf area and improve the leaf quality xu et al 2016 identifying the primary characteristics of a reasonable population is important under limited irrigation and a suitable seeding density the crop canopy architecture influences the leaf area index light penetration into the canopy and rue which has a close relationship to the photosynthetic efficiency of the population dong 1994 liu et al 2016 richards et al 2019 considering the photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area especially for the flag leaf instead of full canopy photosynthesis is a historical misunderstanding about the relationship between photosynthesis and crop yields zelitch 1982 although improving the photosynthetic efficiency played only a minor role in the remarkable yield increases that occurred during the green revolution further increases in yield potentials will still largely rely on improved photosynthesis ray et al 2012 zhu et al 2010 the near term opportunities include improving the canopy structure to prevent the light saturation of individual leaves and optimizing the canopy chlorophyll content zhu et al 2010 therefore constructing a favorable crop population architecture is the foundation for improving photosynthesis saving water and obtaining high yields and high water productivity wheat leaves are the key organs for photosynthesis assimilate however spike also have real or potential photosynthetic capabilities zhang et al 2011 compared with the leaf the spike organs have strong resistance to drought and high temperatures through delaying spike senescence abbad et al 2004 maintaining higher water potential for spikelets under water stress tambussi et al 2005 2007 and they also have better photosynthetic performance araus et al 1993 and higher water productivity tambussi et al 2007 moreover the spike can partially refix respiratory co2 by grain respiration during grain filling thereby reducing respiratory loss and increasing the transpiration efficiency of the organ araus et al 1993 vicente et al 2018 the relative contribution of the spike photosynthesis relative to the grain yield varied from 10 to 76 depending on the genotype experimental procedures and the environment biscoe et al 1975 araus et al 1993 many methodologies have been designed to estimate the photosynthetic contribution of different plant organs to filling grains including shading the spikes thorne 1963 application of photosynthesis inhibitor sanchez bragado et al 2016 defoliating leaf blades ahmadi et al 2009 and the stable carbon isotope signature or in its natural abundance sanchez bragado et al 2014 shading techniques have been used by many investigators since they were first introduced identifying the spike photosynthesis contribution to filling grains is important under the increasing seeding density and limited irrigation to date there have been studies on the interaction effect of the sowing time and seeding density seeding density and row spacing on the population character and yield formation of wheat and the canopy architecture has primarily been focused on the leaf size leaf posture and light interception fischer et al 1976 dai et al 2017 ma et al 2018 fischer et al 2019 fewer studies have been conducted to study the non leaf green organ character canopy apparent photosynthesis cap and photosynthetic contribution of each organ instead we believe that increasing seeding density under limited irrigation could help establish a favorable crop population architecture with high photosynthetic efficiency at the later stage and low water consumption improve the photosynthesis contribution from remobilization and spike which is beneficial for increasing the grain yield and water productivity to test this hypothesis a three year experiment with different seeding density and irrigation treatments was conducted in the ncp and the population architectures and cap as well as their effects on the photosynthesis contribution grain yield and water productivity were investigated 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental design the field experiments were conducted during the

chambers using an infrared gas analyzer i e an li 6400 portable gas exchange photosynthesis system li cor lincoln ne usa zhang et al 2020b the chamber had the dimensions 1 1 1 m length width height with two battery powered 50 w fans installed within it to maintain interior airflow the chamber was tall enough to contain plants for cap measurements without affecting the canopy structure the chamber was covered with 0 2 mm thick polyethylene terephthalate pet or mylar which permits sunlight to enter at up to 95 of its natural intensity the measurements were taken on a sunny day from 9 00 a m to 11 30 a m at each stage the cap is measured by monitoring the net exchange of co2 from the canopy to the atmosphere when the plants are enclosed in a chamber the plants were enclosed inside the chamber and the co2 concentration was measured continuously for 5 min the chamber was then lifted for another 5 min for gas exchange these measurements were repeated 3 times after measuring the cap an opaque black cloth was used to shade the chamber to measure the soil respiration rates in a nearby plot the plants at the plot were cut off at ground level and removed the cap and soil respiration

significant effects on the yield spike number kernels per spike and grains per unit area and their interaction had a significant effect on the yield spike number and grains per unit area table 1 an increasing seeding density significantly improved the grain yields under the w0 and w1 treatments from 2015 to 2018 and the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w1 condition from 2016 to 2018 and the w0 condition during the 2017 2018 growing season however increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the yield under the w3 treatment fig 1a c compared with the conventional high yield cultivation sd1w3 the water saving cultivation sd3w1 obtained a comparable yield increasing the seeding density improved the spike number and decreased the kernels per spike during the 2015 2018 growing seasons however the difference in spike numbers was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 treatment the grains per unit area was improved with the increased seeding density under the w0 and w1 treatments in 2015 2018 and the difference was not significant between the sd3 and sd4 treatments under the w3 treatment sd2 had the highest grains per unit area and with the increase in the density the grains per unit area decreased but the difference was not significant increasing the seeding density improved the ratio of the main stem spikes to the total spike number fig s2 however increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the thousand kernel weight tkw except for a slight reduction in 2017 2018 table 2 increasing irrigation improved the spike number and kernels per spike and thus the grains per unit area increased table 2 but there was a decrease in the ratio of the main stem spikes to the total spike number fig s2 increasing the irrigation improved the tkw in 2016 2017 and decreased the tkw during the 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 growing seasons table 2 3 2 canopy apparent photosynthesis cap during the 2016 2018 growing seasons the maximum cap values occurred at anthesis and decreased thereafter table 3 sd3 and sd4 had a higher cap than sd1 sd2 at the later grain filling stage under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments from 2016 to 2018 table 3 however sd4 had a lowest cap at anthesis and the middle of the grain filling stage under the w3 irrigation treatment during the 2016 2018 seasons at heading stage sd2 had a highest cap than sd3 and sd4 under w1 and w3 irrigation treatments table 3 a pearson s correlation analysis showed that the grain yield was positively correlated with the cap

p 0 01 table 4 3 3 canopy architecture 3 3 1 the area and ratio of green organs for individual stems irrigation had a significant effect on the area and ratio of the effective photosynthetic green organs from 2015 to 2018 the seeding density had a significant effect on this factor from 2015 to 2017 but their interaction had no significant effect on the area of the leaf and individual stem over the 2015 2018 growing seasons table 5 the leaf blades are the major photosynthetic organs and had the maximum photosynthetic area and ratio at anthesis and spikes displayed the minimum area and ratio table 5 during the 2015 2017 seasons the effective photosynthetic green organ area for individual stems decreased with the increased seeding density irrespective of the irrigation scheme among these parameters the area of the leaf decreased much more quickly than that of the non leaf organ shoot and spike areas from 2015 2017 increasing the seeding density decreased the area and ratio of the leaf and improved the non leaf organ ratio especially that of the shoot and the spike retained an unchanged ratio and a decreased area table 5 increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on the area and ratio of green organs for 2017 2018 due to the small difference in the seeding densities and the high rainfall increasing irrigation increased the area of the effective photosynthetic green organs for individual stems especially the leaf and decreased the proportion of non leaf organ area table 5 3 3 2 area index for canopy green organs seeding density and irrigation both had significant effects on the green organ area index for the total canopy and upper strata including the spike rachis internode and flag leaf from 2016 to 2018 and their interaction was significant during the 2015 2017 season tables 6 and 7 increasing the seeding density and irrigation improved the total green area index tgai leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the total canopy and upper strata during the 2016 2018 growing seasons tables 6 and 7 especially the sai additionally the sai was larger than the lai of the upper strata during 2016 2018 except w3 irrigation treatment in 2017 2018 table 7 3 3 3 light interception and distribution in the canopy the total light interception by the wheat canopy increased with the increased seeding density and irrigation and it ranged from 75 2 to 97 9 during the 2016 2018 growing seasons fig 2 the light interception fraction by the spikes were from 22 5 to 47 4 and the range for the remaining canopy was 46 2 58 2 the spikes intercepted the most energy because they were located at the top of the canopy the light interception by spikes improved with the increased seeding density and irrigation fig 2 increasing the seeding density had no significant effect on light interception by flag leaf penultimate leaf and the remaining leaves under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments but there was decreased light interception by the penultimate and remaining leaves under the w3 condition during the 2016 2018 seasons fig 2 increasing irrigation improved light interception by flag leaves but decreased light interception by the remaining leaves fig 2 3 4 contribution of remobilization of dry matter pre anthesis spike and leaf photosynthesis of post anthesis to grain the anova showed that the seeding density had significant effects on the biomass dry matter remobilization amount ra before anthesis and the grain weight of shaded spike irrigation treatment had significant effects on the biomass and the grain weight of shaded spike and non shaded spike table 1 increasing the seeding density improved the biomass in 2015 2017 and the ra in 2015 2018 seasons irrespective of the irrigation scheme and the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 irrigation treatment during 2016 2017 fig s3 increasing seeding density decreased the grain weight of shaded spike in 2015 2016 and 2017 2018 and the grain weight under the w3 treatment in 2016 2017 fig 3a c compared with non shaded spike spike shading after anthesis reduced grain weight significantly in both irrigation and density treatments fig 3 increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of dry matter remobilization before anthesis to grain rc during the 2015 2018 growing season and there was no significant difference between sd3 and sd4 under the w3 treatment in 2016 2017 season fig 4d f the estimated contribution of remobilization rc ranging from 9 9 to 35 5 with an average of 22 7 in the three years the contribution of spikes photosynthesis to grain estimated from these data tended to increase with more irrigation and with higher sowing density except for sd1 and sd2 under w0 in 2016 2017 fig 4a c the estimated contribution of spikes photosynthesis ranged from 11 3 to 31 5 excepted the sd3 and sd4 under w0 treatment in 2016 2017 with an average of 21 4 in the three years increasing seeding density decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to grain except for the w0 treatment in 2016 2017 fig 4g i the estimated contribution of leaf photosynthesis ranged from 46 0 to 69 0 with an average of 57 5 in the three years 3 5 root group architecture the primary root number per plant for the wheat variety nongda399 was 6 for the three growing seasons irrespective of the seeding density the total primary root number per land area increased significantly with the increased seeding density fig s4 the primary root number per spike was increased with the increased seeding density and reduced with the increased irrigation fig s5 the roots were able to extend to 200 cm during the wheat growing season the root length density rld significantly declined as the soil layer depth increased the primary area of root distribution for different irrigation and seeding density treatments was in the 0 100 cm soil layers with the increase in seeding density under the w1 irrigation treatment from 2015 to 2016 and under the w0 treatment for 2017 2018 the rld in the 0 200 cm soil layers increased significantly especially in the 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm layers fig 5a c during the 2016 2017 season the rld in the 0 200 cm soil layers increased with the irrigation increase under the sd1 seeding density increasing the irrigation times improved the rld markedly in the 0 80 cm soil layers and decreased the rld in the 140 200 cm layer fig 5b 3 6 soil water content et and water productivity wp the anova showed that the seeding density and irrigation had significant effects on the et and wp and their interaction was significant for the wp during the 2015 2018 growing seasons table 1 the high population density of sd3 and sd4 decreased the et in 2015 2016 under the w1 treatment and the et in 2017 2018 irrespective of the irrigation scheme fig 1d f increasing the seeding density improved the soil water content of each layer at jointing stage in the 0 140 cm soil layer especially in 2015 2017 seasons and had no effect on the soil water content at deeper layers fig 6b e h at maturity the soil water content was lower at 140 200 cm with the increase of seeding density in 2015 2017 especially in 180 200 cm fig 6c f i the reduction in the et over the growing season under a high density was primarily due to the lower water consumption from the sowing to jointing stages but the water consumption from the jointing to maturity stages increased in the high seeding density treatment during the 2015 2017 growing seasons fig s6 therefore the wp was increased with the increasing seeding density but the difference was not significant between sd3 and sd4 during the 2016 2018 seasons fig 1g h i increasing irrigation improved the et during the 2015 2018 growing seasons the wp was improved with the increase in irrigation in 2015 2016 irrespective of the seeding density and in 2016 2017 under the sd1 and sd2 densities fig 1 4 discussion 4 1 increasing seeding density optimized the canopy architecture and improved yield tilman et al 2011 forecasted that global crop production from 2005 to 2050 would require a 100 110 increase to meet the needs of a growing population meeting the challenge of doubling global food production will require increasing crop canopy photosynthesis zhu et al 2010 2012 in our study pearson s correlation analysis showed that the cap measured at the later grain filling stage was positively correlated with the grain yield during the 2016 2018 growing seasons table 4 this finding was consistent with the previous results by dong 1994 and liu et al 2016 dong 1991 1994 shown that lower seeding density decreased the cap before jointing stage but increased it after anthesis under an adequate supply of water and fertilizer however this cultivation techniques requires a large amount of water and fertilizer input to promote the growth of individuals and form strong seedlings to improve photosynthesis at the later stage this is not suitable for the water shortage situation in the ncp in our study increasing seeding density improved the cap at the later of the grain filling stage under the w0 and w1 irrigation treatments from 2016 to 2018 table 3 under limited irrigation the plants tended to senescence more quickly at the later grain filling stage and the green leaf area decreased significantly the leaf photosynthetic rate decreased rapidly but the non leaf organs could still cover a large green area and stay green for a long time wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2011 in our study increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the leaf area index lai and non leaf area index nlai of the canopy and upper strata tables 6 and 7 especially the spike area index sai of the upper strata table 7 thus the light interception by the spike was improved fig 2 the spike intercepted the most energy because the spike organs are nearly cylindrical in shape and are distributed vertically in the canopy and they can fully intercept solar radiation at different times of the day and absorb the higher concentrations of co2 flowing above the canopy wang et al 2006 in our study increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to grain because the high spike density resulted in a higher sai and higher fraction of spike light interception and photosynthesis in a population this trend was consistent with previous reports arduini et al 2006 wheat yield comes primarily from the photosynthetic production after anthesis but high seeding density could decrease the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the lower strata leaves and cause premature senescence of wheat population under the condition the remobilization of dry matter pre anthesis stored in vegetative organs is an important source for grain filling tahir and nakata 2005 in our study increasing the seeding density improved the contribution of remobilization of pre anthesis dry matter to grain rc and decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to grain fig 4 the analysis of yield components showed that the higher grain yield was primarily due to the higher number of kernels per unit area directly related to the number of spikes per unit area and secondly to the higher mean kernel weight arduini et al 2006 kernel weight seems to be less affected by seed rate hiltbrunner et al 2005 this was consistent with our studies however fischer et al 1976 2019 revealed little response in yield under densities from 80 to 300 plants m 2 or row spacing ranging from 10 to 40 cm with optimum planting dates in north west mexico the primary reason for this difference is that the experiments were conducted under high water and fertilizer conditions and irrigation was applied every 15 35 days after sowing with sufficient frequency to avoid any visible signs of plant water stress which is different from the water scarcity of the ncp in which increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation can improve the yield in the ncp when sowing from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density was approximately 525 600 plants m 2 under 75 mm of irrigation at the jointing stage 4 2 increasing seeding density increased the deeper root systems and improved water productivity wp deeper rooting has been demonstrated to be an important trait for capturing water stored at depth which is especially important during later stages when water is used for grain filling hendriks et al 2016 severini et al 2020 our study showed that increasing seeding density under limited irrigation increased the root length density rld in the 0 200 cm soil layer especially at 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm fig 5 duggan et al 2005 and hendriks et al 2016 used tin tillering inhibition containing nils near isogenic lines of wheat and found that reduced tillers increased the total root length root biomass and root to shoot ratio at early stem elongation due to the surplus assimilate available for extra root growth because tillers did not develop water deficit before jointing can also control the size of the leaf and decrease the number of tillers jones and kirby 1977 deeper wheat root systems primarily consist of the primary roots and in our study increasing the seeding density improved the number of primary roots in the root system and the primary root number per spike figs s4 and s5 our study showed that with the increase in seeding density the et and water consumption prior to the jointing stage decreased but the water consumption after jointing was improved fig s6 in our water saving cultivation practice winter wheat was sowed at an appropriately late time to reduce the number of tillers and the water consumption the 3 5 5 5 main stem leaf ages accumulated temperature 380 530 c before the wintering stage were used as the age standard for healthy seedlings under late sowing wang et al 2016 in general a large proportion of the available water is lost in soil evaporation with estimates ranging from 20 to 70 of the total available water boogaard et al 1996 from the sowing to jointing stages the growth period lasts approximately 180 days the plant grows slowly due to the lower temperature and there is a large amount of soil exposed to the air so soil evaporation is greater than plant transpiration boogaard et al 1996 increasing the seeding density resulted in faster biomass production and earlier canopy closure which decreased the amount of radiation that reached the soil and reduced the soil evaporation lascano et al 1994 boogaard et al 1996 hernández et al 2020 therefore the soil water content of each layer at jointing stage in the 0 140 cm soil layer was increased with the increased seeding density fig 6 from jointing to maturity the growth period is more than 50 days the plant is growing rapidly and biomass accumulation is faster and the primary soil water consumption is transpiration boogaard et al 1996 in our study at maturity increasing seeding density increased the rld in the 120 200 cm layer and decreased the soil water content in the 140 200 cm layer figs 5 and 6 this is due to increasing seeding density intensified the soil water competition among plants and stimulated the roots to grow into deeper soil layers increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture especially in environments prone to end of season drought or terminal drought zhang et al 2011 xu et al 2016 the canopy temperature has been used as a surrogate for stomatal conductance that controls the exchange of water for co2 in the plant canopy rebetzke et al 2017 li et al 2019 showed that the rooting depth was significantly negatively correlated with the canopy temperature at the later stage deep roots accessing soil water may maintain more open stomata and will have cooler canopies which improves transpiration and leads to high wp 5 conclusion increasing the seeding density under limited irrigation improved the yield by increasing the spike number and grains per unit area and had no significant effect on the tkw increases in grain yield was generally caused by increases in cap at the later stage through improving the lai and nlai especially the sai of the upper strata thus more light was intercepted by spikes which improved the contribution of spike photosynthesis to grain yield increasing the seeding density also improved the contribution of dry matter remobilization of pre anthesis to yield and decreased the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to yield the measured average contribution of spike photosynthesis to yield was 21 4 the contribution of remobilization pre anthesis to yield was 22 7 and the contribution of post anthesis leaf photosynthesis to yield was 57 5 increasing the seeding density improved the rld in the 0 200 cm layer especially at 0 20 cm and 120 200 cm which increased the absorption and use of deep soil moisture and improved water productivity overall a reasonable canopy architecture and deep root systems played an important role in improving the photosynthetic potential and water absorption capacity from the deeper soil at the later of grain filling when sowing time from october 10 20 the appropriate seeding density of approximately 525 600 plants m 2 with 75 mm of irrigation at the jointing stage was the best cultivation practice for saving water and

consumption of agricultural water accounts for 63 2 of the total water consumption and most is used to irrigation wang et al 2010 with the increasing of irrigation areas and crops water shortage becomes one of the main limiting factors for agricultural production and threatens the agriculture sustainability in china especially in north china kang et al 2017 wu et al 2007 optimizing agricultural irrigation to improve the crop water use efficiency wue has significance for agricultural sustainable development a large numbers of studies have been conducted to optimize irrigation

the shortage of agricultural water resources potato is sensitive to the variations of water h wang et al 2019 several studies pointed out that the potato yield increased with increasing amount of irrigation yuan et al 2003 however potato yield will not increase always with increasing irrigation due to the high n leaching under high irrigation woli et al 2016 in addition the time and frequency of irrigation also had significant impacts on potato yield and wue kassem 2008 increasing the irrigation frequencies and decreasing the irrigation amount could significantly improve potato yield and wue kang et al 2004 some studies revealed that irrigated during the periods of tuberization and tuber bulking could significantly enhance potato yield qin et al 2013 tang et al 2018a 2019 however few

et al 2020 for example optimum application of time and amount of n could also enhance potato yield marketable tuber rate and quality rosem et al 2009 neshev and manolov 2015 however few studies were concentrated on potato production in the agro pastoral ecotone in north china lots of studies revealed that there is a significant interaction between irrigation and n managements the optimal irrigation could increase nue reduce n loss and enhance crop yields and the optimal n application rate varied with the different irrigation levels mahajan et al 2012 khan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 therefore optimizing the combination of water and n managements was more necessary than only considering the single measure generally the optimal water and n management can be identified by field experiments yang and su 2009 suggested that reducing the amount of irrigation by 10 25 coupled with 225 kg ha 1 n could reduce the groundwater pollution significantly in heihe oasis h wang et al 2019 pointed out that applying full irrigation every 8 days coupled with 200 kg ha 1 of n was the optimum scheduling for potato production in yulin site of northern china moreover potato yield wue and nue could be enhanced significantly under the optimum combination of irrigation and n fertilization he et al 1999 badr et al 2012 x yang et al 2017 the negative environmental impacts could be reduced under the optimum combinations of irrigation and n fertilization fontes et al 2010 karam et al 2014 x wang et al 2019 however field experiments need lots of funds and long time inputs of labor tang et al 2019 agricultural system models could analyze the response of crop growth to various couplings of water and n treatments under different agricultural practices soil types and climate conditions and the cost was much lower than the field experiment keating et al 2003 therefore many studies were conducted based on the model to simulate crop growth water and nitrogen use li et al 2015 y zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as a typical crop model apsim potato model has been tested and applied in different regions under variable climate conditions brown et al 2011 tang et al 2018 2019 the model could reproduce the phenology yield water and n balance and it has been used in australia and new zealand to optimize irrigation and n managements brown et al 2011 lissson and cotching 2011 however it was rarely evaluated in china agro pastoral ecotone ape in china is one of the staple potato production regions due to suitable climate and soil conditions tang et al 2016 in the ape the planting area of potato has increased sharply during past several decades and its yield accounts for 46 8 of the total agricultural products tang et al 2018a 2018b generally water shortage is the main limiting factor for potato production in the ape due to annual and growing season precipitation often does not meet the water requirements for potato growth tang et al 2019 in our previous studies we have optimized the planting dates across ape and the optimal planting dates were may 10 may 20 and may 30 in the eastern middle and western ape for rainfed potato tang et al 2018a application of irrigation and nitrogen is an important measure to increase potato yield however a serious problem is that excessive irrigation about 400 mm and n around 200 kg ha 1 fertilization was applied in the region qin et al 2013 which often result in relatively low wue nue and income while also wasting valuable water resources and causing damage to the soil structure k yang et al 2017 x yang et al 2017 previous studies showed that the groundwater table in the ape decreased sharply by 0 5 1 0 m yr 1 due to continuous irrigation chen et al 2016 groundwater pollution is another severe environment problem due to the excess application of n fertilizer in the ape zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 optimizing irrigation and n schedules is an effective way to balance yield cost and environmental impacts badr et al 2012 however the studies of the optimizing of irrigation and n fertilizer conducted in the ape mainly concentrated on maximizing yield or wue qin et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 actually optimization of irrigation and n fertilizer should be based on the local condition including not only the climate and soil conditions but also the management habits and inputs of local farmers in addition based on different production goals including the pursuit of maximum yield benefit or the pursuit of sustainable agro ecological development there are certain differences in water and nitrogen management therefore the environment impact and development of intelligent agricultural should be considered in the optimizing of irrigation and n fertilizer based on the multiple goals therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the response of potato yield water use and n use to different combination of irrigation and n fertilizer levels and 2 recommend the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilization for different production goals including the maximizing yield wue nue and income of potato in the ape 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region climate and soil data the agro pastoral ecotone ape is a transitional zone between arid and semi arid pastoral grasslands to intensive cropland in north china shi et al 2018 the zone covers areas of eight provinces heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi shannxi ningxia and gansu and one autonomous region inner mongolia in this study considering integrity and effectiveness of the climate data twenty seven sites were selected and the sites were roughly and uniformly distributed in the ape fig 1 based on the potato planting dates determined by the onset of rainy season which was defined as the first wet day of 5 day spell receiving at least 20 mm without any 10 day dry spell in the following day tang et al 2018a the ape was divided into three regions i e zone ⅰ eastern ape zone ⅱ middle ape and zone ⅲ western ape this is because planting date has significance impacts on potato growth in the ape and the optimal planting date in different sub regions of ape was different tang et al 2018a the sunshine hours sh h growing season average temperature t total precipitation p mm onset of rainy season ors planting date pd harvesting date hd nitrogen fertilizer inputs n kg ha 1 and irrigation inputs ir mm during potato growing season in three zones were shown in table 1 climate data including daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation mm and sunshine hours h during 1981 2010 in the study sites and 2015 2016 at the experimental site were available from china meteorological administration cma daily solar radiation was calculated based on daily sunshine hours using the ångström equation black et al 1954 j wang et al 2015 the observed soil parameters were input parameters to drive apsim potato model the physical and chemical properties of soil at each site were obtained from the china soil scientific database http www soil csdb cn the physical and chemical properties of the soil are recorded in the depth more than 1 m in the database and considering the potato root depth we used the soil parameters within the 1 m depth the detailed hydraulic characteristics of the soil at each site were shown in table s1 2 2 coupling water and n experiments field experiments with different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization were conducted at a typical site wuchuan in the ape in 2015 and 2016 the soil parameters were shown in the table s1 four irrigation levels 0 90 180 and 360 mm coupled with four n levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 were set in this experiment with three replications of each treatment the irrigation method was drip irrigation and the drip irrigation belt was laid between the two rows of potato before drip irrigation n fertilizer was spread evenly in the furrow between the two rows and then the drip irrigation was applied the interactions of different levels of irrigation and n fertilization were named as w i n j i and j ranged from 0 to 4 with the interval of 1 potato was planted in 7 5 4 m plots and the cultivar kexin1 was used in all treatments the tuber was elliptical the block was large and tidy and the depth of the bud was medium the cultivar was resistant to the y and leaf rolling viruses drought tolerant and resistant to bunchy top disease more resistant to pest and late blight planting date used the local normal planting date of may 5 which is the optimal date for local region the planting density was 46 500 plants per ha base fertilizer was applied at planting with 120 kg ha 1 of ammonium diammonium phosphate the content of p2o5 was 46 and 90 kg ha 1 of potassium chloride the content of k2o was 60 the key phenological stages including planting emergence tuberization tuber bulking and maturity were recorded leaf area index lai and biomass of each plant part root tuber stem and leaf were measured every 15 days after emergence using 3 plant samples per plot the leaf area was measured using the portable area meter model li 3000 c soil water content was taken every 15 days to the depth 1 m at every 10 cm using the oven drying method the fresh tuber yield with moisture content of 80 was measured after harvest from the four 7 5 m rows in the center of the block giving a harvest area of 15 m2 the potato n uptake was calculated based on measurement of the n content in different organs kjeldahl method was used to measure the n content in the different organs and mineral n content in the soil the results of the field experiments have been shown in the supplemental materials 2 3 apsim potato model calibration and validation apsim potato model is a process based crop model the key modules used in the apsim potato are potato soilwat soiln surfaceom and a management module apsim simulated potato development biomass growth and tuber yield in response to temperature photoperiod solar radiation soil water and nitrogen at a daily time step the more detailed description about the basic parameters and simulation process of the apsim potato could be referred to tang et al 2018a in this study we evaluated the performance of apsim potato model in simulating the response of potato growth to different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization based on two years field experiments at wuchuan fig 1 observed data in 2015 and 2016 with different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization was used to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model respectively the calibrating and validating including the comparisons of observed and simulated phenology soil water content in 1 m depth n uptake by potato the content of mineral n in the 1 m depth and potato fresh yield the trail and error method was used to derive the genetic parameters of potato and parameters related to n process the detailed parameters were shown in table 2 2 4 modeling impacts of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on potato yield water use nitrogen use and groundwater in the apsim potato model different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization were set for the long term simulation in 1981 2010 under the optimal planting dates based on our previous study tang et al 2018a in three regions of ape first we simulated potato growth under the combination of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers i e the amounts of 400 mm and 200 kg ha 1 of irrigation and n fertilizer were applied the application of irrigation and n fertilization was 100 mm and 50 kg ha 1 at emergence 150 mm and 75 kg ha 1 at tuberization and tuber bulking qin et al 2013 then the simulation scenarios were set to optimize the combination of irrigation and n fertilization to achieve different production goals considering the fine control of irrigation and n fertilizer using the precision instruments as a trend in the future the settings of irrigation and n fertilizer management in the simulation were different from the current field practices which decided by farmer s experience referred to previous studies the irrigation was applied based on the soil water deficit and these advanced irrigation methods used in the model is an extension from field experimental results as demonstrated by previous studies keating et al 2003 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit the difference between filed capacity moisture and current soil water content at root depth beyond a certain value and the values were set from 10 to 100 mm with an interval of 10 mm generally the rooting depth of potatoes is in the range of 40 80 cm stalham and allen 2004 wang et al 2006 and there were evidences that potato could extend their rooting depth down to 1 m stone 1982 iwama 2008 therefore the scheduling irrigation was set based on the water deficits of 1 m depth the 10 irrigation deficit levels of 100 90 10 mm were represented as ir100 ir90 and ir10 under each irrigation scenario the amounts of n were set at an interval of 30 kg ha 1 from 0 n0 to 210 n210 kg ha 1 in total 8 n treatments were set totally there were 71 280 simulation scenarios in the study due to the optimal planting dates and soil properties are different in the different sub regions of ape thus we optimized the water and n management practices in different sub regions based on local climate environment and soil condition in this study the irrigation water was all from the pumping groundwater due to the lacking of surface water in the ape zhu et al 2014 applying irrigation from the pumping groundwater would result in depletion of groundwater based on related studies the depth of groundwater table in the ape is relatively shallow about 1 2 4 m in the rainy season and the irrigation water moving down the 1 m depth will directly impact on groundwater level fan et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 zhai et al 2021 in the simulation the loss of irrigation water in different irrigation scheduling was not considered i e the irrigation efficiency was assumed to 1 in all simulation scenarios net groundwater use nug mm due to its extraction for irrigation can be calculated as 1 nug gui rdp where gui is the amount of groundwater used for irrigation mm rdp is the recharge by deep drainage mm water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and fertilizer n use efficiency fnue kg ha 1 kg 1 of potato were calculated as follows 2 wue y et where y was the total fresh yield kg ha 1 et was evapotranspiration mm which was the sum of soil evaporation es mm and crop transpiration ep simulated by apsim potato 3 fnue y tn where y was the total fresh yield tn was the amount of n applied specially applied irrigation and n would induce the loss of n which includes the n leaching by the irrigation and denitrification by denitrifying bacteria in this study the n loss was the sum of n leaching and denitrification simulated by apsim potato model this is because the n fertilizer was applied in the 5 cm depth in the model and the ammonia volatilization could be ignored ju et al 2002 and we only considered the n leaching and denitrification 2 5 the economic analysis of potato production under different combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization net income ni that the farmers can achieve under different combinations was estimated as 4 ni yield p inputs where yield was the potato fresh yield p is the price of the fresh tuber 0 8 cny kg 1 in the local market yield p represent the gross income of local farmers total cost of cultivation including the cost of seeding irrigation fertilization use of fungicides and pesticide tillage planting and harvesting and labor was estimated based on the local market price labor cost using for agronomic management during potato growing season was estimated about 500 cny ha 1 the detailed costs of field inputs were showed in table 3 2 6 statistical analysis the performance of apsim potato model in simulating the phenology soil water content and yield of potato was evaluated based on the regression lines of the coefficient of determination r 2 index of agreement d root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse determined by observed and simulated

s i are the observed and simulated values o avg and s avg are the mean of observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of observations in this study we interpolated values of the simulation variables of 27 selected sites to the whole ape by using the inverse distance weighted method idw 3 results 3 1 the performance of apsim potato model apsim potato is a process based crop model and it has been applied in different regions with various climate and soil conditions in our previous studies apsim potato version 7 7 had been validated based on serial planting experimental data tang et al 2018a the results showed that the model performed well in simulating phenology with rmse less than 4 days soil water content at 1 m depth with rrmse less than 9 and yields with rrmse less than 8 moreover the model had been validated based on experimental data with irrigation treatments in the same site tang et al 2019 j tang et al 2020 the results showed the model could also perform well in simulating soil water content at 1 m depth with rrmse less than 15 4 growing period evapotranspiration with rrmse less than 10 6 and yield with rrmse less than 17 4 in this study results showed that apsim potato model performed well in simulating the potato phenology and the rmse between observed and simulated phenology was 2 4 days fig 2a using the calibrated crop parameters of kexin1 table 2 the model could simulate soil water content swc well and the rrmse between observed values and simulated values was 14 1 fig 2b the performance for simulating swc in different soil depth was shown in fig s1 simulated n uptake by potato closely followed by the observations fig 2c and the model was able to explain 77 of variation in observed n uptake by potato under different irrigation and n treatments simulations of mineral n content in the soil had good agreement with the measurements fig 2d and the model was able to explain 89 of the variation in mineral n content in the soil under different couplings of irrigation and n applications the performance for simulating cmn in different soil depth was shown in fig s1 good agreement between observed and simulated potato yield was obtained with the rrmse of 14 0 fig 2e 3 2 potato yield income wue decline of groundwater table nue and n loss across the ape under local farmers practices simulated potato fresh yields under combination of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers ranged from 25 7 to 35 0 t ha 1 from 28 7 to 37 4 t ha 1 and from 27 5 to 34 9 t ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively in 1981 2010 and the yield was highest in the zone ⅱ followed by zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ fig 3a wues were 75 7 87 2 66 2 95 3 and 75 3 96 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ

similar with the yield and the income was highest in the zone ⅱ with the value of 18 100 cny ha 1 and the values were 17 200 and 16 800 cny ha 1 in the zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 3d the annual ngu showed an increasing trend from eastern ape to western ape in 1981 2010 due to the water drainage difference in different regions and the values were 157 5 226 5 169 5 229 5 and 139 5 232 2 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 3e annual n loss ranged from 2 2 to 33 7 kg ha 1 from 2 0 to 30 9 kg ha 1 and from 1 8 to 24 8 kg ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ with the highest value in the zone ⅰ following by zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 3f 3 3 combination of irrigation and nitrogen for maximizing potato yield in the ape combination of ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm and n210 210 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied maximized potato fresh yields in all regions of ape during 1981 2010 fig 4 potato fresh yields were highest in the zone ⅱ with the range of 31 7 38 6 t ha 1 followed by zone ⅲ and zone ⅰ with the yields of 29 2 37 2 and 29 8 37 7 t ha 1 fig 4a under the combination the irrigation amounts showed a decreasing trend from east to west with the averages of 664 634 and 607 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 4b potato wues ranged from 62 8 to 80 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 from 64 1 to 85 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 and from 64 1 to 81 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the three parts of ape with the highest wue in the zone ⅱ fig 4c averaged potato nue was 158 9 kg ha 1 kg 1 in the zone ⅰ which was 5 5 and 3 3 lower than the zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 4d the annual ngu showed a decrease trend from east to west and the ngus were 180 270 165 3150 and 180 345 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 4e change trend of the annual n loss was similar with the gdt and the averaged values were 13 7 10 7 and 8 4 kg ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 4f 3 4 combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization that maximized potato wue in the ape combinations of irrigation and n fertilization that maximized the wue were different in different parts of ape fig 5 s6 under the combinations for maximizing wue potato yields ranged from 24 3 to 37 4 t ha 1 from 25 1 to 36 3 t ha 1 and from 21 6 to 35 6 t ha 1 in zone i ii and iii respectively fig 5a the difference among the combinations were mainly concentrated on the irrigation amount i e the irrigation levels ranged from ir60 to ir30 while the amounts of n fertilization amount were 90 kg ha 1 in most sites of ape fig 5b potato wue was highest in the zone ⅱ followed by zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ the ranges of wue were 68 4 105 1 78 8 109 5 and 69 8 104 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 5b to maximize the wue the amount of irrigation was 132 mm 124 and 107 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 5c the ngu showed an increasing trend from eastern to western ape and the averaged values were 76 5 91 5 and 109 5 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 5d averaged nue was 364 kg ha 1 kg 1 in the zone ⅱ which was 15 7 and 11 7 higher than that in the zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ fig 5e the amounts of annual n loss ranged from 0 5 to 7 7 kg ha 1 from 0 2 to 2 0 kg ha 1 and from 0 4 to 3 1 kg ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively and the averaged value was highest in the zone ⅰ fig 5f 3 5 combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization that maximized potato nue in the ape ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm coupled with n30 30 kg ha 1 n fertilizer produced the maximum nue across ape fig 6 under the combinations that maximized nue potato yields were 28 7 32 8 and 30 6 t ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 6a change trend of nue in the ape was similar with the potato yield and the nue was highest in the zone ⅱ with the values of 1010 1210 kg ha 1 kg 1 for zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ the ranges were 885 1125 and 910 1160 kg ha 1 kg 1 fig 6b averaged potato wues in the zones ⅰ ⅲ were 63 7 71 3 and 64 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively fig 6c to maximize nue the amounts of irrigation decreased from eastern to western ape and the averaged values were 670 650 and 610 mm in the zones ⅰ ⅲ respectively fig 6d under the combinations that maximized the nue the n loss was relatively low and the amount ranged from 0 1 to 1 7 kg ha 1 in the whole ape fig 6e however contrary to the amounts of irrigation ngu showed an increasing trend from eastern to western ape and the ranges were 165 255 150 315 and 180 345 mm from zones i iii fig 6f 3 6 combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization that maximized potato income in the ape to maximize the income of potato the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilization varied across the ape i e the irrigation levels ranged from ir50 to ir10 and the amounts of n fertilizers ranged from 30 to 120 kg ha 1 in the ape fig 7 s9 under the combinations the income was highest in the zone ⅱ with the values of 20 100 cny ha 1 which was 9 9 and 7 5 higher than the zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ fig 7a to achieve the maximum income the amounts of irrigation showed a decreasing trend from eastern to

under the combinations the ngu was 138 mm in the zone ⅱ 55 and 41 higher than that in the zone ⅰ and ⅲ fig 7d nue generally increased from eastern to western ape and the values were 404 528 and 557 kg ha 1 kg 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 7e the annual n loss was highest in the zone ⅰ with the value of 1 65 kg ha 1 and the values were 0 77 and 1 06 kg ha 1 in the zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 7f 4 discussions 4 1 crop model as an effective tool to optimize agricultural managements field experiment is the most reliable way to optimize agricultural managements to improve wue nue income etc over the local management but it is difficult to apply this approach for all combinations of water and n management across complex soil environment and various climate conditions across different sites however well calibrated model could be an effective tool to optimize agricultural managements to improve yield wue nue income etc over the local managements under various soil and climate conditions keating et al 2003 in this study the apsim potato model was used to recommend the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different potato production goals in the ape the apsim potato model was able to explain 76 94 of variation in observed values including phenology soil water content n uptake by potato mineral n in the 1 m depth and fresh potato yield under different irrigation and n treatments related studies which optimize irrigation and n managements for crop production using crop models including dssat rzwqm and stics models noted that the crop model was an effective tool when the accuracy was more than 70 fang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 coucheney et al 2015 therefore the recommendations by apsim potato model in this study are reliable related studies have used the apsim model to evaluate groundwater changes under different cropping systems and irrigation treatments the results show that by adjusting crop cultivar parameters and soil parameters related to soil evaporation the apsim model could simulate groundwater changes well xiao et al 2017 2020 sun et al 2019 therefore the recommendations by apsim potato model in this study are reliable 4 2 potato production under local farmers managements in the ape in the ape 400 mm of irrigation coupled with 200 kg ha 1 of n are applied by local farmers during potato growing period tang et al 2018a however local farmers believe that the potato yield can be enhanced always with the increasing of irrigation and n fertilizer thus more water and n were used in some regions in the ape qin et al 2013 j z tang et al 2020 in most parts of ape potato is still planted with flood irrigation and the waste of irrigation water and n fertilizer is seriously tang et al 2018a 2019 therefore potato production in this region was not sustainable which supported by some studies qin et al 2013 chen et al 2016 currently the quantitative impacts of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers on potato yield wue and nue were rarely revealed in the study we first evaluated the potato yield income nue decline of gdt and n loss under local production practices using the apsim potato model our results showed that potato yields wue nue and income were all higher in the middle ape than other regions under the combination used by local farmers fig 4 many studies pointed out that both climate and soil conditions have significant impacts on potato production darwish et al 2006 shock et al 2007 woli et al 2016 tang et al 2018b we further analyzed the potato growth conditions in different regions and found that the temperature in the middle ape was more suitable for potato growth than other regions water drainage is also the vital factor that determines the variation of potato production in different regions li et al 2006 arora et al 2013 applying same amount of irrigation under the soil with better water holding capacity would lead to less nitrate leaching poch massegú et al 2014 due to the better soil condition n loss in the middle ape was less than the eastern and western ape with the same amount of n fertilizer therefore the yield could be enhanced more under the middle ape moreover the more suitable temperature and soil conditions could also contribute to the higher wue income and nue in the middle ape compared with the other two regions 4 3 spatial difference of maximized potato yield in the ape potato yield could be enhanced significantly with the increasing inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer within the certain range patel and rajput 2007 camargo et al 2015 x wang et al 2019 lots of studies were conducted to optimize the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer to maximize potato yield yuan et al 2003 lahlou and ledent 2005 zebarth and rosen 2007 ierna and mauromicale 2018 in this study we found that there was an obvious spatial difference of potato yield under different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer in the ape due to higher solar radiation and more suitable temperature conditions in the middle ape during potato growing period the maximum yield in this region was higher than that in the eastern and western ape in all regions interaction effects of irrigation and n fertilizer were existed applying same irrigation amounts tuber yield increased as the fertilizer rate increased with the fertilization levels in this study same results were also obtained by kumar et al 2007 and zhou et al 2018 while the increase of tuber yield with n fertilizer input levels was less under low levels irrigation condition than that under high levels irrigation this is because applying irrigation could promote the n fertilizer use efficiency ju et al 2002 fang et al 2008 similar to yield the wue and nue were both highest in the middle ape to maximize the potato yield the inputs of irrigation were 664 634 and 607 mm in the eastern middle and western ape respectively fig 4 however the combination would lead to serious decline of groundwater water table and the annual decline of gdt were 1 2 1 8 1 1 2 1 and 1 2 2 3 m in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively moreover the n loss was 13 7 10 7 and 8 4 kg ha 1 in the eastern middle and western ape therefore we concluded that maintaining the high inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer to obtain the high potato yield is not sustainable in the ape 4 4 spatial difference of maximized potato wue nue and income in the ape enhancing the wue and nue is the vital way to maintain potato yield reduce production cost and negative environment impacts onder et al 2005 darwish et al 2006 badr et al 2012 previous studies reported that potato wue was higher under deficit irrigation than that under full irrigation fabeiro et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2018 the results in this study showed that applying 36 417 mm irrigation coupled with 90 kg ha 1 n fertilizer maximized the wue in the ape and the irrigation amounts were much less than that required amounts for maximizing potato yield the wue was highest in the middle ape followed by eastern and western ape we further analyzed the proportion of potato transpiration and soil evaporation during potato growing period and found that the potato transpiration was higher in the middle ape due to more suitable temperature condition during potato growing period than that in other regions nue was highest under the combination of ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm coupled with n30 30 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied applying larger amounts of n would result higher n loss and the potato yield would not increase accordingly therefore the nue could not increase more compared with other treatments the irrigation amount and water drainage were almost same with the combination that maximized potato yield while they were much higher than the combinations maximized wue and income for n loss it was much lower than other treatments that maximized yield wue and income actually local famers hope the wue and nue are both high thus we analyzed the response of wue and nue to different managements of water and nitrogen across the ape fig 8 and found that the wue and nue were both high under the combination of ir40 or ir50 coupled with n30 and under such combinations the wue and nue could both reach 85 of the highest values moreover the yield and income could almost reach 80 of the highest values therefore the combination of ir40 or ir50 coupled with n30 could be the optimal combination to maintain the yield wue nue and income in relative high levels in general farmer s income is not only determined by the yield but also affected by the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer woli et al 2016 to maximize the income the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer should be 53 417 mm and 30 120 kg ha 1 in the ape and the maximum net profits of potato ranged from 13 030 to 22 400 cny ha 1 from 15 600 to 23 200 cny ha 1 and from 13 300 to 21 500 cny ha 1 in the eastern middle and western ape and the average value was highest in the middle ape previous field experimental studies indicated that the optimum amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized income of potato were almost 300 mm and 200 kg ha 1 in the ape song et al 2013 chen et al 2019 the recommended amounts were a little higher than our study the reasons would be that the loss of water and n fertilizer in the actual condition was higher than that in the simulation study actually the price of potato was not consistent in different years and the price change would have impacts on income next step the agricultural economic model should be integrated in the study to consider the impacts of price change on income 4 5 comparison of inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer and environmental impacts under different combinations in this study we recommended the optimum combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different production goals of potato in the ape table 4 to maximize yield 235 mm irrigation and 10 kg ha 1 n fertilizer should be additional applied compared with the local inputs under the combination that maximized potato yield the annual decline of gdt was 0 29 m more than the local farmers practice while the n loss could be reduced by 1 5 kg ha 1 due to the different irrigation method however the surplus n fertilizer in the soil would lead the soil hardening to maximize potato wue the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer should be cut down by 280 mm and 105 kg ha 1 compared with local farmers under the combination that maximized potato wue the annual decline of gdt was 0 69 m less than the combination used by local farmers moreover the annual n loss could be reduced by 10 7 kg ha 1 under the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized potato nue the inputs n fertilizer should be reduced by 170 kg ha 1 and this is because the humic n fertilizer in the soil could be used while the irrigation amount should be increased by 235 mm compared with the combination used by local farmers under our recommended combination the nue could be enhanced by 584 and the annual n loss could be reduced by 97 6 while the yield only decreased by 4 1 under the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized the potato income the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer were 220 mm and 111 kg ha 1 less than the amounts of used by local farmers while the income was 9 6 higher than that of the local irrigation and n fertilizer managements there were some reasons for our recommends with different production goals first the farmers may engage in other jobs and do not have much energy to devote to maximize potato yield or income second the protection of the ecological environment should be considered in the ape and the flood irrigation and excessive n should be forbidden therefore our study recommended the different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer to achieve different production goals based on the local conditions in different parts of ape generally weather conditions have significant impacts on optimum water and n management we analyzed the optimal combinations of irrigation and n management under different precipitation year types results showed that the irrigation amounts could be reduced by 6 1 20 9 and 10 5 68 8 under normal years and wet years compared with dry years for different production goals while the optimal amounts of n fertilizer was same in different year type this is because the total water received by potato was almost same in different year types and the amount of n fertilizer could not be reduced our results could provide some theoretical basis for achieving sustainable development for agriculture in the region however there are some limitations in our study first the effects of irrigation methods sprinkler furrow and drip irrigations on irrigation efficiency potato yield and wue were not considered actually the optimal amount of irrigation is likely to be different as farmers adopt different irrigation practices onder et al 2005 ierna and mauromicale 2018 second the optimal amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer would change with the change of cropping system agricultural managements such as ridge furrow with film or straw mulching zhao et al 2014 tang et al 2019 next step the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for potato under different agricultural systems should be explored third the improvement in yield wue nue etc over the local management simulated by the model should be further verified by field experiment in addition there are some uncertainties existed in crop model simulation for example currently widely used crop models including the apsim potato model used in this study do not fully consider the impacts of extreme climates such as high temperature drought etc pests and diseases on crop production so that the simulation results tend to overestimate crop yields moreover the uncertainty for the response of crop to various climate and soil condition may also result from different model structures and parameters values these impact uncertainties can be better quantified through use of multi crop model ensembles xiao et al 2020 5 conclusions crop model is a convenient and effective tool to evaluate and optimize agricultural managements for different crop production goals apsim potato model performed well in simulating potato phenology soil water content potato n uptake mineral n in the soil and potato fresh yield well under different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer in the ape the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different production goals were different the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer were higher for maximizing potato yield compared with the inputs by local farmers and the maximum potato yield was highest in the middle ape followed by eastern and western ape the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized wue were lower than the local practices and the spatial variation of wue in the ape was familiar with the yield reducing the input of n fertilizer and increasing the amount of irrigation compared with local inputs could maximize the nue of potato and the nue was highest in the middle ape followed by zone ⅲ and zone ⅰ the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer should be reduced by 220 mm and 111 kg ha 1 to maximize income and the income was 9 6 higher than the local managements our study could fill the knowledge gap in understanding the optimal agricultural options including irrigation and n application for different potato production goals

10059,potato is a staple food crop in the agro pastoral ecotone ape of north china however the potato yield is low and highly variable due to limited water and nutrient availabilities in the region irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization have been used widely to enhance potato yield but result in negative environmental impacts in the ape this study aims to explore the optimum combinations of irrigation and n fertilization for different potato production goals by using apsim potato model calibrated well by field experiments with different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer conducted at the typical site in the ape long term 1981 2010 simulation for potato yield water use efficiency wue nitrogen use efficiency nue economic profits and environmental impacts were analyzed under different combinations of irrigation ir based on the soil water deficit ranged from 10 ir10 to 100 mm ir100 with the interval of 10 mm and n fertilization ranged from 0 n0 to 210 n210 kg ha 1 with the interval of 30 kg ha 1 combination of ir10 and n210 maximized potato yields in the whole ape and the yield was highest in the middle ape with the value of 35 2 t ha 1 which was 6 7 and 2 1 higher than that in the eastern and western ape however such water and nitrogen managements would cause annual decline of groundwater table by 1 6 m and n loss by 10 9 kg ha 1 in order to achieve the highest wue the irrigation amounts should be 124 107 and 132 mm in the eastern middle and western ape respectively coupled with 90 kg ha 1 n fertilizer and the highest wues were 89 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 93 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 84 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the eastern middle and western ape for highest fnue the combination should be ir10 and n30 across ape and the highest values were 959 kg ha 1 kg 1 1092 kg ha 1 kg 1 and 1022 kg ha 1 kg 1 in the eastern middle and western ape moreover to get the highest income the irrigation ranged from ir50 to ir10 and the amounts of n fertilizers ranged from 30 kg ha 1 to 120 kg ha 1 and the maximum incomes were 18 250 cny ha 1 20 060 cny ha 1 and 19 660 cny ha 1 in the eastern middle and western ape in all the combination that maximized the income could contain the relative higher yield wue nue and lower environmental sequence our study would be helpful in determining the optimal amounts of irrigation and n fertilization for different goals of potato production in the ape keywords yield water use efficiency nitrogen use efficiency nitrogen loss income apsim 1 introduction water is a key factor for crop growth and yield formation xu et al 2020 in china the consumption of agricultural water accounts for 63 2 of the total water consumption and most is used to irrigation wang et al 2010 with the increasing of irrigation areas and crops water shortage becomes one of the main limiting factors for agricultural production and threatens the agriculture sustainability in china especially in north china kang et al 2017 wu et al 2007 optimizing agricultural irrigation to improve the crop water use efficiency wue has significance for agricultural sustainable development a large numbers of studies have been conducted to optimize irrigation practices to improve crop yield wue and keep the sustainable development of agriculture farré and faci 2009 shi et al 2020 overall optimizing irrigation treatments is a critical measure to deal with the shortage of agricultural water resources potato is sensitive to the variations of water h wang et al 2019 several studies pointed out that the potato yield increased with increasing amount of irrigation yuan et al 2003 however potato yield will not increase always with increasing irrigation due to the high n leaching under high irrigation woli et al 2016 in addition the time and frequency of irrigation also had significant impacts on potato yield and wue kassem 2008 increasing the irrigation frequencies and decreasing the irrigation amount could significantly improve potato yield and wue kang et al 2004 some studies revealed that irrigated during the periods of tuberization and tuber bulking could significantly enhance potato yield qin et al 2013 tang et al 2018a 2019 however few concentrated on potato in the agro pastoral ecotone in north china where potato is usually limited by water stress tang et al 2018a therefore optimizing irrigation schedule for potato in the region is needed except for water nitrogen n fertilizer is another vital factor that influences crop production x zhang et al 2015 h wang et al 2015 total consumption of n fertilizer increased by 158 during last three decades in china while the total crop yield increased by about 70 revealing the unbalance between supply of n and the crop demand for n cui et al 2013 k yang et al 2017 excess fertilization has led low nitrogen use efficiency nue and a series of environmental issues such as n2o emissions soil degradation and groundwater contamination fang et al 2006 cui et al 2013 gu et al 2013 actually over fertilization especially n is a series problem in agricultural production in china in some regions the n application rates has reached 500 kg ha 1 liang et al 2016 shi et al 2020 therefore lots of studies were conducted to optimize the n fertilizer application schedule which was mostly concentrated on the amount and stage under different water conditions huang et al 2018 x wang et al 2019 xu et al 2020 for example optimum application of time and amount of n could also enhance potato yield marketable tuber rate and quality rosem et al 2009 neshev and manolov 2015 however few studies were concentrated on potato production in the agro pastoral ecotone in north china lots of studies revealed that there is a significant interaction between irrigation and n managements the optimal irrigation could increase nue reduce n loss and enhance crop yields and the optimal n application rate varied with the different irrigation levels mahajan et al 2012 khan et al 2017 chen et al 2019 therefore optimizing the combination of water and n managements was more necessary than only considering the single measure generally the optimal water and n management can be identified by field experiments yang and su 2009 suggested that reducing the amount of irrigation by 10 25 coupled with 225 kg ha 1 n could reduce the groundwater pollution significantly in heihe oasis h wang et al 2019 pointed out that applying full irrigation every 8 days coupled with 200 kg ha 1 of n was the optimum scheduling for potato production in yulin site of northern china moreover potato yield wue and nue could be enhanced significantly under the optimum combination of irrigation and n fertilization he et al 1999 badr et al 2012 x yang et al 2017 the negative environmental impacts could be reduced under the optimum combinations of irrigation and n fertilization fontes et al 2010 karam et al 2014 x wang et al 2019 however field experiments need lots of funds and long time inputs of labor tang et al 2019 agricultural system models could analyze the response of crop growth to various couplings of water and n treatments under different agricultural practices soil types and climate conditions and the cost was much lower than the field experiment keating et al 2003 therefore many studies were conducted based on the model to simulate crop growth water and nitrogen use li et al 2015 y zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 as a typical crop model apsim potato model has been tested and applied in different regions under variable climate conditions brown et al 2011 tang et al 2018 2019 the model could reproduce the phenology yield water and n balance and it has been used in australia and new zealand to optimize irrigation and n managements brown et al 2011 lissson and cotching 2011 however it was rarely evaluated in china agro pastoral ecotone ape in china is one of the staple potato production regions due to suitable climate and soil conditions tang et al 2016 in the ape the planting area of potato has increased sharply during past several decades and its yield accounts for 46 8 of the total agricultural products tang et al 2018a 2018b generally water shortage is the main limiting factor for potato production in the ape due to annual and growing season precipitation often does not meet the water requirements for potato growth tang et al 2019 in our previous studies we have optimized the planting dates across ape and the optimal planting dates were may 10 may 20 and may 30 in the eastern middle and western ape for rainfed potato tang et al 2018a application of irrigation and nitrogen is an important measure to increase potato yield however a serious problem is that excessive irrigation about 400 mm and n around 200 kg ha 1 fertilization was applied in the region qin et al 2013 which often result in relatively low wue nue and income while also wasting valuable water resources and causing damage to the soil structure k yang et al 2017 x yang et al 2017 previous studies showed that the groundwater table in the ape decreased sharply by 0 5 1 0 m yr 1 due to continuous irrigation chen et al 2016 groundwater pollution is another severe environment problem due to the excess application of n fertilizer in the ape zhu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 optimizing irrigation and n schedules is an effective way to balance yield cost and environmental impacts badr et al 2012 however the studies of the optimizing of irrigation and n fertilizer conducted in the ape mainly concentrated on maximizing yield or wue qin et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 actually optimization of irrigation and n fertilizer should be based on the local condition including not only the climate and soil conditions but also the management habits and inputs of local farmers in addition based on different production goals including the pursuit of maximum yield benefit or the pursuit of sustainable agro ecological development there are certain differences in water and nitrogen management therefore the environment impact and development of intelligent agricultural should be considered in the optimizing of irrigation and n fertilizer based on the multiple goals therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the response of potato yield water use and n use to different combination of irrigation and n fertilizer levels and 2 recommend the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilization for different production goals including the maximizing yield wue nue and income of potato in the ape 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region climate and soil data the agro pastoral ecotone ape is a transitional zone between arid and semi arid pastoral grasslands to intensive cropland in north china shi et al 2018 the zone covers areas of eight provinces heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi shannxi ningxia and gansu and one autonomous region inner mongolia in this study considering integrity and effectiveness of the climate data twenty seven sites were selected and the sites were roughly and uniformly distributed in the ape fig 1 based on the potato planting dates determined by the onset of rainy season which was defined as the first wet day of 5 day spell receiving at least 20 mm without any 10 day dry spell in the following day tang et al 2018a the ape was divided into three regions i e zone ⅰ eastern ape zone ⅱ middle ape and zone ⅲ western ape this is because planting date has significance impacts on potato growth in the ape and the optimal planting date in different sub regions of ape was different tang et al 2018a the sunshine hours sh h growing season average temperature t total precipitation p mm onset of rainy season ors planting date pd harvesting date hd nitrogen fertilizer inputs n kg ha 1 and irrigation inputs ir mm during potato growing season in three zones were shown in table 1 climate data including daily maximum and minimum temperature precipitation mm and sunshine hours h during 1981 2010 in the study sites and 2015 2016 at the experimental site were available from china meteorological administration cma daily solar radiation was calculated based on daily sunshine hours using the ångström equation black et al 1954 j wang et al 2015 the observed soil parameters were input parameters to drive apsim potato model the physical and chemical properties of soil at each site were obtained from the china soil scientific database http www soil csdb cn the physical and chemical properties of the soil are recorded in the depth more than 1 m in the database and considering the potato root depth we used the soil parameters within the 1 m depth the detailed hydraulic characteristics of the soil at each site were shown in table s1 2 2 coupling water and n experiments field experiments with different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization were conducted at a typical site wuchuan in the ape in 2015 and 2016 the soil parameters were shown in the table s1 four irrigation levels 0 90 180 and 360 mm coupled with four n levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 were set in this experiment with three replications of each treatment the irrigation method was drip irrigation and the drip irrigation belt was laid between the two rows of potato before drip irrigation n fertilizer was spread evenly in the furrow between the two rows and then the drip irrigation was applied the interactions of different levels of irrigation and n fertilization were named as w i n j i and j ranged from 0 to 4 with the interval of 1 potato was planted in 7 5 4 m plots and the cultivar kexin1 was used in all treatments the tuber was elliptical the block was large and tidy and the depth of the bud was medium the cultivar was resistant to the y and leaf rolling viruses drought tolerant and resistant to bunchy top disease more resistant to pest and late blight planting date used the local normal planting date of may 5 which is the optimal date for local region the planting density was 46 500 plants per ha base fertilizer was applied at planting with 120 kg ha 1 of ammonium diammonium phosphate the content of p2o5 was 46 and 90 kg ha 1 of potassium chloride the content of k2o was 60 the key phenological stages including planting emergence tuberization tuber bulking and maturity were recorded leaf area index lai and biomass of each plant part root tuber stem and leaf were measured every 15 days after emergence using 3 plant samples per plot the leaf area was measured using the portable area meter model li 3000 c soil water content was taken every 15 days to the depth 1 m at every 10 cm using the oven drying method the fresh tuber yield with moisture content of 80 was measured after harvest from the four 7 5 m rows in the center of the block giving a harvest area of 15 m2 the potato n uptake was calculated based on measurement of the n content in different organs kjeldahl method was used to measure the n content in the different organs and mineral n content in the soil the results of the field experiments have been shown in the supplemental materials 2 3 apsim potato model calibration and validation apsim potato model is a process based crop model the key modules used in the apsim potato are potato soilwat soiln surfaceom and a management module apsim simulated potato development biomass growth and tuber yield in response to temperature photoperiod solar radiation soil water and nitrogen at a daily time step the more detailed description about the basic parameters and simulation process of the apsim potato could be referred to tang et al 2018a in this study we evaluated the performance of apsim potato model in simulating the response of potato growth to different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization based on two years field experiments at wuchuan fig 1 observed data in 2015 and 2016 with different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization was used to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model respectively the calibrating and validating including the comparisons of observed and simulated phenology soil water content in 1 m depth n uptake by potato the content of mineral n in the 1 m depth and potato fresh yield the trail and error method was used to derive the genetic parameters of potato and parameters related to n process the detailed parameters were shown in table 2 2 4 modeling impacts of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on potato yield water use nitrogen use and groundwater in the apsim potato model different combinations of irrigation and n fertilization were set for the long term simulation in 1981 2010 under the optimal planting dates based on our previous study tang et al 2018a in three regions of ape first we simulated potato growth under the combination of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers i e the amounts of 400 mm and 200 kg ha 1 of irrigation and n fertilizer were applied the application of irrigation and n fertilization was 100 mm and 50 kg ha 1 at emergence 150 mm and 75 kg ha 1 at tuberization and tuber bulking qin et al 2013 then the simulation scenarios were set to optimize the combination of irrigation and n fertilization to achieve different production goals considering the fine control of irrigation and n fertilizer using the precision instruments as a trend in the future the settings of irrigation and n fertilizer management in the simulation were different from the current field practices which decided by farmer s experience referred to previous studies the irrigation was applied based on the soil water deficit and these advanced irrigation methods used in the model is an extension from field experimental results as demonstrated by previous studies keating et al 2003 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit the difference between filed capacity moisture and current soil water content at root depth beyond a certain value and the values were set from 10 to 100 mm with an interval of 10 mm generally the rooting depth of potatoes is in the range of 40 80 cm stalham and allen 2004 wang et al 2006 and there were evidences that potato could extend their rooting depth down to 1 m stone 1982 iwama 2008 therefore the scheduling irrigation was set based on the water deficits of 1 m depth the 10 irrigation deficit levels of 100 90 10 mm were represented as ir100 ir90 and ir10 under each irrigation scenario the amounts of n were set at an interval of 30 kg ha 1 from 0 n0 to 210 n210 kg ha 1 in total 8 n treatments were set totally there were 71 280 simulation scenarios in the study due to the optimal planting dates and soil properties are different in the different sub regions of ape thus we optimized the water and n management practices in different sub regions based on local climate environment and soil condition in this study the irrigation water was all from the pumping groundwater due to the lacking of surface water in the ape zhu et al 2014 applying irrigation from the pumping groundwater would result in depletion of groundwater based on related studies the depth of groundwater table in the ape is relatively shallow about 1 2 4 m in the rainy season and the irrigation water moving down the 1 m depth will directly impact on groundwater level fan et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 zhai et al 2021 in the simulation the loss of irrigation water in different irrigation scheduling was not considered i e the irrigation efficiency was assumed to 1 in all simulation scenarios net groundwater use nug mm due to its extraction for irrigation can be calculated as 1 nug gui rdp where gui is the amount of groundwater used for irrigation mm rdp is the recharge by deep drainage mm water use efficiency wue kg ha 1 mm 1 and fertilizer n use efficiency fnue kg ha 1 kg 1 of potato were calculated as follows 2 wue y et where y was the total fresh yield kg ha 1 et was evapotranspiration mm which was the sum of soil evaporation es mm and crop transpiration ep simulated by apsim potato 3 fnue y tn where y was the total fresh yield tn was the amount of n applied specially applied irrigation and n would induce the loss of n which includes the n leaching by the irrigation and denitrification by denitrifying bacteria in this study the n loss was the sum of n leaching and denitrification simulated by apsim potato model this is because the n fertilizer was applied in the 5 cm depth in the model and the ammonia volatilization could be ignored ju et al 2002 and we only considered the n leaching and denitrification 2 5 the economic analysis of potato production under different combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization net income ni that the farmers can achieve under different combinations was estimated as 4 ni yield p inputs where yield was the potato fresh yield p is the price of the fresh tuber 0 8 cny kg 1 in the local market yield p represent the gross income of local farmers total cost of cultivation including the cost of seeding irrigation fertilization use of fungicides and pesticide tillage planting and harvesting and labor was estimated based on the local market price labor cost using for agronomic management during potato growing season was estimated about 500 cny ha 1 the detailed costs of field inputs were showed in table 3 2 6 statistical analysis the performance of apsim potato model in simulating the phenology soil water content and yield of potato was evaluated based on the regression lines of the coefficient of determination r 2 index of agreement d root mean square error rmse and relative rmse rrmse determined by observed and simulated

simulation variables of 27 selected sites to the whole ape by using the inverse distance weighted method idw 3 results 3 1 the performance of apsim potato model apsim potato is a process based crop model and it has been applied in different regions with various climate and soil conditions in our previous studies apsim potato version 7 7 had been validated based on serial planting experimental data tang et al 2018a the results showed that the model performed well in simulating phenology with rmse less than 4 days soil water content at 1 m depth with rrmse less than 9 and yields with rrmse less than 8 moreover the model had been validated based on experimental data with irrigation treatments in the same site tang et al 2019 j tang et al 2020 the results showed the model could also perform well in simulating soil water content at 1 m depth with rrmse less than 15 4 growing period evapotranspiration with rrmse less than 10 6 and yield with rrmse less than 17 4 in this study results showed that apsim potato model performed well in simulating the potato phenology and the rmse between observed and simulated phenology was 2 4 days fig 2a using the calibrated crop parameters of kexin1 table 2 the model could simulate soil water content swc well and the rrmse between observed values and simulated values was 14 1 fig 2b the performance for simulating swc in different soil depth was shown in fig s1 simulated n uptake by potato closely followed by the observations fig 2c and the model was able to explain 77 of variation in observed n uptake by potato under different irrigation and n treatments simulations of mineral n content in the soil had good agreement with the measurements fig 2d and the model was able to explain 89 of the variation in mineral n content in the soil under different couplings of irrigation and n applications the performance for simulating cmn in different soil depth was shown in fig s1 good agreement between observed and simulated potato yield was obtained with the rrmse of 14 0 fig 2e 3 2 potato yield income wue decline of groundwater table nue and n loss across the ape under local farmers practices simulated potato fresh yields under combination of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers ranged from 25 7 to 35 0 t ha 1 from 28 7 to 37 4 t ha 1 and from 27 5 to 34 9 t ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively in 1981 2010 and the yield was highest in the zone ⅱ followed by zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ fig 3a wues were 75 7 87 2 66 2 95 3 and 75 3 96 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively with the maximum wue in the zone ⅱ fig 3b averaged nues in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ were 159 3 164 5 and 156 7 kg ha 1 kg 1 respectively fig 3c change trend of income in the ape was similar with the yield and the income was highest in the zone ⅱ with the value of 18 100 cny ha 1 and the values were 17 200 and 16 800 cny ha 1 in the zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 3d the annual ngu showed an increasing trend from eastern ape to western ape in 1981 2010 due to the water drainage difference in different regions and the values were 157 5 226 5 169 5 229 5 and 139 5 232 2 mm in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 3e annual n loss ranged from 2 2 to 33 7 kg ha 1 from 2 0 to 30 9 kg ha 1 and from 1 8 to 24 8 kg ha 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ with the highest value in the zone ⅰ following by zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 3f 3 3 combination of irrigation and nitrogen for maximizing potato yield in the ape combination of ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm and n210 210 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied maximized potato fresh yields in all regions of ape during 1981 2010 fig 4 potato fresh yields were highest in the zone ⅱ with the range of 31 7 38 6 t ha 1 followed by zone ⅲ and zone ⅰ with the yields of 29 2 37 2 and 29 8 37 7 t ha 1 fig 4a under the combination the irrigation amounts showed a decreasing trend from east to

kg ha 1 mm 1 in the three parts of ape with the highest wue in the zone ⅱ fig 4c averaged potato nue was 158 9 kg ha 1 kg 1 in the zone ⅰ which was 5 5 and 3 3 lower than the zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ fig 4d

potato wue in the ape combinations of irrigation and n fertilization that maximized the wue were different in different parts of ape fig 5 s6 under the combinations for maximizing wue potato yields ranged from 24 3 to 37 4 t ha 1 from 25 1 to 36 3 t ha 1 and from 21 6 to 35 6 t ha 1 in zone i ii and iii respectively fig 5a the difference among the combinations were mainly concentrated on the irrigation amount i e the irrigation levels ranged from ir60 to ir30 while the amounts of n fertilization amount were 90 kg ha 1 in most sites of ape fig 5b potato wue was highest in the zone ⅱ followed by zone ⅰ and zone ⅲ the ranges of wue were 68 4 105 1 78 8 109 5 and 69 8 104 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively fig 5b to maximize the wue the amount of irrigation

of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization that maximized potato nue in the ape ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm coupled with n30 30 kg ha 1 n fertilizer produced the

averaged potato wues in the zones ⅰ ⅲ were 63 7 71 3 and 64 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively fig 6c to maximize nue the amounts of irrigation decreased from eastern to western ape and the averaged values were 670 650 and 610 mm in the zones ⅰ ⅲ respectively fig 6d under the combinations that maximized the nue the n loss was relatively low and the amount ranged from 0 1 to 1 7 kg ha 1 in the whole ape fig 6e however contrary to the amounts of irrigation ngu showed an increasing trend from eastern to western ape and the ranges were 165 255 150 315 and 180 345 mm from zones i iii fig 6f 3 6 combinations of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization that maximized potato income in the ape to maximize the income of potato the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilization varied across

discussions 4 1 crop model as an effective tool to optimize agricultural managements field experiment is the most reliable way to optimize agricultural managements to improve wue nue income etc over the local management but it is difficult to apply this approach for all combinations of water and n management across complex soil environment and various climate conditions across different sites however well calibrated model could be an effective tool to optimize agricultural managements to improve yield wue nue income etc over the local managements under various soil and climate conditions keating et al 2003 in this study the apsim potato model was used to recommend the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different potato production goals in the ape the apsim potato model was able to explain 76 94 of variation in observed values including phenology soil water content n uptake by potato mineral n in the 1 m depth and fresh potato yield under different irrigation and n treatments related studies which optimize irrigation and n managements for crop production using crop models including dssat rzwqm and stics models noted that the crop model was an effective tool when the accuracy was more than 70 fang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 coucheney et al 2015 therefore the recommendations by apsim potato model in this study are reliable related studies have used the apsim model to evaluate groundwater changes under different cropping systems and irrigation treatments the results show that by adjusting crop cultivar parameters and soil parameters related to soil evaporation the apsim model could simulate groundwater changes well xiao et al 2017 2020 sun et al 2019 therefore the recommendations by apsim potato model in this study are reliable 4 2 potato production under local farmers managements in the ape in the ape 400 mm of irrigation coupled with 200 kg ha 1 of n are applied by local farmers during potato growing period tang et al 2018a however local farmers believe that the potato yield can be enhanced always with the increasing of irrigation and n fertilizer thus more water and n were used in some regions in the ape qin et al 2013 j z tang et al 2020 in most parts of ape potato is still planted with flood irrigation and the waste of irrigation water and n fertilizer is seriously tang et al 2018a 2019 therefore potato production in this region was not sustainable which supported by some studies qin et al 2013 chen et al 2016 currently the quantitative impacts of irrigation and n fertilization used by local farmers on potato yield wue and nue were rarely revealed in the study we first evaluated the potato yield income nue decline of gdt and n loss under local production practices using the apsim potato model our results showed that potato yields wue nue and income were all higher in the middle ape than other regions under the combination used by local farmers fig 4 many studies pointed out that both climate and soil conditions have significant impacts on potato production darwish et al 2006 shock et al 2007 woli et al 2016 tang et al 2018b we further analyzed the potato growth conditions in different regions and found that the temperature in the middle ape was more suitable for potato growth than other regions water drainage is also the vital factor that determines the variation of potato production in different regions li et al 2006 arora et al 2013 applying same amount of irrigation under the soil with better water holding capacity would lead to less nitrate leaching poch massegú et al 2014 due to the better soil condition n loss in the middle ape was less than the eastern and western ape with the same amount of n fertilizer therefore the yield could be enhanced more under the middle ape moreover the more suitable temperature and soil conditions could also contribute to the higher wue income and nue in the middle ape compared with the other two regions 4 3 spatial difference of maximized potato yield in the ape potato yield could be enhanced significantly with the increasing inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer within the certain range patel and rajput 2007 camargo et al 2015 x wang et al 2019 lots of studies were conducted to optimize the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer to maximize potato yield yuan et al 2003 lahlou and ledent 2005 zebarth and rosen 2007 ierna and mauromicale 2018 in this study we found that there was an obvious spatial difference of potato yield under different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer in the ape due to higher solar radiation and more suitable temperature conditions in the middle ape during potato growing period the maximum yield in this region was higher than that in the eastern and western ape in all regions interaction effects of irrigation and n fertilizer were existed applying same irrigation amounts tuber yield increased as the fertilizer rate increased with the fertilization levels in this study same results were also obtained by kumar et al 2007 and zhou et al 2018 while the increase of tuber yield with n fertilizer input levels was less under low levels irrigation condition than that under high levels irrigation this is because applying irrigation could promote the n fertilizer use efficiency ju et al 2002 fang et al 2008 similar to yield the wue and nue were both highest in the middle ape to maximize the potato yield the inputs of irrigation were 664 634 and 607 mm in the eastern middle and western ape respectively fig 4 however the combination would lead to serious decline of groundwater water table and the annual decline of gdt were 1 2 1 8 1 1 2 1 and 1 2 2 3 m in the zone ⅰ zone ⅱ and zone ⅲ respectively moreover the n loss was 13 7 10 7 and 8 4 kg ha 1 in the eastern middle and western ape therefore we concluded that maintaining the high inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer to obtain the high potato yield is not sustainable in the ape 4 4 spatial difference of maximized potato wue nue and income in the ape enhancing the wue and nue is the vital way to maintain potato yield reduce production cost and negative environment impacts onder et al 2005 darwish et al 2006 badr et al 2012 previous studies reported that potato wue was higher under deficit irrigation than that under full irrigation fabeiro et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2018 the results in this study showed that applying 36 417 mm irrigation coupled with 90 kg ha 1 n fertilizer maximized the wue in the ape and the irrigation amounts were much less than that required amounts for maximizing potato yield the wue was highest in the middle ape followed by eastern and western ape we further analyzed the proportion of potato transpiration and soil evaporation during potato growing period and found that the potato transpiration was higher in the middle ape due to more suitable temperature condition during potato growing period than that in other regions nue was highest under the combination of ir10 irrigation was applied if the soil water deficit beyond 10 mm coupled with n30 30 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was applied applying larger amounts of n would result higher n loss and the potato yield would not increase accordingly therefore the nue could not increase more compared with other treatments the irrigation amount and water drainage were almost same with the combination that maximized potato yield while they were much higher than the combinations maximized wue and income for n loss it was much lower than other treatments that maximized yield wue and income actually local famers hope the wue and nue are both high thus we analyzed the response of wue and nue to different managements of water and nitrogen across the ape fig 8 and found that the wue and nue were both high under the combination of ir40 or ir50 coupled with n30 and under such combinations the wue and nue could both reach 85 of the highest values moreover the yield and income could almost reach 80 of the highest values therefore the combination of ir40 or ir50 coupled with n30 could be the optimal combination to maintain the yield wue nue and income in relative high levels in general farmer s income is not only determined by the yield but also affected by the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer woli et al 2016 to maximize the income the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer should be 53 417 mm and 30 120 kg ha 1 in the ape and the maximum net profits of potato ranged from 13 030 to 22 400 cny ha 1 from 15 600 to 23 200 cny ha 1 and from 13 300 to 21 500 cny ha 1 in the eastern middle and western ape and the average value was highest in the middle ape previous field experimental studies indicated that the optimum amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized income of potato were almost 300 mm and 200 kg ha 1 in the ape song et al 2013 chen et al 2019 the recommended amounts were a little higher than our study the reasons would be that the loss of water and n fertilizer in the actual condition was higher than that in the simulation study actually the price of potato was not consistent in different years and the price change would have impacts on income next step the agricultural economic model should be integrated in the study to consider the impacts of price change on income 4 5 comparison of inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer and environmental impacts under different combinations in this study we recommended the optimum combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different production goals of potato in the ape table 4 to maximize yield 235 mm irrigation and 10 kg ha 1 n fertilizer should be additional applied compared with the local inputs under the combination that maximized potato yield the annual decline of gdt was 0 29 m more than the local farmers practice while the n loss could be reduced by 1 5 kg ha 1 due to the different irrigation method however the surplus n fertilizer in the soil would lead the soil hardening to maximize potato wue the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer should be cut down by 280 mm and 105 kg ha 1 compared with local farmers under the combination that maximized potato wue the annual decline of gdt was 0 69 m less than the combination used by local farmers moreover the annual n loss could be reduced by 10 7 kg ha 1 under the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized potato nue the inputs n fertilizer should be reduced by 170 kg ha 1 and this is because the humic n fertilizer in the soil could be used while the irrigation amount should be increased by 235 mm compared with the combination used by local farmers under our recommended combination the nue could be enhanced by 584 and the annual n loss could be reduced by 97 6 while the yield only decreased by 4 1 under the combination of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized the potato income the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer were 220 mm and 111 kg ha 1 less than the amounts of used by local farmers while the income was 9 6 higher than that of the local irrigation and n fertilizer managements there were some reasons for our recommends with different production goals first the farmers may engage in other jobs and do not have much energy to devote to maximize potato yield or income second the protection of the ecological environment should be considered in the ape and the flood irrigation and excessive n should be forbidden therefore our study recommended the different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer to achieve different production goals based on the local conditions in different parts of ape generally weather conditions have significant impacts on optimum water and n management we analyzed the optimal combinations of irrigation and n management under different precipitation year types results showed that the irrigation amounts could be reduced by 6 1 20 9 and 10 5 68 8 under normal years and wet years compared with dry years for different production goals while the optimal amounts of n fertilizer was same in different year type this is because the total water received by potato was almost same in different year types and the amount of n fertilizer could not be reduced our results could provide some theoretical basis for achieving sustainable development for agriculture in the region however there are some limitations in our study first the effects of irrigation methods sprinkler furrow and drip irrigations on irrigation efficiency potato yield and wue were not considered actually the optimal amount of irrigation is likely to be different as farmers adopt different irrigation practices onder et al 2005 ierna and mauromicale 2018 second the optimal amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer would change with the change of cropping system agricultural managements such as ridge furrow with film or straw mulching zhao et al 2014 tang et al 2019 next step the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for potato under different agricultural systems should be explored third the improvement in yield wue nue etc over the local management simulated by the model should be further verified by field experiment in addition there are some uncertainties existed in crop model simulation for example currently widely used crop models including the apsim potato model used in this study do not fully consider the impacts of extreme climates such as high temperature drought etc pests and diseases on crop production so that the simulation results tend to overestimate crop yields moreover the uncertainty for the response of crop to various climate and soil condition may also result from different model structures and parameters values these impact uncertainties can be better quantified through use of multi crop model ensembles xiao et al 2020 5 conclusions crop model is a convenient and effective tool to evaluate and optimize agricultural managements for different crop production goals apsim potato model performed well in simulating potato phenology soil water content potato n uptake mineral n in the soil and potato fresh yield well under different combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer in the ape the optimal combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer for different production goals were different the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer were higher for maximizing potato yield compared with the inputs by local farmers and the maximum potato yield was highest in the middle ape followed by eastern and western ape the amounts of irrigation and n fertilizer that maximized wue were lower than the local practices and the spatial variation of wue in the ape was familiar with the yield reducing the input of n fertilizer and increasing the amount of irrigation compared with local inputs could maximize the nue of potato and the nue was highest in the middle ape followed by zone ⅲ and zone ⅰ the inputs of irrigation and n fertilizer should be reduced by 220 mm and 111 kg ha 1 to maximize income and the income was 9 6 higher than the local managements our study could fill the knowledge gap in understanding the optimal agricultural options including irrigation and n application for different potato production goals
