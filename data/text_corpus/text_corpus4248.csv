21240,water entry impacts are quite common for seagoing ships however the understanding of the characteristics of slamming loads has normally relied on vertical water entry experiments this paper proposes an experimental study to isolate the impact characteristics of water entry of a 3d bow flare model with various pitch angles a series of drop tests were carried out with the pitch angle adjusted by an angle device the falling kinemics and slamming loads were measured by arranging relevant sensors experimental repeatability was verified by analyzing the repeatable tests that indicated good stability the completed datasets including displacements velocities accelerations and impact forces were provided for all tests to improve the further development of 3d impact theory oscillations of measured data were analyzed via a combination of fft analysis and free surface characteristics finally the influences of pitch angles on impact pressure are discussed by comparing the slamming pressures at various water entry cases our findings show that the pitch angle greatly increases the slamming pressure in the flare region these findings provide insights into 3d water entry with various pitch angles which will be helpful for the structural design of ships keywords water entry bow flare model drop tests slamming loads pitch angles 1 introduction the impacts of fluid and structures causing huge slamming loads are quite common for high speed ships the statistical results of daidola and mishkevich 1995 show that the probability of structural damage due to slamming was as high as 15 even though the slamming load was not serious frequent impact could cause fatigue damage to structures ship slamming has strong nonlinearity the pressure characteristics are related to many factors such as water entry velocity geometry structural elasticity wave form air layer and fluid compressibility early studies focused on understanding the impact physics plenty of vertical drop tests related to 2d simplified shapes including wedges wu et al 2004 yettou et al 2006 tveitnes et al 2008 panciroli et al 2012 tenzer et al 2015 and ship like sections zhao et al 1996 brizzolara et al 2008 xie et al 2020a have been carried out these experiments greatly improved the understanding of impact characteristics and provided reliable datasets to verify numerical methods such as the boundary element method zhao and faltinsen 1993 sun 2007 the modified logvinovich model korobkin 2004 qin et al 2011 and the self similarity solution dobrovol skaya dobrovol skaya 1969 water entries with oblique postures or horizontal velocities are also common in water entry during torpedo and landing of a seaplane therefore some oblique drop experiments were undertaken judge et al 2004 carried out a series of experiments for oblique water entry of wedges a limit case of flow separation was realized with increasing horizontal velocity barjasteh et al 2016 provided an experimental reference on the water entry of wedges with inclined angles various parameters including the initial deadrise angle inclination angle and impact velocity were discussed the results indicated that the inclination angle could dramatically affect impact pressure russo et al 2018b elucidated the impact dynamics of a wedge and the associated flow physics using particle image velocimetry piv technology the role of heel angle and impact velocity on pile up evolution hydrodynamic loading and energy imparted to the fluid flow were systematically analyzed some other known experimental works on oblique water entry limited to 2d sections can be found in garabedian 1953 gu et al 2014 wang and guedes soares wang and guedessoares 2014 and wang and guedes soares wang and guedessoares 2016 these experimental studies have clarified the oblique impact characteristics to further understand the physics of oblique water entry the water entry impact has obvious three dimensional effects the studies mentioned above are necessary first steps before studying more complicated 3d shapes de backer et al de backer et al 2009 carried out a drop test of cones at different deadrise angles the results were compared with a three dimensional asymptotic theory for axisymmetric rigid bodies the asymptotic theory was found to be quite conservative since the measured peak pressure levels appear to be approximately 50 75 of the theoretical levels complicated flows including flow separation and air cavities are the main reasons for the differences between experiments and theory many experiments have observed these complicated flows for example wei and shi 2012 carried out experiments on oblique water entry for an inclined cylinder and examined the evolution of hollow bubbles during water entry the cylinder s trajectory into water took the form of a curve and that caused the cavitation to separate into two bubbles and eventually collapse under hydrostatic pressure derakhshanian et al 2018 studied the oblique water entry of blunted nose models considering moment of inertia center of gravity and other dynamical properties several two phase fluid dynamics phenomena including splash asymmetrical cavity formation and cavity collapse were observed similar drop experiments related to 3d bodies also include battley and allen 2012 el malki alaoui et al el malkialaoui et al 2012 jalalisendi et al 2015 scolan and korobkin 2015 derakhshanian and haghdel derakhshanian et al 2018 and swidan et al 2016 from the three dimensional drop tests mentioned above the model shapes are limited to simple geometric forms such as cones spheres and ellipsoids although these drop experiments greatly improved the understanding on 3d impact they cannot fully reflect the impact characteristics of complicated impact phenomena such as a real 3d ship xie et al 2018a conducted a preliminary discussion on water entry for a three dimensional ship bow multiple pressure peaks appeared above the bulbous bow and the pressure peaks in some points decrease in a larger water entry velocity case these pressure characteristics were different to simplified 3d bodies such as cones an important reason for predicting the slamming loads of a 3d ship bow is to guide the local structural design the structural responses become complex due to time dependent impulse loads since some additional issues such as characteristics of loads the structural inertia effect and the dynamic constitutive equation of the material must be considered ji and wang 2014 discussed the effects of load shape on the dynamic response and found that the stress results under time domain loads simple semi sine and triangular load shapes were different yang and wang 2018 discussed the dynamic behavior of a large containership s bow structure subjected to slamming pressure various influential parameters including pressure peak impact duration rise time and load attenuation coefficient on dynamic response were discussed these influential parameters could affect the stress level of a structure these findings suggested that the pressure characteristics are quite important to the structural dynamic response the ship slamming with pitch angles is common due to the wave body interaction however the drop experiment of the 3d ship bow with pitch angles is limited it hinders the accurate prediction of slamming loads on real ships and the related structural response analysis the present study carried out experiments on the water entry of a 3d bow model with various pitch angles and thus clarified the impact pressure characteristics of a complex 3d ship another purpose of our study was to provide a complete dataset for drop tests such that further numerical comparison can be done for various cases 2 experiments 2 1 experimental system an experimental system was established to carry out a free drop test of various test models it has been successfully applied to vertical drop experimental investigations including hydroelastic impact of a stiffened bottom structure xie et al 2018c and the water entry of 3d rigid bow flare model xie et al 2018a this system includes a fixed frame a model shelf and four guide rails as shown in fig 1 a an angle adjustment device was designed to adjust the water entry angle of the model four longitudinal connecting rods are used to adjust the pitch angles fig 1 b illustrates the sketch of the fixed frame the model shelf and the moving test model with a pitch angle of 15 various pitch angles can be realized by selecting different longitudinal connecting rods the blue parts in fig 1 b fig 1 c demonstrates the details of the connection according to the geometrical relationship the longitudinal connecting rods become horizontal and rotate the test model at a pitch angle when the model shelf falls vertically the test model impacts water with this pitch posture 2 2 test model a truncated 3d bow flare model was made according to the container ship 1200 mm 737 mm 446 mm illustrated in fig 2 in fig 2 a the indigo line represents the location of the stringer plate and the green line denotes the position of transverse diaphragm the ship line shown in fig 2 b can be used to accurately reconstruct the test model with a longitudinal space of 15 mm the model is made up of fiberglass with a shell thicknesses of 8 mm and the total mass with model shelf is 269 kg in order to fully reflect the three dimensional characteristics of the structure on the slamming loads 15 pressure sensors p1 p15 were placed on the left side of the model and were arranged in the four transverse profiles with longitudinal locations as x 436 mm x 605 mm x 774 mm and x 945 mm the geometric shapes of these four sections are shown in fig 2 c and the pressure locations in each profile can be clearly seen 2 3 instruments in the drop experiment the falling kinemics and slamming loads that mainly include falling displacement water entry velocity acceleration and impact force are of greatest interest these physical quantities are measured through pressure sensors accelerometers displacement sensors and force sensors two accelerometers three force transducers and a displacement transducer are placed on the model s top surface the displacement sensor is located at the center of the surface and the falling velocity can be obtained by differencing the measured displacement to the corresponding time swidan et al 2016 three force sensors are placed around a circle with a diameter of 640 mm fig 3 the impact force presented in this paper is the sum of the outputs of the three force sensors two accelerometers are placed on the diagonal and their average is the final output the pressure sensor has a pressure probe with a diameter of 8 mm and the pressure probe is as flat to the model surface as possible to minimize measurement error van nuffel et al 2013 to ensure the measurement validity the capacity of the pressure sensor was 500 kpa and the range of the accelerator was 100 m s2 according to the study by zeraatgar et al 2019 the sampling frequency to capture the peak signals was set as 10 khz 2 4 test conditions drop tests were carried out in a water basin with a size of 108 m in length 7 m in width and 3 5 m in depth the water temperature was approximately 15 c five drop heights were chosen and the distances between the lowest point and calm water level are h250 250 mm h400 400 mm h550 550 mm h700 700 mm and h900 900 mm four pitch angles were selected as p00 0 p05 5 p10 10 and p15 15 the combination of symbols h and p was used to name the test conditions for example the test condition of h400p10 denotes that the test model fell from a drop height of 400 mm and at a pitch angle of 10 the definition of pitch angle is as shown in fig 4 a deadrise angle is the main parameter affecting the pressure characteristic and is defined as the angle between the horizontal line calm water surface and the tangent at the measuring point for a three dimensional model the geometrical parameters affecting the impact pressure are mainly two deadrise angles longitudinal deadrise angle α in the x z plane and transverse deadrise angle β in the y z plane the definition of these two deadrise angles is shown in fig 4 b c for water entry cases with different pitch angles the pitch angle θ can influence the longitudinal deadrise angle α suppose the longitudinal deadrise angle is α0 in the vertical water entry case θ 0 the longitudinal deadrise angle α changes to α0 θ in the drop case with a pitch angle of θ 3 analysis of experimental repeatability the comparative results of the falling kinematics are shown in fig 5 the three repeatable experiments are named test1 test2 and test3 for the falling displacement fig 5 a the maximum error in these three tests was less than 5 for acceleration fig 5 b obvious oscillation was observed in the acceleration signal but the phases of acceleration oscillation can be synchronous the maximum error was less than 6 2 fft analysis in the acceleration signal was used to confirm the sources of oscillation as demonstrated in fig 6 modal analysis of model shelf and fixed frame was executed to estimate the natural vibrating periods the first six order frequencies are listed in table 1 the natural frequency of model shelf 60 7 hz was close to the fourth main frequency component captured in the acceleration signal 58 6 hz this corresponding relationship reflects that the vibration of experimental system affected the measured data xie et al 2019 for the fixed system there is no corresponding frequency which means that the influence of vibration in the supporting system on the acceleration signal was negligible an energy ratio of frequency is defined as 1 ε y f eva y f pri where y f eva and y f pri represent the energy amplitude of the evaluative frequency and the primary frequency the first frequency respectively the ratio represents the relative importance of each frequency component the ratio for frequency 58 6 hz is about 0 11 but it is 0 018 for frequency 45 7 hz first order modal frequency theoretically a higher order model frequency will induce a smaller energy amplitude this abnormal phenomenon means that some other factors increase the amplitude of frequency 58 6 hz an important factor might be the oscillating pressure in some air pockets during impact comparative results of pressure are shown in fig 7 representing the local flow characteristics the characteristics of pressure time history including impact duration and phases of oscillation are approximate to further reflect the repeatability of measured pressure fig 8 illustrates the error bar of all measured pressure points p1 p15 the column represents the mean of peak pressure and the red line denotes the error bar the mean and standard deviation are determined as follows 2 μ i 1 n x i n 3 σ 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 the upper of error bar is μ σ and the lower is μ σ the dispersion of pressure peak in all measured positions is less than 10 among them the dispersions at p3 p7 and p12 points are larger than at other positions these points are located at the bottom fig 2 a where the air cushion is prominent for flat impact the air cushion effect can increase the measuring randomness xie et al 2018c a larger error also appears at points p4 p8 p10 p11 and p13 the error analysis should refer to the complicated flow phenomena during impact in order to clearly show the free surface characteristics vertical water entry simulation was carried out using a 2d cfd method the numerical progress has been reported in a previous study by xie et al 2018b the free surface evolution cannot fully represent the actual flow of 3d bow flare model but it can illustrate some typical flow characteristics referring to the free surface evolution of transverse profile x 774 mm shown in fig 9 point p4 is located above the bulbous bow water is first separated from the body and then re impacts the object secondary impact phenomenon meanwhile some fluid phenomena such as air pocket and flow separation also occur these phenomena can cause pressure oscillation which increases the experimental uncertainty similar case also appears at the transverse profile x 605 mm which can reduce the measuring accuracy for p10 and p11 for the case of points close to the bottom p8 and p13 fig 10 shows the free surface at the time instant of pileup water climbing to p13 the flow separation can easily induce ventilation due to a large negative pressure region sun and faltinsen 2006 and thus increase the uncertainty of measuring pressure in this region 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics of 3d bow flare slamming fig 11 provides a complete dataset in test condition h400p00 where the body touches the calm water at t 0 15 s according to different transverse profiles the pressure is divided into four parts x 945 mm p1 p2 x 774 mm p3 p6 x 605 mm p7 p11 and x 436 mm p12 p15 for the falling kinematics the water entry velocity shown in fig 11 b reaches its first peak at t 0 15 s and then decreases at t 0 188 s after that the velocity increases again t 0 24 s the fluctuation of water entry velocity at 0 15 s t 0 24 s is caused by bottom slamming which induces a huge impact force for acceleration fig 11 c it almost remains constant with an average of 9 2 m s2 in the initial stage t 0 135 s this stage represents free falling the acceleration is smaller than g 9 8 m s2 due to the friction between the model shelf and fixed frame the friction f can be estimated through the following equation 4 f m g g a where m is the falling mass g is the acceleration due to gravity g a is the mean value of measured acceleration in the free falling stage this friction about 161 n is much smaller than the total impact force 14 210 n shown in fig 11 h suggesting that its effect on the measured result is limited bottom slamming occurs when the bottom just touches the water and rapidly accelerates to 43 3 m s2 after that acceleration appears at the second peak induced by the flare impact this characteristic is different in the case of wedges where acceleration only appears at one peak when the water just immerses the body xu et al 2010 for the pressure characteristic the characteristic of slamming loads shown in fig 11 e g is analyzed for the bottom slamming p3 p7 and p12 the peak pressure shows the law of p12 p7 p3 there is a v bottom at p3 while there is a flat bottom at p12 the v bottom aids the water in quickly escaping from the sides of the body pressure phases at these points are accordant and this feature helps the huge impact force to simultaneously appear at the bottom part this is different from what appears in the wedge impact where the location of the maximum pressure moves upward on the wedge surface following the pileup yettou et al 2007 in addition the bottom pressure has a short pressure duration such results can cause the bottom structure to undergo plastic deformation xie et al 2020c compared to the bottom pressure peak pressure on the flare region decreases since the bottom slamming pressure is caused by the body directly hitting the water while the flare slamming pressure mainly comes from the pileup water this is similar to the slamming phenomenon of a wedge wei et al 2015 it should be noted that the bulbous bow can cause flow separation and then the separated fluid may re impact the body causing secondary impact xie et al 2020d this phenomenon can induce multiple impulse pressures for example impulse pressure at p1 appears at t 0 23 s and t 0 27 s however the total impact force does not reflect this characteristic that is the impulse pressure is a local phenomenon that cannot affect global deformation but only affects the local structural dynamic response for the total impact force the measurement data and the estimation values are compared the estimation is based on newton s second law 5 f esi m g a where a is the measured acceleration the experimental data is similar to the estimation f esi finally the oscillation of pressure in test condition h400p00 is further discussed to clarify the pressure time history characteristic the frequency distribution is shown in fig 12 an obvious energy is distributed in the frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz the position appearing in the 50 hz 100 hz is mainly concentrated on the bottom p3 p7 and p12 bulbous bow p8 and p13 and chine of the body p6 p11 and p15 referring to the free surface characteristic illustrated in figs 9 and 10 an air cushion easily forms at the bottom fig 10 a while flow separation easily appears at the bulbous bow and chine fig 9 these phenomena always accompany the formation of a cavity that causes oscillating air pressure moreover there are structural vibrations in the experimental system whose proportions are less than 0 018 referring to table 1 the ratio ε in this frequency is 0 05 and thus the proportion caused by oscillating air pressure is larger than 0 032 hence the sources of oscillations mainly come from the oscillating air pressure in the cavity but not from the structural vibrations in the experimental system fig 13 shows the basic results in the test condition h400p15 compared with the drop test h400p00 fig 11 the water entry velocity fig 11 b only shows an obvious peak t 0 24 s which reflects the smaller fluctuation of velocity caused by bottom slamming on the one hand the bottom peak pressure p3 p7 and p12 in h400p15 is smaller than that in h400p00 on the other hand the bottom pressure does not simultaneously reach the maximum value due to the influence of the pitch angle for example the peak pressure of p3 p7 and p12 appears at 0 153 s 0 168 s and 0 184 s respectively this difference reduces the total impact force on the bottom in addition the friction between the guide rail and the model frame increases due to the horizontal impact force at water entry with the pitch angle for the pressure characteristics pressure peak at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 is about 15 smaller than that in h400p00 while the pressure impact duration increases smaller peak pressure and longer impact duration reduces the stress levels of the bottom structure on the contrary pressure peaks on the bow flare region i e p1 p2 p8 and p13 increase about 30 120 but the impact duration decreases larger slamming pressure and smaller impact duration causes the local bow flare structure to be more dangerous than h400p00 yang et al 2018 with the increment of pitch angle the bow flare area hinders the fluid since the longitudinal impact angle becomes smaller α0 θ the frequency distribution of pressure signals in test condition h400p15 is shown in fig 14 compared to the drop test h400p00 the energy distributed in the frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz becomes smaller air cavity is not so prominent in the vertical water entry case h400p00 due to the obvious longitudinal flow for the total slamming force it is 27 larger than the vertical drop test h400p00 this measured impact force is different from the estimation obtained by eq 5 according to the arrangement of accelerometers the signals captured by these two accelerometers are different if the pitch angle exists the mean value of accelerations is used to estimate the impact force which can induce a certain error 4 2 influence of pitch angle fig 15 and fig 16 show the comparisons of pressure time history with different pitch angles the test conditions are h400p00 h400p05 h400p10 and h400p15 the time axis in h400p05 h400p10 and h400p15 moves forward 0 05 s 0 10 s and 0 15 s respectively for bottom slamming fig 15 the peak pressure is maximal at a pitch angle of θ 5 referring to fig 4 the longitudinal impact angle α at the bottom is 0 in the test condition h400p00 but becomes θ when the body enters the water with a pitch angle of θ a section having a small angle to the water surface about 5 experiences higher impact pressures than the same section with a completely flat impact 0 this is due to the cushion effects of the air cavity underneath the flat section okada and sumi 2000 in addition the pressure oscillation at θ 0 is more obvious than in other cases with the increase in pitch angle the longitudinal impact angle at the bottom moves away from 0 the air cushion effect at the bottom is reduced which in turn reduces the oscillating air pressure in the cavity for bow flare slamming fig 16 the peak pressure increases with the pitch angle even though the pressure increases four times at p2 and p6 from θ 0 to θ 15 it is much smaller than the bottom pressure comparing to the bottom region the flare pressure at different pitch angle illustrates distinctive differences the pitch angle mainly affects the pressure characteristic on the flare region similar to the bottom impact the pressure oscillation at the flare region also decreases with the pitch angle but this reduction is smaller than that of the bottom region pressure oscillation mainly appears during the pressure decreasing stage according to the basic impact results bao et al 2017 the pressure is maximum when the fluid fully immerses the body at this stage the fluid disturbance is serious due to the fluid falling back and breaking this effect of flow disturbance on the bow flare region is more serious than that on the bottom due to being closer 4 3 influence of drop height fig 17 and fig 18 demonstrate the pressure characteristics with different drop heights the pressure coefficient cp is defined as 6 cp 2 p t ρ v t 2 where v t is the impact velocity in fig 17 the pressure coefficients at p5 p10 and p15 points are close which agrees with the theoretical result that the impact pressure is proportional to the drop velocity squared however the cp at p7 and p12 decreases with the drop height these two points are located at the bottom where the angle to the water surface is 5 the cushion is important in this impact case it has been stated in the literature that the cushion effect is obvious at a higher impact velocity which reduces the impact pressure in addition one important characteristic is that the impulse pressure appears at points p2 and p5 as shown in the mark in fig 17 a the points p2 and p5 are located above the bulbous bow when the bulbous bow first enters into water the jet flow separates from the body and then re hits the body fig 9 this jet flow impact will induce impulse pressure however the impulse pressure depends on the relation of flow velocity and separated location on the water entry velocity according to the present experimental results the impulse pressures are different for different drop height cases this impulse pressure may not always be much smaller than the peak value the numerical simulation of a bow flare section by xie et al 2020b showed that the impulse pressure was 20 larger than the pressure peak 5 conclusions an experimental investigation on the water entry of a 3d bow flare model with various pitch angles was carried out through a series of free drop tests detailed experimental data including the water entry depth velocity pressure and impact force are reported it further clarifies the impact characteristics of a 3d ship model the slamming loads during impact were presented in different drop tests the bottom pressure p3 p7 and p12 that endangers the bottom structure is larger and experiences shorter impact duration than the flare pressure obvious pressure oscillation appears at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 bulbous bow p8 and p13 and chine p6 p11 and p15 at a frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz fft analysis shows that the oscillation is mainly from the oscillating air pressure in the air cavity compared to the vertical water entry case θ 0 the peak pressure in the bottom region becomes smaller but it is larger in the flare region for water entry with a pitch angle for the total slamming force it increases 27 from θ 0 to θ 15 however the pressure oscillation decreases since the air cavity is not significant in the water entry case with a pitch angle these findings reveal that the characteristics of impact hydrodynamics in water entry with pitch angles are different from vertical impact cases the influence of pitch angles on the pressure characteristics was further examined we found that the effect of the pitch angle on the pressure peak at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 is negligible nevertheless the flare pressure greatly increases with the pitch angle and even increases more than four times at some points for different drop heights the pressure coefficients at most positions are independent of the drop height but the impulse pressure characteristic is different this difference is caused by the jet flow impact related to water entry velocity the results of this study are expected to improve the understanding of the impact characteristic of 3d bow flare model with pitch angles experimental datasets can be used to further verify the numerical method and improve the structural design it should be noted that the friction in the guiding system affects the acceleration and velocity during the experiments however if the velocity is used in validation studies it does not affect the relationship of this velocity with the measured pressures and the impact force further studies should be conducted on the improvement of 3d impact theory and the analysis of structural response credit authorship contribution statement hang

structures causing huge slamming loads are quite common for high speed ships the statistical results of daidola and mishkevich 1995 show that the probability of structural damage due to slamming was as high as 15 even though the slamming load was not serious frequent impact could cause fatigue damage to structures ship slamming has strong nonlinearity the pressure characteristics are related to

the role of heel angle and impact velocity on pile up evolution hydrodynamic loading and energy imparted to the fluid flow were systematically analyzed some other known experimental works on oblique water entry limited to 2d sections can be found in garabedian 1953 gu et al 2014 wang and guedes soares wang and guedessoares 2014 and wang and guedes soares wang and guedessoares 2016 these experimental studies have clarified the oblique impact characteristics to further understand the physics of oblique water entry the water entry impact has obvious three dimensional effects the studies mentioned above are necessary first steps before studying more complicated 3d shapes de backer et al de backer et al 2009 carried out a drop test of cones at different deadrise angles the results were compared with a three dimensional asymptotic theory for axisymmetric rigid bodies the asymptotic theory was found to be quite conservative since the measured peak pressure levels appear to be approximately 50 75 of the theoretical levels complicated flows including flow separation and air cavities are the main reasons for the differences between experiments and theory many experiments have observed these complicated flows for example wei and shi 2012 carried out experiments on oblique water entry for an inclined cylinder and examined the evolution of hollow bubbles during water entry the cylinder s trajectory into water took the form of a curve and that caused the cavitation to separate into two bubbles and eventually collapse under hydrostatic pressure derakhshanian et al 2018 studied the oblique water entry of blunted nose models considering moment of inertia center of gravity and other dynamical properties several two phase fluid dynamics phenomena including splash asymmetrical cavity formation and cavity collapse were observed similar drop experiments related to 3d bodies also include battley and allen 2012 el malki alaoui et al el malkialaoui et al 2012 jalalisendi et al 2015 scolan and korobkin 2015 derakhshanian and haghdel derakhshanian et al 2018 and swidan et al 2016 from the three dimensional drop tests mentioned above the model shapes are limited to simple geometric forms such as cones spheres and ellipsoids although these drop experiments greatly improved the understanding on 3d impact they cannot fully reflect the impact characteristics of complicated impact phenomena such as a real 3d ship xie et al 2018a conducted a preliminary discussion on water entry for a three dimensional ship bow multiple pressure peaks appeared above the bulbous bow and the pressure peaks in some points decrease in a larger water entry velocity case these pressure characteristics were different to simplified 3d bodies such as cones an important reason for predicting the slamming loads of a 3d ship bow is to guide the local structural design the structural responses become complex due to time dependent impulse loads since some additional issues such as characteristics of loads the structural inertia effect and the dynamic constitutive equation of the material must be considered ji and wang 2014 discussed the effects of load shape on the dynamic response and found that the stress results under time domain loads simple semi sine and triangular load shapes were different yang and wang 2018 discussed the dynamic behavior of a large containership s bow structure subjected to slamming pressure various influential parameters including pressure peak impact duration rise time and load attenuation coefficient on dynamic response were discussed these influential parameters could affect the stress level of a structure these findings suggested that the pressure characteristics are quite important to the structural dynamic response the ship slamming with pitch angles is common due to the wave body interaction however the drop experiment of the 3d ship bow with pitch angles is limited it hinders the accurate prediction of slamming loads on real ships and the related structural response analysis the present study carried out experiments on the water entry of a 3d bow model with various pitch angles and thus clarified the impact pressure characteristics of a complex 3d ship another purpose of our study was to provide a complete dataset for drop tests such that further numerical comparison can be done for various cases 2 experiments 2 1 experimental system an experimental system was established to carry out a free drop test of various test models it has been successfully applied to vertical drop experimental investigations including hydroelastic impact of a stiffened bottom structure xie et al 2018c and the water entry of 3d rigid bow flare model xie et al 2018a this system includes a fixed frame a model shelf and four guide rails as shown in fig 1 a an angle adjustment device was designed to adjust the water entry angle of the model four longitudinal connecting rods are used to adjust the pitch angles fig 1 b illustrates the sketch of the fixed frame the model shelf and the moving test model with a pitch angle of 15 various pitch angles can be realized by selecting different longitudinal connecting rods the blue parts in fig 1 b fig 1 c demonstrates the details of the connection according to the geometrical relationship the longitudinal connecting rods become horizontal and rotate the test model at a pitch angle when the model shelf falls vertically the test model impacts water with this pitch posture 2 2 test model a truncated 3d bow flare model was made according to the container ship 1200 mm 737 mm 446 mm illustrated in fig 2 in fig 2 a the indigo line represents the location of the stringer plate and the green line denotes the position of transverse diaphragm the ship line shown in fig 2 b can be used to accurately reconstruct the test model with a longitudinal space of 15 mm the model is made up of fiberglass with a shell thicknesses of 8 mm and the total mass with model shelf is 269 kg in order to fully reflect the three dimensional characteristics of the structure on the slamming loads 15 pressure sensors p1 p15 were placed on the left side of the model and were arranged in the four transverse profiles with longitudinal locations as x 436 mm x 605 mm x 774 mm and x 945 mm the geometric shapes of these four sections are shown in fig 2 c and the pressure locations in each profile can be clearly seen 2 3 instruments in the drop experiment the falling kinemics and slamming loads that mainly include falling displacement water entry velocity acceleration and impact force are of greatest interest these physical quantities are measured through pressure sensors accelerometers displacement sensors and force sensors two accelerometers three force transducers and a displacement transducer are placed on the model s top surface the displacement sensor is located at the center of the surface and the falling velocity can be obtained by differencing the measured displacement to the corresponding time swidan et al 2016 three force sensors are placed around a circle with a diameter of 640 mm fig 3 the impact force presented in this paper is the sum of the outputs of the three force sensors two accelerometers are placed on the diagonal and their average is the final output the pressure sensor has a pressure probe with a diameter of 8 mm and the pressure probe is as flat to the model surface as possible to minimize measurement error van nuffel et al 2013 to ensure the measurement validity the capacity of the pressure sensor was 500 kpa and the range of the accelerator was 100 m s2 according to the study by zeraatgar et al 2019 the sampling frequency to capture the peak signals was set as 10 khz 2 4 test conditions drop tests were carried out in a water basin with a size of 108 m in length 7 m in width and 3 5 m in depth the water temperature was approximately 15 c five drop heights were chosen and the distances between the lowest point and calm water level are h250 250 mm h400 400 mm h550 550 mm h700 700 mm and h900 900 mm four pitch angles were selected as p00 0 p05 5 p10 10 and p15 15 the combination of symbols h and p was used to name the test conditions for example the test condition of h400p10 denotes that the test model fell from a drop height of 400 mm and at a pitch angle of 10 the definition of pitch angle is as shown in fig 4 a deadrise angle is the main parameter affecting the pressure characteristic and is defined as the angle between the horizontal line calm water surface and the tangent at the measuring point for a three dimensional model the geometrical parameters affecting the impact pressure are mainly two deadrise angles longitudinal deadrise angle α in the x z plane and transverse deadrise angle β in the y z plane the definition of these two deadrise angles is shown in fig 4 b c for water entry cases with different pitch angles the pitch angle θ can influence the longitudinal deadrise angle α suppose the longitudinal deadrise angle is α0 in the vertical water entry case θ 0 the longitudinal deadrise angle α changes to α0 θ in the drop case with a pitch angle of θ 3 analysis of experimental repeatability the comparative results of the falling kinematics are shown in fig 5 the three repeatable experiments are named test1 test2 and test3 for the falling displacement fig 5 a the maximum error in these three tests was less than 5 for acceleration fig 5 b obvious oscillation was observed in the acceleration signal but the phases of acceleration oscillation can be synchronous the maximum error was less than 6 2 fft analysis in the acceleration signal was used to confirm the sources of oscillation as demonstrated in fig 6 modal analysis of model shelf and fixed frame was executed to estimate the natural vibrating periods the first six order frequencies are listed in table 1 the natural frequency of model shelf 60 7 hz was close to the fourth main frequency component captured in the acceleration signal 58 6 hz this corresponding relationship reflects that the vibration of experimental system affected the measured data xie et al 2019 for the fixed system there is no corresponding frequency which means that the influence of vibration in the supporting system on the acceleration signal was negligible an energy ratio of frequency is defined as 1 ε y f eva y f pri where y f eva and y f pri represent the energy amplitude of the evaluative frequency and the primary frequency the first frequency respectively the ratio represents the relative importance of each frequency component the ratio for frequency 58 6 hz is about 0 11 but it is 0 018 for frequency 45 7 hz first order modal frequency theoretically a higher order model frequency will induce a smaller energy amplitude this abnormal phenomenon means that some other factors increase the amplitude of frequency 58 6 hz an important factor might be the oscillating pressure in some air pockets during impact comparative results of pressure are shown in fig 7 representing the local flow characteristics the characteristics of pressure time history including impact duration and phases of oscillation are approximate to further reflect the repeatability of measured pressure fig 8 illustrates the error bar of all measured pressure points p1 p15 the column represents the mean of peak pressure and the red line denotes the error bar the mean and standard deviation are determined as follows 2 μ i 1 n x i n 3 σ 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 the upper of error bar is μ σ and the lower is μ σ the dispersion of pressure peak in all measured positions is less than 10 among them the dispersions at p3 p7 and p12 points are larger than at other positions these points are located at the bottom fig 2 a where the air cushion is prominent for flat impact the air cushion effect can increase the measuring randomness xie et al 2018c a larger error also appears at points p4 p8 p10 p11 and p13 the error analysis should refer to the complicated flow phenomena during impact in order to clearly show the free surface characteristics vertical water entry simulation was carried out using a 2d cfd method the numerical progress has been reported in a previous study by xie et al 2018b the free surface evolution cannot fully represent the actual flow of 3d bow flare model but it can illustrate some typical flow characteristics referring to the free surface evolution of transverse profile x 774 mm shown in fig 9 point p4 is located above the bulbous bow water is first separated from the body and then re impacts the object secondary impact phenomenon meanwhile some fluid phenomena such as air pocket and flow separation also occur these phenomena can cause pressure oscillation which increases the experimental uncertainty similar case also appears at the transverse profile x 605 mm which can reduce the measuring accuracy for p10 and p11 for the case of points close to the bottom p8 and p13 fig 10 shows the free surface at the time instant of pileup water climbing to p13 the flow separation can easily induce ventilation due to a large negative pressure region sun and faltinsen 2006 and thus increase the uncertainty of measuring pressure in this region 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics of 3d bow flare slamming fig 11 provides a complete dataset in test condition h400p00 where the body touches the calm water at t 0 15 s according to different transverse profiles the pressure is divided into four parts x 945 mm p1 p2 x 774 mm p3 p6 x 605 mm p7 p11 and x 436 mm p12 p15 for the falling kinematics the water entry velocity shown in fig 11 b reaches its first peak at t 0 15 s and then decreases at t 0 188 s after that the velocity increases again t 0 24 s the fluctuation of water entry velocity at 0 15 s t 0 24 s is caused by bottom slamming which induces a huge impact force for acceleration fig 11 c it almost remains constant with an average of 9 2 m s2 in the initial stage t 0 135 s this stage represents free falling the acceleration is smaller than g 9 8 m s2 due to the friction between the model shelf and fixed frame the friction f can be estimated through the following equation 4 f m g g a where m is the falling mass g is the acceleration due to gravity g a is the mean value of measured acceleration in the free falling stage this friction about 161 n is much smaller than the total impact force 14 210 n shown in fig 11 h suggesting that its effect on the measured result is limited bottom slamming occurs when the bottom just touches the water and rapidly accelerates to 43 3 m s2 after that acceleration appears at the second peak induced by the flare impact this characteristic is different in the case of wedges where acceleration only appears at one peak when the water just immerses the body xu et al 2010 for the pressure characteristic the characteristic of slamming loads shown in fig 11 e g is analyzed for the bottom slamming p3 p7 and p12 the peak pressure shows the law of p12 p7 p3 there is a v bottom at p3 while there is a flat bottom at p12 the v bottom aids the water in quickly escaping from the sides of the body pressure phases at these points are accordant and this feature helps the huge impact force to simultaneously appear at the bottom part this is different from what appears in the wedge impact where the location of the maximum pressure moves upward on the wedge surface following the pileup yettou et al 2007 in addition the bottom pressure has a short pressure duration such results can cause the bottom structure to undergo plastic deformation xie et al 2020c compared to the bottom pressure peak pressure on the flare region decreases since the bottom slamming pressure is caused by the body directly hitting the water while the flare slamming pressure mainly comes from the pileup water this is similar to the slamming phenomenon of a wedge wei et al 2015 it should be noted that the bulbous bow can cause flow separation and then the separated fluid may re impact the body causing secondary impact xie et al 2020d this phenomenon can induce multiple impulse pressures for example impulse pressure at p1 appears at t 0 23 s and t 0 27 s however the total impact force does not reflect this characteristic that is the impulse pressure is a local phenomenon that cannot affect global deformation but only affects the local structural dynamic response for the total impact force the measurement data and the estimation values are compared the estimation is based on newton s second law 5 f esi m g a where a is the measured acceleration the experimental data is similar to the estimation f esi finally the oscillation of pressure in test condition h400p00 is further discussed to clarify the pressure time history characteristic the frequency distribution is shown in fig 12 an obvious energy is distributed in the frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz the position appearing in the 50 hz 100 hz is mainly concentrated on the bottom p3 p7 and p12 bulbous bow p8 and p13 and chine of the body p6 p11 and p15 referring to the free surface characteristic illustrated in figs 9 and 10 an air cushion easily forms at the bottom fig 10 a while flow separation easily appears at the bulbous bow and chine fig 9 these phenomena always accompany the formation of a cavity that causes oscillating air pressure moreover there are structural vibrations in the experimental system whose proportions are less than 0 018 referring to table 1 the ratio ε in this frequency is 0 05 and thus the proportion caused by oscillating air pressure is larger than 0 032 hence the sources of oscillations mainly come from the oscillating air pressure in the cavity but not from the structural vibrations in the experimental system fig 13 shows the basic results in the test condition h400p15 compared with the drop test h400p00 fig 11 the water entry velocity fig 11 b only shows an obvious peak t 0 24 s which reflects the smaller fluctuation of velocity caused by bottom slamming on the one hand the bottom peak pressure p3 p7 and p12 in h400p15 is smaller than that in h400p00 on the other hand the bottom pressure does not simultaneously reach the maximum value due to the influence of the pitch angle for example the peak pressure of p3 p7 and p12 appears at 0 153 s 0 168 s and 0 184 s respectively this difference reduces the total impact force on the bottom in addition the friction between the guide rail and the model frame increases due to the horizontal impact force at water entry with the pitch angle for the pressure characteristics pressure peak at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 is about 15 smaller than that in h400p00 while the pressure impact duration increases smaller peak pressure and longer impact duration reduces the stress levels of the bottom structure on the contrary pressure peaks on the bow flare region i e p1 p2 p8 and p13 increase about 30 120 but the impact duration decreases larger slamming pressure and smaller impact duration causes the local bow flare structure to be more dangerous than h400p00 yang et al 2018 with the increment of pitch angle the bow flare area hinders the fluid since the longitudinal impact angle becomes smaller α0 θ the frequency distribution of pressure signals in test condition h400p15 is shown in fig 14 compared to the drop test h400p00 the energy distributed in the frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz becomes smaller air cavity is not so prominent in the vertical water entry case h400p00 due to the obvious longitudinal flow for the total slamming force it is 27 larger than the vertical drop test h400p00 this measured impact force is different from the estimation obtained by eq 5 according to the arrangement of accelerometers the signals captured by these two accelerometers are different if the pitch angle exists the mean value of accelerations is used to estimate the impact force which can induce a certain error 4 2 influence of pitch angle fig 15 and fig 16 show the comparisons of pressure time history with different pitch angles the test conditions are h400p00 h400p05 h400p10 and h400p15 the time axis in h400p05 h400p10 and h400p15 moves forward 0 05 s 0 10 s and 0 15 s respectively for bottom slamming fig 15 the peak pressure is maximal at a pitch angle of θ 5 referring to fig 4 the longitudinal impact angle α at the bottom is 0 in the test condition h400p00 but becomes θ when the body enters the water with a pitch angle of θ a section having a small angle to the water surface about 5 experiences higher impact pressures than the same section with a completely flat impact 0 this is due to the cushion effects of the air cavity underneath the flat section okada and sumi 2000 in addition the pressure oscillation at θ 0 is more obvious than in other cases with the increase in pitch angle the longitudinal impact angle at the bottom moves away from 0 the air cushion effect at the bottom is reduced which in turn reduces the oscillating air pressure in the cavity for bow flare slamming fig 16 the peak pressure increases with the pitch angle even though the pressure increases four times at p2 and p6 from θ 0 to θ 15 it is much smaller than the bottom pressure comparing to the bottom region the flare pressure at different pitch angle illustrates distinctive differences the pitch angle mainly affects the pressure characteristic on the flare region similar to the bottom impact the pressure oscillation at the flare region also decreases with the pitch angle but this reduction is smaller than that of the bottom region pressure oscillation mainly appears during the pressure decreasing stage according to the basic impact results bao et al 2017 the pressure is maximum when the fluid fully immerses the body at this stage the fluid disturbance is serious due to the fluid falling back and breaking this effect of flow disturbance on the bow flare region is more serious than that on the bottom due to being closer 4 3 influence of drop height fig 17 and fig 18 demonstrate the pressure characteristics with different drop heights the pressure coefficient cp is defined as 6 cp 2 p t ρ v t 2 where v t is the impact velocity in fig 17 the pressure coefficients at p5 p10 and p15 points are close which agrees with the theoretical result that the impact pressure is proportional to the drop velocity squared however the cp at p7 and p12 decreases with the drop height these two points are located at the bottom where the angle to the water surface is 5 the cushion is important in this impact case it has been stated in the literature that the cushion effect is obvious at a higher impact velocity which reduces the impact pressure in addition one important characteristic is that the impulse pressure appears at points p2 and p5 as shown in the mark in fig 17 a the points p2 and p5 are located above the bulbous bow when the bulbous bow first enters into water the jet flow separates from the body and then re hits the body fig 9 this jet flow impact will induce impulse pressure however the impulse pressure depends on the relation of flow velocity and separated location on the water entry velocity according to the present experimental results the impulse pressures are different for different drop height cases this impulse pressure may not always be much smaller than the peak value the numerical simulation of a bow flare section by xie et al 2020b showed that the impulse pressure was 20 larger than the pressure peak 5 conclusions an experimental investigation on the water entry of a 3d bow flare model with various pitch angles was carried out through a series of free drop tests detailed experimental data including the water entry depth velocity pressure and impact force are reported it further clarifies the impact characteristics of a 3d ship model the slamming loads during impact were presented in different drop tests the bottom pressure p3 p7 and p12 that endangers the bottom structure is larger and experiences shorter impact duration than the flare pressure obvious pressure oscillation appears at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 bulbous bow p8 and p13 and chine p6 p11 and p15 at a frequency range of 50 hz 100 hz fft analysis shows that the oscillation is mainly from the oscillating air pressure in the air cavity compared to the vertical water entry case θ 0 the peak pressure in the bottom region becomes smaller but it is larger in the flare region for water entry with a pitch angle for the total slamming force it increases 27 from θ 0 to θ 15 however the pressure oscillation decreases since the air cavity is not significant in the water entry case with a pitch angle these findings reveal that the characteristics of impact hydrodynamics in water entry with pitch angles are different from vertical impact cases the influence of pitch angles on the pressure characteristics was further examined we found that the effect of the pitch angle on the pressure peak at the bottom p3 p7 and p12 is negligible nevertheless the flare pressure greatly increases with the pitch angle and even increases more than four times at some points for different drop heights the pressure coefficients at most positions are independent of the drop height but the impulse pressure characteristic is different this difference is caused by the jet flow impact related to water entry velocity the results of this study are expected to improve the understanding of the impact characteristic of 3d bow flare model with pitch angles experimental datasets can be used to further verify the numerical method and improve the structural design it should be noted that the friction in the guiding system affects the acceleration and velocity during the experiments however if the velocity is used in validation studies it does not affect the relationship of this velocity with the measured pressures and the impact force further studies should be conducted on the improvement of 3d impact theory and the analysis of structural response credit authorship contribution statement hang

2 types of porosity distribution three different types of porosity distribution are considered as shown in figs 2 4 they are denoted as type 1 uneven symmetrical distribution type 2 uneven asymmetric distribution and type 3 even distribution according to previous studies wattanasakulpong et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 the different types of porosity distribution correspond to different variation laws

the fluid formulation it is beneficial to note that there are two familiar vibrational modes in the fluid structure systems bulging and sloshing modes the sloshing modes are related to the rigid body movement of the container that makes vibration in the fluid free surface and the bulging modes are caused by the vibration of the flexible structure which moves the fluid amabili 2000 to describe the dynamic motion of a fluid a function called the fluid velocity potential is used this is defined as follows 19 φ 0 φ b φ s where φ b and φ s are the fluid velocity potential functions of the bulging and sloshing modes respectively in addition the velocity potential φ 0 is related to the deformation potential φ 0 as follows amabili 2000 20 φ 0 x y z t ϕ 0 x y z t t i ω ϕ 0 x y z e i ω t in the above relation ω is the angular frequency i 1 is the imaginary variable and t is the time variable due to the incompressibility of the fluid the velocity potential satisfies the laplace equation 21 2

waves on the free surface φ b must satisfy the following boundary condition 23 φ b y d 0 besides the velocity components of the fluid and elastic plate in the transverse direction must be equal at the fluid plate interface so the compatibility condition can be written as 24 φ b z z 0 w t the linearized sloshing condition at the fluid free surface can be defined as amabili 2000 25 φ 0 y y d ω 2 g φ

according to eq 21 we can write 39 2 ϕ s x 2 2 ϕ s y 2 2 ϕ s z 2 0 by inserting eq 38 in eq 39 it follows that 40 1 ϕ s x x d 2 ϕ s x x d x 2 1 ϕ s y y d 2 ϕ s y y d y 2 1 ϕ s z z d 2 ϕ s y z d z 2 0 which can be written as 41 a 1 ϕ s x x d 2 ϕ s x x d x 2 p 2 2 41 b 1 ϕ s y y d 2 ϕ s y y d y 2 q 2 2 41 c 1 ϕ s z z d 2 ϕ s z z d z 2 p 2 2 q 2 2 where p 1 2 and q 1 2 stand for the arbitrary unknown

researches and the validity of the current method is examined next the results of the natural frequency are presented for different boundary conditions and various types of porosity distribution moreover the effect of fluid depth side to thickness ratio length to width aspect ratio and porosity coefficient on the computed natural frequencies are discussed finally several samples of the mode shapes of the system are presented for different boundary conditions the properties of the materials of the fgp plates are listed in table 1 the frequencies provided in this paper are dimensionless and the dimensionless natural frequencies are obtained using the following two relations 58 ω ω a 2 ρ 1 d d d e 1 h 3 12 1 ν 2 59 ω ω h ρ 1 e 1 in addition seven different bcs cccc ssss sssf cccf scsc cscf and scsf are considered as shown in fig 5 4 1 convergence study since the present study uses series solution for the parameters of plate displacement and fluid velocity potential it is necessary to determine the number of terms in the series for which the results converge to a certain extent in this regard based on the number of different terms for the series the result of the basic dimensionless natural frequency ω is presented for different fluid depths table 2 the type 1 porosity distribution is assumed to be e 0 0 5 and the plate is made of berea sandstone in addition the results of the first six dimensionless natural frequencies of same case are presented in table 3 in this case d a as shown in tables 2 and 3 as the number of terms in the series increases the number of dimensionless natural frequencies gradually converges to a certain extent therefore for approximation series of the plate l 50 and for fluid velocity potential series m 1 n 1 6 are used 4 2 validation since no study has been conducted on the vibrations of the functionally graded porous plate in contact with the fluid yet to validate the present study first the results of the isotropic plate in contact with the fluid are compared with that of the previous studies then the results of the natural frequency of the fgp plate are compared with the available data in the literatures in table 4 the results of the dimensionless frequencies ω of the present study are compared with that of previous ones omiddezyani et al 2018 khorshidi and karimi 2019 and karimi et al 2020 the four edges of the intended plate were simply supported the properties of the materials used in the construction of the plate as well as the dimensions of the plate are as follows 60 a 10 m b 10 m h 0 15 m c a 10 ρ 2400 k g m 3 e 25 g p a a n d ν 0 15 it should be noted that setting the porosity coefficient to zero e 0 0 one can present the results for isotropic plates table 5 compares the results of the dimensionless natural frequency ω of the plate made of functionally graded porous material with porosity distribution of type 2 with the results of previous researches zhao et al 2019 and rezaei and saidi 2015 zhao et al 2019 examined the free vibrations of fgp plate and used virtual springs to model the system boundaries rezai et al rezaei and saidi 2015 provided an exact solution to obtain the natural frequencies of a rectangular plate made of functionally graded materials table 5 presents the results for the plate made of berea sandstone with the following data 61 a 0 5 m b 1 m h a 0 1

type 3 with the results of zhao et al 2019 table 5 presents the results for the plate made of al with the following data 62 a 1 m b 1 m a n d h a 0 15 as shown in tables 4 6 the results of the current method for the plate natural frequencies are in excellent agreement with the known results for plates made of functionally graded materials and isotropic plates in contact with fluid 4 3 results of dimensionless frequency for different boundary conditions table 7 contains the first six dimensionless frequencies ω of the fgp plate in contact with fluid this table shows the results for different boundary conditions and various types of porosity distribution the plate is made of berea sandstone and the porosity coefficient is 0 5 e 0 0 5 further the plate dimensions and depth of the fluid are considered as follows 63 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 015 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in table 7 the highest frequency is related to the four edge clamped boundary conditions and the lowest frequency is related to the three edge simply supported and one edge free boundary conditions the effect of fluid depth side to thickness ratio length to width aspect ratio and the porosity coefficient on the system s natural frequencies will be discussed below 4 4 the effect of fluid depth fig 6 shows the changes in the dimensionless natural frequency ω of the fgp plate based on the changes in the fluid depth this figure shows how the dimensionless natural frequency changes for three boundary conditions of cccc scsc and ssss and three different types of porosity distribution in this example the plate is made of berea sandstone the porosity coefficient is considered to be e 0 0 5 other dimensional specifications for this case are as follows 64 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 1 c a 10 as shown in fig 6 as the fluid depth ratio increases the dimensionless natural frequency for all three boundary conditions of cccc scsc and ssss and all three types of porosity distribution decreases so that the lowest natural frequency is obtained when the tank is completely filled 4 5 the effect of side to thickness ratio the diagrams in fig 7 show the changes in the fundamental natural frequency hz of the fgp plate in contact with fluid with respect to the side to thickness ratio in this figure the results are presented for three different types of boundary conditions namely cccc cccf and scsf and for three different types of porosity distribution in addition fig 8 shows the changes in the first four dimensional frequencies of the plate with ssss boundary conditions versus side to thickness ratio it should be noted that due to the thickness parameter h in the relations provided for the dimensionless frequencies introduced in eqs 58 and 59 the results presented in this case are dimensional this allows for accurate comparison of frequencies between plates with different thicknesses the plates considered in figs 7 and 8 are made of berea sandstone other specifications of the plates are as follows 65 a 1 m b 1 m e 0 0 5 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in figs 7 and 8 as the side to thickness ratio increases the natural frequency of the plate decreases in other words as the thickness of the plate reduces the overall stiffness of the plate decreases and consequently the natural frequency of the plate decreases in addition it is clear that the plate with cccc boundary conditions has the highest natural frequency 4 6 the effect of aspect ratio fig 9 represents the first four modes of dimensionless natural frequencies ω of the fgp plate in contact with the fluid for different aspect length to width ratio the boundary conditions of the plate are ssss and in this example the plate is made of berea sandstone other dimensional specifications of fluid and plate are as follows 66 e 0 0 5 h a 0 1 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in fig 9 as the aspect ratio of the fgp plate increases dimensionless natural frequencies ω for all three types of porosity distributions decrease this means that the plate with larger aspect ratio has smaller frequencies 4 7 the effect of porosity coefficient table 8 represents the first six dimensionless frequencies of fgp plate with scsc boundary conditions the results of three types of porosity distributions for different values of porosity coefficient are presented in table 8 in this example the plate is made of al and other specifications for the plate are as follows 67 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 1 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 it can be inferred from table 8 that if all the parameters are the same the dimensionless natural frequencies of fgp plates in contact with fluid are the highest for the type 1 of porosity distribution and the lowest for the type 3 further for the plate with scsc boundary conditions when the porosity distribution is of type 2 or type 3 an increase in the porosity coefficient leads to a decrease in dimensionless natural frequency however in case that porosity distribution is of the type 1 by increasing the porosity coefficient the frequency first decreases and then increases the reason for this trend is that in the symmetric type of porosity distribution with increasing porosity coefficient stiffness and inertia of the cross section of the plate decreases but when the porosity coefficient exceeds a certain value the rate of reduction in the stiffness resulting from the increase in the porosity coefficient is lower that of inertia similar trend have been reported in zhao et al 2019 and wattanasakulpong et al 2018 4 8 the mode shapes fig 10 shows the first twelve vibrational mode shapes of the fgp plate ssss in contact with fluid in this figure the length and width of the plate is taken to be 1 m and the fluid depth is 0 5 m porosity distribution is of type 2 and the plate is made of berea sandstone as shown in this figure due to the interaction of fluid and structure the shape of the modes are asymmetric unlike the case without the presence of fluid in fact the effect of fluid on the kinetic energy of the plate makes the mode shapes of the plate in contact with the fluid to be different from the mode shapes of the plate without the presence of fluid moreover fig 11 shows the first twelve vibrational modes of the fgp plate with cscf boundary conditions in contact with the fluid except the boundary conditions the other physical characteristics for this case are similar to those of fig 10 fig 11 clearly shows the effect of the interaction of fluid and plate on the vibrational mode shapes of the plate in general the presence of fluid in contact with the plate creates asymmetrical mode shapes in the plate and this effect becomes more pronounced for the higher modes 5 conclusion this study examined the free vibrations of fgp plates in contact with bounded fluid the kinetic energy and strain energy of the plate were calculated using first order shear deformation theory the fluid was assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational and its velocity potential functions were obtained by using boundary and compatibility conditions using the rayleigh ritz method and the two variable orthogonal polynomials the natural frequencies and mode shapes were obtained the validity of the results was confirmed through comparison with the results of previous researches the effect of different system parameters on the natural frequency of the plate for three different porosity distribution modes was also investigated the results of this study can be summarized as follows the natural frequencies of fgp plates are affected by the fluid depth as the latter increases the frequency decreases so the lowest frequency is attained when the tank is completely filled in with fluid as the side to thickness ratio of the fgp plate increases the natural frequency decreases in other words as the thickness of the plate decreases the natural frequency decreases the natural frequency of the fgp plate in contact with fluid depends on the aspect length to width ratio of the plate and its value decreases as the aspect ratio increases the type of porosity distribution of the fgp plate affects its natural frequency so that the highest natural frequency is related to the uneven symmetrical porosity distribution while the lowest natural frequency corresponds to the evenly distribution as a basic parameter determining the density and distribution of pores the porosity coefficient affects the natural frequency of the fgp plate for all of the three types of porosity distribution the existence of fluid around the plate causes change in the overall effective mass of the system and as a result the presence of fluid in contact with the plate affects the mode shapes of the plate and creates asymmetrical mode shapes in the plate in addition the deflection response can be affected by the depth ratio depending on the selected mode shapes credit authorship contribution statement sajjad riahi farsani conceptualization methodology software validation writing

the dimensionless natural frequency ω of the plate made of functionally graded porous material with porosity distribution of type 2 with the results of previous researches zhao et al 2019 and rezaei and saidi 2015 zhao et al 2019 examined the free vibrations of fgp plate and used virtual springs to model the system boundaries rezai et al rezaei and saidi 2015 provided an exact solution to obtain the natural frequencies of a rectangular plate made of functionally graded materials table 5 presents the results for the plate made of berea sandstone with the following data 61 a 0 5 m b 1 m h a 0 1

type 3 with the results of zhao et al 2019 table 5 presents the results for the plate made of al with the following data 62 a 1 m b 1 m a n d h a 0 15 as shown in tables 4 6 the results of the current method for the plate natural frequencies are in excellent agreement with the known results for plates made of functionally graded materials and isotropic plates in contact with fluid 4 3 results of dimensionless frequency for different boundary conditions table 7 contains the first six dimensionless frequencies ω of the fgp plate in contact with fluid this table shows the results for different boundary conditions and various types of porosity distribution the plate is made of berea sandstone and the porosity coefficient is 0 5 e 0 0 5 further the plate dimensions and depth of the fluid are considered as follows 63 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 015 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in table 7 the highest frequency is related to the four edge clamped boundary conditions and the lowest frequency is related to the three edge simply supported and one edge free boundary conditions the effect of fluid depth side to thickness ratio length to width aspect ratio and the porosity coefficient on the system s natural frequencies will be discussed below 4 4 the effect of fluid depth fig 6 shows the changes in the dimensionless natural frequency ω of the fgp plate based on the changes in the fluid depth this figure shows how the dimensionless natural frequency changes for three boundary conditions of cccc scsc and ssss and three different types of porosity distribution in this example the plate is made of berea sandstone the porosity coefficient is considered to be e 0 0 5 other dimensional specifications for this case are as follows 64 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 1 c a 10 as shown in fig 6 as the fluid depth ratio increases the dimensionless natural frequency for all three boundary conditions of cccc scsc and ssss and all three types of porosity distribution decreases so that the lowest natural frequency is obtained when the tank is completely filled 4 5 the effect of side to thickness ratio the diagrams in fig 7 show the changes in the fundamental natural frequency hz of the fgp plate in contact with fluid with respect to the side to thickness ratio in this figure the results are presented for three different types of boundary conditions namely cccc cccf and scsf and for three different types of porosity distribution in addition fig 8 shows the changes in the first four dimensional frequencies of the plate with ssss boundary conditions versus side to thickness ratio it should be noted that due to the thickness parameter h in the relations provided for the dimensionless frequencies introduced in eqs 58 and 59 the results presented in this case are dimensional this allows for accurate comparison of frequencies between plates with different thicknesses the plates considered in figs 7 and 8 are made of berea sandstone other specifications of the plates are as follows 65 a 1 m b 1 m e 0 0 5 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in figs 7 and 8 as the side to thickness ratio increases the natural frequency of the plate decreases in other words as the thickness of the plate reduces the overall stiffness of the plate decreases and consequently the natural frequency of the plate decreases in addition it is clear that the plate with cccc boundary conditions has the highest natural frequency 4 6 the effect of aspect ratio fig 9 represents the first four modes of dimensionless natural frequencies ω of the fgp plate in contact with the fluid for different aspect length to width ratio the boundary conditions of the plate are ssss and in this example the plate is made of berea sandstone other dimensional specifications of fluid and plate are as follows 66 e 0 0 5 h a 0 1 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 as shown in fig 9 as the aspect ratio of the fgp plate increases dimensionless natural frequencies ω for all three types of porosity distributions decrease this means that the plate with larger aspect ratio has smaller frequencies 4 7 the effect of porosity coefficient table 8 represents the first six dimensionless frequencies of fgp plate with scsc boundary conditions the results of three types of porosity distributions for different values of porosity coefficient are presented in table 8 in this example the plate is made of al and other specifications for the plate are as follows 67 a 1 m b 1 m h a 0 1 c a 10 a n d d a 0 5 it can be inferred from table 8 that if all the parameters are the same the dimensionless natural frequencies of fgp plates in contact with fluid are the highest for the type 1 of porosity distribution and the lowest for the type 3 further for the plate with scsc boundary conditions when the porosity distribution is of type 2 or type 3 an increase in the porosity coefficient leads to a decrease in dimensionless natural frequency however in case that porosity distribution is of the type 1 by increasing the porosity coefficient the frequency first decreases and then increases the reason for this trend is that in the symmetric type of porosity distribution with increasing porosity coefficient stiffness and inertia of the cross section of the plate decreases but when the porosity coefficient exceeds a certain value the rate of reduction in the stiffness resulting from the increase in the porosity coefficient is lower that of inertia similar trend have been reported in zhao et al 2019 and wattanasakulpong et al 2018 4 8 the mode shapes fig 10 shows the first twelve vibrational mode shapes of the fgp plate ssss in contact with fluid in this figure the length and width of the plate is taken to be 1 m and the fluid depth is 0 5 m porosity distribution is of type 2 and the plate is made of berea sandstone as shown in this figure due to the interaction of fluid and structure the shape of the modes are asymmetric unlike the case without the presence of fluid in fact the effect of fluid on the kinetic energy of the plate makes the mode shapes of the plate in contact with the fluid to be different from the mode shapes of the plate without the presence of fluid moreover fig 11 shows the first twelve vibrational modes of the fgp plate with cscf boundary conditions in contact with the fluid except the boundary conditions the other physical characteristics for this case are similar to those of fig 10 fig 11 clearly shows the effect of the interaction of fluid and plate on the vibrational mode shapes of the plate in general the presence of fluid in contact with the plate creates asymmetrical mode shapes in the plate and this effect becomes more pronounced for the higher modes 5 conclusion this study examined the free vibrations of fgp plates in contact with bounded fluid the kinetic energy and strain energy of the plate were calculated using first order shear deformation theory the fluid was assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational and its velocity potential functions were obtained by using boundary and compatibility conditions using the rayleigh ritz method and the two variable orthogonal polynomials the natural frequencies and mode shapes were obtained the validity of the results was confirmed through comparison with the results of previous researches the effect of different system parameters on the natural frequency of the plate for three different porosity distribution modes was also investigated the results of this study can be summarized as follows the natural frequencies of fgp plates are affected by the fluid depth as the latter increases the frequency decreases so the lowest frequency is attained when the tank is completely filled in with fluid as the side to thickness ratio of the fgp plate increases the natural frequency decreases in other words as the thickness of the plate decreases the natural frequency decreases the natural frequency of the fgp plate in contact with fluid depends on the aspect length to width ratio of the plate and its value decreases as the aspect ratio increases the type of porosity distribution of the fgp plate affects its natural frequency so that the highest natural frequency is related to the uneven symmetrical porosity distribution while the lowest natural frequency corresponds to the evenly distribution as a basic parameter determining the density and distribution of pores the porosity coefficient affects the natural frequency of the fgp plate for all of the three types of porosity distribution the existence of fluid around the plate causes change in the overall effective mass of the system and as a result the presence of fluid in contact with the plate affects the mode shapes of the plate and creates asymmetrical mode shapes in the plate in addition the deflection response can be affected by the depth ratio depending on the selected mode shapes credit authorship contribution statement sajjad riahi farsani conceptualization methodology software validation writing

21242,this paper employed a direct urans cfd based approach to investigate the speed loss and waterjet performance for a waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested head waves firstly a reasonable quantity of linear superposed regular waves was validated to simulate the realistic ocean wave adopted on the ittc directional wave spectrum then the wave parameters were applied to the urans cfd simulations to avoid the wave reflection due to structures and to narrow the simulation domain the euler overlay method eom based wave forcing zone was defined in the outer domain the time history of the wave elevation and the wave patterns matched well with the theoretical results moreover by employing the pid controller and body force method the 1 30 scale waterjet propelled trimaran free running numerical model was validated through the trimaran model tests eventually the free running simulations in short crested head waves of the trimaran were performed considering the effects of sea state traveling speed and wind respectively the added resistance in short crested waves was mainly caused by the pitch and heave variation and lead to the speed loss and waterjet performance deterioration notable the wind induced speed loss could account for nearly one half of the total while the wind speed exceeds the vessel speed the proposed approach of direct evaluating the traveling and propulsion performance in short crested waves shows reasonable results and practical value keywords speed loss waterjet performance short crested head waves euler overlay method pid controller free running model 1 introduction for the ship resistance and propulsion performance the traditional ship design mainly focuses on these performances in calm water conditions however when the vessel traveling in the wave condition the added resistance more shaft power requirement speed loss and slamming have become a concern for ship designers the added resistance in waves is one of the essential contents of sea keeping research which directly lead to the speed loss affect the propulsion performance and cause loss of ship operation performance and economic benefits as an essential role in the standard regulation the speed reduction coefficient f w proposed in the energy efficiency design index eedi imo 2011 has typically been assumed as a constant value of 1 0 at the ship design stage however the actual value of f w affects the eedi calculation directly which lead to the requirement of more evaluation method for f w after then in 2013 imo put forward another essential interim guideline for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the maneuverability of ships under adverse conditions imo 2013 which requires the calculation of the added resistance under adverse conditions the above regulations indeed guide researches putting more focus on ship performance in waves in fact plenty of research works has been done in the last half century before the regulations officially put forward the added resistance and ship motions in waves are mainly adopted on two methods the cfd method including the potential theory based cfd and viscous cfd and experimental method since mauro 1960 firstly used the far field method to compute the added resistance based on the momentum conservation theory more researchers put forward and enhance the method joosen 1966 newman 1967 kashiwagi et al 2010 more applicable methods based on the potential theory were carried out for investigating the 2d strip theory applications salvesen et al 1970 added resistance due to wave reflection fujii and takahashi 1975 and the near field method applications joncquez 2009 with the rapid development of high performance computation hpc the viscous cfd based techniques have been widely used in the added resistance calculation orihara and miyata 2003 hosseini et al 2013 which has the advantages of considering viscous effects large motions high sea state slamming and green water in recent few years the added resistance and speed loss in waves were researched in more detail wu et al 2011 performed the investigation of a rans cfd based simulations of a high speed trimaran barehull model in regular waves the calculated attitudes and added resistance matched well with the experiment results luo et al 2016 used the panel method for calculating added resistance in regular waves and cfd approach for wind resistance then evaluate the speed loss by either nmri approach or h e p method kim et al kim et al 2017a investigated the wave reflection reduction effects from the bow for the modified kvlcc2 ship model in different regular head waves using the urans method and the modified hull form receives about 8 energy saving in sea state 5 conditions considering the realistic sea conditions with irregular random waves and winds firstly kim et al 2017b validated the capability of 2 d 3 d potential methods and urans cfd tool to calculate the added resistance and motions in regular waves then applied the 2 d linear potential method in the calculation of mean added resistance in irregular waves based on the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum meanwhile the added resistance due to wind was taking into account based on the blendermann chart finally the added resistance speed loss and sea margins were evaluated riesner and ould 2018 researched the wave induced added resistance of a container ship and kvlcc2 tanker with a forward speed in regular head waves using the nonlinear time domain rankine source method the radiation and diffraction effects considering the empirical method based viscous effect and the varied wetted surface were numerically researched and compared with the rans cfd based results and experimental results which validated the applicability of the method in added resistance prediction for the proppulsion factors research moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1975 both did the well designed experimental tests to research how the wave parameters affected the propulsion factors bhattacharyya and steen 2014 did a comprehensive experimental study for a 120 m cargo ship with the open ducted propeller in waves where the open propeller shows less influence in waves and the thrust deduction fraction is found to be independent of propeller loading in a broad range of loadings sigmund and el moctar 2017 have done both the experimental and rans cfd based numerical investigation on a single and a twin screw ship to research the effects of head waves to the propulsion performance where all the deviation of the computed propeller forces are with 5 the numerical method was validated to be capable of investigating the propulsion behavior of a ship in regular head waves base on the experimental results taskar et al 2019 recently performed the simulations to research the effect of varying propulsion factor due to waves in the simulated realistic wave conditions where the varied range from 12 to 4 for the energy consuming due to the changes of propulsion factors in waves was reported in general most researches on the added resistance and speed loss in waves are based on the resistance results in the specified regular waves to evaluate the mean added resistance in irregular waves using the wave spectrum while the potential theory based method is lack of the real viscous effect consideration or using the empirical estimation approach instead the viscous cfd based method takes the fully nonlinear and viscous effects into account but the wave generation wave absorbing technology and the time cost in huge computation cases becomes the primary challenge in the present research we proposed a directly urans cfd based approach for the added resistance and speed loss evaluation in a realistic ocean environment firstly the wave generation and absorbing method for the short crested irregular waves are described in detail and are validated by comparing with the results in theory then to realize the directly traveling speed control in a limited simulation domain the pid controlled free running numerical model was applied on a waterjet propelled trimaran model where the barehull bh and self propulsion sp simulations were in good agreement with the model test results finally we performed the direct simulations on the trimaran free running model in short crested head waves with the considering of the sea state effects speed effects and wind effects for the added resistance and speed loss evaluation the primary evaluation process is displayed in fig 1 2 basic theory 2 1 3 d directional propagation wave model the realistic random wave ma et al 2015 is mostly the short crested irregular waves and the direction of the waves is multi directional and it is irregular in time and space the short crested wave can be regarded as an irregular wave system formed by superimposing a plurality of micro simple harmonics with different frequencies different directions different amplitudes and random phases the wave evaluation at the position x y in space at time t can be expressed as 1 η i 1 m j 1 n a i j cos ω i t k i x cos θ j k i y sin θ j ε i j where a ij and ε i j is the wave amplitude and random phase of the single regular wave with the i frequency and the j direction ω i and k i is the angular frequency and wavenumber θ j denotes the j wave direction m and n is the total number of the wave frequency and the wave direction the three dimensional short crested wave was defined by the directional wave spectrum s ω θ which was satisfied with the following equations 2 i 1 m j 1 n a i j 2 2 π π 0 s ω θ d ω d θ 3 s ω θ s ω d ω θ where s ω and d ω θ is the wave spectrum and directional diffusion function and θ denotes the wave propagation direction in present work to build the real time ocean random waves environment the ittc directional wave spectrum was used to complete the wave spectrum simulations the main equations of the ittc wave spectrum model were as follows 4 s ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 5 d ω θ 2 π cos 2 θ θ 0 where h 1 3 and t 1 is significant wave height and average period θ 0 is wave direction of the main wave and θ π 2 π 2 in real time wave simulations usually the equi energy divided method eem or equi frequency divided method efm is used to simulate the spectrum and the three dimensional directional spectrum is simulated by a single summation method or a double summation method in this paper the spectral energy and direction angle is divided by the equal division method and the wave simulation is performed by the double summation method assuming that most of the energy distribution of the target spectrum is in the range of the frequency ω 1 ω n for the equi frequency divided method the frequency in the range is equally divided into m intervals and for the equi enegy divided method the spectrum energy in the range is equally divided into m intervals the wave propagation angle is divided into 2n intervals in pi 2 pi 2 the simulated frequency takes the center frequency of each boundary point and the boundary point angles are taken as the simulation angles in all directions 6 ω

area the corresponding frequency boundary for the i th division spectrum area and the corresponding frequency boundary for the i th division frequency range the wave elevation of each component is expressed as 7 a i j 2 s ω i θ j δ ω δ θ cos θ j θ 0 2 s ω i δ ω n e q u i f r e q u e n c y m e t h o d a i j 2 s ω i θ j δ ω δ θ cos θ j θ 0 2 e 0 m n e q u i e n e r g y m e t h o d where for the wave amplitude a ij to avoid the partial attenuation due to viscous and mesh distribution we could multiply a coefficient k a that slightly larger than 1 in the practical rans cfd simulations present paper takes the coefficient k a 1 10 the total wave elevation of the three dimensional shorted crested wave and the time history equation of the total superposition velocity field are as follows 8 ϕ i

elimination of structural reflection waves are critical to the success of numerical simulations often determining the success or failure of numerical simulation in the past most of the methods used are damping wave elimination source term clipping and combining the coarse mesh in the downstream of the wave making region to eliminate the wave at the same time in order to make the wave eliminating effect and the flow field simulation effect around the structure good enough it needs to widen and lengthen the simulation domain which brings a large increase in overall grids and calculation cost the thought of euler overlay method eom was proposed by kim et al 2011 who used the potential theory based solution for the far field wave condition and solved the ns equations around the near field in a finite element method fem cfd simulations the gap between the far field theory solution and the near field current solution was applied as a body force source term to transit in the blending area after the successful attempt kim et al 2012 applied eom to the finite volume method fvm viscous cfd field the load response of a vertical cylinder in a steep wave is simulated the results show that the method successfully simulates the wave loads and wave breaking effects in accordance with the experimental results when the computational domain of viscous cfd is significantly reduced the computational domain length of numerical simulation is 2 m and the experimental flume length is 105 m perić and abdel maksoud 2015 2016 2018 continuously did a series of research on the wave reflection and absorbing problems in free surface flow simulations to improve the eom based force wave damping module which is included in the software siemens star ccm fig 2 shows the eom based computational domain of the numerical wave tank eom applied the source term to the forcing zone forcing the current fvm cfd solution towards the theoretical solution from the specified inner boundary to the outer boundary the added source term applied in the forcing zone for the solution of the transport equation is as follows 10 q φ γ d x φ r e f φ where γ is the forcing strength d x is the distribution function of the source term over the domain x represents the distance from the inner boundary to the outer boundary φ r e f and φ are the reference theoretical solution and current solution the distribution function d x mainly has five expressions the constant the linear the quadratic the trigonometric and the exponential perić and abdel maksoud 2015 star ccm software applied the following cosine squared function to transit the gap of the two solutions in equation 10 11 d x cos 2 π x 2 where x x d i is the non dimensional distance d i is the distance from the inner boundary to the corresponding outer boundary perić and abdel maksoud 2016 researched how the distance d i affect the generation of regular and irregular waves and in engineering practice the typical range of 2 λ d i λ in regular wave and d i λ p in irregular wave are suggested where λ and λ p is the wave length and typical wave length 2 3 pid controller for hull speed maintenance in free running simulations the thrust from the propulsor i e propeller or waterjet pump drives the vessel moving ahead the arising resistance slows the ship to maintain the forward speed the ship requires a feedback controller for heading speed by employing the proportional integral pi speed controller carrica et al 2008 did the direct overset free running simulations on propulsor appended ship model to research the broaching event in irregular waves then performed the direct maneuvering simulations carrica et al 2016 both the simulations received consistent results moreover wang et al 2016 2018 also verified the applicability of the pi controller in free running model simulations in the present research a fully developed proportion integration differentiation pid controller was applied to the propulsor by controlling the propulsor revolution the target traveling speed could be achieved similarly for the barehull model simulations the pid controller also could be adopted for the towing force to balance the resistance the target pid controller equation for the two simulations is expressed as follows 12 n p f d p n e i n 0 t e d t d n d e d t p n v 0 v t n i n i 2 t n v 0 v i 2 v i 1 2 δ t d n a where n p is the propulsor revolution applied in the sp model simulations the unit is rpm 1 m or rps 1 s f d is the towing force in bh model resistance simulations a is the speed acceleration tn is the total iterations at the simulated time t and δt is the time step the error term is e v 0 v v 0 v tn and v i are the target hull speed the hull speed at simulated time t and the hull speed at the

been widely used in dealing with the propulsion modeling problems in cfd simulations of self propulsion sakamoto et al 2013 and maneuvering broglia et al 2013 which adopts the actuator disk concept and validated to contribute to time saving and lower computational cost under the reasonable accuracy in general the bfm is applied to the propeller region to replace the rotational propeller a cylindrical virtual disks are created with the same dimensions as the propeller in the rotational region the force radially distributed over each virtual disk follows the goldstein optimum and is expressed as star ccm 2018 13 f b t 105 ρ n 2 d p 4 k t 8 π t 3 r h 4 r r r h r 1 r 14 f b q 105 ρ n 2 d p 5 k q 8 π t 3 r h 4 r r r h r 1 r r 15 r r r h r r h where f bt and f bq are the axial and

revolution and propeller diameter k t and k q are the coefficients of thrust and torque of the propeller which are obtained from the open water test or numerical calculation 3 numerical model and validations 3 1 the simulation of short crested wave in rans cfd 3 1 1 convergence analysis of the wave parameters a large number of experimental observations show that the total instantaneous value distribution of wave surface elevation belongs to the normal distribution according to probability theory if the instantaneous value distribution of a random variable obeys normal distribution the amplitude of the variable obeys rayleigh distribution then the statistical characteristics of waves can be calculated according to the following formulas 16 m q 0 ω q s ω d ω h 1 3 4 m 0 t 1 2 π m 0 m 1 where m q q 0 1 is the q order moments for the specified frequency spectrum energy partitions numbers m and the wave propagation angle numbers 2n we could get the convergence target wave parameters with different m and n from equation 16 in the present research the main wave direction θ 0 0 the target short crested head wave parameters are as shown in table 1 h 1 3 0 04 m t 1 0 82 s h 1 3 0 08 m t 1 1 25 s h 1 3 0 12 m t 1 1 5 s the convergence process for the three waves is as displayed in figs 3 4 as the wave propagation angle is symmetrically distributed around the main head wave direction the division partitions 2n is without effects on the wave parameters from equation 16 the partitions 2n is set as 10 to get the convenient partitions m the frequency range is broad enough for both the three target waves from 1 0r ad s to 20 0 rad s the convergence process of m in fig 3 a c shows that the wave height h 1 3 both get stable from the partitions m 20 for the equi energy method eem and equi frequency method efm with the relative error that less than 2 however fig 3 b d demonstrate that the period t 1 of the sea state ii and iii does not fulfill the target requirements both the convergence value is lower than the targets with the relative difference about 6 and 9 to simulate the target waves with the convergence partitions m we should find the suitable simulation frequency range ω 1 ω n to match the target period t 1 within the reasonable error the suitable lower frequency limit ω 1 is chosen for the sea state i ii and iii as 1 0 2 0 and 3 5 and the convergence process of ω n is displayed in fig 4 we can see that the simulated spectrum frequency range ω 1 ω n is the main reason to affects the wave period under the specified frequency spectrum energy partitions m for the present partitions m 20 the upper frequency limit ω n of the sea state i ii and iii are converged to 16 0 rad s 11 0 rad s and 10 0 rad s for the both eem and efm simulations as shown in fig 4 b d meanwhile fig 4 a c display that the significant wave height h 1 3 of both simulated waves meet the target value well except for the sea state iii in eem simulation where there is a slight difference between the simulation value and target one but the relative error of 3 is an acceptable difference for the practical simulation upon the above convergence analysis of the simulated frequency spectrum energy partitions m and the simulated frequency range ω 1 ω n we confirm that the partitions m 20 and the frequency range 3 5 rad s 16 0 rad s 2 0 rad s 11 0 rad s and 1 0 rad s 10 rad s for the sea state i ii and iii are the reasonable simulated wave parameters the final simulation parameters and the relative error are listed in table 2 the maximum relative error of the significant height is 1 3 and 3 6 for the efm and eem and that of the period is 1 6 and 1 8 for the efm and eem though the relative error of the eem is larger than efm considering both the errors are in an acceptable range for practical application and the simulation frequencies of the eem focus on the frequency peak region which divide the wave spectrum more reasonable the eem based wave parameters are chosen for the short crested head waves simulation 3 1 2 validation of the simulated short crested waves in rans cfd the rans cfd simulations are carried out on the star ccm platform the computational domain is a 4 5l pp 3 0l pp 1 5l pp cube as shown in fig 5 the origin is located at the center of the domain with a distance of 2 0l pp away from the outlet boundary and the present l pp is set as 4 m for the target ship model scale the inlet side up and bottom boundaries are set as the velocity inlet boundary condition and the outlet is set as the pressure outlet boundary condition furthermore the eom based wave forcing boundary condition is applied in the inlet side and outlet area to simulate the target short crested wave the linear superposition wave with about 200 component regular waves is generated based on the equi energy method and applied to the inlet velocity boundary condition all the component wave parameters in rans cfd simulations are kept the same with that of in the theory simulations including the random phases the vof method is applied to capture the free surface the widely used and validated sst k ω turbulent model is chosen to close the rans equations and simple algorithm for pressure velocity coupling second order in space schemes and second order implicit scheme in time are used to discretize the governing equations to verify the effect of short crested wave simulations the following four elevation gauges are set up in the computation domain p1 2 0l pp 0 0 p2 0 0 0 p3 0 0 25l pp 0 and p4 0 1 0l pp 0 the grid independence is carried out based on three sets of mesh the coarse mesh the medium mesh and the fine mesh and the mesh size within the wave elevation range in the z direction is set as 1 20 of the significant wave height for the fine mesh the mesh is generated by the trimmed volume mesh tool taking the sea state ii as an example the rans cfd simulations are compared with the theory simulations where fig 5 shows the four gauge points wave elevation time history curves of sea state ii with different grid densities the three grids of density are 0 6 m 1 0 m and 1 7 m from fig 6 it can be seen that the trend and fluctuation amplitude of the time history curve under three grid densities at points p1 and p4 keeps the same and the enlarged region from 15s to 20s shows more obvious differences between the grids where the fine grid shows the least error of within 5 compared with the theoretical curves meanwhile the wave elevation discrepancy in fig 7 is more obvious than that of in fig 6 the simulated wave peak and trough of rans cfd with different grids show a slight delay compared to the theoretical simulated value and fluctuate and according to the different grid density the delay times vary with 0 0 1s moreover the wave elevation of p2 and p3 have a slight attenuation in some wave peak and trough in summary the four gauges both show well matched time history curves with the elevation variation in theory simulation and the fine mesh obtains the relative better simulation results the eom forcing wave boundary conditions on the boundary of side outlet and inlet maintains the wave elevation of the wave forcing domain to agree with the theoretical results considering the viscous effect and turbulent dissipation in urans cfd the relative errors between the two methods is inevitable such as the wave peak errors of p1 and p4 point are less than 5 under fine grids for points p2 and p3 in the middle of the computational domain there is a delay of less than 0 1s relative to the wave elevation in theory the delay is related to the effect of grid density and viscous hysteresis and fine grids contribute to the least delay fig 8 shows the short crested wave patterns comparison between the fine grids simulation and the theoretical results at t 5 0s 15 0s and 25 0s when t 5s there is a wave trough area of about 0 3l pp 0 3l pp near the point p2 and p3 in theoretical simulation both points are located in the blue represented area while the corresponding trough domain in rans cfd results is relatively small and the area near the point p3 is a non blue domain which means the simulation error occurs this difference corresponds to the distribution of the wave heights of the curves in fig 7 at 5s for point p1 and p4 the wave trough area near point p1 is about 0 15l pp 0 15l pp fig 9 is the spectrum results of the four gauges p1 p4 coincide with the time history comparison results of fig 6 p1 and p4 of the three density grids both show the well matched frequency characteristics with the theory spectrum even the relative high frequency component around 1 7 hz is also been captured for the gauges p2 and p3 as some peaks and troughs are not well fitted the cfd simulated high frequency part get lost compared with the theory as shown in fig 9 c d apart from that the main frequency characteristics between 0 5 hz and 1 0 hz are in good agreement with the theoretical results the simulation results of rans cfd fine grids are consistent with the theoretical simulation results in general the peak and trough of short peak wave simulated by viscous urans cfd method based on ittc two parameter spectrum are slightly smaller than those simulated by theory and the overall distribution of wave surface time is consistent with the trend of change the comparison results show that the convergence analysis of short crested wave parameters and the corresponding wave simulations based on the viscous cfd method achieve an acceptable real random wave environment 3 2 barehull and free running model validation the free running model with pid controlled and bfm replaced propulsor is validated through a 1 30 scaled waterjet propelled trimaran ship model which is driven by three sets of waterjet units table 3 lists the main dimensions of the target ship the trimaran resistance model test was conducted with the closed intakes and jets in cssrc china ship scientific research center towing tank where covers region of 470 m 15 m 7 m with the maximum towing speed of 15 m s and the measurement uncertainty is less than 1 after then the free running sp model test was carried out at fr 0 30 in a lake with still open waters the two model tests are as illustrated in fig 10 unlike the towing tank test the free running test has not any tow force added on the hull so the present sp test is actually running the model scale sp point and the following free running simulations at fr 0 30 are based on this model scale sp point 3 2 1 verification and validation methodology in finite volume method based cfd it is necessary to perform the v v verification and validation procedures roy et al 2013 defined the refinement ratio r g as it relates to the total grids number while using the trimmed volume grids the grids of the calculation region in three coordinate directions are uniformly refined the refinement ratio r of 3d simulation is expressed as 17 r g n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 3 where n fine and n coarse is the total grids number of the specified density generally at least three sets of grid density are required to analyze the grid convergence s 1 s 2 and s 3 represent the computational results of fine medium and coarse grid density then the convergence ratio is given as 18 r g s 1 s 2 s 2 s 3 for monotonic convergence 0 r g 1 the estimated order of accuracy p re and the distance metric to the

the body force model based on eqs 13 and 14 the waterjet rotor is assumed as a kind of traditional individual propeller in the waterjet duct then by solving the kt kq curve of the waterjet rotor and applying it into the virtual disk pump region the interactions with the rest part of the waterjet pump system and the hull could be simulated and the flow rate of the waterjet nozzle and forces of each part in the virtual control volume could be obtained eslamdoost and vikström 2019 recently researched three different body force implementations in waterjet pump simulation using bfm the body force model that kept the guide vanes and removed the impeller blades showed an apparent advantage in cost effective and accuracy compared with the mrf moving reference frame method sliding mesh method and the other body force models although the specified expressions of the axial and tangential forces in eqs 13 and 14 are not the same with the eslamdoost s both of them are one of the many body force models the cos effective advantage could be obtained both for the two models for the present work the stator is also kept in simulations to absorb the rotation flow energy and to ensure the flow uniform fig 11 shows the waterjet rotor geometry and the simulation domain for the computational of the open water performance characteristic curves where the waterjet duct surface is excluded the rotor diameter d r 49 mm to get the converged open water performance curves three sets of different density grids with the number of 2 60 m 1 75 m and 0 85 m are generated the prism layer thickness is set as 0 5 mm with 6 layers and a growth factor of 1 5 and the y value of the rotor surface is around 1 the steady numerical simulation uses the sst k ω turbulence model and the near wall flow field is solved by the two layer all y method the rotor revolution is kept as the fixed value of 7920 rpm as the same with the trimaran free running model test by setting a series of inlet velocity the k t and k q curves with different j could be obtained the open water hydrodynamic performance curves of the three different grids density are displayed in fig 12 from the η k t and 10k q curves comparison it is demonstrated that with the grids number increasing the difference between the computed value is decreasing and except for the values of j 0 05 all the computed convergence ratio r g in eq 18 is less than 1 which means the simulation results is monotonically converged finally the fine mesh results is used in bfm for the free running trimaran numerical model and the fine mesh open water hydrodynamic performance results also has been applied in the recent researches zhang et al 2019 2020 3 2 3 barehull and self propulsion simulations three different density of grids coarse medium and fine were generated to proceed with v v of the free running bh and sp simulations the fully appended trimaran geometry model used in simulations is illustrated in fig 13 a b the urans cfd simulation model uses the background field in section 3 1 2 creates a relatively small motion domain around the hull the mesh distribution is displayed in fig 13 c the local refined mesh is generated among the free surface elevation range and around the hull motion domain the prism layer is set with 6 layers with a growth factor of 1 414 and the prism layer thickness is 2 cm 1 5 cm and 1 0 cm for the hull speed fr 0 30 0 45 0 60 respectively which ensure the y value of the hull surface is less than 100 the numerical simulation uses the sst turbulence model the near wall flow field is solved by the two layer all y method and the vof method is applied to track and capture the free surface rigid body motions are released in pitch heave and surge using the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi scheme for the free running model and the pid controller was applied in the rotor revolution controlling for trimaran speed maintenance accounting for the lower computation cost the bfm method with the input open water curves of the real propeller is applied in the rotational region compared with the traditional sp simulation which needs at least three calculations to obtain the sp point using the interpolation between the drag and thrust curves the free running model with the pid controller could get the accurate converged sp point in once simulation the pid coefficient terms p n i n and d n of eq 12 are set as 5 0e2 5 0e2 and 4 0 respectively in the trimaran barehull simulations moreover for the sp simulations the three terms are set as 1 5e5 3 0e5 and 8 0e2 generally the pid coefficient terms are easy to get a suitable scope manually at the beginning of the simulation and the coefficients have not noticeable effect on the convergence speed as the pid feedback could make the target force or revolution reach a relative stable fluctuation within just 3s or fewer fig 14 a b illustrate the barehull resistance and traveling speed convergence process of different grids simulations at fr 0 3 the rapidly converged curves indicate both the three simulations got converged in a few seconds which compared with the model test result the barehull resistance errors are 6 02 4 17 3 01 for the coarse grids medium grids and fine grids respectively for the free running sp simulation results as shown in fig 14 c d the hull speed rapidly dropped down due to the increased resistance meanwhile the self adapted rotor reached a high revolution to speed up the trimaran with zero seconds with the trimaran speed up to the target value v 0 1 88 m s in 3 s the rotor revolution and hull speed curves tend to fluctuate slightly around the convergence value compared with the rotor revolution result of 7920 rpm in the free running model test the coarse mesh medium mesh and fine mesh get the comparison error of 4 42 3 11 and 2 15 respectively meanwhile the grid uncertainty analysis as described in section 3 2 1 was performed the fine density grids show accuracy advantage both in barehull and sp simulations which obtain the grid uncertainty of 5 06 and 4 54 for the barehull resistance and rotor revolution as listed in table 4 indicates that the fine grids simulations are favorable with the model test results the iterative uncertainty ui is generally assumed as the minor term compared with the grid uncertainty ug and could be regarded as negligible kandasamy et al 2013 at present work we calculated ui by obtaining the value of su and sl as show in fig 14 where the values are 14 26 n and 14 14 n for the fine mesh bh simulation and 8124 rpm and 8067 rpm for the fine mesh sp simulation respectively then we can get the two ui values of 0 41 and 0 36 for the two simulations where we can see that ui is an order of magnitude smaller than ug so the neglect of ui as kandasamy et al 2013 mentioned is reasonable for the experimental uncertainty ud the previously used value ud 1 is suitable in the bh model test as the measurement uncertainty is less than 1 however ud 1 is not appropriate for the free running model test as these two model tests are different generally the ud of the free running model test could be larger however the value has not available at present so we take the referenced value of ud 5 for the uv calculation in sp simulation the final uncertainty terms ug ui ud and uv are listed in table 4 from table 4 we can see that for the barehull resistance and rotor revolution of the fine mesh both the comparison error e is smaller than the uv which means the validation of the barehull resistance is achieved at the 5 17 uv interval and the validation of the rotor revolution is achieved at the 6 76 uv interval for the present trimaran model we encountered difficulties finding suitable devices with enough accuracy to directly measure the force torque or inflow and outflow information of the waterjet as the waterjet system is too small the thrust and thrust deduction is not available for the free running model test so we compared the recorded rpm of the sp simulations and experiment in table 4 for the hull resistance and waterjet gross thrust the three grids get the monotonic convergence with rg 0 81 and 0 25 respectively however the thrust deduction fraction of the three grids shows no obviously convergence trend which may duo to the sensitivity of the thrust deduction fraction to slight changes in drag and thrust considering both the other parameters show the well agreed monotonic convergence trend of the three grids the thrust deduction result of the fine mesh would be selected as the referenced value for the following comparison in waves the comparative study on the barehull and free running trimaran model via the urans cfd simulations versus model test validated the present body force model pid controller and cfd models be an effective and reliable approach for the simulation of the trimaran free running model and the fine density grid would be applied in the following simulations 4 performance of waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested waves based on the simulated short crested waves in section 3 1 and the above free running simulation approach in viscous cfd the trimaran was numerical simulated and researched the hydrodynamic performance and speed loss in the realistic ocean environment for the present trimaran model with the scale ratio of 1 30 the simulated short crested wave conditions sea state i sea state ii and sea state iii correspond to the international sea scale of 3 4 and 5 in full scale as the different ocean environment and traveling speed effect the hydrodynamic performance of the trimaran a lot three groups of simulations were performed to research the effects of sea state traveling speed the wind respectively for the wind condition we select the beaufort wind scale for consideration kim et al 2017b where the beaufort number b n correspond to the three simulated significant wave height table 5 listed the wind speed selection for wind effects group to control the wind speed as the single variable the two wind speeds 1 04 m s and 2 51 m s which originally corresponded to the sea state i and sea state iii were selected as the comparison wind conditions in wind effects group in addition the superstructure model of the real ship is also added to the simulated trimaran model to consider the influence of wind eventually a total of cases were generated and more details are listed in table 6 where case2 and case4 indeed are the same simulation case in different groups all the simulations performed in two stages the stage i is self propulsion in the target short crested wave and the hull speed is stabilized at the target value for some time by adjusting the rotor revolution automatically through pid controller after that the rotor revolution is adjusted to the fixed sp point of the corresponding speed to start the stage ii and the hull speed ship is no longer controlled which means the entering of the speed loss stage including the speed loss trimaran attitudes added resistance waterjet thrust and thrust deduction are researched which are expressed as dimensionless 26 u v v 0 27 p i t c h p i t c h a k 28 h e a v e h e a v e a 29 c a w r s c r s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l p p 30 c g t t g s c t g s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l p p where v and v 0 represent the real time traveling speed and initial speed of the free running model a and k are the significant wave amplitude and the corresponding wavenumber of the simulated sea state the added hull resistance and added gross thrust in the short crested waves normalized as c aw and c gt and the corresponding r sc r sw t g sc and t g sw represent the hull resistance in target waves barehull resistance in calm water gross thrust in target waves and gross thrust of sp simulation in calm water respectively the real time waterjet gross thrust is expressed as follows 31 t g i 1 3 q i v j i c m i v i 1 3 q i v j i u c m i v 0 where i 1 2 3 represents the three different waterjet units of the trimaran q i v ji and c mi are the mass flow jet velocity and inlet momentum coefficient of each waterjet duct for the waterjet thrust deduction the hull resistance r sc in waves is applied to the thrust deduction fraction calculation 32 t 1 r s c t g s c by keeping the revolution constant in the stage ii we can research the three different effects on speed loss but for the attitudes and forces it would combine the effect of sea state ship speed or wind thus we will calculate the speed loss using the stage ii and other variables using the stage i which could separate the effects of sea state speed and wind 4 1 the sea state effects the sea state effects were performed at the speed of fr 0 30 under the three target short crested head waves the revolution dimensionless speed coefficient added resistance waterjet gross thrust in the two stages are illustrated in fig 15 the dimensionless pitch heave and thrust deduction fraction time history and frequency domain results in the two stages are figured in fig 16 fig 15 a shows the propulsor revolution of the two stages the variation amplitude of rpm is notable increased from case1 to case3 in the initial speed maintenance stage and the hull speed fluctuation range increases with the increase of sea state where the maximum dimensionless speed fluctuation u in the case3 sea state iii is with the range of 0 025 as shown in fig 15 b on the contrary while the rpm is kept fixed at the sp point in the second stage hull speed is obviously affected by sea conditions and drops quicker with the sea state increases for case1 with the smallest significant wave height h 1 3 lpp 0 01 speed coefficient u shows small oscillation and gradually decreases then stabilizes around 0 965 meanwhile in case2 and case3 u declines rapidly in a short time then shows irregular fluctuations in a specific range taking the mean value of u curves as the target speed coefficient among the fluctuations range the mean u of case2 and case3 are 0 930 and 0 780 respectively it can be concluded that the speed loss percentage increases rapidly with the increase of actual sea conditions which is 3 5 and 7 0 respectively in the first two cases and 22 0 in the third one speed decrease in waves is affected by the added resistance and the diffraction component caused by the change of ship attitudes contributes the most in short waves hizir et al 2019 fig 15 c d display the added wave resistance and gross thrust variation in waves where c aw is almost kept the same fluctuation trend of 4 10 both at the two stages as the thrust is affected by the propulsor revolution we can see that c gt gets the fluctuation range of 3 9 at the stage i due to the pid controlled rpm and varies within the range of 0 6 at the stage ii due to the fixed rpm of sp point fig 16 shows the time history curves of the dimensionless pitch heave and thrust deduction of the three cases and the corresponding frequency domain characteristics based on the fast fourier transformation fft among which the trimaran attitudes in case1 is less affected by the low sea state i and the fluctuation ranges of the two dimensionless amplitude curves are basically the same under sea state ii and iii with higher sea conditions as shown in fig 15 the actual motion amplitude in case1 is small and the pitch changes are apparent in case2 and case3 especially under the sea state iii the slamming has occurred on the connection bridge at the forebody when it comes to the trim by bow at the moment of v 0 t l pp 6 25 as shown in fig 17 a for the dimensionless pitch and heave frequency characteristics both of the frequency focus on the range of 0 5 hz 1 5 hz where the sea state shows more obvious effects by comparing the case2 3 with case1 the thrust deduction fraction time history curves get the fluctuation range from 1 5 to 1 5 and with the sea state increasing the fluctuation range increasing correspondingly as shown in fig 16 except for the evaluation of the speed loss in stage ii the corresponding mean value of the caw cgt and t in stage i is used to evaluate the effects of sea state taking the mean value of fig 15 c d in stage i for consideration caw under case1 3 are 1 93 1 82 and 1 45 respectively for cgt the three curves have the same distribution trend and fluctuation within 3 10 the average values of case1 case3 are 1 41 1 42 and 1 72 which shows that the waterjet thrust increases with the sea state increasing this disciplinarian can be deduced from the parameters changing trend in the calculation of waterjet thrust as shown in fig 17 b when the rotor revolution is self adapt in stage i the average flow fluctuation range of the waterjet duct increases with the increase of sea state and the average value of qmean for case1 3 are 2 70 2 83 and 3 13 while the nozzle velocity represents as v j q ρs j s j is the fixed value of the nozzle area which means the changing trend of the nozzle velocity curve is entirely consistent with the flow rate considering that the momentum real time inlet momentum coefficient c m maintains around 0 8 at the two stages therefore from eq 31 the speed loss gets intensified when the sea condition is worsening and t g is mainly affected by the flow rate qmean and speed coefficient u so the added waterjet thrust becomes larger when the sea condition is more severe when the rotor revolution is fixed in stage ii the average flow fluctuation range of waterjet duct slightly increases with the increase of sea state and the average fluctuation range is within 8 which leads to the relative stable variation of cgt in stage ii for the thrust deduction fraction in stage i as shown in fig 16 the corresponding mean value to the three cases are 0 030 0 069 and 0 068 respectively compared with the calm water t 0 005 the three t in waves shows a bit irregular characteristic with the sea state increasing 4 2 the traveling speed effects three different initial speeds fr 0 30 045 and 0 60 were performed the free running simulations for the traveling speed effects on speed loss investigation the additional grid independency are pre performed for bh and sp simulations for fr 0 45 0 60 and the results both shows the monotonic convergence for the realistic wave environment the sea state ii was adopted as sea condition without the headwind the fixed rotor revolution of case4 case5 and case6 in stage ii is the corresponding sp point to the speed of fr 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 in calm water in consideration of the inconsistency of the initial speed in different simulations the abscissa in the following figures does not use the dimensionless expression but directly take simulated time instead the ordinate is consistent with section 4 1 fig 18 a shows the change chart of the dimensionless ship speed in two stages after entering the second stage with the fixed revolution of the corresponding sp point the hull speed decreases rapidly and the degree of fluctuation of each curve differs but it keeps on fluctuating around the value 0 93 which shows that in the short crested wave condition the decrease of speed is mainly affected by the sea conditions and has little correlation with the initial ship speed fig 18 c d display the comparison diagram of added resistance coefficient and added waterjet thrust coefficient taking the mean value of each curve in stage i the average added resistance coefficient in case4 case6 are 1 82 2 41 and 6 91 respectively which shows that in a specific sea condition there is the peak added resistance coefficient at a particular intermediate speed similar to the analysis process of sea state effects in section 4 1 the stabled trimaran speed coefficient u in case4 case6 has little difference as we can see the mass flow rate of the waterjet duct at high speed is significantly higher than that at low speed and the same is true for the jet velocity vj of the nozzle which indicates that the water thrust is mainly affected by the rotor revolution at the sp point the average added waterjet thrust coefficients of case 4 case 6 in stage i are 1 42 3 65 and 11 25 respectively fig 19 illustrate that the dimensionless attitudes curves have few differences for case4 case6 the frequency distribution curves shows that the attitudes amplitude around the frequency 0 5hz 1 5 hz almost kept the same which indicates that the initial speed has less influence on the amplitude of the trimaran attitudes and the amplitude is mainly determined by the sea condition of the short crested waves as shown in fig 19 the average thrust deduction fraction for case4 case6 are 0 069 0 107 and 0 155 which means the thrust deduction performance of trimaran is greatly reduced when traveling in short crested waves at high speeds 4 3 the head wind effects in the last wind effects group of case7 case9 the wind wave joint influence is considered sea state ii and initial speed fr 0 30 are still selected as the fixed parameters and three headwind conditions of 1 04 m s 1 95 m s and 2 51 m s are employed in the simulations as shown in fig 20 a in order to study the detail effect of wind conditions on the trimaran performance case2 without wind effect is added into the speed loss comparison during the first stage of speed maintenance all the simulations literately run with the corresponding additional wind speed to research the wind effects separately the contrast curves of speed coefficient rpm caw and cgt show that the fluctuation and change trend is nearly the same under different wind conditions in the same short crested wave environment the curve moves down in order with the increase of wind speed that is meant the hull speed decreases more severely which also makes the case with lower wind conditions encounter the wave ahead earlier the horizontal position of the curve appears with the increase of wind speed fig 21 shows the direct comparison of this hysteresis under four wind conditions when the abscissa value reaches 6 6 the wave peak a in the figure is at the stern position in case2 without wind consideration as the speed loss increases with the increase of wind condition the position of wave peak a delay forward gradually until it approaches at the amidship at case9 and the same wave peak b in front of the bow also reflects this phenomenon fig 22 shows the comparison of pitch heave and thrust deduction fraction under different wind conditions the two attitudes both get the high consistent frequency distribution curves for the three winds which indicates that the wind is the minor aspect to effect the motions compared with the speed and sea state for the thrust deduction fraction t the three mean value give as 0 040 0 045 and 0 030 the average speed loss percentage 1 u 100 of case7 case9 are 7 0 9 0 12 5 and 15 0 in turn by subtracting the wave induced speed loss of case2 from the total speed loss in case7 case9 for considering only wind induced component the influence of each wind condition on the speed loss under the simulated sea condition is obtained which is 2 0 5 5 and 8 0 in turn accounting for the percentage of 22 2 44 0 and 53 3 in total effects respectively the present computed wind induced speed loss percentage in case8 b n 5 and case9 b n 6 matched well with the kim s results kim et al 2017b where he estimated the speed loss of the s175 ship model in b n 6 based random head waves when fr 0 25 and fr 0 286 the speed loss proportion due to wind could up to 47 9 and 47 4 of total the trimaran attitudes curves and the so caused added resistance curves show a similar variation tendency due to the same initial sea state environment and the lateral position delay of different curves with the increase of wind conditions is shown in fig 20 as listed in table 7 under the three wind conditions the added resistance coefficient increases in turn and the wind induced added resistance proportion is 12 5 22 2 and 30 5 respectively indicating that the wind tends to play a increasing role after the wind speed gradually increases similar to the dimensionless speed coefficient curve the added waterjet thrust coefficient and thrust deduction fraction curve also shows the same trend under the combined effect of wind and wave the wind induced effects to the average added waterjet thrust coefficient are 22 8 31 1 and 41 6 details listed in table 7 show the speed loss mean added resistance mean added waterjet thrust mean thrust deduction fraction due to the joint effects and wind induced proportion the results reveal that the wind induced effects on resistance propulsion and hull speed are notable especially while the wind speed exceeds the traveling speed the wind induced speed loss could even exceed one half of the total eventually based on the above analysis and discussion all the calculated trimaran performance results on average in 9 cases of the three comparison groups are listed in table 8 5 conclusion this research proposes a practical direct urans cfd approach to establish the short crested waves based real ocean environment and evaluate the free running vessel s speed loss and propulsion performance under corresponding wave conditions by applying the eom based wave forcing zone pid controlled propulsor and bfm based propulsion approach meanwhile the validation process for the simulated waves and free running model have been performed by comparing the theory and model test results finally based on the above techniques and approach simulations have been carried out on a waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested head waves the speed loss and propulsion performance considering sea state effects speed effects and wind effects are researched and analyzed the conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 a urans cfd based random ocean seaway considering turbulent and viscous effects is established under sufficient accuracy which provides a reliable basis for the ship wave interactions 2 free running model appended with pid controller and body force model was validated to be an applicable model for the vessel speed varied simulations especially for the high revolution propulsor appended model which reaches convergence more quickly with reasonable grids 3 the speed loss and performance numerical results of sea state effects speed effects and wind effects on the trimaran free running model in short crested head waves table 8 indicates that the speed loss coefficient has an initial speed independence and mainly related to the waves and wind conditions especially while the wind speed exceeds the vessel speed the wind effects could cover one half of total while for the real time waterjet thrust as the traveling speed increased both the three effects have deteriorated the waterjet propulsion performance especially at high speed 4 the present study provides a practical approach for the performance evaluation of the free running vessel in a random seaway there are still more efforts should be made to improve and enrich the research in future firstly the hydrodynamic performance curves of the propulsor are assumed as the same in waves and calm water and the differences between the two conditions will be further researched in future secondly the waterjet rotor performance curves used in this paper is different from the method solves the waterjet performance by simulating the whole waterjet pump system the difference between the two ways is worthy to further researched thirdly the present simulations of the trimaran in short crested waves are belong to the short term prediction the simulation time will be increased for further research moreover the waterjet system model test and the free running waterjet propelled trimaran model test in regular waves and short crested waves will be performed for the further verification and validation of the present free running numerical

21242,this paper employed a direct urans cfd based approach to investigate the speed loss and waterjet performance for a waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested head waves firstly a reasonable quantity of linear superposed regular waves was validated to simulate the realistic ocean wave adopted on the ittc directional wave spectrum then the wave parameters were applied to the urans cfd simulations to avoid the wave reflection due to structures and to narrow the simulation domain the euler overlay method eom based wave forcing zone was defined in the outer domain the time history of the wave elevation and the wave patterns matched well with the theoretical results moreover by employing the pid controller and body force method the 1 30 scale waterjet propelled trimaran free running numerical model was validated through the trimaran model tests eventually the free running simulations in short crested head waves of the trimaran were performed considering the effects of sea state traveling speed and wind respectively the added resistance in short crested waves was mainly caused by the pitch and heave variation and lead to the speed loss and waterjet performance deterioration notable the wind induced speed loss could account for nearly one half of the total while the wind speed exceeds the vessel speed the proposed approach of direct evaluating the traveling and propulsion performance in short crested waves shows reasonable results and practical value keywords speed loss waterjet performance short crested head waves euler overlay method pid controller free running model 1 introduction for the ship resistance and propulsion performance the traditional ship design mainly focuses on these performances in calm water conditions however when the vessel traveling in the wave condition the added resistance more shaft power requirement speed loss and slamming have become a concern for ship designers the added resistance in waves is one of the essential contents of sea keeping research which directly lead to the speed loss affect the propulsion performance and cause loss of ship operation performance and economic benefits as an essential role in the standard regulation the speed reduction coefficient f w proposed in the energy efficiency design index eedi imo 2011 has typically been assumed as a constant value of 1 0 at the ship design stage however the actual value of f w affects the eedi calculation directly which lead to the requirement of more evaluation method for f w after then in 2013 imo put forward another essential interim guideline for determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the maneuverability of ships under adverse conditions imo 2013 which requires the calculation of the added resistance under adverse conditions the above regulations indeed guide researches putting more focus on ship performance in waves in fact plenty of research works has been done in the last half century before the regulations officially put forward the added resistance and ship motions in waves are mainly adopted on two methods the cfd method including the potential theory based cfd and viscous cfd and experimental method since mauro 1960 firstly used the far field method to compute the added resistance based on the momentum conservation theory more researchers put forward and enhance the method joosen 1966 newman 1967 kashiwagi et al 2010 more applicable methods based on the potential theory were carried out for investigating the 2d strip theory applications salvesen et al 1970 added resistance due to wave reflection fujii and takahashi 1975 and the near field method applications joncquez 2009 with the rapid development of high performance computation hpc the viscous cfd based techniques have been widely used in the added resistance calculation orihara and miyata 2003 hosseini et al 2013 which has the advantages of considering viscous effects large motions high sea state slamming and green water in recent few years the added resistance and speed loss in waves were researched in more detail wu et al 2011 performed the investigation of a rans cfd based simulations of a high speed trimaran barehull model in regular waves the calculated attitudes and added resistance matched well with the experiment results luo et al 2016 used the panel method for calculating added resistance in regular waves and cfd approach for wind resistance then evaluate the speed loss by either nmri approach or h e p method kim et al kim et al 2017a investigated the wave reflection reduction effects from the bow for the modified kvlcc2 ship model in different regular head waves using the urans method and the modified hull form receives about 8 energy saving in sea state 5 conditions considering the realistic sea conditions with irregular random waves and winds firstly kim et al 2017b validated the capability of 2 d 3 d potential methods and urans cfd tool to calculate the added resistance and motions in regular waves then applied the 2 d linear potential method in the calculation of mean added resistance in irregular waves based on the pierson moskowitz pm spectrum meanwhile the added resistance due to wind was taking into account based on the blendermann chart finally the added resistance speed loss and sea margins were evaluated riesner and ould 2018 researched the wave induced added resistance of a container ship and kvlcc2 tanker with a forward speed in regular head waves using the nonlinear time domain rankine source method the radiation and diffraction effects considering the empirical method based viscous effect and the varied wetted surface were numerically researched and compared with the rans cfd based results and experimental results which validated the applicability of the method in added resistance prediction for the proppulsion factors research moor and murdey 1970 and nakamura and naito 1975 both did the well designed experimental tests to research how the wave parameters affected the propulsion factors bhattacharyya and steen 2014 did a comprehensive experimental study for a 120 m cargo ship with the open ducted propeller in waves where the open propeller shows less influence in waves and the thrust deduction fraction is found to be independent of propeller loading in a broad range of loadings sigmund and el moctar 2017 have done both the experimental and rans cfd based numerical investigation on a single and a twin screw ship to research the effects of head waves to the propulsion performance where all the deviation of the computed propeller forces are with 5 the numerical method was validated to be capable of investigating the propulsion behavior of a ship in regular head waves base on the experimental results taskar et al 2019 recently performed the simulations to research the effect of varying propulsion factor due to waves in the simulated realistic wave conditions where the varied range from 12 to 4 for the energy consuming due to the changes of propulsion factors in waves was reported in general most researches on the added resistance and speed loss in waves are based on the resistance results in the specified regular waves to evaluate the mean added resistance in irregular waves using the wave spectrum while the potential theory based method is lack of the real viscous effect consideration or using the empirical estimation approach instead the viscous cfd based method takes the fully nonlinear and viscous effects into account but the wave generation wave absorbing technology and the time cost in huge computation cases becomes the primary challenge in the present research we proposed a directly urans cfd based approach for the added resistance and speed loss evaluation in a realistic ocean environment firstly the wave generation and absorbing method for the short crested irregular waves are described in detail and are validated by comparing with the results in theory then to realize the directly traveling speed control in a limited simulation domain the pid controlled free running numerical model was applied on a waterjet propelled trimaran model where the barehull bh and self propulsion sp simulations were in good agreement with the model test results finally we performed the direct simulations on the trimaran free running model in short crested head waves with the considering of the sea state effects speed effects and wind effects for the added resistance and speed loss evaluation the primary evaluation process is displayed in fig 1 2 basic theory 2 1 3 d directional propagation wave model the realistic random wave ma et al 2015 is mostly the short crested irregular waves and the direction of the waves is multi directional and it is irregular in time and space the short crested wave can be regarded as an irregular wave system formed by superimposing a plurality of micro simple harmonics with different frequencies different directions different amplitudes and random phases the wave evaluation at the position x y in space at time t can be expressed as 1 η i 1 m j 1 n a i j cos ω i t k i x cos θ j k i y sin θ j ε i j where a ij and ε i j is the wave amplitude and random phase of the single regular wave with the i frequency and the j direction ω i and k i is the angular frequency and wavenumber θ j denotes the j wave direction m and n is the total number of the wave frequency and the wave direction the three dimensional short crested wave was defined by the directional wave spectrum s ω θ which was satisfied with the following equations 2 i 1 m j 1 n a i j 2 2 π π 0 s ω θ d ω d θ 3 s ω θ s ω d ω θ where s ω and d ω θ is the wave spectrum and directional diffusion function and θ denotes the wave propagation direction in present work to build the real time ocean random waves environment the ittc directional wave spectrum was used to complete the wave spectrum simulations the main equations of the ittc wave spectrum model were as follows 4 s ω 173 h 1 3 2 t 1 4 ω 5 exp 691 t 1 4 ω 4 5 d ω θ 2 π cos 2 θ θ 0 where h 1 3 and t 1 is significant wave height and average period θ 0 is wave direction of the main wave and θ π 2 π 2 in real time wave simulations usually the equi energy divided method eem or equi frequency divided method efm is used to simulate the spectrum and the three dimensional directional spectrum is simulated by a single summation method or a double summation method in this paper the spectral energy and direction angle is divided by the equal division method and the wave simulation is performed by the double summation method assuming that most of the energy distribution of the target spectrum is in the range of the frequency ω 1 ω n for the equi frequency divided method the frequency in the range is equally divided into m intervals and for the equi enegy divided method the spectrum energy in the range is equally divided into m intervals the wave propagation angle is divided into 2n intervals in pi 2 pi 2 the simulated frequency takes the center frequency of each boundary point and the boundary point angles are taken as the simulation angles in all directions 6 ω

wave amplitude a ij to avoid the partial attenuation due to viscous and mesh distribution we could multiply a coefficient k a that slightly larger than 1 in the practical rans cfd simulations present paper takes the coefficient k a 1 10 the total wave elevation of the three dimensional shorted crested wave and the time history equation of the total superposition velocity field are as follows 8 ϕ i

elimination of structural reflection waves are critical to the success of numerical simulations often determining the success or failure of numerical simulation in the past most of the methods used are damping wave elimination source term clipping and combining the coarse mesh in the downstream of the wave making region to eliminate the wave at the same time in order to make the wave eliminating effect and the flow field simulation effect around the structure good enough it needs to widen and lengthen the simulation domain which brings a large increase in overall grids and calculation cost the thought of euler overlay method eom was proposed by kim et al 2011 who used the potential theory based solution for the far field wave condition and solved the ns equations around the near field in a finite element method fem cfd simulations the gap between the far field theory solution and the near field current solution was applied as a body force source term to transit in the blending area after the successful attempt kim et al 2012 applied eom to the finite volume method fvm viscous cfd field the load response of a vertical cylinder in a steep wave is simulated the results show that the method successfully simulates the wave loads and wave breaking effects in accordance with the experimental results when the computational domain of viscous cfd is significantly reduced the computational domain length of numerical simulation is 2 m and the experimental flume length is 105 m perić and abdel maksoud 2015 2016 2018 continuously did a series of research on the wave reflection and absorbing problems in free surface flow simulations to improve the eom based force wave damping module which is included in the software siemens star ccm fig 2 shows the eom based computational domain of the numerical wave tank eom applied the source term to the forcing zone forcing the current fvm cfd solution towards the theoretical solution from the specified inner boundary to the outer boundary the added source term applied in the forcing zone for the solution of the transport equation is as follows 10 q φ γ d x φ r e f φ where γ is the forcing strength d x is the distribution function of the source term over the domain x represents the distance from the inner boundary to the outer boundary φ r e f and φ are the reference theoretical solution and current solution the distribution function d x mainly has five expressions the constant the linear the quadratic the trigonometric and the exponential perić and abdel maksoud 2015 star ccm software applied the following cosine squared function to transit the gap of the two solutions in equation 10 11 d x cos 2 π x 2 where x x d i is the non dimensional distance d i is the distance from the inner boundary to the corresponding outer boundary perić and abdel maksoud 2016 researched how the distance d i affect the generation of regular and irregular waves and in engineering practice the typical range of 2 λ d i λ in regular wave and d i λ p in irregular wave are suggested where λ and λ p is the wave length and typical wave length 2 3 pid controller for hull speed maintenance in free running simulations the thrust from the propulsor i e propeller or waterjet pump drives the vessel moving ahead the arising resistance slows the ship to maintain the forward speed the ship requires a feedback controller for heading speed by employing the proportional integral pi speed controller carrica et al 2008 did the direct overset free running simulations on propulsor appended ship model to research the broaching event in irregular waves then performed the direct maneuvering simulations carrica et al 2016 both the simulations received consistent results moreover wang et al 2016 2018 also verified the applicability of the pi controller in free running model simulations in the present research a fully developed proportion integration differentiation pid controller was applied to the propulsor by controlling the propulsor revolution the target traveling speed could be achieved similarly for the barehull model simulations the pid controller also could be adopted for the towing force to balance the resistance the target pid controller equation for the two simulations is expressed as follows 12 n p f d p n e i n 0 t e d t d n d e d t p n v 0 v t n i n i 2 t n v 0 v i 2 v i 1 2 δ t d n a where n p is the propulsor revolution applied in the sp model simulations the unit is rpm 1 m or rps 1 s f d is the towing force in bh model resistance simulations a is the speed acceleration tn is the total iterations at the simulated time t and δt is the time step the error term is e v 0 v v 0 v tn and v i are the target hull speed the hull speed at simulated time t and the hull speed at the iteration i respectively p n i n and d n are the coefficient of the corresponding proportion integration and differentiation terms 2 4 body force method for propulsion the body force method bfm has been widely used in dealing with the propulsion modeling problems in cfd simulations of self propulsion sakamoto et al 2013 and maneuvering broglia et al 2013 which adopts the actuator disk concept and validated to contribute to time saving and lower computational cost under the reasonable accuracy in general the bfm is applied to the propeller region to replace the rotational propeller a cylindrical virtual disks are created with the same dimensions as the propeller in the rotational region the force radially distributed over each virtual disk follows the goldstein optimum and is expressed as star ccm 2018 13 f b t 105 ρ n 2 d p 4 k t 8 π t 3 r h 4 r r r h r 1 r 14 f b q 105 ρ n 2 d p 5 k q 8 π t 3 r h 4 r r r h r 1 r r 15 r r r h r r h where f bt and f bq are the axial and tangential directional body force components r t r h and r are the radial coordinate virtual disk thickness hub radius and blade tip radius respectively ρ n and d p are the fluid density propeller revolution and propeller diameter k t and k q are the coefficients of thrust and torque of the propeller which are obtained from the open water test or numerical calculation 3 numerical model and validations 3 1 the simulation of short crested wave in rans cfd 3 1 1 convergence analysis of the wave parameters a large number of experimental observations show that the total instantaneous value distribution of wave surface elevation belongs to the normal distribution according to probability theory if the instantaneous value distribution of a random variable obeys normal distribution the amplitude of the variable obeys rayleigh distribution then the statistical characteristics of waves can be calculated according to the following formulas 16 m q 0 ω q s ω d ω h 1 3 4 m 0 t 1 2 π m 0 m 1 where m q q 0 1 is the q order moments for the specified frequency spectrum energy partitions numbers m and the wave propagation angle numbers 2n we could get the convergence target wave parameters with different m and n from equation 16 in the present research the main wave direction θ 0 0 the target short crested head wave parameters are as shown in table 1 h 1 3 0 04 m t 1 0 82 s h 1 3 0 08 m t 1 1 25 s h 1 3 0 12 m t 1 1 5 s the convergence process for the three waves is as displayed in figs 3 4 as the wave propagation angle is symmetrically distributed around the main head wave direction the division partitions 2n is without effects on the wave parameters from equation 16 the partitions 2n is set as 10 to get the convenient partitions m the frequency range is broad enough for both the three target waves from 1 0r ad s to 20 0 rad s the convergence process of m in fig 3 a c shows that the wave height h 1 3 both get stable from the partitions m 20 for the equi energy method eem and equi frequency method efm with the relative error that less than 2 however fig 3 b d demonstrate that the period t 1 of the sea state ii and iii does not fulfill the target requirements both the convergence value is lower than the targets with the relative difference about 6 and 9 to simulate the target waves with the convergence partitions m we should find the suitable simulation frequency range ω 1 ω n to match the target period t 1 within the reasonable error the suitable lower frequency limit ω 1 is chosen for the sea state i ii and iii as 1 0 2 0 and 3 5 and the convergence process of ω n is displayed in fig 4 we can see that the simulated spectrum frequency range ω 1 ω n is the main reason to affects the wave period under the specified frequency spectrum energy partitions m for the present partitions m 20 the upper frequency limit ω n of the sea state i ii and iii are converged to 16 0 rad s 11 0 rad s and 10 0 rad s for the both eem and efm simulations as shown in fig 4 b d meanwhile fig 4 a c display that the significant wave height h 1 3 of both simulated waves meet the target value well except for the sea state iii in eem simulation where there is a slight difference between the simulation value and target one but the relative error of 3 is an acceptable difference for the practical simulation upon the above convergence analysis of the simulated frequency spectrum energy partitions m and the simulated frequency range ω 1 ω n we confirm that the partitions m 20 and the frequency range 3 5 rad s 16 0 rad s 2 0 rad s 11 0 rad s and 1 0 rad s 10 rad s for the sea state i ii and iii are the reasonable simulated wave parameters the final simulation parameters and the relative error are listed in table 2 the maximum relative error of the significant height is 1 3 and 3 6 for the efm and eem and that of the period is 1 6 and 1 8 for the efm and eem though the relative error of the eem is larger than efm considering both the errors are in an acceptable range for practical application and the simulation frequencies of the eem focus on the frequency peak region which divide the wave spectrum more reasonable the eem based wave parameters are chosen for the short crested head waves simulation 3 1 2 validation of the simulated short crested waves in rans cfd the rans cfd simulations are carried out on the star ccm platform the computational domain is a 4 5l pp 3 0l pp 1 5l pp cube as shown in fig 5 the origin is located at the center of the domain with a distance of 2 0l pp away from the outlet boundary and the present l pp is set as 4 m for the target ship model scale the inlet side up and bottom boundaries are set as the velocity inlet boundary condition and the outlet is set as the pressure outlet boundary condition furthermore the eom based wave forcing boundary condition is applied in the inlet side and outlet area to simulate the target short crested wave the linear superposition wave with about 200 component regular waves is generated based on the equi energy method and applied to the inlet velocity boundary condition all the component wave parameters in rans cfd simulations are kept the same with that of in the theory simulations including the random phases the vof method is applied to capture the free surface the widely used and validated sst k ω turbulent model is chosen to close the rans equations and simple algorithm for pressure velocity coupling second order in space schemes and second order implicit scheme in time are used to discretize the governing equations to verify the effect of short crested wave simulations the following four elevation gauges are set up in the computation domain p1 2 0l pp 0 0 p2 0 0 0 p3 0 0 25l pp 0 and p4 0 1 0l pp 0 the grid independence is carried out based on three sets of mesh the coarse mesh the medium mesh and the fine mesh and the mesh size within the wave elevation range in the z direction is set as 1 20 of the significant wave height for the fine mesh the mesh is generated by the trimmed volume mesh tool taking the sea state ii as an example the rans cfd simulations are compared with the theory simulations where fig 5 shows the four gauge points wave elevation time history curves of sea state ii with different grid densities the three grids of density are 0 6 m 1 0 m and 1 7 m from fig 6 it can be seen that the trend and fluctuation amplitude of the time history curve under three grid densities at points p1 and p4 keeps the same and the enlarged region from 15s to 20s shows more obvious differences between the grids where the fine grid shows the least error of within 5 compared with the theoretical curves meanwhile the wave elevation discrepancy in fig 7 is more obvious than that of in fig 6 the simulated wave peak and trough of rans cfd with different grids show a slight delay compared to the theoretical simulated value and fluctuate and according to the different grid density the delay times vary with 0 0 1s moreover the wave elevation of p2 and p3 have a slight attenuation in some wave peak and trough in summary the four gauges both show well matched time history curves with the elevation variation in theory simulation and the fine mesh obtains the relative better simulation results the eom forcing wave boundary conditions on the boundary of side outlet and inlet maintains the wave elevation of the wave forcing domain to agree with the theoretical results considering the viscous effect and turbulent dissipation in urans cfd the relative errors between the two methods is inevitable such as the wave peak errors of p1 and p4 point are less than 5 under fine grids for points p2 and p3 in the middle of the computational domain there is a delay of less than 0 1s relative to the wave elevation in theory the delay is related to the effect of grid density and viscous hysteresis and fine grids contribute to the least delay fig 8 shows the short crested wave patterns comparison between the fine grids simulation and the theoretical results at t 5 0s 15 0s and 25 0s when t 5s there is a wave trough area of about 0 3l pp 0 3l pp near the point p2 and p3 in theoretical simulation both points are located in the blue represented area while the corresponding trough domain in rans cfd results is relatively small and the area near the point p3 is a non blue domain which means the simulation error occurs this difference corresponds to the distribution of the wave heights of the curves in fig 7 at 5s for point p1 and p4 the wave trough area near point p1 is about 0 15l pp 0 15l pp fig 9 is the spectrum results of the four gauges p1 p4 coincide with the time history comparison results of fig 6 p1 and p4 of the three density grids both show the well matched frequency characteristics with the theory spectrum even the relative high frequency component around 1 7 hz is also been captured for the gauges p2 and p3 as some peaks and troughs are not well fitted the cfd simulated high frequency part get lost compared with the theory as shown in fig 9 c d apart from that the main frequency characteristics between 0 5 hz and 1 0 hz are in good agreement with the theoretical results the simulation results of rans cfd fine grids are consistent with the theoretical simulation results in general the peak and trough of short peak wave simulated by viscous urans cfd method based on ittc two parameter spectrum are slightly smaller than those simulated by theory and the overall distribution of wave surface time is consistent with the trend of change the comparison results show that the convergence analysis of short crested wave parameters and the corresponding wave simulations based on the viscous cfd method achieve an acceptable real random wave environment 3 2 barehull and free running model validation the free running model with pid controlled and bfm replaced propulsor is validated through a 1 30 scaled waterjet propelled trimaran ship model which is driven by three sets of waterjet units table 3 lists the main dimensions of the target ship the trimaran resistance model test was conducted with the closed intakes and jets in cssrc china ship scientific research center towing tank where covers region of 470 m 15 m 7 m with the maximum towing speed of 15 m s and the measurement uncertainty is less than 1 after then the free running sp model test was carried out at fr 0 30 in a lake with still open waters the two model tests are as illustrated in fig 10 unlike the towing tank test the free running test has not any tow force added on the hull so the present sp test is actually running the model scale sp point and the following free running simulations at fr 0 30 are based on this model scale sp point 3 2 1 verification and validation methodology in finite volume method based cfd it is necessary to perform the v v verification and validation procedures roy et al 2013 defined the refinement ratio r g as it relates to the total grids number while using the trimmed volume grids the grids of the calculation region in three coordinate directions are uniformly refined the refinement ratio r of 3d simulation is expressed as 17 r g n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 3 where n fine and n coarse is the total grids number of the specified density generally at least three sets of grid density are required to analyze the grid convergence s 1 s 2 and s 3 represent the computational results of fine

the body force model based on eqs 13 and 14 the waterjet rotor is assumed as a kind of traditional individual propeller in the waterjet duct then by solving the kt kq curve of the waterjet rotor and applying it into the virtual disk pump region the interactions with the rest part of the waterjet pump system and the hull could be simulated and the flow rate of the waterjet nozzle and forces of each part in the virtual control volume could be obtained eslamdoost and vikström 2019 recently researched three different body force implementations in waterjet pump simulation using bfm the body force model that kept the guide vanes and removed the impeller blades showed an apparent advantage in cost effective and accuracy compared with the mrf moving reference frame method sliding mesh method and the other body force models although the specified expressions of the axial and tangential forces in eqs 13 and 14 are not the same with the eslamdoost s both of them are one of the many body force models the cos effective advantage could be obtained both for the two models for the present work the stator is also kept in simulations to absorb the rotation flow energy and to ensure the flow uniform fig 11 shows the waterjet rotor geometry and the simulation domain for the computational of the open water performance characteristic curves where the waterjet duct surface is excluded the rotor diameter d r 49 mm to get the converged open water performance curves three sets of different density grids with the number of 2 60 m 1 75 m and 0 85 m are generated the prism layer thickness is set as 0 5 mm with 6 layers and a growth factor of 1 5 and the y value of the rotor surface is around 1 the steady numerical simulation uses the sst k ω turbulence model and the near wall flow field is solved by the two layer all y method the rotor revolution is kept as the fixed value of 7920 rpm as the same with the trimaran free running model test by setting a series of inlet velocity the k t and k q curves with different j could be obtained the open water hydrodynamic performance curves of the three different grids density are displayed in fig 12 from the η k t and 10k q curves comparison it is demonstrated that with the grids number increasing the difference between the computed value is decreasing and except for the values of j 0 05 all the computed convergence ratio r g in eq 18 is less than 1 which means the simulation results is monotonically converged finally the fine mesh results is used in bfm for the free running trimaran numerical model and the fine mesh open water hydrodynamic performance results also has been applied in the recent researches zhang et al 2019 2020 3 2 3 barehull and self propulsion simulations three different density of grids coarse medium and fine were generated to proceed with v v of the free running bh and sp simulations the fully appended trimaran geometry model used in simulations is illustrated in fig 13 a b the urans cfd simulation model uses the background field in section 3 1 2 creates a relatively small motion domain around the hull the mesh distribution is displayed in fig 13 c the local refined mesh is generated among the free surface elevation range and around the hull motion domain the prism layer is set with 6 layers with a growth factor of 1 414 and the prism layer thickness is 2 cm 1 5 cm and 1 0 cm for the hull speed fr 0 30 0 45 0 60 respectively which ensure the y value of the hull surface is less than 100 the numerical simulation uses the sst turbulence model the near wall flow field is solved by the two layer all y method and the vof method is applied to track and capture the free surface rigid body motions are released in pitch heave and surge using the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi scheme for the free running model and the pid controller was applied in the rotor revolution controlling for trimaran speed maintenance accounting for the lower computation cost the bfm method with the input open water curves of the real propeller is applied in the rotational region compared with the traditional sp simulation which needs at least three calculations to obtain the sp point using the interpolation between the drag and thrust curves the free running model with the pid controller could get the accurate converged sp point in once simulation the pid coefficient terms p n i n and d n of eq 12 are set as 5 0e2 5 0e2 and 4 0 respectively in the trimaran barehull simulations moreover for the sp simulations the three terms are set as 1 5e5 3 0e5 and 8 0e2 generally the pid coefficient terms are easy to get a suitable scope manually at the beginning of the simulation and the coefficients have not noticeable effect on the convergence speed as the pid feedback could make the target force or revolution reach a relative stable fluctuation within just 3s or fewer fig 14 a b illustrate the barehull resistance and traveling speed convergence process of different grids simulations at fr 0 3 the rapidly converged curves indicate both the three simulations got converged in a few seconds which compared with the model test result the barehull resistance errors are 6 02 4 17 3 01 for the coarse grids medium grids and fine grids respectively for the free running sp simulation results as shown in fig 14 c d the hull speed rapidly dropped down due to the increased resistance meanwhile the self adapted rotor reached a high revolution to speed up the trimaran with zero seconds with the trimaran speed up to the target value v 0 1 88 m s in 3 s the rotor revolution and hull speed curves tend to fluctuate slightly around the convergence value compared with the rotor revolution result of 7920 rpm in the free running model test the coarse mesh medium mesh and fine mesh get the comparison error of 4 42 3 11 and 2 15 respectively meanwhile the grid uncertainty analysis as described in section 3 2 1 was performed the fine density grids show accuracy advantage both in barehull and sp simulations which obtain the grid uncertainty of 5 06 and 4 54 for the barehull resistance and rotor revolution as listed in table 4 indicates that the fine grids simulations are favorable with the model test results the iterative uncertainty ui is generally assumed as the minor term compared with the grid uncertainty ug and could be regarded as negligible kandasamy et al 2013 at present work we calculated ui by obtaining the value of su and sl as show in fig 14 where the values are 14 26 n and 14 14 n for the fine mesh bh simulation and 8124 rpm and 8067 rpm for the fine mesh sp simulation respectively then we can get the two ui values of 0 41 and 0 36 for the two simulations where we can see that ui is an order of magnitude smaller than ug so the neglect of ui as kandasamy et al 2013 mentioned is reasonable for the experimental uncertainty ud the previously used value ud 1 is suitable in the bh model test as the measurement uncertainty is less than 1 however ud 1 is not appropriate for the free running model test as these two model tests are different generally the ud of the free running model test could be larger however the value has not available at present so we take the referenced value of ud 5 for the uv calculation in sp simulation the final uncertainty terms ug ui ud and uv are listed in table 4 from table 4 we can see that for the barehull resistance and rotor revolution of the fine mesh both the comparison error e is smaller than the uv which means the validation of the barehull resistance is achieved at the 5 17 uv interval and the validation of the rotor revolution is achieved at the 6 76 uv interval for the present trimaran model we encountered difficulties finding suitable devices with enough accuracy to directly measure the force torque or inflow and outflow information of the waterjet as the waterjet system is too small the thrust and thrust deduction is not available for the free running model test so we compared the recorded rpm of the sp simulations and experiment in table 4 for the hull resistance and waterjet gross thrust the three grids get the monotonic convergence with rg 0 81 and 0 25 respectively however the thrust deduction fraction of the three grids shows no obviously convergence trend which may duo to the sensitivity of the thrust deduction fraction to slight changes in drag and thrust considering both the other parameters show the well agreed monotonic convergence trend of the three grids the thrust deduction result of the fine mesh would be selected as the referenced value for the following comparison in waves the comparative study on the barehull and free running trimaran model via the urans cfd simulations versus model test validated the present body force model pid controller and cfd models be an effective and reliable approach for the simulation of the trimaran free running model and the fine density grid would be applied in the following simulations 4 performance of waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested waves based on the simulated short crested waves in section 3 1 and the above free running simulation approach in viscous cfd the trimaran was numerical simulated and researched the hydrodynamic performance and speed loss in the realistic ocean environment for the present trimaran model with the scale ratio of 1 30 the simulated short crested wave conditions sea state i sea state ii and sea state iii correspond to the international sea scale of 3 4 and 5 in full scale as the different ocean environment and traveling speed effect the hydrodynamic performance of the trimaran a lot three groups of simulations were performed to research the effects of sea state traveling speed the wind respectively for the wind condition we select the beaufort wind scale for consideration kim et al 2017b where the beaufort number b n correspond to the three simulated significant wave height table 5 listed the wind speed selection for wind effects group to control the wind speed as the single variable the two wind speeds 1 04 m s and 2 51 m s which originally corresponded to the sea state i and sea state iii were selected as the comparison wind conditions in wind effects group in addition the superstructure model of the real ship is also added to the simulated trimaran model to consider the influence of wind eventually a total of cases were generated and more details are listed in table 6 where case2 and case4 indeed are the same simulation case in different groups all the simulations performed in two stages the stage i is self propulsion in the target short crested wave and the hull speed is stabilized at the target value for some time by adjusting the rotor revolution automatically through pid controller after that the rotor revolution is adjusted to the fixed sp point of the corresponding speed to start the stage ii and the hull speed ship is no longer controlled which means the entering of the speed loss stage including the speed loss trimaran attitudes added resistance waterjet thrust and thrust deduction are researched which are expressed as dimensionless 26 u v v 0 27 p i t c h p i t c h a k 28 h e a v e h e a v e a 29 c a w r s c r s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l p p 30 c g t t g s c t g s w ρ g a 2 b 2 l p p where v and v 0 represent the real time traveling speed and initial speed of the free running model a and k are the significant wave amplitude and the corresponding wavenumber of the simulated sea state the added hull resistance and added gross thrust in the short crested waves normalized as c aw and c gt and the corresponding r sc r sw t g sc and t g sw represent the hull resistance in target waves barehull resistance in calm water gross thrust in target waves and gross thrust of sp simulation in calm water respectively the real time waterjet gross thrust is expressed as follows 31 t g i 1 3 q i v j i c m i v i 1 3 q i v j i u c m i v 0 where i 1 2 3 represents the three different waterjet units of the trimaran q i v ji and c mi are the mass flow jet velocity and inlet momentum coefficient of each waterjet duct for the waterjet thrust deduction the hull resistance r sc in waves is applied to the thrust deduction fraction calculation 32 t 1 r s c t g s c by keeping the revolution constant in the stage ii we can research the three different effects on speed loss but for the attitudes and forces it would combine the effect of sea state ship speed or wind thus we will calculate the speed loss using the stage ii and other variables using the stage i which could separate the effects of sea state speed and wind 4 1 the sea state effects the sea state effects were performed at the speed of fr 0 30 under the three target short crested head waves the revolution dimensionless speed coefficient added resistance waterjet gross thrust in the two stages are illustrated in fig 15 the dimensionless pitch heave and thrust deduction fraction time history and frequency domain results in the two stages are figured in fig 16 fig 15 a shows the propulsor revolution of the two stages the variation amplitude of rpm is notable increased from case1 to case3 in the initial speed maintenance stage and the hull speed fluctuation range increases with the increase of sea state where the maximum dimensionless speed fluctuation u in the case3 sea state iii is with the range of 0 025 as shown in fig 15 b on the contrary while the rpm is kept fixed at the sp point in the second stage hull speed is obviously affected by sea conditions and drops quicker with the sea state increases for case1 with the smallest significant wave height h 1 3 lpp 0 01 speed coefficient u shows small oscillation and gradually decreases then stabilizes around 0 965 meanwhile in case2 and case3 u declines rapidly in a short time then shows irregular fluctuations in a specific range taking the mean value of u curves as the target speed coefficient among the fluctuations range the mean u of case2 and case3 are 0 930 and 0 780 respectively it can be concluded that the speed loss percentage increases rapidly with the increase of actual sea conditions which is 3 5 and 7 0 respectively in the first two cases and 22 0 in the third one speed decrease in waves is affected by the added resistance and the diffraction component caused by the change of ship attitudes contributes the most in short waves hizir et al 2019 fig 15 c d display the added wave resistance and gross thrust variation in waves where c aw is almost kept the same fluctuation trend of 4 10 both at the two stages as the thrust is affected by the propulsor revolution we can see that c gt gets the fluctuation range of 3 9 at the stage i due to the pid controlled rpm and varies within the range of 0 6 at the stage ii due to the fixed rpm of sp point fig 16 shows the time history curves of the dimensionless pitch heave and thrust deduction of the three cases and the corresponding frequency domain characteristics based on the fast fourier transformation fft among which the trimaran attitudes in case1 is less affected by the low sea state i and the fluctuation ranges of the two dimensionless amplitude curves are basically the same under sea state ii and iii with higher sea conditions as shown in fig 15 the actual motion amplitude in case1 is small and the pitch changes are apparent in case2 and case3 especially under the sea state iii the slamming has occurred on the connection bridge at the forebody when it comes to the trim by bow at the moment of v 0 t l pp 6 25 as shown in fig 17 a for the dimensionless pitch and heave frequency characteristics both of the frequency focus on the range of 0 5 hz 1 5 hz where the sea state shows more obvious effects by comparing the case2 3 with case1 the thrust deduction fraction time history curves get the fluctuation range from 1 5 to 1 5 and with the sea state increasing the fluctuation range increasing correspondingly as shown in fig 16 except for the evaluation of the speed loss in stage ii the corresponding mean value of the caw cgt and t in stage i is used to evaluate the effects of sea state taking the mean value of fig 15 c d in stage i for consideration caw under case1 3 are 1 93 1 82 and 1 45 respectively for cgt the three curves have the same distribution trend and fluctuation within 3 10 the average values of case1 case3 are 1 41 1 42 and 1 72 which shows that the waterjet thrust increases with the sea state increasing this disciplinarian can be deduced from the parameters changing trend in the calculation of waterjet thrust as shown in fig 17 b when the rotor revolution is self adapt in stage i the average flow fluctuation range of the waterjet duct increases with the increase of sea state and the average value of qmean for case1 3 are 2 70 2 83 and 3 13 while the nozzle velocity represents as v j q ρs j s j is the fixed value of the nozzle area which means the changing trend of the nozzle velocity curve is entirely consistent with the flow rate considering that the momentum real time inlet momentum coefficient c m maintains around 0 8 at the two stages therefore from eq 31 the speed loss gets intensified when the sea condition is worsening and t g is mainly affected by the flow rate qmean and speed coefficient u so the added waterjet thrust becomes larger when the sea condition is more severe when the rotor revolution is fixed in stage ii the average flow fluctuation range of waterjet duct slightly increases with the increase of sea state and the average fluctuation range is within 8 which leads to the relative stable variation of cgt in stage ii for the thrust deduction fraction in stage i as shown in fig 16 the corresponding mean value to the three cases are 0 030 0 069 and 0 068 respectively compared with the calm water t 0 005 the three t in waves shows a bit irregular characteristic with the sea state increasing 4 2 the traveling speed effects three different initial speeds fr 0 30 045 and 0 60 were performed the free running simulations for the traveling speed effects on speed loss investigation the additional grid independency are pre performed for bh and sp simulations for fr 0 45 0 60 and the results both shows the monotonic convergence for the realistic wave environment the sea state ii was adopted as sea condition without the headwind the fixed rotor revolution of case4 case5 and case6 in stage ii is the corresponding sp point to the speed of fr 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 in calm water in consideration of the inconsistency of the initial speed in different simulations the abscissa in the following figures does not use the dimensionless expression but directly take simulated time instead the ordinate is consistent with section 4 1 fig 18 a shows the change chart of the dimensionless ship speed in two stages after entering the second stage with the fixed revolution of the corresponding sp point the hull speed decreases rapidly and the degree of fluctuation of each curve differs but it keeps on fluctuating around the value 0 93 which shows that in the short crested wave condition the decrease of speed is mainly affected by the sea conditions and has little correlation with the initial ship speed fig 18 c d display the comparison diagram of added resistance coefficient and added waterjet thrust coefficient taking the mean value of each curve in stage i the average added resistance coefficient in case4 case6 are 1 82 2 41 and 6 91 respectively which shows that in a specific sea condition there is the peak added resistance coefficient at a particular intermediate speed similar to the analysis process of sea state effects in section 4 1 the stabled trimaran speed coefficient u in case4 case6 has little difference as we can see the mass flow rate of the waterjet duct at high speed is significantly higher than that at low speed and the same is true for the jet velocity vj of the nozzle which indicates that the water thrust is mainly affected by the rotor revolution at the sp point the average added waterjet thrust coefficients of case 4 case 6 in stage i are 1 42 3 65 and 11 25 respectively fig 19 illustrate that the dimensionless attitudes curves have few differences for case4 case6 the frequency distribution curves shows that the attitudes amplitude around the frequency 0 5hz 1 5 hz almost kept the same which indicates that the initial speed has less influence on the amplitude of the trimaran attitudes and the amplitude is mainly determined by the sea condition of the short crested waves as shown in fig 19 the average thrust deduction fraction for case4 case6 are 0 069 0 107 and 0 155 which means the thrust deduction performance of trimaran is greatly reduced when traveling in short crested waves at high speeds 4 3 the head wind effects in the last wind effects group of case7 case9 the wind wave joint influence is considered sea state ii and initial speed fr 0 30 are still selected as the fixed parameters and three headwind conditions of 1 04 m s 1 95 m s and 2 51 m s are employed in the simulations as shown in fig 20 a in order to study the detail effect of wind conditions on the trimaran performance case2 without wind effect is added into the speed loss comparison during the first stage of speed maintenance all the simulations literately run with the corresponding additional wind speed to research the wind effects separately the contrast curves of speed coefficient rpm caw and cgt show that the fluctuation and change trend is nearly the same under different wind conditions in the same short crested wave environment the curve moves down in order with the increase of wind speed that is meant the hull speed decreases more severely which also makes the case with lower wind conditions encounter the wave ahead earlier the horizontal position of the curve appears with the increase of wind speed fig 21 shows the direct comparison of this hysteresis under four wind conditions when the abscissa value reaches 6 6 the wave peak a in the figure is at the stern position in case2 without wind consideration as the speed loss increases with the increase of wind condition the position of wave peak a delay forward gradually until it approaches at the amidship at case9 and the same wave peak b in front of the bow also reflects this phenomenon fig 22 shows the comparison of pitch heave and thrust deduction fraction under different wind conditions the two attitudes both get the high consistent frequency distribution curves for the three winds which indicates that the wind is the minor aspect to effect the motions compared with the speed and sea state for the thrust deduction fraction t the three mean value give as 0 040 0 045 and 0 030 the average speed loss percentage 1 u 100 of case7 case9 are 7 0 9 0 12 5 and 15 0 in turn by subtracting the wave induced speed loss of case2 from the total speed loss in case7 case9 for considering only wind induced component the influence of each wind condition on the speed loss under the simulated sea condition is obtained which is 2 0 5 5 and 8 0 in turn accounting for the percentage of 22 2 44 0 and 53 3 in total effects respectively the present computed wind induced speed loss percentage in case8 b n 5 and case9 b n 6 matched well with the kim s results kim et al 2017b where he estimated the speed loss of the s175 ship model in b n 6 based random head waves when fr 0 25 and fr 0 286 the speed loss proportion due to wind could up to 47 9 and 47 4 of total the trimaran attitudes curves and the so caused added resistance curves show a similar variation tendency due to the same initial sea state environment and the lateral position delay of different curves with the increase of wind conditions is shown in fig 20 as listed in table 7 under the three wind conditions the added resistance coefficient increases in turn and the wind induced added resistance proportion is 12 5 22 2 and 30 5 respectively indicating that the wind tends to play a increasing role after the wind speed gradually increases similar to the dimensionless speed coefficient curve the added waterjet thrust coefficient and thrust deduction fraction curve also shows the same trend under the combined effect of wind and wave the wind induced effects to the average added waterjet thrust coefficient are 22 8 31 1 and 41 6 details listed in table 7 show the speed loss mean added resistance mean added waterjet thrust mean thrust deduction fraction due to the joint effects and wind induced proportion the results reveal that the wind induced effects on resistance propulsion and hull speed are notable especially while the wind speed exceeds the traveling speed the wind induced speed loss could even exceed one half of the total eventually based on the above analysis and discussion all the calculated trimaran performance results on average in 9 cases of the three comparison groups are listed in table 8 5 conclusion this research proposes a practical direct urans cfd approach to establish the short crested waves based real ocean environment and evaluate the free running vessel s speed loss and propulsion performance under corresponding wave conditions by applying the eom based wave forcing zone pid controlled propulsor and bfm based propulsion approach meanwhile the validation process for the simulated waves and free running model have been performed by comparing the theory and model test results finally based on the above techniques and approach simulations have been carried out on a waterjet propelled trimaran in short crested head waves the speed loss and propulsion performance considering sea state effects speed effects and wind effects are researched and analyzed the conclusions of this work are summarized as follows 1 a urans cfd based random ocean seaway considering turbulent and viscous effects is established under sufficient accuracy which provides a reliable basis for the ship wave interactions 2 free running model appended with pid controller and body force model was validated to be an applicable model for the vessel speed varied simulations especially for the high revolution propulsor appended model which reaches convergence more quickly with reasonable grids 3 the speed loss and performance numerical results of sea state effects speed effects and wind effects on the trimaran free running model in short crested head waves table 8 indicates that the speed loss coefficient has an initial speed independence and mainly related to the waves and wind conditions especially while the wind speed exceeds the vessel speed the wind effects could cover one half of total while for the real time waterjet thrust as the traveling speed increased both the three effects have deteriorated the waterjet propulsion performance especially at high speed 4 the present study provides a practical approach for the performance evaluation of the free running vessel in a random seaway there are still more efforts should be made to improve and enrich the research in future firstly the hydrodynamic performance curves of the propulsor are assumed as the same in waves and calm water and the differences between the two conditions will be further researched in future secondly the waterjet rotor performance curves used in this paper is different from the method solves the waterjet performance by simulating the whole waterjet pump system the difference between the two ways is worthy to further researched thirdly the present simulations of the trimaran in short crested waves are belong to the short term prediction the simulation time will be increased for further research moreover the waterjet system model test and the free running waterjet propelled trimaran model test in regular waves and short crested waves will be performed for the further verification and validation of the present free running numerical

110016 india department of applied mechanics indian institute of technology delhi hauz khas new delhi 110016 india corresponding author three dimensional wake transitions for a rectangular cylinder near a moving wall at the gap ratio g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 0 have been studied for 0 5 ar aspect ratio width height of cylinder 2 0 using dns and linear stability analysis mode a for all g d values mode b for g d 0 4 and mode c for g d 0 4 and 0 5 are observed for different values of ar a change in the flow rate near the cylinder and shear layer interactions are identified as the causes of wake transitions interaction of shear layers is a dominant factor for low values of g d 0 5 and high values of ar 1 25 for g d 0 5 three dimensionality first decreases for ar 1 25 then increases with ar and flows are periodic for all values of ar for g d 0 4 and 1 0 the flows are periodic for ar 1 25 and ar 0 75 respectively the flow transition is supercritical for all values of ar at ar 1 5 and at ar 0 5 for g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the wave number of the unstable mode has been obtained using floquet analysis and is quite close to the dns results keywords wake transition rectangular cylinder quasi periodic supercritical floquet analysis 1 introduction flow past a bluff body is a fundamental problem of engineering interest and it is observed in various practical applications murakami and mochida 1995 sohankar et al 2000 arif and hasan 2019 flows past a building bridge span and offshore structures such as an oil platform and risers can be studied by simplifying these as a flow past a bluff body cao and tamura 2016 jin et al 2019 the most common bluff bodies encountered in practical applications have a square or a circular cross section in particular a bluff body with a square cross section possesses some interesting flow characteristics due to the presence of sharp corners sharma and eswaran 2004 it involves flow separation at the trailing and leading edges with the formation of von kármán vortices three dimensional transitions with the formations of mode a and mode b vortices with an increase in reynolds number re the onset of three dimensionality and various mode transitions have a significant effect on force coefficients and shedding frequencies jiang and cheng 2018 force coefficients and vortex shedding frequencies in turn play an important role in the lives of various flow structures however in real life applications an isolated square cylinder is rarely used it is often surrounded by nearby objects such as a bluff body near a seabed or near a ground which can be considered as a wall a boundary layer is formed on such wall and its nature thickness laminar or turbulent etc significantly influences the flow bosch et al 1996 ranjan and dewan 2017 bailey et al 2002a the characteristics of the wall boundary layer near the cylinder depend on several factors such as reynolds number inlet velocity profile and the distance of the cylinder from the inlet due to a large number of parameters involved it is difficult to study the influence of each parameter on flow therefore in order to study the effect of wall on flow systematically the boundary layer is removed by moving the wall with the free stream velocity with the absence of the wall boundary layer now flow is relatively simple and it can be studied thoroughly in the present study influences of the shape of the square cylinder aspect ratio and its distance from the wall gap ratio have been studied for a fixed value of re by placing the cylinder near a moving wall the present configuration has many practical applications in chemical industries and underwater research vehicle the flow past a moving autonomous underwater vehicle of rectangular cross section aguirre et al 2017 near a seabed can be considered as a flow past a rectangular cylinder near a moving wall where the vehicle is stationary and the seabed is moving when the frame of reference is attached to the vehicle a number of studies have been performed to study the onset of three dimensionality in the wake of a square cylinder using direct numerical simulation dns and linear stability analysis robichaux et al 1999 saha et al 2003 bai and alam 2018 for an isolated square cylinder the onset of three dimensionality occurs at re 165 in the form of mode a vortices with vortex dislocations jiang et al 2018 sheard et al 2009 with an increase in re mode b vortices are formed at re 190 jiang et al 2018 park and yang 2016 similar observations are reported through experimental studies at re 200 luo et al 2003 2007 these mode b vortices along with mode a vortices are present in the flow up to re 210 for re 210 mode a vortices disappear and mode b vortices only are present in the flow a new mode called mode qp was observed in the flow through floquet analysis choi et al 2012 sheard 2011 a few studies only have been reported on the influence of wall on three dimensional 3 d wake transition of a square cylinder mahir 2009 studied 3 d flow past a square cylinder near a stationary wall and observed that the presence of a wall caused disappearance of mode a and appearance of mode b vortices at a lower value of re compared to the case of an isolated cylinder bailey et al 2002b studied the influence of a stationary wall at a high value of re and reported that for the gap heights close to the vortex shedding suppression probability of the occurrence of vortex dislocations decreases rao et al 2013a studied the influence of the gap ratio on flow transitions for a translating circular cylinder near a stationary wall which is physically similar to a flow past a stationary circular cylinder near a moving wall they observed that for low values of the gap ratio g d 0 25 three dimensionality occurred directly from a two dimensional steady state and for g d 0 25 two dimensional steady flow first became unsteady and then three dimensionality occurred jiang et al 2017 studied the influence of a moving wall on three dimensional wake transition of a circular cylinder using dns they observed the suppression of vortex dislocations for g d 1 and reported a decrease in three dimensionality in the flow for re in the range of 225 275 tanweer et al 2020 studied flow near a moving wall using dns and observed that the onset of three dimensionality occurred at a lower value of re compared to that in an isolated square cylinder they also observed mode qp vortices to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on the influence of the aspect ratio on 3 d wake transition and their characteristics such as periodic or non periodic and subcritical or supercritical behaviours for a flow past a square cylinder near a moving wall since for g d 2 the influence of the wall is quite weak and for g d 0 3 the influence of the wall shear layer is quite strong and flow transitions cannot be seen clearly tanweer et al 2020 in the present study three moderate values of g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 are considered the flow is studied for six different values of ar 0 5 ar 2 0 at a constant value of re 160 which is slightly less than re cr 165 8 for the onset of three dimensionality for an isolated square cylinder problem statement formulation and computational method are presented in section 2 in section 3 results and discussion are presented finally conclusions are drawn from the study 2 numerical method and computational details 2 1 direct numerical simulations a schematic diagram of the flow configuration is presented in fig 1 the gap height between the cylinder and the moving wall is denoted as g the wall is moving with the free stream velocity u in the positive x direction the cylinder has dimensions of l width d height and 10d in x y and z directions respectively fig 1 b the aspect ratio and gap ratio are defined as l d and g d respectively here d is taken as the reference length scale and hence reynolds number is defined as r e u d ν here l u l d and l h denote the distance between the inlet and front surface of the cylinder between the outlet and the rear surface of the cylinder and between the top boundary and the top surface of the cylinder respectively the flow field has been investigated for 0 5 ar 2 0 and g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 for a constant value of re 160 the governing equations for incompressible and newtonian fluid are written as 1 continuity 1 u i x i 0 2 momentum 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j the non dimensional variables are defined as x i x i d t u t d u i u i u and p p ρ u 2 where the quantities with the overbar denote dimensional variables boundary conditions inlet uniform velocity u 1 and v w 0 here u v and w denote velocities in x y and z directions respectively outlet advective φ t u φ x 0 where φ is u v and w cylinder no slip u v w 0 top symmetry u y v w 0 moving wall free stream velocity u 1 v w 0 the cyclic boundary conditions were imposed in the spanwise direction in order to match the conditions for flow past a cylinder of an infinite spanwise length since interactions of a small number of unstable modes only govern the dynamics of the flow a moderate value of the spanwise length is sufficient to computationally capture the flow for an infinite spanwise length henderson 1997 in the present dns study the spanwise length is taken as 10d which is large enough to capture the reported modes mode a mode b mode c etc that evolve in the case of flow past a square cylinder a finite volume based open source library openfoam www openfoam org is adopted for computations and its incompressible dns solver called icofoam is used for the transient terms crank nicolson scheme is used the convective terms are discretized using a third order cubic scheme and for diffusion terms the second order central difference scheme is used the equations are solved using pimple algorithm a hybrid algorithm of simple and piso holzmann 2016 2 1 1 grid independence study a non uniform grid was formed in the domain where it was fine in the vicinity of the cylinder and in near wake region and it was coarse in the regions away from the cylinder fig 2 the size of the smallest grid was 0 005d and the grid growth ratio was less than 1 1 in the spanwise direction a uniform grid was used fig 2 b a grid independence study was performed where the time mean and r m s values of drag coefficient c d and c d rms and lift coefficient c l and c l rms and strouhal number st were obtained for different grid sizes and these results are summarized in table 1 the number of grid points in the spanwise direction was determined based on the previous reported study for a square cylinder near a moving wall tanweer et al 2020 based on this study m2 mesh was chosen for the computations for an assessment of the grid resolution kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 has been calculated here ν and ε denote the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and dissipation rate of kinetic energy respectively in the far wake region the value of η lies between 0 1d to 0 12d which is comparable to the largest grid size this behavior shows that the grid used is fine enough for the present dns study 2 1 2 time independence study a time step independence study was performed where c d c d rms and c l c l rms and st were obtained for different values of the time step and these results are summarized in table 2 after performing the time step independence study table 2 a time step of 1 6 10 3 was chosen where the maximum courant number co in the domain was less than 0 8 2 2 linear stability analysis floquet analysis was employed to determine the onset of three dimensionality in the flow at re 160 for computations of the base flow and perturbation fields a high order spectral element based open source code nektar cantwell et al 2015 was used the flow domain used for the computations of the base flow is presented in fig 3 on the basis of the reported studies rao et al 2013b tanweer et al 2019 in the present case the boundaries were placed quite far from the cylinder an open source meshing tool gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2007 was used for the mesh generation approximately 5000 elements were used in the computational domain and seven node points were used within each element a sixth order polynomial the governing equations for the base flow and floquet analysis are reported by many researchers in detail barkley and henderson 1996 ryan et al 2005 a high order neuman boundary condition for pressure was used at all boundaries except at the outlet at the outlet a zero pressure boundary condition was used at the top boundary stress free condition was imposed a mesh independence study for the base flow was carried out by increasing the number of node points in each element and it is presented in table 3 on the basis of the obtained results m2 mesh was used for the base flow computations base flow fields were stored over 32 equi spaced time intervals in a single base flow period for floquet analysis modified arnoldi method was used to compute the leading eigenmodes 3 results and discussion the numerical model used for dns in the present study has been validated by comparing the obtained results with the reported results for two and three dimensional flows past a square cylinder in a free stream and reported by tanweer et al 2020 the numerical model used for linear stability analysis has been validated with the available results for a three dimensional wake transition in a flow past an isolated square cylinder using floquet analysis robichaux et al 1999 the agreement between the reported results and the present results are good fig 4 first the onset of three dimensionality with the formation of different modes for 0 5 ar 2 and g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 using dns is presented in this section thereafter characteristics of flow transition such as periodic or non periodic and subcritical or super critical behaviours are examined influences of ar and g d on the force coefficients are discussed finally a linear stability analysis is performed and the results obtained are compared with the dns results 3 1 three dimensional wake transitions for an isolated square cylinder the onset of three dimensionality occurs at re cr 165 8 jiang et al 2018 where mode a vortices with vortex dislocations are formed the presence of a moving wall influences the flow in two ways i velocity in the gap region may increase or decrease and ii shear layers formed at the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder are asymmetric due to the presence of the wall in the present study a constant value of re 160 re cr has been considered although re re cr in all the considered cases three dimensionality occurs at this value of re in most of the cases either due to an acceleration of the flow in the gap or due to interactions of the vortices with the wall shear layer 3 1 1 wake transitions at g d 0 4 at g d 0 4 the wake transition is quite sensitive to the aspect ratio ar at ar 0 5 three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the far downstream region when flow has fully developed mode a vortices are observed in the near wake too fig 5 a mode a vortices stretch the braid shear layer between the primary vortices due to this stretching hyperbolic instability occurs and mode b vortices are also formed between mode a vortices these mode b vortices are quite weak and decay downstream in the far wake vortices are highly ordered where a new vortex pair is formed between each pair of mode a vortices fig 5 a at ar 0 75 mode a vortices are formed in the near wake region fig 5 b these vortices get weaker and decay in the intermediate wake region new mode a vortices which have opposite orientation with respect to the near wake mode a are formed in the far wake region similar to the case of ar 0 5 mode b vortices are also observed in the vicinity of the cylinder and these vortices decay in the near wake region however unlike the case of ar 0 5 in this case no new vortex pair is observed in the far wake region at ar 1 and 1 25 new vortex pairs of length 2 5d are formed these vortices seem to be subharmonic and are called mode c vortices fig 6 a these vortices show period doubling phenomenon where after each time period t vortices change their sign fig 6 b and after time interval of 2t the same vortices are formed fig 6 c the period doubling phenomenon can be observed by monitoring the velocity signal at the location 1 75d 0 9d 5d in the near wake region and the lift coefficient signal it can be observed from fig 7 that the time period of the spanwise velocity is twice the time period of the lift coefficient and it confirms the period doubling phenomenon it is believed that in the case of a square cylinder mode c vortices are formed due to an asymmetric vortex shedding from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder this behavior is the reason that for a square cylinder in a free stream where vortex shedding is symmetric mode c vortices cannot be observed by dns however if the square cylinder is placed at some angle from the free stream flow then vortex shedding is asymmetric and mode c vortices can be formed similarly in the present case due to the presence of the wall vortex shedding is asymmetric and hence formation of mode c vortices can be observed at ar 1 5 mode b vortices are formed in the flow fig 5 c these vortices are fairly regular up to two layers in the downstream direction and thereafter these become chaotic similar to the case with ar 1 5 at ar 2 mode b vortices are observed in the near wake region and the flow becomes chaotic in the far wake region for a square cylinder in a free stream mode b transition occurs at a higher value of re 185 compared to mode a transition re 165 7 it can be observed from fig 8 that for a fixed value of g d 0 4 the mean flow velocity in the gap region at x l 2 decreases with an increase in ar which causes a decrease in the effective re near the cylinder thus it can be said that unlike the square cylinder in a free stream in the present case mode b transition at ar 1 5 and 2 occurs at a lower effective re compared to mode a transition at ar 0 5 a possible reason behind the onset of mode b vortices is that at a high value of ar the interactions between the shear layer near the cylinder surface and the wall shear layer increases fig 9 which may cause the formation of mode b vortices it can be clearly observed in fig 9 that at low values of ar 0 5 and 0 75 the interaction between the shear layer is weak while it is much stronger at high values of ar 1 5 and 2 this interaction can be shown quantitatively in terms of enstrophy which is presented in the next sub section 3 1 2 wake transitions at g d 0 5 wake transitions at g d 0 5 for different values of ar are quite interesting at ar 0 5 the wake transition occurs with the formation of mode a vortices fig 10 a in the near wake region mode b vortices are also present between mode a vortices and these decay in the far wake region at ar 0 75 two different wake transitions occur and these can be observed in fig 11 where the spanwise velocity is sampled with time at the location 1 25d 1d 5d initially the wake transition transition 1 occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the near wake as well as in the far wake regions not shown here this flow regime persists for a quite long time period up to 2200 non dimensional time thereafter another transition transition 2 occurs and this has been demarcated by a red line fig 11 this is an example of multiple bifurcations which arises due to the temporal instability in this flow regime in the near wake mode a vortices can be observed while in the far wake no clear structure can be realized fig 10 b these two flow regimes are further investigated by plotting the phase portraits between streamwise u and transverse v velocities at the location 1 25d 1d 5d for transition 1 flow regime phase portrait is a closed loop which shows that the flow is periodic fig 12 a in the power spectra a single fundamental frequency which is also the dominant frequency and its harmonics only are present fig 12 for transition 2 flow regime phase portrait consists of two non overlapping closed loops which show that it is also a periodic flow fig 12 b the dominant frequency in the power spectra is twice that of the fundamental frequency and is equal to the dominant frequency in transition 1 flow fig 12 since the fundamental frequency in transition 2 flow is twice that of the fundamental frequency in transition 1 flow it indicates that in transition 2 flow velocity will repeat its pattern after 2t where t is the time taken in flow 1 to repeat its velocity pattern at ar 1 the flow transition occurs in the form of mode a vortices which are highly ordered in the near wake as well as in the far wake regions with a further increase in ar the onset of three dimensionality in the flow is likely to suppress a possible reason behind this behaviour is that with an increase in ar the velocity in the gap region decreases which decreases the effective re with a further increase in ar again the tendency of 3 d wake transition increases since velocity in the gap region decreases with an increase in ar fig 8 it indicates that some other factors are responsible for the onset of three dimensionality the interactions of the shear layers have been quantified in terms of enstrophy 0 5 ω 2 here ω denotes vorticity in the gap region enstrophy sampled at the location l 2 g 2 5d increases with an increase in ar fig 13 it clearly shows that interactions of shear layers increase with ar at a fixed value of g d this is the reason that three dimensionality increases despite a decrease in the mean velocity in the gap region for ar 1 5 the flow is three dimensional where quite weak mode a like streamwise vortices are present in the near wake region for ar 2 the wake transition occurs in the form of mode c vortices fig 10 c similar to the case of g d 0 4 and ar 1 25 fig 6 these vortices also show period doubling phenomenon but in this case five pairs of streamwise vortices form which manifests that wavelength of the vortices are 2d which is smaller than the wavelength 2 5d of the mode c vortices for g d 0 4 and ar 1 25 the phase portrait between u v sampled at the location 2 5d 1d 5d consists of two non overlapping closed loops and the power spectra shows that the dominant frequency is twice that of the fundamental frequency which also confirms the period doubling phenomenon fig 14 3 1 3 wake transitions at g d 1 in comparison to the cases with g d 0 4 and 0 5 the three dimensional wake transition at g d 1 is less sensitive to ar the reason behind this behaviour is that at a high value of g d the interactions between the shear layer near the cylinder and wall shear layer is quite weak and it does not have much influence on the wake transition and hence velocity in the gap region is a dominant factor only at ar 0 5 three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the near wake where mode b vortices are also formed between mode a vortices fig 15 a these mode b vortices decay downstream in the far wake region some new vortices are formed which are well ordered at ar 0 75 again three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices but in this case no mode b vortices are formed fig 15 b further in this case some new vortices are formed in the far wake with a further increase in ar highly ordered mode a vortices are formed in the near wake as well as in the far wake however the strength of the vortices decreases with an increase in the value of ar at ar 1 5 mode a vortices are quite weak in the near wake at ar 2 no three dimensionality occurs and flow remains two dimensional it can be concluded from the above discussions that the velocity in the gap region and the interactions of the shear layer in the vicinity of the cylinder surface with the wall shear layer are the two main factors that influence the flow at low values of g d 0 4 and 0 5 both factors are dominant with an increase in g d the influence of shear layer interactions decreases and at a high value of g d 1 the velocity in the gap region only is a dominant factor with an increase in ar the velocity in the gap region decreases and shear layer interactions increase this behavior is the reason why for g d 0 4 mode b vortices are formed at ar 1 5 and 2 despite a decrease in velocity in the gap region and for g d 0 5 after the suppression of three dimensionality at ar 1 25 again the three dimensionality occurs at ar 1 5 in the form of mode a vortices another interesting finding is that mode a vortices are formed without the formation of vortex dislocations the above observations are summarized in table 4 3 2 phase portrait and power spectra periodic or quasi periodic in order to examine whether the flow is periodic or quasi periodic phase portrait between streamwise and transverse velocities and power spectra of transverse velocity have been plotted fig 16 shows the phase portrait between streamwise and transverse velocities sampled at a point l 0 5d 1 5d 5d for g d 1 at various values of ar for ar 0 5 the phase portrait is a closed loop which shows that the flow is periodic fig 16 a similar observation can be made from the power spectra of transverse velocity fig 16 b where a single dominant frequency and its harmonics only are present in the power spectra for ar 0 75 the attractor morphology in the phase portrait is cyclic and covers a large banded area in the phase space fig 16 c however it will never cover the entire interior area of the loop even if it is plotted for a quite large time the fact that it is periodic can be seen more clearly in the power spectra which shows a single dominant frequency and its harmonics indicating that the flow is periodic fig 16 d since the flow is periodic the phase trajectory will come back to exactly the same point after a certain time period for ar 1 and 1 25 the trajectory in the phase space follows a quasi periodic path fig 16 e the power spectra have more than one fundamental frequencies and sub harmonic frequencies fig 16 f for ar 1 5 the phase portrait seems to be similar in morphology to the phase portrait at ar 0 75 fig 16 g however at this value of ar the flow is quasi periodic and the phase trajectory will never come back to the same point after a certain time period but will come close to that point this behaviour can be seen clearly in the power spectra where many fundamental frequencies are present fig 16 h if the phase portrait at this value of ar is plotted for a quite large time it will cover the entire interior area of the loop the fact that the flow is periodic at ar 0 75 and it is quasi periodic at ar 1 5 despite having similar morphology can be seen more clearly from the poincaré map fig 17 in poincaré map we sample the data periodically t and plot these values u t v t only in the u v plane for aperiodic system the phase portrait is quite messy in general whereas poincaré map simplifies things and makes the data easier to analyze for the dynamics of the system for ar 0 75 the poincaré map contains some distinct points while for ar 1 5 the poincaré map contains a large number of points which make a closed loop indicating that the trajectory will never come back to its original position for the gap ratio g d 0 5 unlike g d 1 where the flow is aperiodic at ar 1 here the flow is periodic at all the considered values of ar however at some values of ar the dominant frequency is equal to the fundamental frequency fig 12 c while at some other values of ar the dominant frequency is twice that of the fundamental frequency fig 14 for the gap ratio g d 0 4 the flow is periodic up to ar 1 25 and the trajectory in the phase portrait is a closed curve fig 18 a in the power spectra a single dominant peak and its harmonics only are present fig 18 b for ar 1 5 trajectory in the phase portrait does not show a well repeated pattern fig 18 c it indicates that the flow is aperiodic and from the power spectra it can be realized that it is a quasi periodic flow where more than one fundamental frequencies are present fig 18 d similar observations are made for ar 2 it can be concluded from the above discussions that for a fixed value of the gap ratio the flows are periodic at low values of ar and their tendency to become quasi periodic increases at high values of ar the transition from a periodic to a quasi periodic flow occurs at a higher value of ar for a low value of g d 0 4 compared to a high value of g d 1 with a decrease in the gap ratio the tendency of the flow to be periodic first increases and then decreases from g d 1 to 0 5 and then 0 4 the above observations are summarized in table 5 3 3 nature of transition flow transition for a square cylinder placed in a free stream can be subcritical or supercritical in nature the presence of a hysteresis zone is an important characteristic of subcritical transitions where the system can remain in more than one state and it depends on the initial state of the system therefore a subcritical transition shows hysteretic characteristics the hysteresis phenomenon cannot occur in a supercritical transition where the asymptotic state is independent of the initial state of the system gopalakrishnan and sujith 2014 flow transition to mode b shows non hysteretic character while mode a transition shows both hysteretic and non hysteretic natures for a confined flow with a short spanwise length mode a transition is supercritical non hysteretic while for an unconfined flow with a large spanwise length it is subcritical hysteretic in nature jiang et al 2018 in order to examine the flow transition whether it is subcritical or supercritical two approaches can be used it can be examined by performing direct numerical simulation or using stuart landau model in the present study stuart landau model is used to examine the nature of transition this model can be written in terms of amplitude a of perturbation near the onset of instability sheard et al 2004 3 d a d t σ i ω a l 1 i c a 2 a o a 5 here σ and ω denote the linear amplification rate and angular frequency respectively which are independent of the position close to transition and in this sense these are global parameters dušek et al 1994 a denotes a complex number and its real part can be written as 4 d a d t σ a l a 3 equation 4 can be rewritten as 5 d l o g a d t σ l a 2 here l denotes the level of nonlinear saturation the sign of l indicates the nature of bifurcation the flow will be non hysteretic in nature for l 0 which shows a supercritical transition for l 0 the transition will be subcritical and the flow will be hysteretic in nature the sign of l can be obtained by plotting the graph between d l o g a d t and a 2 and checking the sign of the slope a positive slope will provide a negative l and vice versa the amplitude a can be calculated in many ways dušek et al 1994 landau and lifshitz 1987 zielinska and wesfreid 1995 in the present study spanwise velocity z velocity has been used for the calculation of a the value of l depends on the point at which the velocity has been monitored but it is expected that its sign will remain the same thompson et al 2001a the velocity has been sampled at a distance of 1d in the downstream direction from the center of the cylinder fig 19 presents the plot between d l o g a d t and a 2 for g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 for different values of the aspect ratio for g d 0 4 the slopes are negative for all the considered cases and hence l is positive it shows that at g d 0 4 the transition is supercritical and the flow is non hysteretic for g d 0 5 the slopes are negative for all the cases except for ar 2 where it is positive this behavior shows that for ar 2 the transition is subcritical and the flow is hysteretic while it is supercritical and non hysteretic for all other cases for g d 1 the slope is negative for ar 0 5 and it is positive for all the other cases this behavior shows that transition is supercritical for ar 0 5 and it is subcritical for other cases it can be concluded from the above findings that for low values of the gap ratio transition is supercritical and the flow is non hysteretic and with an increase in the gap ratio the tendency of the flow to become hysteretic increases similarly for low values of the aspect ratio the tendency of the flow to be non hysteretic is large and it decreases with an increase in the gap ratio the above observations are summarized in table 6 3 4 force coefficients a change in the aspect ratio has a significant influence on the force coefficients variations in the time averaged force coefficients with ar for different values of g d are presented in fig 20 c d decreases with an increment in g d as well as with an increment in ar fig 20 a for g d 1 a large decrease in c d with an increment in ar can be observed for low values of ar while for high values of ar it is less sensitive to the value of ar and decrement in c d is quite small with an increment in ar at ar 0 5 c d is independent of g d while at high values of ar it varies strongly with g d a possible reason for this behavior is that at ar 0 5 the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of the cylinder is approximately equal for all the values of g d fig 21 a it decreases slightly near the lower part and increases slightly near the upper part of the surfaces with an increment in g d which makes the average pressure difference and hence pressure drag to be independent of g d at high values of ar the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces decreases along the entire surface with an increment in g d fig 21 c which creates a difference in the value of c d at different values of g d the pressure difference at low values of ar is higher than that at high values of ar which makes the total drag to decrease with an increment in ar due to the presence of the moving wall c l is positive away from the wall for all the cases except for ar 0 5 at g d 1 where it is slightly negative fig 20 b c l monotonically increases with ar for all values of g d while it decreases with an increment in g d variation in c l is rapid for low values of g d 0 4 and 0 5 where it varies linearly with ar while it varies slowly with ar at a high value of g d 1 similar to c d c l is nearly independent of g d at ar 0 5 where the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces varies slightly with g d fig 21 b at high values of ar fig 21 d this difference changes with g d and causes c l to be different for various values of g d for ar 1 5 the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces is negative along the entire surface at g d 0 4 which causes a high value of c l 3 5 linear stability analysis in this section a linear stability analysis has been performed to examine the onset of three dimensionality in the flow since the base flow is periodic at re 160 floquet analysis has been used to examine the growth of perturbations where 32 snapshots between one time period of the base flow have been used first the influence of the gap ratio g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 is studied at a low value of ar 0 5 then the influence of the aspect ratio is examined at g d 0 4 and 0 5 3 5 1 influence of g d at ar 0 5 base flow and growth of perturbations at ar 0 5 is quite interesting for all the three gap ratios for g d 0 4 at ar 0 5 the base flow can be divided into two different flow regimes in the near wake region vortex shedding occurs from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder in the form of kármán vortex street at some distance away from the cylinder the vortices shed from the lower surface of the cylinder merge with the wall shear layer and a single row of vortex street only shed from the upper surface of the cylinder are present in the flow fig 22 a this vortex street decays downstream similar flow is obtained for g d 0 5 however the kármán vortex street persists up to a slightly larger downstream distance compared to that in the case of g d 0 4 fig 22 b for g d 1 at ar 0 5 the base flow is quite interesting and can be divided in three different flow regimes fig 22 c in the vicinity of the cylinder the vortex shedding occurs in the form of kármán vortex street in the intermediate wake region vortices of the same sign merge with each other and form a two layered vortices pattern further downstream x 35 a secondary vortex street is formed due to a coupling between the upper shear layer and the wall shear layer the floquet multipliers of unstable modes are real positive numbers in all the three cases for g d 0 4 the perturbations grow in the single row of vortex street region created by the upper shear layer of the cylinder and decay far downstream fig 23 a the perturbations grow in the vortex core which is a signature of an elliptic instability the unstable mode has a spanwise wavelength of 4 8d the fact that the perturbations grow in the far wake region is consistent with the present dns results where the onset of three dimensionality was observed in the form of mode a vortices far downstream however unlike the dns results where in the far wake region a new mode was observed between mode a vortices and in the near wake region mode b vortices appeared fig 5 a no new unstable mode is observed in the linear stability analysis this behavior shows that in the dns results a new mode is formed due to nonlinear interactions between mode a vortices since growth of perturbations occurs away from the wall the three dimensional modes are highly ordered even far downstream fig 5 a for g d 0 5 perturbations grow in the kármán vortex street region in the vicinity of the cylinder as well as in the single row vortex street region close to the cylinder the unstable mode interacts with the wall shear layer which distorts the mode therefore unlike the case of g d 0 4 in this case modes are not highly ordered fig 10 similar to the case of g d 0 4 the unstable mode has a spanwise wavelength of 4 8d for g d 1 perturbations grow in the kármán vortex street region close to the cylinder as well as in the two layered vortex street region in the two layered vortex street region the perturbations grow in the upper shear layer while in the lower shear layer perturbations are damped due to the presence of the wall similar to the cases of g d 0 4 and 0 5 in this case also perturbations grow in the vortex core the spanwise wavelength of the mode is 4 2d which is slightly smaller than that of the mode in cases of g d 0 4 and 0 5 3 5 2 influence of ar at g d 0 4 for g d 0 4 at ar 0 75 the growth of perturbations occurs in the vortex core which indicates the onset of elliptic instability fig 24 a in this case the growth can also be observed in the braid shear layers in the near wake region this growth could be even more intensive than in the elliptic regions of the flow and the elliptic instability type structure can be the secondary effect for mode a appearance aleksyuk and shkadov 2018 thompson et al 2001b in the present case mode has a spanwise length of 4 8d wavenumber β 1 3 and floquet multiplier of this mode is a positive real number the perturbation modes are stronger in the near wake region and decay downstream unlike the dns case fig 5 b in this case no mode b vortices are formed the reason behind this behaviour is that in dns due to the formation of mode a vortices the braid shear layers are stretched that cause the onset of mode b vortices for ar 1 the three dimensionality occurs in the form of a quasi periodic mode which has a spanwise wavelength of 2 7d fig 24 b the eigenvalue of the unstable mode is a complex number with a non zero imaginary part however from the dns results it seems that the three dimensional mode is sub harmonic fig 6 blackburn and lopez 2003 have shown through linear stability analysis that these modes have complex values of floquet multiplier and behave as a standing or traveling waves in fact the quasi periodic mode and subharmonic mode branches are inherently linked the quasi periodic mode is replaced by the subharmonic mode when a finite asymmetry occurs in the wake without the emergence of a different eigenvalue no noticeable change in the structures of quasi periodic and sub harmonic modes is detected sheard 2011 the growth of the perturbations occurs in the near wake region in the stretching shear layer near the moving wall these modes are present in the entire downstream region and change sign in each layer alternately which indicates its traveling wave nature similar results have been observed for ar 1 25 for ar 1 5 two unstable modes are observed one is a long wavelength lw mode and the other is a short wavelength sw mode at the spanwise wave numbers β of 1 1 and 4 5 respectively fig 24 both the modes are stronger in the near wake region the strength of lw mode is sustained in the far wake while the sw mode decays in the far wake region however amplitude of the sw mode is larger than that of the lw mode and therefore it is more unstable therefore transition to three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode b vortices with a spanwise wave length of 1 4d β 4 5 at this ar the perturbations grow in the braid shear layer in the near wake region which indicates the onset of the hyperbolic instability since the growth of the perturbations occurs close to the wall it indicates that the interactions of the shear layer with the wall plays a major role in the formation of mode b vortices similar to the case of ar 1 5 for ar 2 mode b vortices are formed however in this case mode b has a slightly smaller spanwise wavelength of 1 3d 3 5 3 influence of ar at g d 1 for g d 1 at ar 0 75 perturbations grow in the near wake region fig 25 the growth of the perturbations occurs in the vortex core the unstable mode has a wavelength of 4 2d and a real positive floquet multiplier the shed vortices are divided into two rows of vortices in the downstream region and these decay further downstream the reason for the formation of two rows of vortices can be found from the base flow in fig 26 the base flow can be divided in two different regimes in the near wake region vortices are shed in the form of kármán vortices and in the far wake region two rows of vortices are formed formation of two rows of vortices causes the creation of new vortices downstream which is evident from the dns results fig 15 b similar to ar 0 75 for high values of ar 1 1 25 and 1 5 perturbations grow in the vortex core in the near wake region but decay downstream fig 25 b the floquet multiplier of unstable mode for all these cases is a real positive number for higher values of ar the spanwise length of the unstable mode is 4 8d which is slightly higher compared to that in the case of ar 0 75 formation of two rows of vortices disappears for high values of ar the reason behind this behavior is that for high values of ar the formation of two rows of vortices shifts far downstream where the strength of the vortices is quite weak not shown here due to the absence of two rows of vortices the streamwise vortices are highly ordered even far downstream which can be observed from the dns results for g d 0 4 the growth rate of the perturbations with the wavenumber β has been plotted in fig 27 a for different values of ar it is evident from fig 27 a that for low values of ar 0 75 and 1 the curves have two peaks one close to β 1 1 5 which is called short wave number or long wave length lw mode and the other close to β 2 2 5 which is called intermediate wave length iw mode for ar 0 75 the lw mode is the most unstable while iw mode is stable with an increase in ar for ar 1 the growth rate of lw mode decreases and it becomes stable while the growth rate of iw mode increases and it becomes unstable for high values of ar 1 5 and 2 similar to low values of ar the curves have one peak corresponding to lw mode but the other peak occurs close to β 4 5 5 which is called the short wave length sw mode for ar 1 5 both modes are unstable but the growth rate of sw mode is greater than that of the lw mode therefore three dimensional transition occurs with the formation of sw mode for ar 2 the growth rate of lw mode decreases and it becomes stable and sw mode only is unstable for g d 1 the wake transitions are less sensitive to the value of ar the growth rate has two peaks between β 1 1 5 and 3 3 5 corresponding to large wavelength lw and intermediate wavelength iw modes respectively fig 27 b in all the cases lw mode is unstable while iw mode is stable for low values of ar 0 5 and 0 75 peaks occur at β 1 3 while at high values of ar 1 25 and 1 5 peaks occur at β 1 5 4 conclusions a detailed analysis has been performed to study the influence of gap and aspect ratios on three dimensional wake transitions of a square cylinder placed near a moving wall at a constant value of re both dns as well as linear stability analysis have been performed for examining the flow the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study three dimensional wake transition is highly influenced by velocity in the gap region and interactions of the shear layers velocity in the gap region is a dominant factor at low values of ar and at high values of g d while shear layer interactions is a dominant factor at high values of ar and low values of g d for a low value of the gap ratio g d 0 4 wake transitions are more sensitive to ar while for a high value of the gap ratio g d 1 these are less sensitive to ar for g d 0 5 at low values of ar three dimensionality in the flow decreases with an increases in ar due to a decrease in velocity in the gap region and flow becomes two dimensional at ar 1 25 with a further increase in ar three dimensionality in the flow increases due to an increase in interactions between cylinder shear layer and wall shear layer for low values of ar both mode a and mode b vortices are formed these mode b vortices are quite weak and are formed due to stretching of the braid shear layer between the primary vortices and do not sustain in the flow but decay rapidly in the wake mode b vortices are formed again at a high value of ar at g d 0 4 where these vortices are quite strong and sustain in the wake mode c vortices are observed in the flow for some values of ar and g d these vortices show period doubling phenomenon however from linear stability analysis it is observed that these vortices have complex floquet multiplier and therefore are quasi periodic in nature for low values of the gap ratio transition is supercritical and flow is non hysteretic and with an increase in the gap ratio the tendency of flow to become hysteretic increases similarly for low values of the aspect ratio the tendency of the flow to be non hysteretic is large and it decreases with an increase in the aspect ratio the drag coefficient decreases monotonically with an increment in ar while the lift coefficient increases monotonically with ar for a fixed value of ar both drag as well as lift coefficients decrease with an increase in g d both c d and c l are nearly independent

near a moving wall at the gap ratio g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 0 have been studied for 0 5 ar aspect ratio width height of cylinder 2 0 using dns and linear stability analysis mode a for all g d values mode b for g d 0 4 and mode c for g d 0 4 and 0 5 are observed for different values of ar a change in the flow rate near the cylinder and shear layer interactions are identified as the causes of wake transitions interaction of shear layers is a dominant factor for low values of g d 0 5 and high values of ar 1 25 for g d 0 5 three dimensionality first decreases for ar 1 25 then increases with ar and flows are periodic for all values of ar for g d 0 4 and 1 0 the flows are periodic for ar 1 25 and ar 0 75 respectively the flow transition is supercritical for all values of ar at ar 1 5 and at ar 0 5 for g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 0 respectively the wave number of the unstable mode has been obtained using floquet analysis and is quite close to the dns results keywords wake transition rectangular cylinder quasi periodic supercritical floquet analysis 1 introduction flow past a bluff body is a fundamental problem of engineering interest and it is observed in various practical applications murakami and mochida 1995 sohankar et al 2000 arif and hasan 2019 flows past a building bridge span and offshore structures such as an oil platform and risers can be studied by simplifying these as a flow past a bluff body cao and tamura 2016 jin et al 2019 the most common bluff bodies encountered in practical applications have a square or a circular cross section in particular a bluff body with a square cross section possesses some interesting flow characteristics due to the presence of sharp corners sharma and eswaran 2004 it involves flow separation at the trailing and leading edges with the formation of von kármán vortices three dimensional transitions with the formations of mode a and mode b vortices with an increase in reynolds number re the onset of three dimensionality and various mode transitions have a significant effect on force coefficients and shedding frequencies jiang and cheng 2018 force coefficients and vortex shedding frequencies in turn play an important role in the lives of various flow structures however in real life applications an isolated square cylinder is rarely used it is often surrounded by nearby objects such as a bluff body near a seabed or near a ground which can be considered as a wall a boundary layer is formed on such wall and its nature thickness laminar or turbulent etc significantly influences the flow bosch et al 1996 ranjan and dewan 2017 bailey et al 2002a the characteristics of the wall boundary layer near the cylinder depend on several factors such as reynolds number inlet velocity profile and the distance of the cylinder from the inlet due to a large number of parameters involved it is difficult to study the influence of each parameter on flow therefore in order to study the effect of wall on flow systematically the boundary layer is removed by moving the wall with the free stream velocity with the absence of the wall boundary layer now flow is relatively simple and it can be studied thoroughly in the present study influences of the shape of the square cylinder aspect ratio and its distance from the wall gap ratio have been studied for a fixed value of re by placing the cylinder near a moving wall the present configuration has many practical applications in chemical industries and underwater research vehicle the flow past a moving autonomous underwater vehicle of rectangular cross section aguirre et al 2017 near a seabed can be considered as a flow past a rectangular cylinder near a moving wall where the vehicle is stationary and the seabed is moving when the frame of reference is attached to the vehicle a number of studies have been performed to study the onset of three dimensionality in the wake of a square cylinder using direct numerical simulation dns and linear stability analysis robichaux et al 1999 saha et al 2003 bai and alam 2018 for an isolated square cylinder the onset of three dimensionality occurs at re 165 in the form of mode a vortices with vortex dislocations jiang et al 2018 sheard et al 2009 with an increase in re mode b vortices are formed at re 190 jiang et al 2018 park and yang 2016 similar observations are reported through experimental studies at re 200 luo et al 2003 2007 these mode b vortices along with mode a vortices are present in the flow up to re 210 for re 210 mode a vortices disappear and mode b vortices only are present in the flow a new mode called mode qp was observed in the flow through floquet analysis choi et al 2012 sheard 2011 a few studies only have been reported on the influence of wall on three dimensional 3 d wake transition of a square cylinder mahir 2009 studied 3 d flow past a square cylinder near a stationary wall and observed that the presence of a wall caused disappearance of mode a and appearance of mode b vortices at a lower value of re compared to the case of an isolated cylinder bailey et al 2002b studied the influence of a stationary wall at a high value of re and reported that for the gap heights close to the vortex shedding suppression probability of the occurrence of vortex dislocations decreases rao et al 2013a studied the influence of the gap ratio on flow transitions for a translating circular cylinder near a stationary wall which is physically similar to a flow past a stationary circular cylinder near a moving wall they observed that for low values of the gap ratio g d 0 25 three dimensionality occurred directly from a two dimensional steady state and for g d 0 25 two dimensional steady flow first became unsteady and then three dimensionality occurred jiang et al 2017 studied the influence of a moving wall on three dimensional wake transition of a circular cylinder using dns they observed the suppression of vortex dislocations for g d 1 and reported a decrease in three dimensionality in the flow for re in the range of 225 275 tanweer et al 2020 studied flow near a moving wall using dns and observed that the onset of three dimensionality occurred at a lower value of re compared to that in an isolated square cylinder they also observed mode qp vortices to the best of our knowledge no study has been reported on the influence of the aspect ratio on 3 d wake transition and their characteristics such as periodic or non periodic and subcritical or supercritical behaviours for a flow past a square cylinder near a moving wall since for g d 2 the influence of the wall is quite weak and for g d 0 3 the influence of the wall shear layer is quite strong and flow transitions cannot be seen clearly tanweer et al 2020 in the present study three moderate values of g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 are considered the flow is studied for six different values of ar 0 5 ar 2 0 at a constant value of re 160 which is slightly less than re cr 165 8 for the onset of three dimensionality for an isolated square cylinder problem statement formulation and computational method are presented in section 2 in section 3 results and discussion are presented finally conclusions are drawn from the study 2 numerical method and computational details 2 1 direct numerical simulations a schematic diagram of the flow configuration is presented in fig 1 the gap height between the cylinder and the moving wall is denoted as g the wall is moving with the free stream velocity u in the positive x direction the cylinder has dimensions of l width d height and 10d in x y and z directions respectively fig 1 b the aspect ratio and gap ratio are defined as l d and g d respectively here d is taken as the reference length scale and hence reynolds number is defined as r e u d ν here l u l d and l h denote the distance between the inlet and front surface of the cylinder between the outlet and the rear surface of the cylinder and between the top boundary and the top surface of the cylinder respectively the flow field has been investigated for 0 5 ar 2 0 and g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 for a constant value of re 160 the governing equations for incompressible and newtonian fluid are written as 1 continuity 1 u i x i 0 2 momentum 2 u i t u i u j x j p x i 1 r e 2 u i x j x j the non dimensional variables are defined as x i x i d t u t d u i u i u and p p ρ u 2 where the quantities with the overbar denote dimensional variables boundary conditions inlet uniform velocity u 1 and v w 0 here u v and w denote velocities in x y and z directions respectively outlet advective φ t u φ x 0 where φ is u v and w cylinder no slip u v w 0 top symmetry u y v w 0 moving wall free stream velocity u 1 v w 0 the cyclic boundary conditions were imposed in the spanwise direction in order to match the conditions for flow past a cylinder of an infinite spanwise length since interactions of a small number of unstable modes only govern the dynamics of the flow a moderate value of the spanwise length is sufficient to computationally capture the flow for an infinite spanwise length henderson 1997 in the present dns study the spanwise length is taken as 10d which is large enough to capture the reported modes mode a mode b mode c etc that evolve in the case of flow past a square cylinder a finite volume based open source library openfoam www openfoam org is adopted for computations and its incompressible dns solver called icofoam is used for the transient terms crank nicolson scheme is used the convective terms are discretized using a third order cubic scheme and for diffusion terms the second order central difference scheme is used the equations are solved using pimple algorithm a hybrid algorithm of simple and piso holzmann 2016 2 1 1 grid independence study a non uniform grid was formed in the domain where it was fine in the vicinity of the cylinder and in near wake region and it was coarse in the regions away from the cylinder fig 2 the size of the smallest grid was 0 005d and the grid growth ratio was less than 1 1 in the spanwise direction a uniform grid was used fig 2 b a grid independence study was performed where the time mean and r m s values of drag coefficient c d and c d rms and lift coefficient c l and c l rms and strouhal number st were obtained for different grid sizes and these results are summarized in table 1 the number of grid points in the spanwise direction was determined based on the previous reported study for a square cylinder near a moving wall tanweer et al 2020 based on this study m2 mesh was chosen for the computations for an assessment of the grid resolution kolmogorov length scale η ν 3 ε 1 4 has been calculated here ν and ε denote the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and dissipation rate of kinetic energy respectively in the far wake region the value of η lies between 0 1d to 0 12d which is comparable to the largest grid size this behavior shows that the grid used is fine enough for the present dns study 2 1 2 time independence study a time step independence study was performed where c d c d rms and c l c l rms and st were obtained for different values of the time step and these results are summarized in table 2 after performing the time step independence study table 2 a time step of 1 6 10 3 was chosen where the maximum courant number co in the domain was less than 0 8 2 2 linear stability analysis floquet analysis was employed to determine the onset of three dimensionality in the flow at re 160 for computations of the base flow and perturbation fields a high order spectral element based open source code nektar cantwell et al 2015 was used the flow domain used for the computations of the base flow is presented in fig 3 on the basis of the reported studies rao et al 2013b tanweer et al 2019 in the present case the boundaries were placed quite far from the cylinder an open source meshing tool gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2007 was used for the mesh generation approximately 5000 elements were used in the computational domain and seven node points were used within each element a sixth order polynomial the governing equations for the base flow and floquet analysis are reported by many researchers in detail barkley and henderson 1996 ryan et al 2005 a high order neuman boundary condition for pressure was used at all boundaries except at the outlet at the outlet a zero pressure boundary condition was used at the top boundary stress free condition was imposed a mesh independence study for the base flow was carried out by increasing the number of node points in each element and it is presented in table 3 on the basis of the obtained results m2 mesh was used for the base flow computations base flow fields were stored over 32 equi spaced time intervals in a single base flow period for floquet analysis modified arnoldi method was used to compute the leading eigenmodes 3 results and discussion the numerical model used for dns in the present study has been validated by comparing the obtained results with the reported results for two and three dimensional flows past a square cylinder in a free stream and reported by tanweer et al 2020 the numerical model used for linear stability analysis has been validated with the available results for a three dimensional wake transition in a flow past an isolated square cylinder using floquet analysis robichaux et al 1999 the agreement between the reported results and the present results are good fig 4 first the onset of three dimensionality with the formation of different modes for 0 5 ar 2 and g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 using dns is presented in this section thereafter characteristics of flow transition such as periodic or non periodic and subcritical or super critical behaviours are examined influences of ar and g d on the force coefficients are discussed finally a linear stability analysis is performed and the results obtained are compared with the dns results 3 1 three dimensional wake transitions for an isolated square cylinder the onset of three dimensionality occurs at re cr 165 8 jiang et al 2018 where mode a vortices with vortex dislocations are formed the presence of a moving wall influences the flow in two ways i velocity in the gap region may increase or decrease and ii shear layers formed at the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder are asymmetric due to the presence of the wall in the present study a constant value of re 160 re cr has been considered although re re cr in all the considered cases three dimensionality occurs at this value of re in most of the cases either due to an acceleration of the flow in the gap or due to interactions of the vortices with the wall shear layer 3 1 1 wake transitions at g d 0 4 at g d 0 4 the wake transition is quite sensitive to the aspect ratio ar at ar 0 5 three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the far downstream region when flow has fully developed mode a vortices are observed in the near wake too fig 5 a mode a vortices stretch the braid shear layer between the primary vortices due to this stretching hyperbolic instability occurs and mode b vortices are also formed between mode a vortices these mode b vortices are quite weak and decay downstream in the far wake vortices are highly ordered where a new vortex pair is formed between each pair of mode a vortices fig 5 a at ar 0 75 mode a vortices are formed in the near wake region fig 5 b these vortices get weaker and decay in the intermediate wake region new mode a vortices which have opposite orientation with respect to the near wake mode a are formed in the far wake region similar to the case of ar 0 5 mode b vortices are also observed in the vicinity of the cylinder and these vortices decay in the near wake region however unlike the case of ar 0 5 in this case no new vortex pair is observed in the far wake region at ar 1 and 1 25 new vortex pairs of length 2 5d are formed these vortices seem to be subharmonic and are called mode c vortices fig 6 a these vortices show period doubling phenomenon where after each time period t vortices change their sign fig 6 b and after time interval of 2t the same vortices are formed fig 6 c the period doubling phenomenon can be observed by monitoring the velocity signal at the location 1 75d 0 9d 5d in the near wake region and the lift coefficient signal it can be observed from fig 7 that the time period of the spanwise velocity is twice the time period of the lift coefficient and it confirms the period doubling phenomenon it is believed that in the case of a square cylinder mode c vortices are formed due to an asymmetric vortex shedding from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder this behavior is the reason that for a square cylinder in a free stream where vortex shedding is symmetric mode c vortices cannot be observed by dns however if the square cylinder is placed at some angle from the free stream flow then vortex shedding is asymmetric and mode c vortices can be formed similarly in the present case due to the presence of the wall vortex shedding is asymmetric and hence formation of mode c vortices can be observed at ar 1 5 mode b vortices are formed in the flow fig 5 c these vortices are fairly regular up to two layers in the downstream direction and thereafter these become chaotic similar to the case with ar 1 5 at ar 2 mode b vortices are observed in the near wake region and the flow becomes chaotic in the far wake region for a square cylinder in a free stream mode b transition occurs at a higher value of re 185 compared to mode a transition re 165 7 it can be observed from fig 8 that for a fixed value of g d 0 4 the mean flow velocity in the gap region at x l 2 decreases with an increase in ar which causes a decrease in the effective re near the cylinder thus it can be said that unlike the square cylinder in a free stream in the present case mode b transition at ar 1 5 and 2 occurs at a lower effective re compared to mode a transition at ar 0 5 a possible reason behind the onset of mode b vortices is that at a high value of ar the interactions between the shear layer near the cylinder surface and the wall shear layer increases fig 9 which may cause the formation of mode b vortices it can be clearly observed in fig 9 that at low values of ar 0 5 and 0 75 the interaction between the shear layer is weak while it is much stronger at high values of ar 1 5 and 2 this interaction can be shown quantitatively in terms of enstrophy which is presented in the next sub section 3 1 2 wake transitions at g d 0 5 wake transitions at g d 0 5 for different values of ar are quite interesting at ar 0 5 the wake transition occurs with the formation of mode a vortices fig 10 a in the near wake region mode b vortices are also present between mode a vortices and these decay in the far wake region at ar 0 75 two different wake transitions occur and these can be observed in fig 11 where the spanwise velocity is sampled with time at the location 1 25d 1d 5d initially the wake transition transition 1 occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the near wake as well as in the far wake regions not shown here this flow regime persists for a quite long time period up to 2200 non dimensional time thereafter another transition transition 2 occurs and this has been demarcated by a red line fig 11 this is an example of multiple bifurcations which arises due to the temporal instability in this flow regime in the near wake mode a vortices can be observed while in the far wake no clear structure can be realized fig 10 b these two flow regimes are further investigated by plotting the phase portraits between streamwise u and transverse v velocities at the location 1 25d 1d 5d for transition 1 flow regime phase portrait is a closed loop which shows that the flow is periodic fig 12 a in the power spectra a single fundamental frequency which is also the dominant frequency and its harmonics only are present fig 12 for transition 2 flow regime phase portrait consists of two non overlapping closed loops which show that it is also a periodic flow fig 12 b the dominant frequency in the power spectra is twice that of the fundamental frequency and is equal to the dominant frequency in transition 1 flow fig 12 since the fundamental frequency in transition 2 flow is twice that of the fundamental frequency in transition 1 flow it indicates that in transition 2 flow velocity will repeat its pattern after 2t where t is the time taken in flow 1 to repeat its velocity pattern at ar 1 the flow transition occurs in the form of mode a vortices which are highly ordered in the near wake as well as in the far wake regions with a further increase in ar the onset of three dimensionality in the flow is likely to suppress a possible reason behind this behaviour is that with an increase in ar the velocity in the gap region decreases which decreases the effective re with a further increase in ar again the tendency of 3 d wake transition increases since velocity in the gap region decreases with an increase in ar fig 8 it indicates that some other factors are responsible for the onset of three dimensionality the interactions of the shear layers have been quantified in terms of enstrophy 0 5 ω 2 here ω denotes vorticity in the gap region enstrophy sampled at the location l 2 g 2 5d increases with an increase in ar fig 13 it clearly shows that interactions of shear layers increase with ar at a fixed value of g d this is the reason that three dimensionality increases despite a decrease in the mean velocity in the gap region for ar 1 5 the flow is three dimensional where quite weak mode a like streamwise vortices are present in the near wake region for ar 2 the wake transition occurs in the form of mode c vortices fig 10 c similar to the case of g d 0 4 and ar 1 25 fig 6 these vortices also show period doubling phenomenon but in this case five pairs of streamwise vortices form which manifests that wavelength of the vortices are 2d which is smaller than the wavelength 2 5d of the mode c vortices for g d 0 4 and ar 1 25 the phase portrait between u v sampled at the location 2 5d 1d 5d consists of two non overlapping closed loops and the power spectra shows that the dominant frequency is twice that of the fundamental frequency which also confirms the period doubling phenomenon fig 14 3 1 3 wake transitions at g d 1 in comparison to the cases with g d 0 4 and 0 5 the three dimensional wake transition at g d 1 is less sensitive to ar the reason behind this behaviour is that at a high value of g d the interactions between the shear layer near the cylinder and wall shear layer is quite weak and it does not have much influence on the wake transition and hence velocity in the gap region is a dominant factor only at ar 0 5 three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices in the near wake where mode b vortices are also formed between mode a vortices fig 15 a these mode b vortices decay downstream in the far wake region some new vortices are formed which are well ordered at ar 0 75 again three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode a vortices but in this case no mode b vortices are formed fig 15 b further in this case some new vortices are formed in the far wake with a further increase in ar highly ordered mode a vortices are formed in the near wake as well as in the far wake however the strength of the vortices decreases with an increase in the value of ar at ar 1 5 mode a vortices are quite weak in the near wake at ar 2 no three dimensionality occurs and flow remains two dimensional it can be concluded from the above discussions that the velocity in the gap region and the interactions of the shear layer in the vicinity of the cylinder surface with the wall shear layer are the two main factors that influence the flow at low values of g d 0 4 and 0 5 both factors are dominant with an increase in g d the influence of shear layer interactions decreases and at a high value of g d 1 the velocity in the gap region only is a dominant factor with an increase in ar the velocity in the gap region decreases and shear layer interactions increase this behavior is the reason why for g d 0 4 mode b vortices are formed at ar 1 5 and 2 despite a decrease in velocity in the gap region and for g d 0 5 after the suppression of three dimensionality at ar 1 25 again the three dimensionality occurs at ar 1 5 in the form of mode a vortices another interesting finding is that mode a vortices are formed without the formation of vortex dislocations the above observations are summarized in table 4 3 2 phase portrait and power spectra periodic or quasi periodic in order to examine whether the flow is periodic or quasi periodic phase portrait between streamwise and transverse velocities and power spectra of transverse velocity have been plotted fig 16 shows the phase portrait between streamwise and transverse velocities sampled at a point l 0 5d 1 5d 5d for g d 1 at various values of ar for ar 0 5 the phase portrait is a closed loop which shows that the flow is periodic fig 16 a similar observation can be made from the power spectra of transverse velocity fig 16 b where a single dominant frequency and its harmonics only are present in the power spectra for ar 0 75 the attractor morphology in the phase portrait is cyclic and covers a large banded area in the phase space fig 16 c however it will never cover the entire interior area of the loop even if it is plotted for a quite large time the fact that it is periodic can be seen more clearly in the power spectra which shows a single dominant frequency and its harmonics indicating that the flow is periodic fig 16 d since the flow is periodic the phase trajectory will come back to exactly the same point after a certain time period for ar 1 and 1 25 the trajectory in the phase space follows a quasi periodic path fig 16 e the power spectra have more than one fundamental frequencies and sub harmonic frequencies fig 16 f for ar 1 5 the phase portrait seems to be similar in morphology to the phase portrait at ar 0 75 fig 16 g however at this value of ar the flow is quasi periodic and the phase trajectory will never come back to the same point after a certain time period but will come close to that point this behaviour can be seen clearly in the power spectra where many fundamental frequencies are present fig 16 h if the phase portrait at this value of ar is plotted for a quite large time it will cover the entire interior area of the loop the fact that the flow is periodic at ar 0 75 and it is quasi periodic at ar 1 5 despite having similar morphology can be seen more clearly from the poincaré map fig 17 in poincaré map we sample the data periodically t and plot these values u t v t only in the u v plane for aperiodic system the phase portrait is quite messy in general whereas poincaré map simplifies things and makes the data easier to analyze for the dynamics of the system for ar 0 75 the poincaré map contains some distinct points while for ar 1 5 the poincaré map contains a large number of points which make a closed loop indicating that the trajectory will never come back to its original position for the gap ratio g d 0 5 unlike g d 1 where the flow is aperiodic at ar 1 here the flow is periodic at all the considered values of ar however at some values of ar the dominant frequency is equal to the fundamental frequency fig 12 c while at some other values of ar the dominant frequency is twice that of the fundamental frequency fig 14 for the gap ratio g d 0 4 the flow is periodic up to ar 1 25 and the trajectory in the phase portrait is a closed curve fig 18 a in the power spectra a single dominant peak and its harmonics only are present fig 18 b for ar 1 5 trajectory in the phase portrait does not show a well repeated pattern fig 18 c it indicates that the flow is aperiodic and from the power spectra it can be realized that it is a quasi periodic flow where more than one fundamental frequencies are present fig 18 d similar observations are made for ar 2 it can be concluded from the above discussions that for a fixed value of the gap ratio the flows are periodic at low values of ar and their tendency to become quasi periodic increases at high values of ar the transition from a periodic to a quasi periodic flow occurs at a higher value of ar for a low value of g d 0 4 compared to a high value of g d 1 with a decrease in the gap ratio the tendency of the flow to be periodic first increases and then decreases from g d 1 to 0 5 and then 0 4 the above observations are summarized in table 5 3 3 nature of transition flow transition for a square cylinder placed in a free stream can be subcritical or supercritical in nature the presence of a hysteresis zone is an important characteristic of subcritical transitions where the system can remain in more than one state and it depends on the initial state of the system therefore a subcritical transition shows hysteretic characteristics the hysteresis phenomenon cannot occur in a supercritical transition where the asymptotic state is independent of the initial state of the system gopalakrishnan and sujith 2014 flow transition to mode b shows non hysteretic character while mode a transition shows both hysteretic and non hysteretic natures for a confined flow with a short spanwise length mode a transition is supercritical non hysteretic while for an unconfined flow with a large spanwise length it is subcritical hysteretic in nature jiang et al 2018 in order to examine the flow transition whether it is subcritical or supercritical two approaches can be used it can be examined by performing direct numerical simulation or using stuart landau model in the present study stuart landau model is used to examine the nature of transition this model can be written in terms of amplitude a of perturbation near the onset of instability sheard et al 2004 3 d a d t σ i ω a l 1 i c a 2 a o a 5 here σ and ω denote the linear amplification rate and angular frequency respectively which are independent of the position close to transition and in this sense these are global parameters dušek et al 1994 a denotes a complex number and its real part can be written as 4 d a d t σ a l a 3 equation 4 can be rewritten as 5 d l o g a d t σ l a 2 here l denotes the level of nonlinear saturation the sign of l indicates the nature of bifurcation the flow will be non hysteretic in nature for l 0 which shows a supercritical transition for l 0 the transition will be subcritical and the flow will be hysteretic in nature the sign of l can be obtained by plotting the graph between d l o g a d t and a 2 and checking the sign of the slope a positive slope will provide a negative l and vice versa the amplitude a can be calculated in many ways dušek et al 1994 landau and lifshitz 1987 zielinska and wesfreid 1995 in the present study spanwise velocity z velocity has been used for the calculation of a the value of l depends on the point at which the velocity has been monitored but it is expected that its sign will remain the same thompson et al 2001a the velocity has been sampled at a distance of 1d in the downstream direction from the center of the cylinder fig 19 presents the plot between d l o g a d t and a 2 for g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 for different values of the aspect ratio for g d 0 4 the slopes are negative for all the considered cases and hence l is positive it shows that at g d 0 4 the transition is supercritical and the flow is non hysteretic for g d 0 5 the slopes are negative for all the cases except for ar 2 where it is positive this behavior shows that for ar 2 the transition is subcritical and the flow is hysteretic while it is supercritical and non hysteretic for all other cases for g d 1 the slope is negative for ar 0 5 and it is positive for all the other cases this behavior shows that transition is supercritical for ar 0 5 and it is subcritical for other cases it can be concluded from the above findings that for low values of the gap ratio transition is supercritical and the flow is non hysteretic and with an increase in the gap ratio the tendency of the flow to become hysteretic increases similarly for low values of the aspect ratio the tendency of the flow to be non hysteretic is large and it decreases with an increase in the gap ratio the above observations are summarized in table 6 3 4 force coefficients a change in the aspect ratio has a significant influence on the force coefficients variations in the time averaged force coefficients with ar for different values of g d are presented in fig 20 c d decreases with an increment in g d as well as with an increment in ar fig 20 a for g d 1 a large decrease in c d with an increment in ar can be observed for low values of ar while for high values of ar it is less sensitive to the value of ar and decrement in c d is quite small with an increment in ar at ar 0 5 c d is independent of g d while at high values of ar it varies strongly with g d a possible reason for this behavior is that at ar 0 5 the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces of the cylinder is approximately equal for all the values of g d fig 21 a it decreases slightly near the lower part and increases slightly near the upper part of the surfaces with an increment in g d which makes the average pressure difference and hence pressure drag to be independent of g d at high values of ar the pressure difference between the front and rear surfaces decreases along the entire surface with an increment in g d fig 21 c which creates a difference in the value of c d at different values of g d the pressure difference at low values of ar is higher than that at high values of ar which makes the total drag to decrease with an increment in ar due to the presence of the moving wall c l is positive away from the wall for all the cases except for ar 0 5 at g d 1 where it is slightly negative fig 20 b c l monotonically increases with ar for all values of g d while it decreases with an increment in g d variation in c l is rapid for low values of g d 0 4 and 0 5 where it varies linearly with ar while it varies slowly with ar at a high value of g d 1 similar to c d c l is nearly independent of g d at ar 0 5 where the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces varies slightly with g d fig 21 b at high values of ar fig 21 d this difference changes with g d and causes c l to be different for various values of g d for ar 1 5 the pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces is negative along the entire surface at g d 0 4 which causes a high value of c l 3 5 linear stability analysis in this section a linear stability analysis has been performed to examine the onset of three dimensionality in the flow since the base flow is periodic at re 160 floquet analysis has been used to examine the growth of perturbations where 32 snapshots between one time period of the base flow have been used first the influence of the gap ratio g d 0 4 0 5 and 1 is studied at a low value of ar 0 5 then the influence of the aspect ratio is examined at g d 0 4 and 0 5 3 5 1 influence of g d at ar 0 5 base flow and growth of perturbations at ar 0 5 is quite interesting for all the three gap ratios for g d 0 4 at ar 0 5 the base flow can be divided into two different flow regimes in the near wake region vortex shedding occurs from the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder in the form of kármán vortex street at some distance away from the cylinder the vortices shed from the lower surface of the cylinder merge with the wall shear layer and a single row of vortex street only shed from the upper surface of the cylinder are present in the flow fig 22 a this vortex street decays downstream similar flow is obtained for g d 0 5 however the kármán vortex street persists up to a slightly larger downstream distance compared to that in the case of g d 0 4 fig 22 b for g d 1 at ar 0 5 the base flow is quite interesting and can be divided in three different flow regimes fig 22 c in the vicinity of the cylinder the vortex shedding occurs in the form of kármán vortex street in the intermediate wake region vortices of the same sign merge with each other and form a two layered vortices pattern further downstream x 35 a secondary vortex street is formed due to a coupling between the upper shear layer and the wall shear layer the floquet multipliers of unstable modes are real positive numbers in all the three cases for g d 0 4 the perturbations grow in the single row of vortex street region created by the upper shear layer of the cylinder and decay far downstream fig 23 a the perturbations grow in the vortex core which is a signature of an elliptic instability the unstable mode has a spanwise wavelength of 4 8d the fact that the perturbations grow in the far wake region is consistent with the present dns results where the onset of three dimensionality was observed in the form of mode a vortices far downstream however unlike the dns results where in the far wake region a new mode was observed between mode a vortices and in the near wake region mode b vortices appeared fig 5 a no new unstable mode is observed in the linear stability analysis this behavior shows that in the dns results a new mode is formed due to nonlinear interactions between mode a vortices since growth of perturbations occurs away from the wall the three dimensional modes are highly ordered even far downstream fig 5 a for g d 0 5 perturbations grow in the kármán vortex street region in the vicinity of the cylinder as well as in the single row vortex street region close to the cylinder the unstable mode interacts with the wall shear layer which distorts the mode therefore unlike the case of g d 0 4 in this case modes are not highly ordered fig 10 similar to the case of g d 0 4 the unstable mode has a spanwise wavelength of 4 8d for g d 1 perturbations grow in the kármán vortex street region close to the cylinder as well as in the two layered vortex street region in the two layered vortex street region the perturbations grow in the upper shear layer while in the lower shear layer perturbations are damped due to the presence of the wall similar to the cases of g d 0 4 and 0 5 in this case also perturbations grow in the vortex core the spanwise wavelength of the mode is 4 2d which is slightly smaller than that of the mode in cases of g d 0 4 and 0 5 3 5 2 influence of ar at g d 0 4 for g d 0 4 at ar 0 75 the growth of perturbations occurs in the vortex core which indicates the onset of elliptic instability fig 24 a in this case the growth can also be observed in the braid shear layers in the near wake region this growth could be even more intensive than in the elliptic regions of the flow and the elliptic instability type structure can be the secondary effect for mode a appearance aleksyuk and shkadov 2018 thompson et al 2001b in the present case mode has a spanwise length of 4 8d wavenumber β 1 3 and floquet multiplier of this mode is a positive real number the perturbation modes are stronger in the near wake region and decay downstream unlike the dns case fig 5 b in this case no mode b vortices are formed the reason behind this behaviour is that in dns due to the formation of mode a vortices the braid shear layers are stretched that cause the onset of mode b vortices for ar 1 the three dimensionality occurs in the form of a quasi periodic mode which has a spanwise wavelength of 2 7d fig 24 b the eigenvalue of the unstable mode is a complex number with a non zero imaginary part however from the dns results it seems that the three dimensional mode is sub harmonic fig 6 blackburn and lopez 2003 have shown through linear stability analysis that these modes have complex values of floquet multiplier and behave as a standing or traveling waves in fact the quasi periodic mode and subharmonic mode branches are inherently linked the quasi periodic mode is replaced by the subharmonic mode when a finite asymmetry occurs in the wake without the emergence of a different eigenvalue no noticeable change in the structures of quasi periodic and sub harmonic modes is detected sheard 2011 the growth of the perturbations occurs in the near wake region in the stretching shear layer near the moving wall these modes are present in the entire downstream region and change sign in each layer alternately which indicates its traveling wave nature similar results have been observed for ar 1 25 for ar 1 5 two unstable modes are observed one is a long wavelength lw mode and the other is a short wavelength sw mode at the spanwise wave numbers β of 1 1 and 4 5 respectively fig 24 both the modes are stronger in the near wake region the strength of lw mode is sustained in the far wake while the sw mode decays in the far wake region however amplitude of the sw mode is larger than that of the lw mode and therefore it is more unstable therefore transition to three dimensionality occurs in the form of mode b vortices with a spanwise wave length of 1 4d β 4 5 at this ar the perturbations grow in the braid shear layer in the near wake region which indicates the onset of the hyperbolic instability since the growth of the perturbations occurs close to the wall it indicates that the interactions of the shear layer with the wall plays a major role in the formation of mode b vortices similar to the case of ar 1 5 for ar 2 mode b vortices are formed however in this case mode b has a slightly smaller spanwise wavelength of 1 3d 3 5 3 influence of ar at g d 1 for g d 1 at ar 0 75 perturbations grow in the near wake region fig 25 the growth of the perturbations occurs in the vortex core the unstable mode has a wavelength of 4 2d and a real positive floquet multiplier the shed vortices are divided into two rows of vortices in the downstream region and these decay further downstream the reason for the formation of two rows of vortices can be found from the base flow in fig 26 the base flow can be divided in two different regimes in the near wake region vortices are shed in the form of kármán vortices and in the far wake region two rows of vortices are formed formation of two rows of vortices causes the creation of new vortices downstream which is evident from the dns results fig 15 b similar to ar 0 75 for high values of ar 1 1 25 and 1 5 perturbations grow in the vortex core in the near wake region but decay downstream fig 25 b the floquet multiplier of unstable mode for all these cases is a real positive number for higher values of ar the spanwise length of the unstable mode is 4 8d which is slightly higher compared to that in the case of ar 0 75 formation of two rows of vortices disappears for high values of ar the reason behind this behavior is that for high values of ar the formation of two rows of vortices shifts far downstream where the strength of the vortices is quite weak not shown here due to the absence of two rows of vortices the streamwise vortices are highly ordered even far downstream which can be observed from the dns results for g d 0 4 the growth rate of the perturbations with the wavenumber β has been plotted in fig 27 a for different values of ar it is evident from fig 27 a that for low values of ar 0 75 and 1 the curves have two peaks one close to β 1 1 5 which is called short wave number or long wave length lw mode and the other close to β 2 2 5 which is called intermediate wave length iw mode for ar 0 75 the lw mode is the most unstable while iw mode is stable with an increase in ar for ar 1 the growth rate of lw mode decreases and it becomes stable while the growth rate of iw mode increases and it becomes unstable for high values of ar 1 5 and 2 similar to low values of ar the curves have one peak corresponding to lw mode but the other peak occurs close to β 4 5 5 which is called the short wave length sw mode for ar 1 5 both modes are unstable but the growth rate of sw mode is greater than that of the lw mode therefore three dimensional transition occurs with the formation of sw mode for ar 2 the growth rate of lw mode decreases and it becomes stable and sw mode only is unstable for g d 1 the wake transitions are less sensitive to the value of ar the growth rate has two peaks between β 1 1 5 and 3 3 5 corresponding to large wavelength lw and intermediate wavelength iw modes respectively fig 27 b in all the cases lw mode is unstable while iw mode is stable for low values of ar 0 5 and 0 75 peaks occur at β 1 3 while at high values of ar 1 25 and 1 5 peaks occur at β 1 5 4 conclusions a detailed analysis has been performed to study the influence of gap and aspect ratios on three dimensional wake transitions of a square cylinder placed near a moving wall at a constant value of re both dns as well as linear stability analysis have been performed for examining the flow the following conclusions can be drawn from the present study three dimensional wake transition is highly influenced by velocity in the gap region and interactions of the shear layers velocity in the gap region is a dominant factor at low values of ar and at high values of g d while shear layer interactions is a dominant factor at high values of ar and low values of g d for a low value of the gap ratio g d 0 4 wake transitions are more sensitive to ar while for a high value of the gap ratio g d 1 these are less sensitive to ar for g d 0 5 at low values of ar three dimensionality in the flow decreases with an increases in ar due to a decrease in velocity in the gap region and flow becomes two dimensional at ar 1 25 with a further increase in ar three dimensionality in the flow increases due to an increase in interactions between cylinder shear layer and wall shear layer for low values of ar both mode a and mode b vortices are formed these mode b vortices are quite weak and are formed due to stretching of the braid shear layer between the primary vortices and do not sustain in the flow but decay rapidly in the wake mode b vortices are formed again at a high value of ar at g d 0 4 where these vortices are quite strong and sustain in the wake mode c vortices are observed in the flow for some values of ar and g d these vortices show period doubling phenomenon however from linear stability analysis it is observed that these vortices have complex floquet multiplier and therefore are quasi periodic in nature for low values of the gap ratio transition is supercritical and flow is non hysteretic and with an increase in the gap ratio the tendency of flow to become hysteretic increases similarly for low values of the aspect ratio the tendency of the flow to be non hysteretic is large and it decreases with an increase in the aspect ratio the drag coefficient decreases monotonically with an increment in ar while the lift coefficient increases monotonically with ar for a fixed value of ar both drag as well as lift coefficients decrease with an increase in g d both c d and c l are nearly independent

the influence of the porous effect parameter on the hydrodynamic forces on the disc keywords porous plate added mass water waves damping coefficient hypersingular integral 1 introduction a horizontally submerged thin circular plate is a component in several structures used in offshore and coastal engineering varying from wave energy converters wecs astariz and iglesias 2015 to breakwaters near coasts and very large floating structures vlfs lamas pardo et al 2015 a major innovation in the renewable energy sector is the semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine fowt these structures often have column stabilized platforms with submerged plates which provide extra heave added mass and wave damping far removed from wave excitation antonutti et al 2014 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 the first theoretical works on the propagation of water waves in the presence of a porous medium started with the investigation of sollitt and cross 1972 where reflection and transmission coefficients are predicted for a permeable breakwater of rectangular cross section the topic of the interaction of waves with porous plates in 2d has been studied by several authors and the results expressed in terms of wave reflection and transmission the mathematical modelling is accomplished by expressing the normal velocity of the fluid passing the porous plate proportionally to the jump in the velocity potential across it chwang and wu 1994 eq 2 this relationship is based on the assumption that the flow in the porous medium is governed by darcy s law chwang 1983 neves et al 2000 obtained an analytical solution for the problem of waves propagating past a horizontal porous plate of finite thickness using a multiple scale perturbation method using the wiener hopf method together with the cauchy integral method evans and peter 2011 deduced an explicit expression for the reflection coefficient when a plane wave is obliquely incident upon a semi infinite porous plate in water of finite depth more recently singular integral equation methods have been applied to two dimensional wave porous plate problems gayen and mondal used expansion collocation methods based on chebyshev polynomials to solve the governing hypersingular equations for a submerged porous plate gayen and mondal 2014 and for two symmetric inclined permeable plates gayen and mondal 2016 while koley et al considered wave scattering by a floating flexible porous plate via fredholm integral equations and obtained solutions using simpson s quadrature formula koley et al 2018 the study of the three dimensional wave porous plate problem has received slightly less attention so far and is based mainly on the method of matched eigenfunction expansions chwang and wu 1994 and liu et al 2011 considered wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous disc the latter showed results for the dimensionless wave height relative to the water depth and the disc radius and for the vertical force on the disc the former presented the dimensionless surface elevation as well as the vertical wave force molin and nielsen considered the axisymmetric problem for the heave radiation of water waves by a submerged porous disc and presented the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of the keulegan carpenter number an and faltinsen 2012 analysed the wave porous plate problem using a quadratic pressure loss condition which relates the pressure loss difference to the square of the transverse velocity meylan et al 2017 solved the problem of linear water wave scattering by a circular floating porous elastic plate by an eigenfunction matching method and by a plate of arbitrary shape using a coupled boundary element and finite element method they presented the far field amplitude and the wave energy dissipated due to porosity a number of recent works dokken et al 2017 oule housseine mackay et al 2019 formulate the wave diffraction radiation by bodies with porous components and present results for the added mass and damping coefficients but not for porous plates in the present article we use a formulation and solution method based on a spectral method which has been successfully applied to wave solid plate problems farina and martin 1998 1999 farina 2010 ziebell and farina 2012 farina et al 2017 the governing equation is a hypersingular integral equation and its approximate solution is sought as an expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials the convergence of the galerkin version of this method has been proved by farina et al 2014 the mathematical problem formulation is presented in section 2 and the spectral method is described in section 3 we model the physical aspects of the problem in section 4 where the heave radiation and the porous effect parameter are described the numerical results showing the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of the wave number and for distinct porous effect parameters are given in section 5 and the concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 formulation a cartesian coordinate system is chosen in which z is orientated vertically downwards into the fluid and the disturbed free surface is at z ζ x y t we suppose that the motion of the fluid is of small amplitude and irrotational that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid then the time dependent velocity potential φ x y z t satisfies laplace s equation in the fluid 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 with the linearized kinematic condition and dynamic condition imposed on the mean free surface z 0 2 φ z ζ t 3 φ t g ζ 0 where and g is the acceleration due to gravity eqs 2 and 3 may be combined to give the free surface boundary condition as 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 z 0 in deep water the bed condition is expressed as 4 φ 0 as z in the presence of an obstacle within the fluid the potential must also satisfy boundary conditions on its body surface and also a radiation condition at large horizontal distances thus let us consider a body with a smooth closed and bounded surface d the body six linear rigid motions can be described by the body velocity with respect to the fluid mei et al 2018 eq 8 2 14 u d x d t n where x and n are six dimensional generalized body displacement and normal vector respectively mei et al 2018 eq s 8 2 13 let us now assume the body is a porous plate its permeability may be described by means of the resistance law relating the fluid velocity perpendicular to the plate w t n with the difference in pressure between the two sides p in the general form 5 w f p if the plate is made with a material with very fine pores f is a linear function of p see taylor 1956 thus the boundary condition for the relative velocity in the normal direction is 6 φ n u w on d then as particular cases if the body is held fixed the boundary condition of the porous body surface will be 7 φ n w on d while for a rigid impermeable plate the boundary condition takes the form 8 φ n u on d 2 1 simple harmonic motion we now assume the motion of the fluid is of small amplitude and time harmonic with frequency ω the linearity of the problem allows separation of variables as 9 φ x y z t d x d t x y z t ζ x y t t x y z t p x y z t re ϕ x y z v x y z η x y w x y z ϱ x y z e i ω t for the complex valued functions ϕ v η w and ϱ where v v 1 v 6 and w w 1 w 6 denote the amplitudes of the generalized body velocity and of

generalizes the equation treated in farina and martin 1998 and farina et al 2014 3 method of solution equations of the form 27 with β 0 have been solved by the spectral method proposed by farina and

al 2014 as a particular case when the plate is a solid disc and performs vertical oscillations heave motion the problem has an axisymmetric solution and it can be solved by reducing it to a non singular one dimensional fredholm integral equation of the second kind martin and farina 1997 eq 7 6 a simple numerical method can be used for this equation for instance a nyström method combined with the gauss legendre quadrature rule as employed in martin and farina 1997 for the general case we can adopt farina martin s spectral method and this will be done next now assume that d is a circular porous disc with radius a as shown in fig 1 then the disc is given by 28 d r θ d 0 r a π θ π it has radius a and is submerged at a distance d below the free surface we can nondimensionalize using a thus without loss of generality we take a 1 eq 26 becomes 29 1 4 π d ϕ j ρ α 1 r 3 m r θ ρ α d k ρ d ρ d α i k g ϕ j r θ n j r θ 0 1 π π where r 3 ρ 2 r 2 2 ρ r cos α θ 3 2 we seek solutions in the

expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials erdélyi et al 1953 the functions b k m are orthogonal over the unit disc with respect to the weight 1 ρ 2 1 2 further it is known that krenk 1979 31 1 4 π

implementation some computational aspects in the implementation of the spectral method described above need careful treatment in order to provide an efficient algorithm probably the main issue is the computation of the free surface green s function here we are concerned only with the double normal derivative of g given by eq 25 it can be shown farina and martin 1998 eq 16 ziebell and farina 2012 eq 32 that this function can be expressed as 34 m 2 k 2 r 2 2 d 2 1 2 4 k d 1 r 2 2 d 2 3 2 6 d 2 r 2 2 d 2 5 2 π k 3 e 2 k d h 0 k r y 0 k r 2 k 3 e 2 k d 0 2 k d e t k r 2 t 2 1 2 d t 2 π i k 3 e 2 k d j 0 k r this expression is an improvement on the representation 25 since it does not involve path integrals whose evaluations are computationally expensive furthermore the struve and bessel functions h 0 and y 0 respectively present in this alternative expression are efficiently computed by approximating orthogonal polynomials see newman 1984a integrals such as the one in 34 can be efficiently computed see newman 1984b 1985 concerning the numerical evaluation of the basis functions 30 we employ a recurrence relation for the legendre functions the following stable recurrence on k is adopted k m p k m x 2 k 1 x p k 1 m x k m 1 p k 2 m x we used n 1 n 2 6 which gives 49 collocation points over the disc the computed results from this choice of values provided numerical evidence of convergence of the expansions used to approximate ϕ j we assume that the solution is symmetric about θ 0 this means that the collocation points lie in the semi disc r θ 0 ρ 1 0 θ π collocating at symmetric points on the other semi disc would give no further information about the solution of the linear system the collocation points are taken as the intersection of concentric circles radius r l with equally separated rays emanating from the origin angle θ n more precisely the chosen points are r l θ n l 0 1 n 1 n 0 1 n 2 where r l is a certain set of distinct points in 0 1 and θ n 2 n 1 π 2 n 2 2 n 0 1 n 2 are the zeros of cos n 2 1 θ in 0 π however care must be taken when choosing the distribution of the numbers s l for instance choosing equally spaced numbers in 0 1 gives a badly conditioned system we adopt a chebyshev tensor product collocation which means that the points in the radial variable are zeros of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind t 2 n 1 2 r in 0 1 explicitly r l cos 2 l 1 π 4 n 1 4 l 0 1 n 1 the numerical method described above was implemented in fortran and the lapack routine cgerfs was used to solve the resulting linear system e a b in order to provide numerical evidence of the method convergence in table 1 of appendix the complex coefficients a k m in the expansion 32 of the solution ϕ j are shown for two distinct choices of the parameters g d a and k a the coefficients typically they decay rapidly as n 1 and n 2 increase only the first terms have significant values this indicates that the series converges rapidly and the solution is very stable a well known computational difficulty of submerged body problems arises when the submergence depth d a decreases because the so called resonant frequencies grow increasingly large in the solution ϕ j and in the hydrodynamic force this is due to a singularity in the matrix e to study the case where a plate is very close to the free surface approximations such as the ones adopted in martin and farina 1997 and farina 2010 are an alternative 4 wave radiation and the porous medium effect next we describe in section 4 1 how the wave force is expressed in terms of the heave added mass and damping coefficients and in section 4 2 how the physics of the flow within the plate is modelled by means of the porous effect parameter 4 1 added mass and damping we assume now the plate performs vertical oscillations characterizing a heaving motion for which n j n 3 as d is horizontal the vertical component of its normal vector is 1 then we have n j 1 thus the approximation to ϕ 3 is given by 35 k m n a k m c k m 1 r 2 i k g b k m r θ 1 4 π d b k m ρ α m ρ α r θ d k ρ d ρ d α 1 for r θ 0 1 π π many important applications in ocean engineering dealing with body wave interactions employ the hydrodynamic force in the design and assessment of offshore structures the hydrodynamic force on the heaving disc is given by an integral of ϕ 3 over the disc and is decomposed into the added mass a and the damping b coefficients as falnes 2002 a i b d ϕ 3 d s 0 1 0 2 π ϕ 3 r θ r d r d θ 4 2 the porous effect parameter the wave motion across a porous medium has been described by sollitt and cross 1972 in terms of a resistance force or friction coefficient f and an inertial coefficient s xiping yu and allen t chwang published a series of articles in the 1990 s yu and chwang 1994b a yu 1995 in which a porous thin plate boundary condition was introduced in the boundary condition there is an important parameter depending on f and s and on the geometrical properties of the porous plate which we call the porous effect parameter g in its general form as introduced in yu and chwang 1994b g is a complex number which can be written as 36 g γ k b f i s where γ is the plate porosity defined as the ratio of the volume of the porous part to the volume of the whole and b is the physical thickness of the porous plate writing g as 37 g γ f i s k b f 2 s 2 g r i g i we can roughly speaking refer to the real part of g as the resistance parameter and to the imaginary part of g as the inertial force acting on the porous plate this identification will be useful for interpreting the results section 5 some articles on the wave porous structure interaction are concerned only with the case in which g is real chwang 1983 chwang and wu 1994 yu and chwang 1994a an and faltinsen 2012 this means f s and physically represents a densely packed plate while when the inertial force coefficient dominates that is s f g is nearly purely imaginary and the object is said to be loosely packed yu and chwang 1994b the evaluation of g for different objects can be accomplished by obtaining f and s experimentally using the least squares method li et al 2006 eq 24 proposed a formula to evaluate f when s 1 as a function of the plate thickness and the water depth 5 numerical results we divide the numerical experiments in two regimes with respect to the disc submergence below the free surface intermediate to large depths and small depths in the later case resonances are associated with the motion above the disc and we look into this phenomenon in detail comparing it to the solid disc behaviour 5 1 intermediate and large submergence depths we first examine the hydrodynamic coefficients for submergence depths d a varying from 0 2 to 10 in figs 2 and 3 we see the added mass and damping coefficients respectively for a solid disc g 0 the maxima decrease as d a grows with a slight shift to higher frequencies in particular these coefficients approach the limiting values of a 8 3 and b 0 with this behaviour clearly seen in the curves representing the value d a 10 this corresponds to the problem of a circular solid disc moving along the z axis in an unbounded fluid lamb 1924 102 for g 0 d a 0 2 and g 0 d a 0 4 our results agree with those in martin and farina 1997 figure 2 and porter 2015 figure 14 in figs 4 and 5 we present the added mass and damping coefficients respectively for g 0 7 i 0 3 in comparison with the results for g 0 the peaks in both hydrodynamic force coefficients are lower and occur at lower frequencies as well for small k a the added mass approaches the limit 8 3 but assumes smaller values for greater k a similar behaviours are observed when g 1 in figs 6 and 7 with a further reduction in the values of a and b in the entire range of the wave frequency considered 5 2 small submergence depth we now consider the value d a 0 1 in the results presented below in order to better examine the influence of g on the behaviour of the added mass and damping coefficient we divide the analysis into two disjoint cases g imaginary and g real in fig 8 the added mass is shown as a function of k a for different values of imaginary values of the porous effect parameter g and for g 0 we emphasize three changes as g i increases a shift from the maximum to lower frequencies a displacement of the point of inflection of the curves and a significant increase in the value of the added mass peak in fig 9 a similar plot is shown but for real values of g the added mass peaks now decrease as g r increases the peak frequency is slightly shifted to a lower value as in fig 8 we can see that when g varies over purely real values the added masses for the solid disc and that for g 1 form an envelope to the intermediate curves g 0 1 and g 0 5 in such a way that the inflection points do not vary figs 10 and 11 show the damping coefficient as a function of k a for increasing absolute value of g in the case when g is imaginary respectively real we see the same behaviour as noticed for the added mass with respect to the dynamics of the peaks as g varies for g 0 we observe also that the numerical results recover the known behaviour of the added mass and damping coefficients for an impermeable horizontal disc they agree with those in fig 2 of martin and farina 1997 the peaks in the hydrodynamic force are more pronounced when the submergence depth is small this is associated with the resonant motion of the fluid over the disc the potential in the thin layer above the submerged disc is significant there the fluid is in a simple state of uniform vertical oscillation in phase with the disc with potential z 1 k in the case of a solid disc martin and farina 1997 farina 2010 a general remark is that the resonant peaks occur for lower values of the wave frequency for all porous discs as compared to the impermeable one in order to understand the behaviour of the peaks when porosity is present we look now into the extreme values of the added mass for varying complex g we consider next g c i e g is positive complex in figs 12 and 13 we present a colourmap showing the value of maxima and minima assumed by a as a function of g r and g i in the figures we do not show at which value of k a these extreme values are assumed rather we are interested to see how the extreme values of a vary with the real part of g on the horizontal axis and with the imaginary part of g on the vertical axis we then focus on the relative influence of g i and g r on a and it is clearly seen that the added mass is maximized and also minimized for large g i and small g r thus increasing the imaginary part of g emphasizes the peaks in the added mass except when the real part of g is large the resonant behaviour present in both hydrodynamic force coefficients is attenuated when the real part of the porous effect parameter dominates its imaginary part i e when the inertial force is larger than its resistance coefficient s f this property can be used in the design of offshore structures to reduce resonant oscillations 6 conclusion in this work the general problem for the diffraction and radiation of water waves by a porous disc in deep water is formulated simple harmonic motion for a heaving horizontal disc is studied in detail in particular we have analysed the influence of the porous effect parameter on the hydrodynamic forces on a thin porous disc performing vertical oscillations using a hypersingular integral equation of the second kind the solution is obtained by a spectral method based on a collocation expansion procedure which shows the method can be extended to a wider class of integral equations the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of k a are presented and the dynamic behaviours of their extreme values peak frequencies and inflexion points as g varies in the complex plane are found in particular we found that the resonant behaviour apparent in the hydrodynamic force coefficients is attenuated when the real part of the porous effect parameter dominates its imaginary part i e when the inertial force is larger than its resistance coefficient s f the numerical

21244,a thin circular porous plate is submerged below the free surface of deep water the problem is reduced to a hypersingular integral equation of the second kind over the surface of the unit disc the solution is computed by a spectral method known to be efficient for the case of a solid plate numerical results are presented for the heave added mass and damping coefficients which demonstrate the influence of the porous effect parameter on the hydrodynamic forces on the disc keywords porous plate added mass water waves damping coefficient hypersingular integral 1 introduction a horizontally submerged thin circular plate is a component in several structures used in offshore and coastal engineering varying from wave energy converters wecs astariz and iglesias 2015 to breakwaters near coasts and very large floating structures vlfs lamas pardo et al 2015 a major innovation in the renewable energy sector is the semi submersible floating offshore wind turbine fowt these structures often have column stabilized platforms with submerged plates which provide extra heave added mass and wave damping far removed from wave excitation antonutti et al 2014 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 the first theoretical works on the propagation of water waves in the presence of a porous medium started with the investigation of sollitt and cross 1972 where reflection and transmission coefficients are predicted for a permeable breakwater of rectangular cross section the topic of the interaction of waves with porous plates in 2d has been studied by several authors and the results expressed in terms of wave reflection and transmission the mathematical modelling is accomplished by expressing the normal velocity of the fluid passing the porous plate proportionally to the jump in the velocity potential across it chwang and wu 1994 eq 2 this relationship is based on the assumption that the flow in the porous medium is governed by darcy s law chwang 1983 neves et al 2000 obtained an analytical solution for the problem of waves propagating past a horizontal porous plate of finite thickness using a multiple scale perturbation method using the wiener hopf method together with the cauchy integral method evans and peter 2011 deduced an explicit expression for the reflection coefficient when a plane wave is obliquely incident upon a semi infinite porous plate in water of finite depth more recently singular integral equation methods have been applied to two dimensional wave porous plate problems gayen and mondal used expansion collocation methods based on chebyshev polynomials to solve the governing hypersingular equations for a submerged porous plate gayen and mondal 2014 and for two symmetric inclined permeable plates gayen and mondal 2016 while koley et al considered wave scattering by a floating flexible porous plate via fredholm integral equations and obtained solutions using simpson s quadrature formula koley et al 2018 the study of the three dimensional wave porous plate problem has received slightly less attention so far and is based mainly on the method of matched eigenfunction expansions chwang and wu 1994 and liu et al 2011 considered wave scattering by a submerged horizontal porous disc the latter showed results for the dimensionless wave height relative to the water depth and the disc radius and for the vertical force on the disc the former presented the dimensionless surface elevation as well as the vertical wave force molin and nielsen considered the axisymmetric problem for the heave radiation of water waves by a submerged porous disc and presented the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of the keulegan carpenter number an and faltinsen 2012 analysed the wave porous plate problem using a quadratic pressure loss condition which relates the pressure loss difference to the square of the transverse velocity meylan et al 2017 solved the problem of linear water wave scattering by a circular floating porous elastic plate by an eigenfunction matching method and by a plate of arbitrary shape using a coupled boundary element and finite element method they presented the far field amplitude and the wave energy dissipated due to porosity a number of recent works dokken et al 2017 oule housseine mackay et al 2019 formulate the wave diffraction radiation by bodies with porous components and present results for the added mass and damping coefficients but not for porous plates in the present article we use a formulation and solution method based on a spectral method which has been successfully applied to wave solid plate problems farina and martin 1998 1999 farina 2010 ziebell and farina 2012 farina et al 2017 the governing equation is a hypersingular integral equation and its approximate solution is sought as an expansion in terms of orthogonal polynomials the convergence of the galerkin version of this method has been proved by farina et al 2014 the mathematical problem formulation is presented in section 2 and the spectral method is described in section 3 we model the physical aspects of the problem in section 4 where the heave radiation and the porous effect parameter are described the numerical results showing the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of the wave number and for distinct porous effect parameters are given in section 5 and the concluding remarks are presented in section 6 2 formulation a cartesian coordinate system is chosen in which z is orientated vertically downwards into the fluid and the disturbed free surface is at z ζ x y t we suppose that the motion of the fluid is of small amplitude and irrotational that the fluid is incompressible and inviscid then the time dependent velocity potential φ x y z t satisfies laplace s equation in the fluid 1 2 φ x 2 2 φ y 2 2 φ z 2 0 with the linearized kinematic condition and dynamic condition imposed on the mean free surface z 0 2 φ z ζ t 3 φ t g ζ 0 where and g is the acceleration due to gravity eqs 2 and 3 may be combined to give the free surface boundary condition as 2 φ t 2 g φ z 0 z 0 in deep water the bed condition is expressed as 4 φ 0 as z in the presence of an obstacle within the fluid the potential must also satisfy boundary conditions on its body surface and also a radiation condition at large horizontal distances thus let us consider a body with a smooth closed and bounded surface d the body six linear rigid motions can be described by the body velocity with respect to the fluid mei et al 2018 eq 8 2 14 u d x d t n where x and n are six dimensional generalized body displacement and normal vector respectively mei et al 2018 eq s 8 2 13 let us now assume the body is a porous plate its permeability may be described by means of the resistance law relating the fluid velocity perpendicular to the plate w t n with the difference in pressure between the two sides p in the general form 5 w f p if the plate is made with a material with very fine pores f is a linear function of p see taylor 1956 thus the boundary condition for the relative velocity in the normal direction is 6 φ n u w on d then as particular cases if the body is held fixed the boundary condition of the porous body surface will be 7 φ n w on d while for a rigid impermeable plate the boundary condition takes the form 8 φ n u on d 2 1 simple harmonic motion we now assume the motion of the fluid is of small amplitude and time harmonic with frequency ω the linearity of the problem allows separation of variables as 9 φ x y z t d x d t x y z t ζ x y t t x y z t p x y z t re ϕ x y z v x y z η x y w x y z ϱ x y z e i ω t for the complex valued functions ϕ v η w and ϱ where v v 1 v 6 and w w 1 w 6 denote the amplitudes of the generalized body velocity and of the fluid velocity respectively we decompose ϕ further as 10 ϕ ϕ d j 1 6 v j ϕ j where 11 ϕ d ϕ 0 ϕ 7 with ϕ 0 and ϕ 7 being the incident wave and scattering potentials respectively thus ϕ d represents the diffraction potential when the body is held fixed by incoming waves from 1 3 9 and 11 we have for j 1 7 12 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j y 2 2 ϕ j z 2 0 z 0 and 13 ϕ j z i ω η 0 z 0 14 g η i ω ϕ j 0

generalizes the equation treated in farina and martin 1998 and farina et al 2014 3 method of solution equations of the form 27 with β 0 have been solved by the spectral method proposed by farina and martin in farina and martin 1998 and applied in ziebell and farina 2012 farina et al 2017 and kundu et al 2019 the convergence of the galerkin version of it has recently been established by farina et al 2014 as a particular case when the plate is a solid disc and performs vertical oscillations heave motion the problem has an axisymmetric solution and it can be solved by reducing it to a non singular one dimensional fredholm integral equation of the second kind martin and farina 1997 eq 7 6 a simple numerical method can be used for this equation for instance a nyström method combined with the gauss legendre quadrature rule as employed in martin and farina 1997 for the general case we can adopt farina martin s spectral method and this will be done next now assume that d is a circular porous disc with radius a as shown in fig 1 then the disc is given by 28 d r θ d 0 r a π θ π it has radius a and is submerged at a distance d below the free surface we can nondimensionalize using a thus without loss of generality we take a 1 eq 26 becomes 29 1 4 π d ϕ j ρ α 1 r 3 m r θ ρ α d k ρ d ρ d α i k g ϕ j r θ n j r θ 0 1 π π where r 3 ρ 2 r 2 2 ρ r cos α θ 3 2 we seek solutions in the space spanned by b k m where the b k m are defined by 30 b k m ρ α p m 2 k 1 m 1 ρ 2 e i m α k m 0 1 and p n m is an associated legendre function the radial part of these basis functions can also be expressed in terms of gegenbauer polynomials erdélyi et al 1953 the functions b k m are orthogonal over the unit disc with respect to the weight 1 ρ 2 1 2 further it is known that krenk 1979 31 1 4 π

formula 31 is that the functions b k m r θ 1 r 2 can be seen as eigenfunctions of the integral operator h defined by h v r θ d 1 r 3 v ρ α 1 ρ 2 ρ d ρ d α to exploit 31 we expand ϕ j in terms of the

implementation some computational aspects in the implementation of the spectral method described above need careful treatment in order to provide an efficient algorithm probably the main issue is the computation of the free surface green s function here we are concerned only with the double normal derivative of g given by eq 25 it can be shown farina and martin 1998 eq 16 ziebell and farina 2012 eq 32 that this function can be expressed as 34 m 2 k 2 r 2 2 d 2 1 2 4 k d 1 r 2 2 d 2 3 2 6 d 2 r 2 2 d 2 5 2 π k 3 e 2 k d h 0 k r y 0 k r 2 k 3 e 2 k d 0 2 k d e t k r 2 t 2 1 2 d t 2 π i k 3 e 2 k d j 0 k r this expression is an improvement on the representation 25 since it does not involve path integrals whose evaluations are computationally expensive furthermore the struve and bessel functions h 0 and y 0 respectively present in this alternative expression are efficiently computed by approximating orthogonal polynomials see newman 1984a integrals such as the one in 34 can be efficiently computed see newman 1984b 1985 concerning the numerical evaluation of the basis functions 30 we employ a recurrence relation for the legendre functions the following stable recurrence on k is adopted k m p k m x 2 k 1 x p k 1 m x k m 1 p k 2 m x we used n 1 n 2 6 which gives 49 collocation points over the disc the computed results from this choice of values provided numerical evidence of convergence of the expansions used to approximate ϕ j we assume that the solution is symmetric about θ 0 this means that the collocation points lie in the semi disc r θ 0 ρ 1 0 θ π collocating at symmetric points on the other semi disc would give no further information about the solution of the linear system the collocation points are taken as the intersection of concentric circles radius r l with equally separated rays emanating from the origin angle θ n more precisely the chosen points are r l θ n l 0 1 n 1 n 0 1 n 2 where r l is a certain set of distinct points in 0 1 and θ n 2 n 1 π 2 n 2 2 n 0 1 n 2 are the zeros of cos n 2 1 θ in 0 π however care must be taken when choosing the distribution of the numbers s l for instance choosing equally spaced numbers in 0 1 gives a badly conditioned system we adopt a chebyshev tensor product collocation which means that the points in the radial variable are zeros of chebyshev polynomials of the first kind t 2 n 1 2 r in 0 1 explicitly r l cos 2 l 1 π 4 n 1 4 l 0 1 n 1 the numerical method described above was implemented in fortran and the lapack routine cgerfs was used to solve the resulting linear system e a b in order to provide numerical evidence of the method convergence in table 1 of appendix the complex coefficients a k m in the expansion 32 of the solution ϕ j are shown for two distinct choices of the parameters g d a and k a the coefficients typically they decay rapidly as n 1 and n 2 increase only the first terms have significant values this indicates that the series converges rapidly and the solution is very stable a well known computational difficulty of submerged body problems arises when the submergence depth d a decreases because the so called resonant frequencies grow increasingly large in the solution ϕ j and in the hydrodynamic force this is due to a singularity in the matrix e to study the case where a plate is very close to the free surface approximations such as the ones adopted in martin and farina 1997 and farina 2010 are an alternative 4 wave radiation and the porous medium effect next we describe in section 4 1 how the wave force is expressed in terms of the heave added mass and damping coefficients and in section 4 2 how the physics of the flow within the plate is modelled by means of the porous effect parameter 4 1 added mass and damping we assume now the plate performs vertical oscillations characterizing a heaving motion for which n j n 3 as d is horizontal the vertical component of its normal vector is 1 then we have n j 1 thus the approximation to ϕ 3 is given by 35 k m n a k m c k m 1 r 2 i k g b k m r θ 1 4 π d b k m ρ α m ρ α r θ d k ρ d ρ d α 1 for r θ 0 1 π π many important applications in ocean engineering dealing with body wave interactions employ the hydrodynamic force in the design and assessment of offshore structures the hydrodynamic force on the heaving disc is given by an integral of ϕ 3 over the disc and is decomposed into the added mass a and the damping b coefficients as falnes 2002 a i b d ϕ 3 d s 0 1 0 2 π ϕ 3 r θ r d r d θ 4 2 the porous effect parameter the wave motion across a porous medium has been described by sollitt and cross 1972 in terms of a resistance force or friction coefficient f and an inertial coefficient s xiping yu and allen t chwang published a series of articles in the 1990 s yu and chwang 1994b a yu 1995 in which a porous thin plate boundary condition was introduced in the boundary condition there is an important parameter depending on f and s and on the geometrical properties of the porous plate which we call the porous effect parameter g in its general form as introduced in yu and chwang 1994b g is a complex number which can be written as 36 g γ k b f i s where γ is the plate porosity defined as the ratio of the volume of the porous part to the volume of the whole and b is the physical thickness of the porous plate writing g as 37 g γ f i s k b f 2 s 2 g r i g i we can roughly speaking refer to the real part of g as the resistance parameter and to the imaginary part of g as the inertial force acting on the porous plate this identification will be useful for interpreting the results section 5 some articles on the wave porous structure interaction are concerned only with the case in which g is real chwang 1983 chwang and wu 1994 yu and chwang 1994a an and faltinsen 2012 this means f s and physically represents a densely packed plate while when the inertial force coefficient dominates that is s f g is nearly purely imaginary and the object is said to be loosely packed yu and chwang 1994b the evaluation of g for different objects can be accomplished by obtaining f and s experimentally using the least squares method li et al 2006 eq 24 proposed a formula to evaluate f when s 1 as a function of the plate thickness and the water depth 5 numerical results we divide the numerical experiments in two regimes with respect to the disc submergence below the free surface intermediate to large depths and small depths in the later case resonances are associated with the motion above the disc and we look into this phenomenon in detail comparing it to the solid disc behaviour 5 1 intermediate and large submergence depths we first examine the hydrodynamic coefficients for submergence depths d a varying from 0 2 to 10 in figs 2 and 3 we see the added mass and damping coefficients respectively for a solid disc g 0 the maxima decrease as d a grows with a slight shift to higher frequencies in particular these coefficients approach the limiting values of a 8 3 and b 0 with this behaviour clearly seen in the curves representing the value d a 10 this corresponds to the problem of a circular solid disc moving along the z axis in an unbounded fluid lamb 1924 102 for g 0 d a 0 2 and g 0 d a 0 4 our results agree with those in martin and farina 1997 figure 2 and porter 2015 figure 14 in figs 4 and 5 we present the added mass and damping coefficients respectively for g 0 7 i 0 3 in comparison with the results for g 0 the peaks in both hydrodynamic force coefficients are lower and occur at lower frequencies as well for small k a the added mass approaches the limit 8 3 but assumes smaller values for greater k a similar behaviours are observed when g 1 in figs 6 and 7 with a further reduction in the values of a and b in the entire range of the wave frequency considered 5 2 small submergence depth we now consider the value d a 0 1 in the results presented below in order to better examine the influence of g on the behaviour of the added mass and damping coefficient we divide the analysis into two disjoint cases g imaginary and g real in fig 8 the added mass is shown as a function of k a for different values of imaginary values of the porous effect parameter g and for g 0 we emphasize three changes as g i increases a shift from the maximum to lower frequencies a displacement of the point of inflection of the curves and a significant increase in the value of the added mass peak in fig 9 a similar plot is shown but for real values of g the added mass peaks now decrease as g r increases the peak frequency is slightly shifted to a lower value as in fig 8 we can see that when g varies over purely real values the added masses for the solid disc and that for g 1 form an envelope to the intermediate curves g 0 1 and g 0 5 in such a way that the inflection points do not vary figs 10 and 11 show the damping coefficient as a function of k a for increasing absolute value of g in the case when g is imaginary respectively real we see the same behaviour as noticed for the added mass with respect to the dynamics of the peaks as g varies for g 0 we observe also that the numerical results recover the known behaviour of the added mass and damping coefficients for an impermeable horizontal disc they agree with those in fig 2 of martin and farina 1997 the peaks in the hydrodynamic force are more pronounced when the submergence depth is small this is associated with the resonant motion of the fluid over the disc the potential in the thin layer above the submerged disc is significant there the fluid is in a simple state of uniform vertical oscillation in phase with the disc with potential z 1 k in the case of a solid disc martin and farina 1997 farina 2010 a general remark is that the resonant peaks occur for lower values of the wave frequency for all porous discs as compared to the impermeable one in order to understand the behaviour of the peaks when porosity is present we look now into the extreme values of the added mass for varying complex g we consider next g c i e g is positive complex in figs 12 and 13 we present a colourmap showing the value of maxima and minima assumed by a as a function of g r and g i in the figures we do not show at which value of k a these extreme values are assumed rather we are interested to see how the extreme values of a vary with the real part of g on the horizontal axis and with the imaginary part of g on the vertical axis we then focus on the relative influence of g i and g r on a and it is clearly seen that the added mass is maximized and also minimized for large g i and small g r thus increasing the imaginary part of g emphasizes the peaks in the added mass except when the real part of g is large the resonant behaviour present in both hydrodynamic force coefficients is attenuated when the real part of the porous effect parameter dominates its imaginary part i e when the inertial force is larger than its resistance coefficient s f this property can be used in the design of offshore structures to reduce resonant oscillations 6 conclusion in this work the general problem for the diffraction and radiation of water waves by a porous disc in deep water is formulated simple harmonic motion for a heaving horizontal disc is studied in detail in particular we have analysed the influence of the porous effect parameter on the hydrodynamic forces on a thin porous disc performing vertical oscillations using a hypersingular integral equation of the second kind the solution is obtained by a spectral method based on a collocation expansion procedure which shows the method can be extended to a wider class of integral equations the added mass and damping coefficients as functions of k a are presented and the dynamic behaviours of their extreme values peak frequencies and inflexion points as g varies in the complex plane are found in particular we found that the resonant behaviour apparent in the hydrodynamic force coefficients is attenuated when the real part of the porous effect parameter dominates its imaginary part i e when the inertial force is larger than its resistance coefficient s f the numerical
