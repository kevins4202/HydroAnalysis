1625,the changing landscape of fuel consumption related in part to increased engine efficiency and the inexpensive supply of natural gas has led to the closure of multiple refineries as the operational lifetime of many refineries exceeds 100 years historical releases of oil and refined products is common to evaluate remediation and rehabilitation options there is a need to understand the rate and distribution of natural hydrocarbon mass losses across these large properties here surficial co2 flux measurements were used to evaluate naturally occurring hydrocarbon mass losses at a large scale former refinery that has been closed since 1982 natural source zone depletion nszd rates over a five year period 2012 2016 were derived from surficial co2 efflux measurements on a high resolution grid n 80 results demonstrate substantial variations of mass loss rates across the site average site wide mass loss rates ranged from 1 1 5 4 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 with a multi year average of 4 0 g tph m 2 d 1 as decane c10h22 consistent with observations at other sites statistical analysis demonstrated that the same average mass loss rates would have been obtained with fewer measurement locations n 20 30 comparing nszd rates to site metadata show co2 fluxes to be a reasonably good proxy for zones of subsurface hydrocarbon contamination particularly with respect to vadose zone impacts it is hypothesized that the observed decline of nszd rates over the study period is related to rise of groundwater levels leading to increased submergence of the smear zone overall mass loss rates calculated from co2 fluxes show nszd can result in substantial contaminant removal which may rival that obtained from engineered remediation under some conditions keywords nszd source zone natural attenuation flux chamber biodegradation co2 former refinery hydrocarbon 1 introduction as demand for refined oil products has decreased and public concerns related to gasoline pricing has increased the number of operating refineries in the united states has declined international energy agency iea 2013 in 2010 for example 124 refineries were in operation in the us reduced from the 158 in operation in the 1990s based on the long lifetime of refineries many being in operation for over 100 years hydrocarbon contamination related to historical operating practices and accidental releases is to be expected andrews and pirog 2010 once refineries close there is a need to characterize the extent of the contamination to evaluate options for site management and or redevelopment natural source zone depletion nszd here defined as contaminant mass losses resulting from naturally occurring biodegradation e g kao et al 2010 can provide an important means for mass removal soga et al 2004 identifying areas where nszd is occurring as well as areas with a lack of degradation i e either unimpacted or unable to degrade is valuable for site management purposes including selection of remedial measures khaitan et al 2006 furthermore quantifying natural mass loss rates is useful for estimating source zone longevity and assessing the utility of implementing engineered remediation measures or enhancing natural processes under different conditions khaitan et al 2006 however measuring nszd remains challenging particularly due to the influence of subsurface heterogeneities on local scale contaminant degradation processes garg et al 2017 lundegard and johnson 2006 these include for example variations in geology and contaminant morphology influencing delivery of electron acceptors and nutrients to the zones of biological reaction bekins et al 2005 h√∂hener and ponsin 2014 moreover our understanding of how snapshot measurements relate to long term mass loss rates is limited these factors prove particularly challenging at large scale industrial sites where the area of investigation can be large tens of hectares and the characteristic sampling area is difficult to define historically source zones have been delineated using invasive and time and cost intensive methods khaitan et al 2006 even for detailed site investigations it is common that only a limited interpretation of the contaminant distribution and the processes controlling contaminant degradation is possible khaitan et al 2006 despite significant investments in many cases the extent and rate of nszd can be delineated based on the measurement of biodegradation reactants and or products resulting from nszd e g johnson et al 2006 and sihota et al 2011 a conceptual representation of nszd processes occurring within a contaminated subsurface is presented in fig 1 johnson et al 2006 for example related a decrease in vadose zone o2 concentrations to a mass loss of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph attributable to aerobic degradation through the measurement of subsurface concentration gradients sihota et al 2011 equated the elevated co2 efflux above a crude oil containing vadose zone to a carbon flux from nszd using a real time dynamic closed chamber method li cor inc lincoln ne a background correction bgc was used by subtracting measured co2 fluxes at locations unaffected by the contaminant i e background locations from co2 flux measurements in areas known or suspected to be impacted by the contaminant sihota and mayer 2012 further evaluated the validity of this approach through a detailed investigation of the radiocarbon content of vadose zone co2 which was combined with quantitative reactive transport modeling to assess the processes resulting in the co2 flux measured at the ground surface results of this study conducted at the bemidji crude oil spill site showed the majority of co2 within the vadose zone was generated from oil degradation contributions to soil gas co2 due to biodegradation are likely associated with residual oil in the vadose zone and the exposed portion of the smear zone although gas release from degradation within the submerged portion of the smear zone may also occur revesz et al 1995 recently sihota et al 2016 further evaluated nszd at the bemidji site by investigating seasonal variations in gas efflux rates indicating that contaminant degradation rates were affected by seasonal changes and that flux measurements during the summer month overestimated average yearly nszd rates these results were corroborated by a study conducted at a large refinery site eichert et al 2017 nszd mass loss rates delineated using the surficial co2 flux method at the bemidji site sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 sihota et al 2016 were shown to be comparable to other nszd rates reported for the site revesz et al 1995 molins et al 2010 indicating that the method can be used to obtain non invasive estimates of nszd rates however the spill at bemidji consisted of a single contaminant type namely crude oil which was released over a short period of time and can be considered a point source large scale industrial sites are inherently more complex eichert et al 2017 providing motivation to evaluate how the co2 efflux method can be applied most effectively for investigation of nszd mass losses at sites such as former refineries where the distribution of contaminant sources is more wide spread and heterogeneous in composition and age specifically the objectives of this work include 1 evaluating the spatial distribution of contaminant respiration including identification of rapidly degrading hotspots and inactive zones possibly uncontaminated or not degrading using co2 flux measurements at a large former refinery site 2 characterizing and understanding the year to year variability in co2 effluxes representative for late summer early fall conditions 3 assessing variability in background co2 efflux values followed by calculating nszd mass losses with the background correction bgc for each study year and for the complete dataset 4 correlating co2 fluxes to site attributes to evaluate the suitability of this approach for identifying zones of high lnapl source strength 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site is a former refinery in the north central usa the climate in the region is characterized as semi arid and natural vegetation at the site is sparse where present it is dominated by a mixture of grasses and short brush the refinery was operational between 1923 and 1982 during its lifetime the facility processed crude oil from local sources into gasoline diesel and other fuels asphalt and petroleum coke were also produced the refinery was closed in 1982 and decommissioned beginning in 1996 by the end of 1999 buildings processing units tanks underground piping and other components had been removed the vadose zone and aquifer that underlies much of the property is generally comprised of alluvial medium coarse sands with some interbeds of fine sands and silts based on soil boring logs collected by the site consultants a bedrock subcrop is located in the northeastern portion of the property the presence of the subcrop implies that the alluvial aquifer is absent at that location fig 2 depth to groundwater ranges from approximately 1 5 to 11 m below ground surface mbgs with the greatest depths observed at the southeastern corner of the property since 1999 multiple subsurface investigations have been conducted on the property to support development of a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl site conceptual model and inform the selection of remedial measures the lnapl distribution and chemical physical properties have been characterized across the entire site covering approximately 60 ha ha 150 acres nested vapor well data indicate that the smear zone lnapl acts as the primary source of volatile constituents to soil gas with possible minor contribution from sorbed hydrocarbons in the shallow subsurface based on the soil gas profiles determined from vadose zone monitoring points the volatilized hydrocarbons are mineralized to co2 either directly aerobic biodegradation or indirectly methanogenesis followed by aerobic oxidation of methane fig 1 thus the fossil fuel co2 effluxes at ground surface can generally be considered as representative of hydrocarbon losses from the vadose zone soils and smear zone 2 2 co2 flux measurements co2 flux measurements were conducted in four different years between september 9 and 12th 2012 between july 21 and 25th 2014 and between september 16 and 21st 2015 and between september 21 and 23rd 2016 weather conditions were dry during each of the measurement events and any on site irrigation was suspended at least one week beforehand following sihota et al 2011 measurements were conducted using a li cor 8100a soil co2 flux system with a 20 cm survey chamber for a detailed discussion of the method the reader is referred to sihota et al 2011 and sihota and mayer 2012 to develop a high resolution map of the nszd processes co2 flux measurements were conducted at up to 94 locations across a regular grid fig 2 due to site access restrictions that varied by year a total of 83 locations were consistently visited over the four sampling events at each location soil collars 20 cm id pvc were installed 5 8 cm into the soil several days prior to conducting the flux measurements as recommended by jassal et al 2012 replicate measurements at each single location were averaged two background locations were selected in 2012 based on data from previous site assessments that identified these areas at the perimeter of the site as devoid of an lnapl smear zone fig 2 in 2014 2015 and 2016 an additional 10 background locations were measured on the north side of the river to better constrain the background co2 flux value and calculated nszd rates fig 2 2 3 calculations and comparisons of nszd rates to calculate nszd rates using the bgc measured co2 fluxes were corrected for measured natural soil respiration rates nsr following sihota et al 2011 specifically the average background co2 flux was subtracted from the average co2 flux for each measurement location in the smear zone for comparison of nszd hydrocarbon mass loss rates to mass loss rates obtained from engineered approaches and different studies results for this study are also presented in tph equivalents following johnson et al 2006 tph is represented as c10h22 at each smear zone location the nszd rate was then converted to an equivalent mass of c10h22 based on the carbon equivalents to compare the distribution of nszd rates across the study years and to evaluate the persistence of areas with elevated nszd spearmans rank order correlations were conducted these correlations provide a measure of the relationship strength between two variables by assessing how well an arbitrary monotonic function can describe the relationship without assumptions about the frequency distribution of either variable hauke and kossowski 2011 2 4 site characteristics describing lnapl sources to evaluate the value of nszd rates calculated from surficially measured co2 fluxes to identify site attributes relevant for assessing remediation goals a suite of subsurface parameters was selected for comparison to average location specific co2 fluxes metadata considered include thickness of the smear zone based on laser induced fluorescence lif depth to top of smear zone maximum fluorescence intensity for a given lif push normalized to the maximum for the full lif data set lnapl persistence i e the frequency of lnapl occurrence above 3 cm thickness in monitoring wells from 2000 to 2010 benzene mole fraction in lnapl analyzed in lnapl samples collected from monitoring wells and smear zone soil samples and soil type based on cone penetrometer measurements cpt low values indicate fine grain soils the distribution of the site metadata is provided in fig 3 the first five metadata are continuous variables while soil type is a categorical variable metadata sample sizes were 45 or greater the maximum distance from co2 efflux measurement locations to corresponding metadata locations was generally 45 m in the southeastern corner of the facility where replicate samples were not collected at each event the distance to the nearest metadata location was greater up to 150 m to examine the relationships between the metadata and surficial co2 fluxes the metadata were interpolated to smooth surfaces fig 3 and then matched to co2 flux measurement points pearsons correlation coefficients were then calculated for the paired data sets the pearson correlation test was chosen as it is robust to deviations from normality at sample sizes of 10 or greater edgell and noon 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 fluxes and nszd rates in 2012 total co2 fluxes measured above the smear zone ranged from 0 4 to 14 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 4 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 a 43 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 outlier was not included table 1 fig 4 while in 2014 total co2 fluxes measured ranged from 0 4 to 20 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 6 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 5 in 2015 measured total co2 fluxes covered a similar range from 0 1 to 18 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with a lower average flux of 1 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 6 in 2016 total co2 fluxes ranged from 0 0 to 7 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 2 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 7 across all years lowest fluxes were consistently measured in the north western and south eastern regions of the site while highest fluxes were clustered into two areas near the center of the property figs 4 7 the mean background co2 fluxes were consistently lower than fluxes above the smear zone with values of 0 9 2 3 1 0 and 1 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 for 2012 n 2 2014 n 13 2015 n 13 and 2016 n 13 respectively table 1 these values are consistent with co2 fluxes measured at natural sites under similar climate soil and vegetation conditions dugas 1993 raich and schlesinger 1992 standard errors se for mean background co2 fluxes were similar to those above the smear zone despite the smaller sample sizes table 1 the relatively low spatial variability of the background fluxes suggests that the simple background correction to nszd rates provides an acceptable approximation at this site with nszd rate uncertainty similar to that for total fluxes using the bgc nszd was identified at 93 84 92 of the measurement locations in 2012 89 77 87 in 2014 63 60 94 in 2015 and 68 64 94 in 2016 if biodegradation of hydrocarbons at the remaining locations was occurring the rate of co2 generation was too low for the signal to be distinguished from natural soil respiration within the error of this method estimated average nszd rates ranged from 0 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 se 0 3 Œºmolm 2 s 1 in 2015 to 4 4 Œºmolm 2 s 1 se 0 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 in 2014 table 1 rank correlations for nszd rates were significant for all inter annual comparisons Œ± 0 05 table 2 the spearman s œÅ values were generally 0 4 and no lower than 0 25 indicating an overall moderate correlation between measurement events this suggests that while average nszd rates varied across measurement events the spatial distributions remained similar this result indicates that one measurement event would have been sufficient to characterize zones of low versus high nszd rates at this site and supports the inference that the method can be used as a site characterization tool to identify subsurface lnapl sources however to provide a more accurate estimate of the average nszd rate and to evaluate long term trends multi year measurements and ideally seasonal measurements sihota et al 2016 are required for instance estimated average nszd rates in 2012 and 2014 were more than three times higher than in 2015 and 2016 table 1 this observation suggests that the processes controlling the rates were subject to inter annual variability over the course of the study to evaluate the sampling density necessary to adequately characterize the average site wide nszd rate the sensitivity of the average site wide nszd rate to the number of samples included in the estimate was assessed using multiple random realizations from each of the four datasets shows limited impact on the predicted site wide average above 20 30 sampling locations fig 8 this finding suggests that for each of the study years the average site wide nszd rate could have been adequately characterized using one sampling point per 2 0 3 0 104 m2 one sample per 5 to 7 5 acres this result is based on a threshold defined by a deviation of the average site wide nszd rate by less than the positive or negative standard deviation of its average value derived from all realizations fig 8 3 2 evaluation of nszd hydrocarbon mass losses using average nszd rates for each dataset results in site wide mass loss rates of 2 5 3 3 0 6 and 0 8 103 kg tph day 1 for the 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 datasets respectively nszd rates calculated in this study can be converted to mass loss rates for the entire area of the refinery 60 ha and then compared to both historical data from the study site and mass loss rates reported in the literature to facilitate these comparisons the average mass loss rate from all years in this study was calculated 3 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and converted to tph equivalents per day 4 0 Œºmol m 2 s 1 as c10h22 however it should be stressed that this conversion is for comparative purposes only seasonal changes in nszd rates suggest that a more detailed understanding of co2 fluxes is required before making long term predictions of annual hydrocarbon mass loss rates sihota et al 2016 to compare mass loss rates determined from this study to those reported in the literature total mass loss rates were evaluated in the context of mass losses from natural and engineered remediation measures at this and other sites table 3 for example within the direct vicinity of the highly impacted source zone at the site of a crude oil pipeline rupture near bemidji mn sihota et al 2011 estimated an average mass loss rate of 3 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 using co2 flux measurements at the guadalupe oil field in california lundegard and johnson 2006 estimated natural mass loss rates of diluent in the range of 0 14 3 6 Œºmol m 2 s 1 using vadose zone gas concentration profiles using o2 profiles reported by luo et al 2009 near a maintenance warehouse near location e2 on fig 2 concentration gradient calculations result in mass loss estimate of 1 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 which is similar to the values estimated based on co2 fluxes figs 4 7 table 1 using o2 consumption rates below a building where vadose zone sediments were impacted by a tarry lnapl source lundegard et al 2008 estimated an o2 consumption rate of 200 500 g day 1 correspoinding to nszd on the order of 0 2 0 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 based on a 0 25 g tph per gram o2 stoichiometric conversion factor with methane oxidation johnson et al 2006 and 250 m2 footprint overall natural mass loss estimates obtained in this study are within the range of those reported in the literature and also demonstrate variability in mass loss rates within and among study sites to set mass loss rates obtained from co2 fluxes into the broader context of remediation at the site hydrocarbon mass removal rates achieved by active remedial systems are evaluated table 3 the comparisons here are for hydrocarbon losses achieved by individual engineered systems versus hydrocarbon losses over the entire site footprint approximately 60 ha this evaluation provides context for nszd rates which at large sites can occur over larger surface areas than localized remedial activities at this site lnapl was recovered via groundwater interceptor trenches adjacent to a barrier wall a hydraulic barrier between the aquifer and the adjacent river fig 2 while the primary purpose of the system was to achieve hydraulic control of groundwater the system was also well suited for lnapl recovery via drawdown adjacent to an aquifer boundary the barrier wall the maximum annual lnapl recovery rate from 2000 to 2014 was 7 5 102 kg tph day 1 with an average of 2 3 102 kg tph day 1 and much lower rates in the latter years of operations these lnapl recovery rates are greater than those achieved by nszd 7 to 60 kg tph day 1 in the approximate 57 000 m2 area near the interceptor trenches however the lnapl recovery rates are comparable to those achieved by nszd integrated across the site 0 6 to 3 3 103 kg tph day 1 demonstrating that when placed in a site wide context nszd mass loss rates can rival those achieved by engineered systems at the end stages of hydraulic recovery lnapl mass was also removed in a partial smear zone excavation 6300 m2 within the black dotted line on fig 2 conducted in 2013 which involved extraction of 1 2 105 kg of lnapl followed by on site disposal of recovered soils for comparison an equivalent mass could be removed by nszd in 0 1 0 5 years based on nszd rates estimated for the entire site further emphasizing the substantial contribution of nszd processes towards mass removal it should be emphasized that these comparisons were based on rate estimates valid for late summer early fall taking seasonal fluctuations into considerations average yearly nszd rates may be lower sihota et al 2016 however likely by less than a factor of 2 sihota et al 2016 than the values used here implying that the comparisons outlined above are not materially affected overall these results suggest that baseline nszd rate surveys are useful for characterizing engineered remediation system efficiencies such comparisons may also be valuable in gaining regulatory approval for shutting off poorly performing engineered systems 3 3 site metadata to evaluate the relationships between co2 fluxes and subsurface parameters of concern at remediation sites we next evaluated correlations between co2 fluxes and site metadata including smear zone thickness maximum normalized lif intensity historical frequency of lnapl occurrence in wells the benzene mole fraction of the lnapl depth to the smear zone and soil type as characterized by cone penetrometer cpt using average co2 effluxes above the smear zone from all years we found significant positive correlations with smear zone thickness maximum lif intensity historical frequency of lnapl occurrence in wells and the benzene mole fraction of the lnapl table 4 pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0 23 to 0 44 indicating moderate effect sizes i e strength of the relationship between the parameter sets investigated each of the above subsurface characteristics is related to the source strength and the results suggest that co2 efflux measurements can be used to identify areas of elevated subsurface contamination and in this way guide site characterization efforts in addition average co2 effluxes above the smear zone were significantly negatively correlated with depth to the smear zone and cpt values with moderate effect sizes 0 36 and 0 44 respectively both of these subsurface characteristics are related to subsurface transport with shallow smear zone depths implying shorter vapor path lengths and lower cpt values representing more coarse textured soils with lower values for both parameters implying fewer restrictions to vapor transport and o2 ingress this outcome also suggests that co2 effluxes are suited for delineating lnapl impacts at this site which has smear zone top depths up to 11 mbgs in generally sandy soils with some finer silt and clay layers of note is that the prevalence of significant relationships indicates that the subsurface source zone characteristics are themselves correlated the univariate analysis suggests co2 effluxes can be used for identification of contaminant zones in a broader sense however no specific subsurface characteristic can be identified as dominant based on elevated co2 effluxes it is worth noting that in individual years the strength of the correlations varied however when using the average of the co2 flux data from all years significant correlations persisted si table s 1 this finding points to the benefits of collecting multi year datasets when evaluating nszd mass loss processes with replicate data sets the results show that elevated nszd rates tend to occur in locations where total lnapl mass and volatile content is relatively high as treatment often prioritizes areas where lnapl mass and content of toxicologically relevant chemicals are elevated an understanding of the distribution of these parameters is important for site remediation itrc 2018 the correlation of co2 fluxes with parameters of concern suggests surficial co2 fluxes could be used as a rapid and cost effective screening tool for identifying lnapl contaminated areas and providing guidance on which areas should be prioritized for further site investigation and possibly active remediation see table 3 to further evaluate reasons for changes in apparent nszd rates derived from co2 effluxes in the different measurement years a correlation of nszd rates to water table fluctuations changes in precipitation patterns and temperature trends was attempted in this exercise a correlation could only be identified with respect to water table elevation to further investigate this aspect estimates of the lnapl smear zone thickness exposed in the vadose zone were derived from water table contour maps results show that in general a deeper water table i e a greater smear zone thickness exposed in the vadose zone tends to correlate with greater nszd rates fig 9 it is postulated that deeper water table conditions present in 2012 and 2014 lead to increased o2 ingress into available pore space close to the contaminated regions stimulating aerobic degradation and in turn increasing the rate of co2 release from the vadose zone it is also possible that increased volatilization from an exposed smear zone resulted in an increase in the observed biodegradation rate measured at ground surface however this evaluation alone did not explain the anomalously high nszd rate measured in 2014 to further investigate the processes leading to the measured nszd rates in 2014 we examined the time elapsed between the exposure of the smear zone and the period when the flux measurements were performed the data reveals that flux measurements conducted in 2014 were performed shortly after a substantial drop in groundwater levels at an indicator well on the west side of the site fig 10 simultaneously leading to an increased exposure of the smear zone this suggests that several factors could contribute to elevated apparent nszd rates such as those measured in 2014 for example when the smear zone first becomes exposed entrapped gases co2 and ch4 commonly present in submerged smear zones e g amos et al 2005 can be released rapidly to the vadose zone leading to an increase in surficial co2 effluxes and leading to an elevated apparent rate of nszd concurrently the declining water table results in increased o2 availability for aerobic respiration as noted above this analysis also reveals that the average water table conditions at the site have been rising over the course of the study it is reasonable to assume that increasing groundwater levels led to the progressive submergence of the lnapl source thereby limiting the extent of nszd this observation explains at least in part the declining rate of nszd noted across the 4 year study although the influence of exposed lnapl on the nszd rate is apparent several limitations must be outlined for this analysis first the nszd rate estimates are each one time snapshot assessments without characterization leading up to and following the measurement events in addition groundwater level monitoring frequency was variable from 2012 to 2016 with generally higher frequencies in later years this makes lag time estimates less robust for early data sets especially 2012 overall the interpretation that rising water levels led to smear zone submergence and decreased biodegradation rates provides a reasonable hypothesis that can be tested in future studies using higher frequency temporal data collection 4 conclusions this study represents the first multi year application of co2 flux measurements with high spatial resolution n 80 or one sample per 2 acres for evaluating areas undergoing nszd at a large scale industrial site with subsurface hydrocarbon impacts although the spatial distribution of measured nszd rates show substantial variability across the site evaluation of the sampling density necessary to characterize an average site wide mass loss rate suggests this could have been achieved with fewer measurements locations at this site n 20 30 or one sample per 5 to 7 5 acres comparison of nszd rates to select subsurface parameters demonstrates co2 flux measurements are correlated with lnapl distribution and composition this finding supports the use of the surficial co2 flux method for identifying the presence of lnapl source zones and to guide additional site investigation efforts at locations similar to this site many of the subsurface characteristics e g smear zone thickness benzene mole fraction of lnapl co varied so additional research would be needed to identify the specific source zone characteristics that are most important in generating co2 efflux the average multi year site wide mass loss rate calculated from co2 effluxes in this study 4 0 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 is within the range of those estimated from other sites where nszd source zone depletion is occurring 0 14 9 7 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 the variability in nszd rates estimated across the large footprint for the current study supports the within site variation documented elsewhere and adds the observation that this variation is related to subsurface source zone characteristics comparison of nszd mass loss rates to engineered mass removal at this site show that when integrated over the entire study area natural mass losses can rival those obtained from late stage lnapl recovery systems in localized areas however it should be stressed that engineered systems may be needed to achieve goals other than mass removal e g the barrier wall at the study site evaluated in this work or when a sensitive receptor may be impacted by the contaminant the general trend of declining mass loss rates over the study period is likely correlated to rising groundwater levels increasing water levels tend to lead to the submergence of the lnapl smear zone and are believed to be at least in part responsible for the declining nszd rates at this site overall results of this study demonstrate that nszd rate estimates obtained from co2 flux measurements with the background correction can be useful for delineating hydrocarbon impacted areas and setting engineered mass losses into context with those occurring via natural processes however while high resolution data can be valuable for understanding local scale processes sampling densities can be significantly reduced if only a bulk mass loss rate for the site is needed acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the

1625,the changing landscape of fuel consumption related in part to increased engine efficiency and the inexpensive supply of natural gas has led to the closure of multiple refineries as the operational lifetime of many refineries exceeds 100 years historical releases of oil and refined products is common to evaluate remediation and rehabilitation options there is a need to understand the rate and distribution of natural hydrocarbon mass losses across these large properties here surficial co2 flux measurements were used to evaluate naturally occurring hydrocarbon mass losses at a large scale former refinery that has been closed since 1982 natural source zone depletion nszd rates over a five year period 2012 2016 were derived from surficial co2 efflux measurements on a high resolution grid n 80 results demonstrate substantial variations of mass loss rates across the site average site wide mass loss rates ranged from 1 1 5 4 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 with a multi year average of 4 0 g tph m 2 d 1 as decane c10h22 consistent with observations at other sites statistical analysis demonstrated that the same average mass loss rates would have been obtained with fewer measurement locations n 20 30 comparing nszd rates to site metadata show co2 fluxes to be a reasonably good proxy for zones of subsurface hydrocarbon contamination particularly with respect to vadose zone impacts it is hypothesized that the observed decline of nszd rates over the study period is related to rise of groundwater levels leading to increased submergence of the smear zone overall mass loss rates calculated from co2 fluxes show nszd can result in substantial contaminant removal which may rival that obtained from engineered remediation under some conditions keywords nszd source zone

remedial measures khaitan et al 2006 furthermore quantifying natural mass loss rates is useful for estimating source zone longevity and assessing the utility of implementing engineered remediation measures or enhancing natural processes under different conditions khaitan et al 2006 however measuring nszd remains challenging particularly due to the influence of subsurface heterogeneities on

acceptors and nutrients to the zones of biological reaction bekins et al 2005 h√∂hener and ponsin 2014 moreover our understanding of how snapshot measurements relate to long term mass loss rates is

interpretation of the contaminant distribution and the processes controlling contaminant degradation is possible khaitan et al 2006 despite significant investments in many cases the extent and rate of nszd can be delineated based on the measurement of biodegradation reactants and or products resulting from nszd e g johnson et al 2006 and sihota et al 2011 a conceptual representation of nszd processes occurring within a contaminated subsurface is presented in fig 1 johnson et al 2006 for example related a decrease in vadose zone o2 concentrations to a mass loss of total petroleum hydrocarbons tph attributable to aerobic degradation through the measurement of subsurface concentration gradients sihota et al 2011 equated the elevated co2 efflux above a crude oil containing vadose zone to a carbon flux from nszd using a real time dynamic closed chamber method li cor inc lincoln ne a background correction bgc was used by subtracting measured co2 fluxes at locations unaffected by the contaminant i e background locations from co2 flux measurements in areas known or suspected to be impacted by the contaminant sihota and mayer 2012 further evaluated the validity of this approach through a detailed investigation of the radiocarbon content of vadose zone co2 which was combined with quantitative reactive transport modeling to assess the processes resulting in the co2 flux measured at the ground surface results of this study conducted at the bemidji crude oil spill site showed the majority of co2 within the vadose zone was generated from oil degradation contributions to soil gas co2 due to biodegradation are likely associated with residual oil in the vadose zone and the exposed portion of the smear zone although gas release from degradation within the submerged portion of the smear zone may also occur revesz et al 1995 recently sihota et al 2016 further evaluated nszd at the bemidji site by investigating seasonal variations in gas efflux rates indicating that contaminant degradation rates were affected by seasonal changes and that flux measurements during the summer month overestimated average yearly nszd rates these results were corroborated by a study conducted at a large refinery site eichert et al 2017 nszd mass loss rates delineated using the surficial co2 flux method at the bemidji site sihota et al 2011 sihota and mayer 2012 sihota et al 2016 were shown to be comparable to other nszd rates reported for the site revesz et al 1995 molins et al 2010 indicating that the method can be used to obtain non invasive estimates of nszd rates however the spill at bemidji consisted of a single contaminant type namely crude oil which was released over a short period of time and can be considered a point source large scale industrial sites are inherently more complex eichert et al 2017 providing motivation to evaluate how the co2 efflux method can be applied most effectively for investigation of nszd mass losses at sites such as former refineries where the distribution of contaminant sources is more wide spread and heterogeneous in composition and age specifically the objectives of this work include 1 evaluating the spatial distribution of contaminant respiration including identification of rapidly degrading hotspots and inactive zones possibly uncontaminated or not degrading using co2 flux measurements at a large former refinery site 2 characterizing and understanding the year to year variability in co2 effluxes representative for late summer early fall conditions 3 assessing variability in background co2 efflux values followed by calculating nszd mass losses with the background correction bgc for each study year and for the complete dataset 4 correlating co2 fluxes to site attributes to evaluate the suitability of this approach for identifying zones of high lnapl source strength 2 methods 2 1 study site the study site is a former refinery in the north central usa the climate in the region is characterized as semi arid and natural vegetation at the site is sparse where present it is dominated by a mixture of grasses and short brush the refinery was operational between 1923 and 1982 during its lifetime the facility processed crude oil from local sources into gasoline diesel and other fuels asphalt and petroleum coke were also produced the refinery was closed in 1982 and decommissioned beginning in 1996 by the end of 1999 buildings processing units tanks underground piping and other components had been removed the vadose zone and aquifer that underlies much of the property is generally comprised of alluvial medium coarse sands with some interbeds of fine sands and silts based on soil boring logs collected by the site consultants a bedrock subcrop is located in the northeastern portion of the property the presence of the subcrop implies that the alluvial aquifer is absent at that location fig 2 depth to groundwater ranges from approximately 1 5 to 11 m below ground surface mbgs with the greatest depths observed at the southeastern corner of the property since 1999 multiple subsurface investigations have been conducted on the property to support development of a light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl site conceptual model and inform the selection of remedial measures the lnapl distribution and chemical physical properties have been characterized across the entire site covering approximately 60 ha ha 150 acres nested vapor well data indicate that the smear zone lnapl acts as the primary source of volatile constituents to soil gas with possible minor contribution from sorbed hydrocarbons in the shallow subsurface based on the soil gas profiles determined from vadose zone monitoring points the volatilized hydrocarbons are mineralized to co2 either directly aerobic biodegradation or indirectly methanogenesis followed by aerobic oxidation of methane fig 1 thus the fossil fuel co2 effluxes at ground surface can generally be considered as representative of hydrocarbon losses from the vadose zone soils and smear zone 2 2 co2 flux measurements co2 flux measurements were conducted in four different years between september 9 and 12th 2012 between july 21 and 25th 2014 and between september 16 and 21st 2015 and between september 21 and 23rd 2016 weather conditions were dry during each of the measurement events and any on site irrigation was suspended at least one week beforehand following sihota et al 2011 measurements were conducted using a li cor 8100a soil co2 flux system with a 20 cm survey chamber for a detailed discussion of the method the reader is referred to sihota et al 2011 and sihota and mayer 2012 to develop a high resolution map of the nszd processes co2 flux measurements were conducted at up to 94 locations across a regular grid fig 2 due to site access restrictions that varied by year a total of 83 locations were consistently visited over the four sampling events at each location soil collars 20 cm id pvc were installed 5 8 cm into the soil several days prior to conducting the flux measurements as recommended by jassal et al 2012 replicate measurements at each single location were averaged two background locations were selected in 2012 based on data from previous site assessments that identified these areas at the perimeter of the site as devoid of an lnapl smear zone fig 2 in 2014 2015 and 2016 an additional 10 background locations were measured on the north side of the river to better constrain the background co2 flux value and calculated nszd rates fig 2 2 3 calculations and comparisons of nszd rates to calculate nszd rates using the bgc measured co2 fluxes were corrected for measured natural soil respiration rates nsr following sihota et al 2011 specifically the average background co2 flux was subtracted from the average co2 flux for each measurement location in the smear zone for comparison of nszd hydrocarbon mass loss rates to mass loss rates obtained from engineered approaches and different studies results for this study are also presented in tph equivalents following johnson et al 2006 tph is represented as c10h22 at each smear zone location the nszd rate was then converted to an equivalent mass of c10h22 based on the carbon equivalents to compare the distribution of nszd rates across the study years and to evaluate the persistence of areas with elevated nszd spearmans rank order correlations were conducted these correlations provide a measure of the relationship strength between two variables by assessing how well an arbitrary monotonic function can describe the relationship without assumptions about the frequency distribution of either variable hauke and kossowski 2011 2 4 site characteristics describing lnapl sources to evaluate the value of nszd rates calculated from surficially measured co2 fluxes to identify site attributes relevant for assessing remediation goals a suite of subsurface parameters was selected for comparison to average location specific co2 fluxes metadata considered include thickness of the smear zone based on laser induced fluorescence lif depth to top of smear zone maximum fluorescence intensity for a given lif push normalized to the maximum for the full lif data set lnapl persistence i e the frequency of lnapl occurrence above 3 cm thickness in monitoring wells from 2000 to 2010 benzene mole fraction in lnapl analyzed in lnapl samples collected from monitoring wells and smear zone soil samples and soil type based on cone penetrometer measurements cpt low values indicate fine grain soils the distribution of the site metadata is provided in fig 3 the first five metadata are continuous variables while soil type is a categorical variable metadata sample sizes were 45 or greater the maximum distance from co2 efflux measurement locations to corresponding metadata locations was generally 45 m in the southeastern corner of the facility where replicate samples were not collected at each event the distance to the nearest metadata location was greater up to 150 m to examine the relationships between the metadata and surficial co2 fluxes the metadata were interpolated to smooth surfaces fig 3 and then matched to co2 flux measurement points pearsons correlation coefficients were then calculated for the paired data sets the pearson correlation test was chosen as it is robust to deviations from normality at sample sizes of 10 or greater edgell and noon 1984 3 results and discussion 3 1 co2 fluxes and nszd rates in 2012 total co2 fluxes measured above the smear zone ranged from 0 4 to 14 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 4 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 a 43 2 Œºmol m 2 s 1 outlier was not included table 1 fig 4 while in 2014 total co2 fluxes measured ranged from 0 4 to 20 1 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 6 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 5 in 2015 measured total co2 fluxes covered a similar range from 0 1 to 18 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with a lower average flux of 1 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 6 in 2016 total co2 fluxes ranged from 0 0 to 7 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with an average of 2 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 table 1 fig 7 across all years lowest fluxes were consistently measured in the north western and south eastern regions of the site while highest fluxes were clustered into two areas near the center of the property figs 4 7 the mean background co2 fluxes were consistently lower than fluxes above the smear zone with values of 0 9 2 3 1 0 and 1 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 for 2012 n 2 2014 n 13 2015 n 13 and 2016 n 13 respectively table 1 these values are consistent with co2 fluxes measured at natural sites under similar climate soil and vegetation conditions dugas 1993 raich and schlesinger 1992 standard errors se for mean background co2 fluxes were similar to those above the smear zone despite the smaller sample sizes table 1 the relatively low spatial variability of the background fluxes suggests that the simple background correction to nszd rates provides an acceptable approximation at this site with nszd rate uncertainty similar to that for total fluxes using the bgc nszd was identified at 93 84 92 of the measurement locations in 2012 89 77 87 in 2014 63 60 94 in 2015 and 68 64 94 in 2016 if biodegradation of hydrocarbons at the remaining locations was occurring the rate of co2 generation was too low for the signal to be distinguished from natural soil respiration within the error of this method estimated average nszd rates ranged from 0 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 se 0 3 Œºmolm 2 s 1 in 2015 to 4 4 Œºmolm 2 s 1 se 0 7 Œºmol m 2 s 1 in 2014 table 1 rank correlations for nszd rates were significant for all inter annual comparisons Œ± 0 05 table 2 the spearman s œÅ values were generally 0 4 and no lower than 0 25 indicating an overall moderate correlation between measurement events this suggests that while average nszd rates varied across measurement events the spatial distributions remained similar this result indicates that one measurement event would have been sufficient to characterize zones of low versus high nszd rates at this site and supports the inference that the method can be used as a site characterization tool to identify subsurface lnapl sources however to provide a more accurate estimate of the average nszd rate and to evaluate long term trends multi year measurements and ideally seasonal measurements sihota et al 2016 are required for instance estimated average nszd rates in 2012 and 2014 were more than three times higher than in 2015 and 2016 table 1 this observation suggests that the processes controlling the rates were subject to inter annual variability over the course of the study to evaluate the sampling density necessary to adequately characterize the average site wide nszd rate the sensitivity of the average site wide nszd rate to the number of samples included in the estimate was assessed using multiple random realizations from each of the four datasets shows limited impact on the predicted site wide average above 20 30 sampling locations fig 8 this finding suggests that for each of the study years the average site wide nszd rate could have been adequately characterized using one sampling point per 2 0 3 0 104 m2 one sample per 5 to 7 5 acres this result is based on a threshold defined by a deviation of the average site wide nszd rate by less than the positive or negative standard deviation of its average value derived from all realizations fig 8 3 2 evaluation of nszd hydrocarbon mass losses using average nszd rates for each dataset results in site wide mass loss rates of 2 5 3 3 0 6 and 0 8 103 kg tph day 1 for the 2012 2014 2015 and 2016 datasets respectively nszd rates calculated in this study can be converted to mass loss rates for the entire area of the refinery 60 ha and then compared to both historical data from the study site and mass loss rates reported in the literature to facilitate these comparisons the average mass loss rate from all years in this study was calculated 3 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 and converted to tph equivalents per day 4 0 Œºmol m 2 s 1 as c10h22 however it should be stressed that this conversion is for comparative purposes only seasonal changes in nszd rates suggest that a more detailed understanding of co2 fluxes is required before making long term predictions of annual hydrocarbon mass loss rates sihota et al 2016 to compare mass loss rates determined from this study to those reported in the literature total mass loss rates were evaluated in the context of mass losses from natural and engineered remediation measures at this and other sites table 3 for example within the direct vicinity of the highly impacted source zone at the site of a crude oil pipeline rupture near bemidji mn sihota et al 2011 estimated an average mass loss rate of 3 3 Œºmol m 2 s 1 using co2 flux measurements at the guadalupe oil field in california lundegard and johnson 2006 estimated natural mass loss rates of diluent in the range of 0 14 3 6 Œºmol m 2 s 1 using vadose zone gas concentration profiles using o2 profiles reported by luo et al 2009 near a maintenance warehouse near location e2 on fig 2 concentration gradient calculations result in mass loss estimate of 1 9 Œºmol m 2 s 1 which is similar to the values estimated based on co2 fluxes figs 4 7 table 1 using o2 consumption rates below a building where vadose zone sediments were impacted by a tarry lnapl source lundegard et al 2008 estimated an o2 consumption rate of 200 500 g day 1 correspoinding to nszd on the order of 0 2 0 5 Œºmol m 2 s 1 based on a 0 25 g tph per gram o2 stoichiometric conversion factor with methane oxidation johnson et al 2006 and 250 m2 footprint overall natural mass loss estimates obtained in this study are within the range of those reported in the literature and also demonstrate variability in mass loss rates within and among study sites to set mass loss rates obtained from co2 fluxes into the broader context of remediation at the site hydrocarbon mass removal rates achieved by active remedial systems are evaluated table 3 the comparisons here are for hydrocarbon losses achieved by individual engineered systems versus hydrocarbon losses over the entire site footprint approximately 60 ha this evaluation provides context for nszd rates which at large sites can occur over larger surface areas than localized remedial activities at this site lnapl was recovered via groundwater interceptor trenches adjacent to a barrier wall a hydraulic barrier between the aquifer and the adjacent river fig 2 while the primary purpose of the system was to achieve hydraulic control of groundwater the system was also well suited for lnapl recovery via drawdown adjacent to an aquifer boundary the barrier wall the maximum annual lnapl recovery rate from 2000 to 2014 was 7 5 102 kg tph day 1 with an average of 2 3 102 kg tph day 1 and much lower rates in the latter years of operations these lnapl recovery rates are greater than those achieved by nszd 7 to 60 kg tph day 1 in the approximate 57 000 m2 area near the interceptor trenches however the lnapl recovery rates are comparable to those achieved by nszd integrated across the site 0 6 to 3 3 103 kg tph day 1 demonstrating that when placed in a site wide context nszd mass loss rates can rival those achieved by engineered systems at the end stages of hydraulic recovery lnapl mass was also removed in a partial smear zone excavation 6300 m2 within the black dotted line on fig 2 conducted in 2013 which involved extraction of 1 2 105 kg of lnapl followed by on site disposal of recovered soils for comparison an equivalent mass could be removed by nszd in 0 1 0 5 years based on nszd rates estimated for the entire site further emphasizing the substantial contribution of nszd processes towards mass removal it should be emphasized that these comparisons were based on rate estimates valid for late summer early fall taking seasonal fluctuations into considerations average yearly nszd rates may be lower sihota et al 2016 however likely by less than a factor of 2 sihota et al 2016 than the values used here implying that the comparisons outlined above are not materially affected overall these results suggest that baseline nszd rate surveys are useful for characterizing engineered remediation system efficiencies such comparisons may also be valuable in gaining regulatory approval for shutting off poorly performing engineered systems 3 3 site metadata to evaluate the relationships between co2 fluxes and subsurface parameters of concern at remediation sites we next evaluated correlations between co2 fluxes and site metadata including smear zone thickness maximum normalized lif intensity historical frequency of lnapl occurrence in wells the benzene mole fraction of the lnapl depth to the smear zone and soil type as characterized by cone penetrometer cpt using average co2 effluxes above the smear zone from all years we found significant positive correlations with smear zone thickness maximum lif intensity historical frequency of lnapl occurrence in wells and the benzene mole fraction of the lnapl table 4 pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0 23 to 0 44 indicating moderate effect sizes i e strength of the relationship between the parameter sets investigated each of the above subsurface characteristics is related to the source strength and the results suggest that co2 efflux measurements can be used to identify areas of elevated subsurface contamination and in this way guide site characterization efforts in addition average co2 effluxes above the smear zone were significantly negatively correlated with depth to the smear zone and cpt values with moderate effect sizes 0 36 and 0 44 respectively both of these subsurface characteristics are related to subsurface transport with shallow smear zone depths implying shorter vapor path lengths and lower cpt values representing more coarse textured soils with lower values for both parameters implying fewer restrictions to vapor transport and o2 ingress this outcome also suggests that co2 effluxes are suited for delineating lnapl impacts at this site which has smear zone top depths up to 11 mbgs in generally sandy soils with some finer silt and clay layers of note is that the prevalence of significant relationships indicates that the subsurface source zone characteristics are themselves correlated the univariate analysis suggests co2 effluxes can be used for identification of contaminant zones in a broader sense however no specific subsurface characteristic can be identified as dominant based on elevated co2 effluxes it is worth noting that in individual years the strength of the correlations varied however when using the average of the co2 flux data from all years significant correlations persisted si table s 1 this finding points to the benefits of collecting multi year datasets when evaluating nszd mass loss processes with replicate data sets the results show that elevated nszd rates tend to occur in locations where total lnapl mass and volatile content is relatively high as treatment often prioritizes areas where lnapl mass and content of toxicologically relevant chemicals are elevated an understanding of the distribution of these parameters is important for site remediation itrc 2018 the correlation of co2 fluxes with parameters of concern suggests surficial co2 fluxes could be used as a rapid and cost effective screening tool for identifying lnapl contaminated areas and providing guidance on which areas should be prioritized for further site investigation and possibly active remediation see table 3 to further evaluate reasons for changes in apparent nszd rates derived from co2 effluxes in the different measurement years a correlation of nszd rates to water table fluctuations changes in precipitation patterns and temperature trends was attempted in this exercise a correlation could only be identified with respect to water table elevation to further investigate this aspect estimates of the lnapl smear zone thickness exposed in the vadose zone were derived from water table contour maps results show that in general a deeper water table i e a greater smear zone thickness exposed in the vadose zone tends to correlate with greater nszd rates fig 9 it is postulated that deeper water table conditions present in 2012 and 2014 lead to increased o2 ingress into available pore space close to the contaminated regions stimulating aerobic degradation and in turn increasing the rate of co2 release from the vadose zone it is also possible that increased volatilization from an exposed smear zone resulted in an increase in the observed biodegradation rate measured at ground surface however this evaluation alone did not explain the anomalously high nszd rate measured in 2014 to further investigate the processes leading to the measured nszd rates in 2014 we examined the time elapsed between the exposure of the smear zone and the period when the flux measurements were performed the data reveals that flux measurements conducted in 2014 were performed shortly after a substantial drop in groundwater levels at an indicator well on the west side of the site fig 10 simultaneously leading to an increased exposure of the smear zone this suggests that several factors could contribute to elevated apparent nszd rates such as those measured in 2014 for example when the smear zone first becomes exposed entrapped gases co2 and ch4 commonly present in submerged smear zones e g amos et al 2005 can be released rapidly to the vadose zone leading to an increase in surficial co2 effluxes and leading to an elevated apparent rate of nszd concurrently the declining water table results in increased o2 availability for aerobic respiration as noted above this analysis also reveals that the average water table conditions at the site have been rising over the course of the study it is reasonable to assume that increasing groundwater levels led to the progressive submergence of the lnapl source thereby limiting the extent of nszd this observation explains at least in part the declining rate of nszd noted across the 4 year study although the influence of exposed lnapl on the nszd rate is apparent several limitations must be outlined for this analysis first the nszd rate estimates are each one time snapshot assessments without characterization leading up to and following the measurement events in addition groundwater level monitoring frequency was variable from 2012 to 2016 with generally higher frequencies in later years this makes lag time estimates less robust for early data sets especially 2012 overall the interpretation that rising water levels led to smear zone submergence and decreased biodegradation rates provides a reasonable hypothesis that can be tested in future studies using higher frequency temporal data collection 4 conclusions this study represents the first multi year application of co2 flux measurements with high spatial resolution n 80 or one sample per 2 acres for evaluating areas undergoing nszd at a large scale industrial site with subsurface hydrocarbon impacts although the spatial distribution of measured nszd rates show substantial variability across the site evaluation of the sampling density necessary to characterize an average site wide mass loss rate suggests this could have been achieved with fewer measurements locations at this site n 20 30 or one sample per 5 to 7 5 acres comparison of nszd rates to select subsurface parameters demonstrates co2 flux measurements are correlated with lnapl distribution and composition this finding supports the use of the surficial co2 flux method for identifying the presence of lnapl source zones and to guide additional site investigation efforts at locations similar to this site many of the subsurface characteristics e g smear zone thickness benzene mole fraction of lnapl co varied so additional research would be needed to identify the specific source zone characteristics that are most important in generating co2 efflux the average multi year site wide mass loss rate calculated from co2 effluxes in this study 4 0 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 is within the range of those estimated from other sites where nszd source zone depletion is occurring 0 14 9 7 g tph m 2 d 1 as c10h22 the variability in nszd rates estimated across the large footprint for the current study supports the within site variation documented elsewhere and adds the observation that this variation is related to subsurface source zone characteristics comparison of nszd mass loss rates to engineered mass removal at this site show that when integrated over the entire study area natural mass losses can rival those obtained from late stage lnapl recovery systems in localized areas however it should be stressed that engineered systems may be needed to achieve goals other than mass removal e g the barrier wall at the study site evaluated in this work or when a sensitive receptor may be impacted by the contaminant the general trend of declining mass loss rates over the study period is likely correlated to rising groundwater levels increasing water levels tend to lead to the submergence of the lnapl smear zone and are believed to be at least in part responsible for the declining nszd rates at this site overall results of this study demonstrate that nszd rate estimates obtained from co2 flux measurements with the background correction can be useful for delineating hydrocarbon impacted areas and setting engineered mass losses into context with those occurring via natural processes however while high resolution data can be valuable for understanding local scale processes sampling densities can be significantly reduced if only a bulk mass loss rate for the site is needed acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the

1626,considerable activities from the oil and natural gas sector have risen some concerns about the pollution of soil and groundwater by petroleum hydrocarbons phcs in semi arid coastal regions the understanding of the fate and transport of phcs in these regions is therefore necessary to develop strategies for remediation to quantify the sorption rates of phcs in semi arid coastal soil environments we conducted a series of controlled laboratory batch experiments under variable temperature and salinity conditions the soil samples were collected from the eastern coast of qatar which is near the two largest off shore oil and natural gas fields of the country north gas and al shaheen oil fields and the volatile benzene and naphthalene were used as phcs the characterization of soil samples showed sand classification with the texture class of sabkha and saline beach sandy soils with calcite as potential dominant mineral the concentrations of dissolved chloride and sodium were found to be high 400 mg l 1 with a chloride to sodium ratio of about 1 7 the results of sorption experiments showed that the rates of naphthalene sorption were more than for benzene where the initial aqueous concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were reduced at equilibrium due to sorption by about 14 25 and 65 79 respectively this difference was attributed mainly to the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient which is higher for naphthalene the sorption rate experiments showed that sorption was stronger for benzene under higher salinity and lower temperature conditions the sorption of naphthalene was not affected by the change in salinity but increased by 18 when the temperature decreased from 35 to 5 c a sorption kinetic model was also applied to define the sorption behavior of benzene and naphthalene for the coastal soil collected in qatar and the best fits were achieved with the langmuir sorption isotherm keywords hydrocarbons arid soil temperature salinity sorption 1 introduction a common source of contamination of soil and groundwater in arid and semi arid coastal regions are accidental spills of petroleum products such as crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel usually referred to as dense or light non aqueous phase liquids dnapl or lnapl soil and groundwater pollution by petroleum hydrocarbons phcs is a serious environmental problem which poses hazards to water resources and living organisms including humans kponee et al 2015 poole et al 1993 rengarajan et al 2015 when released to the subsurface phcs move downwards through the aerobic vadose zone eventually they reach the groundwater table where oil overlay promotes the development of anaerobic conditions salminen et al 2004 vroblesky et al 1996 the geochemical conditions above the water table including the oxygen availability moisture content nutrient concentrations ph salinity and temperature are important determinants of physical and biogeochemical processes sims et al 1993 the fate transport and multiphase flow of phcs depend on biogeochemical processes and on the processes of volatilization biodegradation dissolution transport and sorption which vary by environmental factors including oxygen supply soil moisture ph temperature salinity nutrients and redox potential they are controlled by the organic carbon content of soils or aquifer materials dissolution into groundwater and biodegradation in the unsaturated and saturated zones among these soil and environmental factors the effects of temperature and salinity seem most crucial for the feasibility of remediation of polluted groundwater in semi arid and arid coastal regions piatt et al 1996 used batch and column experiments to study the sorption of naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene to low organic carbon aquifer sediments at 4 and 26 c and they found that equilibrium partitioning coefficients increased with a decrease in temperature whereas desorption rates decreased with temperature wang et al 2011 conducted batch studies to determine the effects of temperature on the sorption of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to river and estuary sediments under thermal gradients from 5 to 35 c and their results showed that stronger sorption occurred at lower temperatures means 1995 conducted batch sorption experiments to examine the influence of salinity on the partitioning of pyrene between natural sediments and water and they found that equilibrium partitioning coefficients increased with salinity tremblay et al 2005 used estuarine particles as sorbents to study the effects of temperature and salinity on the sorption of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in batch experiments and they found that a decrease in water temperature and an increase in salinity together increased the sorption to the particles the fate and transport of phcs at the coastal area of qatar a peninsular arab country may not be similar to other studies because of the combination of high saline seawater intrusion groundwater table fluctuations induced by groundwater and seawater interactions and qatar s harsh and fragile environment high temperature low rainfall strong winds and low nutrient availability in the soil alsharhan et al 2001 the understanding of the influence of the above factors is important due to the proximity of the large off shore oil and natural gas fields of the country and the challenges that qatar is facing with freshwater availability to the best of our knowledge there is no existing studies or data related to the sorption of phcs to qatari soils or aquifer materials especially from the coastal areas previous environmental studies in qatar regions have focused primarily on the characterization of phcs contaminated media potential methods of treatment for decontamination and biodegradation e g al kaabi 2016 al disi et al 2017 rushdi et al 2017 the main goal of this study was to extensively characterize soils from the eastern coast of qatar and conduct multiple series of batch experiments under variable temperatures and salinities to determine the sorption properties of two selected phcs with the specific objectives to determine the sorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics of the phcs for qatar semi arid coastal regions this study provides the first knowledge about the sorption of phcs on qatari coastal soils as a function of temperature and salinity moreover this study includes modeling of sorption kinetics which can be used to predict the fate and transport of phcs in these soils with possible implications of the findings to contribute in meeting the remediation targets in contaminated soil environment and as such will enhance qatar s capacity to sustain healthy soil ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide the findings of the present study could also be useful for other coastal areas with similar climate and salinity conditions such as in iran and the other countries of the arabian peninsula including saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain kuwait oman and yemen 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and soil sampling the soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 to 75 cm below the ground surface on the eastern side of a small town called sumaysimah which lies on the eastern coast of qatar 25 34 26 61 n 51 29 18 77 e the selected field site provides a condition where seawater and groundwater interact salinity and nutrient concentrations are high and large temperature fluctuations are the norm baalousha 2016b qatar meteorology department 2018 shomar 2015 the site is also near the two largest off shore oil and natural gas fields of qatar north gas field and al shaheen oil field in an event of environmental contamination by these two oil and natural gas fields the soil and groundwater in sumaysimah regions and the population may be exposed to phcs the site therefore provides an ideal setting to study the fate of phcs under extreme environmental conditions e g variable salinity and temperature the soil samples were air dried and transported to the university of waterloo in canada for characterizations and laboratory experiments

determined by sieve analysis prior to sieving 491 g of the soil was dried in an oven at 105 c and for 24 h the dry soil was then dry sieved using a series of sieves with mesh sizes of 0 063 0 125 0 25 0 5 0 6 1 2 4 and 13 5 mm the mesh sizes were selected in a way to cover the size range of soil particles including seashells and to have data points as close as possible to sediment size limits of standard soil classification systems the particle density of the soil was determined on samples with size smaller than 2 mm to make sure that the measured density is representative of the sediments in the soil 100 g of the sediment fraction of the soil samples was first dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and three dried samples of 25 g each were used for particle density measurement the particle density was determined gravimetrically similarly to the pycnometer method using millipore water and by gentle boiling on a hot plate with frequent swirling to release air from the water saturated soil the chemical solid phase characterization of the sediment fractions of the samples was performed using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 3000 coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer bruker quantax 70 eds total carbon organic and inorganic nitrogen and sulfur concentrations were measured on a chns carbo erba analyzer method detection limit 0 1 dry all sem and chns analyses were conducted in duplicates and the precision was 5 relative standard deviation according to certified reference materials a leaching experiment was conducted to measure the soluble salt content ph electrical conductivity ec total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and precipitated or deposited chemicals from the soil samples a purpose of this experiment was to measure the natural physico chemical parameters of the soil samples which could not be measured during the sorption experiments due to the addition of a biocide see 2 4 the leaching experiment consisted of mixing the air dried soil samples 4 mm particle size with millipore water liquid to solid ratio of 1 28 0 01 ml g 1 into two 60 ml glass bottles duplicates with open top unlined aluminum seals and teflon faced septa the bottles were agitated for 24 h on a tumbling wheel at a speed of 10 rounds per minute rpm and during the process of leaching the aqueous phase became very turbid indicating good dissolution of soluble salts in millipore water at the end of the agitation the bottles were left on bench for three hours to settle the particles before aqueous extraction the non turbid aqueous phase was extracted from the bottles and the samples were analyzed for ph and ec using a thermo scientific orion 2 star bench top ph meter thermo scientific orion versastar and for toc and tn using shimadzu toc lcph cpn

select representative phcs for qatar reviews on common naphthas used in qatar oil industries were conducted the aromatic compounds were given more attention in most reports and studies likely because they are easily found in the products of oil companies and giving a high probability to end up in the soil and groundwater environment as contaminants benzene c6h6 and naphthalene c10h8 were selected for the batch experiments in this study in qatar benzene is used for example in a designed production of 100 000 million tons per annum of linear alkyl benzene at the petrochemical company seef qatar petroleum 2014 based on an assay report of al shaheen crude oil naphthalene was estimated at 2 4 volume of the fraction of the crude extracted within 150 200 c caleb brett 2006 a percentage which when multiplied by the volume of crude extracted can give a significant volume of naphthalene in this study the high purity benzene 99 9 catalogue number 270709 and naphthalene 99 crystal form catalogue number 184500 from sigma aldrich canada were used benzene is more soluble than naphthalene in water table 1 and in a mixture of these two compounds the average density at 25 c would be 0 98 kg l 1 and thus the mixture could behave like a lnapl temperature and salinity are two factors affecting the solubility of benzene and naphthalene the following relationships were used to calculate the solubility as a function of temperature for benzene eq 1 and naphthalene eq 2 may et al 1978 1 s w benzene a 0 0247 t 3 0 6838 t 2 0 3166 t 1833 10 3 2 s w naphthalene a 0 0189 t 2 0 2499 t 13 66 10 3 where s w a is the water solubility Œºg l 1 at a known temperature t c the following empirical relationship which was derived by setschenow 1889 was used to calculate the solubility of benzene and

mol 1 is the setschenow constant and c s mol l 1 is the salt concentration examples of solubility of benzene and naphthalene in fresh and saline water are shown in table 1 2 4 batch sorption experiments the effects of temperature and salinity on the sorption of benzene and naphthalene on the soil were determined in multiple batch sorption experiments historical climate data in qatar show that the air temperature can vary between 10 c in january and 40 c in july ali et al 2016 lloyd et al 1987 qatar meteorology department 2018 qatar ministry of development planning and statistics 2014 surface water temperature in qatar can be similar to air temperature kahramaa 2014 groundwater temperatures in qatar were reported between 28 and 30 c u k institute of hydrology 1982 vecchioli 1976 thus the batch sorption experiments were conducted at three temperatures of 5 25 and 35 c to mimic the field condition in qatar babikir 1990 1984 determined that the soil in qatar has high salinity and they reported that chloride concentration varies from 631 1 mg l 1 to 2056 3 mg l 1 in sand dunes and 39 175 6 mg l 1 to 47 294 3 mg l 1 in sabkha soils which both can be found in coastal areas of qatar baalousha 2016b sodium concentrations in soil collected all over qatar were reported between 240 mg kg 1 and 93 120 mg kg 1 shomar 2015 and in groundwater collected in coastal and inland areas of qatar were between 9 5 mg l 1 and 9560 mg l 1 kuiper et al 2015 based on these studies two types of salinities as chloride concentrations were used in batch sorption experiments one as natural salinity in the soil ranging between 700 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 salinity i and one as second salinity as high concentrations ranging between 3600 mg l 1 and 4000 mg l 1 salinity ii therefore sodium chloride nacl was used in batch sorption experiments with salinity ii only the temperature of 25 c was considered with salinity ii because this temperature is the closest to the range of groundwater temperatures in qatar regions mercury ii chloride hgcl2 with a concentration of 271 5 mg l 1 van de graaf et al 1995 was used as a biocide to inhibit microbial activity in the batch sorption experiments meta fluorotoluene c7h7f was used as an internal standard for the analysis of benzene and naphthalene by gas chromatography gc see below meta fluorotoluene was prepared in the organic solvent dichloromethane ch‚ÇÇcl‚ÇÇ and stored in a fridge until used for batch experiments dichloromethane was also used for the extraction of benzene and naphthalene from aqueous solutions prior to running the sorption rate experiments a preliminary assessment of the soil was performed to check if the soil samples were contaminated with benzene and naphthalene three soil samples were prepared like those of the leaching experiment and aqueous phases were analyzed by gc revealing that benzene and naphthalene were not present the initial concentration of benzene and naphthalene used in batch sorption experiments was 1 mg l 1 which is above the drinking water quality requirements of kahramaa 2014 table 1 fully dissolved benzene and naphthalene in millipore water were used in sorption experiments in order to achieve full dissolution of benzene and naphthalene they were quickly added to amber glass bottles already containing millipore water 271 5 mg l 1 of mercury ii chloride and a teflon coated magnetic stir bar after which the bottles were closed with tefon faced septa the headspace was minimized in each bottle to reduce loss by volatilization the solutions were stirred on a flat magnetic stirrer until full dissolution was expected which was within one to two weeks a micro extraction gas chromatographic technique was used to extract benzene and naphthalene from the prepared solutions for gc analysis in this extraction method two volumes of 19 ml each were sampled from each solution with a glass syringe and transferred to two 20 ml glass vials for the extraction 1 ml of previously prepared dichloromethane containing the internal standard meta fluorotoluene was immediately added in each of the 20 ml glass vials which were closed using open top caps with teflon faced septa the glass vials were then shaken on their side at 350 rpm on a lateral shaker for 20 min to allow benzene and naphthalene to mix with the organic solvent dichloromethane containing meta fluorotoluene following shaking the vials were inverted and left at rest for 20 to 30 min to allow the aqueous and organic phases to separate approximately 0 7 ml of the organic phase dichloromethane meta fluorotoluene and either benzene or naphthalene was removed from the inverted vials with a gas tight glass syringe through the teflon faced septa this organic phase was finally transferred to a teflon sealed auto sampler vial for injection into a gas chromatograph model agilent 7890a gc series minimum detection limit 0 005 mg l 1 equipped with a gc sampler 80 a 0 25 mm 30 m db5 capillary column with a film thickness of 0 25 Œºm and a flame ionization detector for measurement the chromatographic temperature conditions were as follows injection port temperature of 275 c initial column temperature of 35 c heating rate of 15 c per minute final temperature of 300 c and detector temperature of 325 c once the initial benzene and naphthalene solutions were prepared and the concentrations were confirmed the solutions were used for sorption rate and sorption isotherm experiments 2 4 1 sorption rate experiments sorption rate experiments were conducted to determine parameters which describe the kinetics of hydrocarbon sorption on the soil and the time needed to reach sorption equilibrium four types of sorption rate experiments were conducted at conditions with three temperatures 5 25 and 35 c and two salinities i and ii in sorption rate experiments for each benzene and naphthalene compound the soil samples were air dried homogenized and sieved to remove particles larger than 4 mm diameter and then the soil samples were filled in three sets of eight 60 ml glass bottles with a final mass of 35 0 02 g per bottle two other sets of eight empty bottles for controls were then disposed alongside the three sets containing the soil controls were used to check for potential losses through sorption on bottle glass surfaces and the caps the bottles of the five sets were then disposed in such a way that rows of triplicate bottles containing the soil and two empty bottles for controls would be used for one sampling time giving the possibility to have triplicates of eight concentration data points over time in other words rows of five bottles were sacrificed at each sampling time to get the concentration of the benzene and naphthalene compounds the initial solution was then dispensed in rows of five bottles three containing the soil and two empty for controls from the first up to the eighth row and the bottles were quickly capped with open top unlined aluminum seals with teflon faced septa the liquid to solid ratio was 1 28 0 01 ml g 1 two volumes of 19 ml of the initial solution were sampled before and after dispensing into the bottles to validate the initial concentration the bottles were loaded on a tumbling wheel and agitated at 10 rpm bottles in rows of five were successively removed from the wheel after 1 3 7 12 21 45 93 and 163 h and then they were left on the bench for 1 5 h to settle the particles before extraction the bottles were then opened in the same order for extraction of the supernatant after 2 5 10 15 24 48 96 and 168 h the latter time set was used in the analysis of the results since it was when the contact between the sampled solution and the soil stopped the same extraction procedure described for the initial solutions was used to extract the organic compounds from the aqueous supernatant from each 60 ml glass bottle and the concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were measured by gc aqueous samples were also collected from the 60 ml bottles containing the soils for ion chemistry analysis using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 in order to check the concentrations of chloride i e salinity 2 4 2 sorption isotherm experiments the results of sorption rate experiments provided the time at which sorption equilibrium was reached as the equilibrium time was the same for all types of sorption rate experiments the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted only at 25 c and salinity i both representing a more natural temperature and salinity condition in qatar field sites moreover the langmuir sorption isotherm obtained at 25 c and salinity i see section 3 3 is limited by a maximum sorption capacity and thus the sorption parameters would not change much at other conditions the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted similarly to the sorption rate experiments with the difference that six different concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were used the concentrations were 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 12 mg l 1 for naphthalene and 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 14 mg l 1 for benzene after dispensing all the solutions in the 60 ml bottles these bottles were loaded on a tumbling wheel and agitated at 10 rpm up to the time required to reach sorption equilibrium see section 3 2 the methods of extraction and analysis were the same as the sorption rate experiments described above 2 4 3 sorption rate and isotherm data analyses and parameters the sorption of benzene and naphthalene compounds on the soil was quantified from the aqueous concentrations measured in the sorption rate and isotherm experiments the sorbed concentration of compounds onto the soil s mg kg 1 was calculated using 4 s v c 0 c m where c 0 mg l 1 and c mg l 1 are the initial and final aqueous concentrations of the compounds respectively v l is the volume of the aqueous solution and m kg is the mass of the initial dry soil in the experiment bottles three linear freundlich and langmuir models at equilibrium were used to determine the sorption isotherms the models are expressed by the following equations 5 s k d c linear model 6 s k fr c n fr nonlinear freundlich model 7 s s max c k c nonlinear langmuir model where k d l kg 1 is the linear partitioning coefficient k fr mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 is the freundlich partitioning coefficient n fr is the freundlich exponent s max mg kg 1 is the monolayer maximum sorbed concentration and k mg l 1 is the half saturation concentration related to the energy of adsorption for each compound the above models were fitted to each of the three experimental data sets a fourth data set containing the calculated mean concentrations of the three experimental data sets was also fitted sorption rate parameters were determined using a two site sorption kinetic model which assumes two sorption sites on the soil one site in local equilibrium and one undergoing first order kinetic sorption this model was similar to the two site first order non equilibrium model by maraqa and khashan 2014 but in the current study the nonlinear sorption isotherms were considered to best fit the experimental data for a more detailed explanation of the model the reader is referred to maraqa and khashan 2014 and the supplementary material in short the model constituted of the following eqs 8 9 10 and 11 when using the freundlich isotherm and 8 12 13 and 14 when using the langmuir isotherm 8 s s 1 s 2 9 s 1 t t f eq k fr c n fr 10 s 2 t Œª 1 f eq k fr c n fr s 2 11 v mf eq k fr n fr c n fr 1 c t m s 2 t 0 12 s 1 t t f eq s max c k c 13 s 2 t Œª 1 f eq s max c k c s 2 14 v mf eq s max k k c 2 c t m s 2 t 0 where s 1 mg kg 1 is the sorbed concentration at the site with instantaneous equilibrium sorption s 2 mg kg 1 is the sorbed concentration at the site with kinetic sorption t s is the time f eq is the fraction of equilibrium sorption bounded by the values of 0 and 1 and Œª s 1 is the first order rate coefficient of kinetic sorption the mass of the soil and volume of the aqueous solution in the bottles of the batch sorption experiments were fairly constant and therefore the mean values of the mass m 35 g and volume v 44 9 ml were used in the two site sorption kinetic model the fittings of the sorption isotherm and rate data were performed using the melder mead simplex algorithm incorporated in the matlab function fminsearch lagarias et al 1998 when necessary the matlab function fminsearchbnd was used to set up boundary values for the fitting parameters d errico 2012 purchase 2007 the goodness of the fits was determined by computing and minimizing the root mean square error rmse between experimental and model data 3 results and discussions 3 1 soil characterization the water content of the initial soil sample was low as 2 18 which is realistic for the soil in semi arid environment with warm to hot temperature and low precipitation shomar 2015 shomar et al 2013 shomar et al 2014 the soil samples contained a mixture of sediments small seashells which were either intact or fragmented and characteristics of soils located along a seashore and some small plant residues fig 1a visually the fraction of sediments was more than the seashells and plant residues and most seashells were smaller than 1 cm diameter and there was a very small number of long screw shaped seashells with sizes of 1 5 cm in their elongated side after sieving it was observed that most of seashells in the soil samples were retained within the size of 2 to 4 mm and the seashells in the size fraction smaller than 2 mm were fragmented grain size distribution analysis showed that organic matter as plant residues were smaller than 4 mm in diameter but in a very small fraction in the samples the results of particle size distribution are shown in fig 1b and compared with the unified soil classification system uscs astm d2487 06 2006 the soil used in this study contained 6 of silt and clay 0 075 mm 45 of fine sand 0 075 to 0 425 mm 33 of medium sand 0 425 to 2 mm 11 of coarse sand 2 to 4 75 mm and 5 of fine gravel 4 75 to 19 05 mm fig 1b the dominant sediment is sand which represents 89 of the soil the fraction of coarse sand was mostly seashells indicating that most of the soil particles excluding seashells were smaller than 2 mm the soil particle size distribution was used to calculate the specific particle diameters equivalent to 10 30 50 and 60 passing d 10 d 30 d 50 and d 60 as 0 11 0 22 0 40 and 0 58 mm respectively the median diameter d 50 falls within the range of fine sand and the coefficients of uniformity cu d 60 d 10 and curvature cc d 30 2 d 10 d 60 astm d2487 06 2006 were calculated as 5 27 and 0 76 respectively based on these classifications the dominant sediment was sand and thus the soil texture was a fine to medium grained sand cu 6 and or 1 cc 3 similar to beach sand and sabkha soils which are common at the coast of qatar and surrounding countries alnuaim and el naggar 2014 baalousha 2016b babikir 1990 kamal and ibrahim 2015 kinsman and park 1969 kinsman 1969 the coastal sabkha soils in particular are formed from depositional off lap of marine sediments of subtidal intertidal and supratidal facies where the salt content is the key parameter to characterize that type of soils kinsman 1969 the soil particle size distribution was also used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity k m s 1 using the following empirical formula of breyer which can be applied for the soils with 1 cu 20 and 0 06 mm d 10 0 6 mm kresic 2006 vukoviƒá and soro 1992 15 k g ŒΩ 6 10 4 log 500 c u d 10 2 where g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ŒΩ m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water assuming the kinematic viscosity of water at 25 c equals to 0 899 10 6 m2 s 1 alam et al 2018 k was calculated as 1 6 10 4 m s 1 which is within the range of k in shallow aquifers in qatar 1 2 10 6 to 2 3 10 3 m s 1 baalousha 2016a the particle size distribution of the soil including seashells was also used to classify the soil using the system of the united state department of agriculture usda soil science division staff 2017 the analysis of the results led to the same conclusion as with the uscs and details are available in the supplementary material the particle density of the soil excluding seashells 2 mm was 2 72 0 02 kg l 1 and similar to that of calcite suggesting to assume that calcite is maybe the dominant mineral in the soil yigiterhan et al 2018 the result of the sem eds analysis of the sediment fraction of the soil samples excluding seashells 2 mm is shown in fig 1c the sem analysis indicates that most particles had a smooth and rounded surface which is indicative of their depositional environment characterized by series of seawater rise and retreat calcium had the highest concentration 15 91 wt suggesting that the calcium rich minerals are dominant in the soil which is common in the sediments of the arabian peninsula coastal areas ashour 2013 butler 1969 kinsman 1969 the concentration of silicon 6 19 wt in the soil indicates the presence of silica minerals ashour 2013 such as quartz and feldspars whereas bromine 2 41 wt and sodium 1 wt are indicative of solid salts precipitated or deposited on the soil the other chemical elements magnesium and iron were in the range of concentrations reported by other studies e g shomar 2015 total carbon was determined by chns as 10 01 0 28 dry including 9 19 0 18 dry inorganic and 0 84 0 47 dry organic carbon contents total nitrogen concentration was low as 0 07 0 00 dry whereas the sulfur was high as 2850 71 mg kg 1 which are common for the sediments of arabian peninsula coastal areas al naimi et al 2016 shomar 2015 the ph ec toc and tn from the leaching experiment at 25 c and salinity i were measured as 7 73 0 25 5730 396 Œºs cm 1 27 46 1 80 mg l 1 and 25 57 0 50 mg l 1 respectively the ph is slightly alkaline and the ec is very high as determined in previous studies on soil and groundwater in qatar babikir 1990 kuiper et al 2015 the alkaline ph was linked to the dissociation of calcite from calcareous sediments and rocks into bicarbonate and hydroxyl ions shomar 2015 whereas the ec indicates an influence by seawater the fairly high toc and tn are similar and could come from dissolved organic matter in the soil environment the toc is also similar to the maximum toc measured in groundwater in qatar kuiper et al 2015 the results of major soluble cations and anions analyses from the leaching experiment are shown in table 2 the concentrations of calcium ca magnesium mg manganese mn sodium na fluoride f chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were within the range of the concentrations measured in groundwater in qatar kuiper et al 2015 the concentrations of ca na cl and so4 2 were naturally very high indicating that the chemical properties of soils and groundwater in qatar are influenced by seawater intrusion where the main sources of ca and so4 2 are from the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals 3 2 sorption rates the time series observed changes of aqueous and sorbed concentrations of benzene normalized to the initial concentration c 0 under three different temperatures 5 25 and 35 c and two salinities salinity i and ii with 1006 39 mg l 1 and 3941 02 mg l 1 of chloride respectively are shown in fig 2 the concentrations of benzene decreased by a sorption rate of 14 12 12 and 17 within the first 5 to 10 h in the samples at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively indicating a weak sorption on the soil and reached an equilibrium state after 24 to 48 h fig 2 a and b the selected equilibrium time for the benzene sorption isotherm experiment was then 48 h with about 20 14 15 and 25 sorption at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 2 a and b the strongest benzene sorption was observed for the soil at 25 c and salinity ii this high sorption indicates that the sorption rate increased with increase of salinity as it was reported in other previous studies on the sorption of organic compounds to sorbents at various salinities and ionic strengths el nahhal and safi 2004 karapanagioti 2007 karickhoff et al 1979 means 1995 sun et al 2009 wang et al 2015 you et al 2010 the sorption rate of benzene at different temperature and same salinity i showed that the sorption increased when the temperature decreased as the highest rate was measured at 5 c and salinity i fig 2 a and b which is in agreement with previous studies on temperature dependent sorption of organic compounds piatt et al 1996 wang et al 2011 the latter observation is however not easily applicable between the conditions at 25 and 35 c because the ranges of normalized aqueous concentrations were similar the similarity could be attributed to the weak sorption capacity of benzene on the soil which would require significant variations of environmental conditions for higher change of the sorption capacity of benzene seawater intrusion and large temperature variations between the seasons and the days and nights in qatar provide favorable conditions for the effects on sorption rates observed in the current study to occur fig 3 shows the normalized aqueous and sorbed concentrations of naphthalene over time for different temperature and salinity conditions as considered for benzene the measured concentrations of chloride for the two salinity conditions at 25 c were 1007 40 mg l 1 and 3674 40 mg l 1 for salinities i and ii respectively the sorption rates of naphthalene were in general stronger and measured as 72 63 60 and 67 within the first 2 to 5 h for the conditions at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 3 a and b the concentrations of naphthalene decreased until 48 h and then reached equilibrium state the selected equilibrium time for the naphthalene sorption isotherm experiment was then 48 h with about 79 75 65 and 73 sorption at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 3 a and b the sorption rate of naphthalene increased with decrease of temperature and the strongest naphthalene sorption was observed for the soil at 5 c with an increase of 18 when compared to 35 c the change in salinity did not show any effect on the sorption rate of naphthalene many studies have shown that the sorption of neutral hydrophobic hydrocarbons increases with the organic carbon content of natural soils and sediments e g karickhoff et al 1979 toul et al 2003 the measured organic carbon content of the soil used in this study was low 0 47 dry and based on this parameter only the predicted sorption of benzene and naphthalene would have possibly been weaker than the measured one it is therefore suggested that the high magnitude of sorption may have also resulted from the salting out effect which leads to an increase of sorption with increasing salinity oh et al 2013 because the solutions contained high concentrations of ions including the common divalent seawater ions calcium magnesium and sulfate table 2 in summary the sorption rate of naphthalene was stronger than benzene at all different temperature and salinity conditions fig 4 this difference can be explained by their affinity to organic carbon which is higher for naphthalene than benzene as shown by their organic carbon water partitioning coefficient table 1 moreover naphthalene is more hydrophobic than benzene and would therefore have a higher sorption capacity than benzene fig 4b shows that the sorption of benzene was not the weakest at 35 c salinity i like for naphthalene in order to follow a complete increasing trend of sorption with decreasing temperature this difference at 35 c salinity i suggests that salinity dominated over the effect of temperature for benzene and this was likely favored by its lower affinity to organic carbon on the other hand the sorption of naphthalene at 25 c salinity ii was not the strongest like for benzene likely because the sorption capacity of naphthalene was strongly influenced by its affinity to organic carbon 3 3 sorption isotherms based on the results of equilibrium time observed in the sorption rate experiments 3 2 the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted for duration of 48 h to reach the sufficient equilibrium the results of sorption isotherms for benzene and naphthalene at 25 c and salinity i are shown in fig 5 the experimental data are fitted with the linear freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms and the model parameters are presented in table 3 the best model fit for benzene was obtained with the langmuir sorption isotherm whereas the best fit for naphthalene was achieved with both freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms fig 5 ball and roberts 1991 also found the freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms for sorption of tetrachloroethene on a low carbon sandy aquifer material from borden ontario canada the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient of naphthalene was calculated using the equation shown in karickhoff et al 1979 16 k oc fr k fr f oc where k oc fr mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 is the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient calculated using the freundlich partitioning coefficient toul et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 and f oc is the organic carbon content of the soil 0 0084 0 0047 using the minimum and maximum values of k fr in table 3 and the original values of f oc 0 00501 and 0 0117 the mean value of k oc fr is calculated as 425 mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 the calculated k oc fr value is smaller than the values reported for the sorption of naphthalene on low organic carbon soils k oc fr 900 mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 site 2001 zhang et al 2009 this lower value indicates that partitioning is the main sorption mechanism of naphthalene to the soil used in this study where a greater value of k oc fr would suggest that other processes contributed to the sorption the study by piatt et al 1996 showed that the lower sorption magnitude of naphthalene provides the possibility for another sorption mechanisms to take place concerning the results of the langmuir sorption isotherm table 3 the half saturation concentrations k are similar for benzene and naphthalene the higher maximum sorbed concentration s max for naphthalene can be attributed to its stronger sorption capacity although salinity i is the natural salinity of the soil it corresponds to a saline condition as opposed to a freshwater condition due to the high concentrations of calcium sodium sulfur chloride and sulfate in the soil table 2 the model parameters therefore incorporate the effect of salinity on sorption 3 4 numerical modeling of sorption kinetics and thermodynamics of sorption the parameters of the best fitted sorption isotherm models determined for the experiments conducted at 25 c and salinity i were used in the two site sorption kinetic model to fit the data from the sorption rate experiments at the same temperature and salinity conditions the best fits to the normalized aqueous and sorbed concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were achieved with the sorption kinetic model parameters obtained from the langmuir isotherm figs 2 and 3 the model parameters are presented in table 4 for different temperature and salinity conditions where the s max and k values are within the corresponding ranges bounded by the minimum and maximum values table 3 the fraction of equilibrium sorption values f eq were estimated to be 0 5 for both benzene and naphthalene revealing that instantaneous equilibrium sorption dominated over rate limited one the rate limited sorptive uptake was very slow as indicated by the very small values of the first order rate coefficient of kinetic sorption Œª which had the same magnitude for the two compounds the magnitude of Œª values is however similar to that of kinetic desorption rate constants determined in batch sorption experiments by piatt et al 1996 on a low organic carbon aquifer sediment medium grained sand f oc 0 00019 0 00008 for naphthalene 3 89 10 5 s 1 and 1 58 10 5 s 1 at 4 and 26 c respectively and phenanthrene 1 03 10 5 s 1 and 2 61 10 5 s 1 at 4 and 26 c respectively the number of sites available for sorption is limited by a maximum in the langmuir sorption isotherm since it is described by a monolayer this means that the s max and k values at equilibrium would theoretically not change much if the same sorbent and mass are used like in the experiments conducted in this study therefore the ranges of s max 2 39 3 89 mg kg 1 for benzene and 30 23 59 42 mg kg 1 for naphthalene and k 7 12 15 04 mg l 1 for benzene and 8 93 20 90 mg l 1 for naphthalene in table 3 determined for the conditions at 25 c and salinity i were kept the same to fit the experimental data of the other environmental conditions the modeling results are also shown in figs 2 and 3 and table 4 and they clearly show that the models well described the sorption kinetics of benzene and naphthalene sorption remained dominated by the sites with instantaneous equilibrium sorption as shown by the values of f eq 0 5 the magnitude of Œª values remained similar for the different environmental conditions investigated and thus the overall magnitude of the mass transfer time scale of benzene and naphthalene between phases inverse of Œª was about 104 s an inverse correlation between the temperature and the sorption of benzene and naphthalene s max were found table 4 and consequently the values of k decrease with temperature the parameters of sorption thermodynamics such as the standard gibbs free energy Œ¥g kj mol 1 the standard enthalpy of sorption Œ¥h kj mol 1 and the standard entropy of sorption Œ¥s kj mol 1 k 1 could be calculated for neutral sorbates using the results of numerical modeling and the following equations liu 2009 17 Œ¥ g Œø rt ln k l 18 ln k l Œ¥ h Œø rt Œ¥ s Œø r where r is the gas constant equal to 8 314 10 3 kj mol 1 k 1 t k is the absolute temperature and k l l mol 1 is the langmuir equilibrium constant of adsorption equal to the inverse of the half saturation constant k the plot of ln k l against 1 t provides a straight line allowing to calculate Œ¥h and Œ¥s the best linear correlation between ln k l and 1 t was found only for naphthalene compound ln k l 1226 t 4 87 r2 0 98 where the Œ¥h and Œ¥s values were derived as the correlation between ln k l and 1 t was not linear for benzene compound because of similar k l values or k values at 5 and 25 c the following integrated van t hoff equation was used for benzene to calculate only Œ¥h 19 Œ¥ h Œø ln k l 5 Œø c k l 35 Œø c 1 t 35 Œø c 1 t 5 Œø c r where the Œ¥h is assumed to be constant over the considered temperature range the sorption thermodynamics parameters are shown in table 5 all Œ¥g values had the same magnitude and were negative suggesting that the sorption of benzene and naphthalene to the soil was spontaneous all Œ¥h values were comparable to the values reported by other studies for the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds such as chlorinated benzenes naphthalene and acenaphthene to natural soils and within a temperature range of about 3 to 48 c piatt et al 1996 ten hulscher and cornelissen 1996 wang et al 2011 the negative Œ¥h values suggest that the sorption of benzene and naphthalene is an exothermic process and the more negative enthalpy of naphthalene could be explained by its molecular size relative to benzene since larger size organic compounds were found to exhibit more negative enthalpy than smaller ones piatt et al 1996 wang et al 2011 the negative enthalpy suggests that van der waals forces played a significant role in the sorption of the two compounds to the soil especially for naphthalene wang et al 2011 the very small Œ¥s value of naphthalene suggests that its sorption to the soil was not controlled by the entropy 4 conclusions findings of this study showed that the soil from the eastern coast of qatar can be classified as a low organic carbon sabkha soil and saline beach sandy soil the characterization of the soil revealed that its dominant mineral could be calcite the concentrations of dissolved chloride and sodium were higher than 400 mg l 1 and comparable to those measured in groundwater in qatar coastal regions the latter highlights that the chemical properties of soils and groundwater in qatar are influenced by seawater intrusions the sorption rate of phcs used in this study benzene and naphthalene showed that the sorption of naphthalene was stronger than benzene as the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient of naphthalene is higher than benzene the sorption of benzene increased when the temperature decreased and the salinity increased whereas the sorption of naphthalene increased with decrease of temperature only the langmuir sorption isotherm model well described the sorption of benzene and naphthalene on the soil for both sorption isotherms and kinetics the two site sorption kinetic modeling revealed that sites with instantaneous equilibrium sorption dominated over those with rate limited sorption overall this study showed that extreme environmental factors in coastal qatar regions can affect the sorption capacity of the phcs on the soil although contamination by phcs in the coastal soil may persist after a decrease or increase of temperature and salinity the variations of these environmental factors may help remediation processes to some extent sorption could indeed retain the phcs in the subsurface after an oil spill allowing the contaminated soil to be excavated before the phcs reach groundwater this process applies more for naphthalene at low temperature conditions at the contaminated sites for environmental site assessment one should consider the change in natural conditions such as alternating temperature and salinity as well as climate change which play an important role in the sorption of hydrocarbons the properties of benzene and naphthalene span the range of properties of compounds like toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes which could then be expected to have sorption behaviors in

1626,considerable activities from the oil and natural gas sector have risen some concerns about the pollution of soil and groundwater by petroleum hydrocarbons phcs in semi arid coastal regions the understanding of the fate and transport of phcs in these regions is therefore necessary to develop strategies for remediation to quantify the sorption rates of phcs in semi arid coastal soil environments we conducted a series of controlled laboratory batch experiments under variable temperature and salinity conditions the soil samples were collected from the eastern coast of qatar which is near the two largest off shore oil and natural gas fields of the country north gas and al shaheen oil fields and the volatile benzene and naphthalene were used as phcs the characterization of soil samples showed sand classification with the texture class of sabkha and saline beach sandy soils with calcite as potential dominant mineral the concentrations of dissolved chloride and sodium were found to be high 400 mg l 1 with a chloride to sodium ratio of about 1 7 the results of sorption experiments showed that the rates of naphthalene sorption were more than for benzene where the initial aqueous concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were reduced at equilibrium due to sorption by about 14 25 and 65 79 respectively this difference was attributed mainly to the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient which is higher for naphthalene the sorption rate experiments showed that sorption was stronger for benzene under higher salinity and lower temperature conditions the sorption of naphthalene was not affected by the change in salinity but increased by 18 when the temperature decreased from 35 to 5 c a sorption kinetic model was also applied to define the sorption behavior of benzene and naphthalene for the coastal soil collected in qatar and the best fits were achieved with the langmuir sorption isotherm keywords hydrocarbons arid soil temperature salinity sorption 1 introduction a common source of contamination of soil and groundwater in arid and semi arid coastal regions are accidental spills of petroleum products such as crude oil gasoline and diesel fuel usually referred to as dense or light non aqueous phase liquids dnapl or lnapl soil and groundwater pollution by petroleum hydrocarbons phcs is a serious environmental problem which poses hazards to water resources and living organisms including humans kponee et al 2015 poole et al 1993 rengarajan et al 2015 when released to the subsurface phcs move downwards through the aerobic vadose zone eventually they reach the groundwater table where oil overlay promotes the development of anaerobic conditions salminen et al 2004 vroblesky et al 1996 the geochemical conditions above the water table including the oxygen availability moisture content nutrient concentrations ph salinity and temperature are important determinants of physical and biogeochemical processes sims et al 1993 the fate transport and multiphase flow of phcs depend on biogeochemical processes and on the processes of volatilization biodegradation dissolution transport and sorption which vary by environmental factors including oxygen supply soil moisture ph temperature salinity nutrients and redox potential they are controlled by the organic carbon content of soils or aquifer materials dissolution into groundwater and biodegradation in the unsaturated and saturated zones among these soil and environmental factors the effects of temperature and salinity seem most crucial for the feasibility of remediation of polluted groundwater in semi arid and arid coastal regions piatt et al 1996 used batch and column experiments to study the sorption of naphthalene phenanthrene and pyrene to low organic carbon aquifer sediments at 4 and 26 c and they found that equilibrium partitioning coefficients increased with a decrease in temperature whereas desorption rates decreased with temperature wang et al 2011 conducted batch studies to determine the effects of temperature on the sorption of five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to river and estuary sediments under thermal gradients from 5 to 35 c and their results showed that stronger sorption occurred at lower temperatures means 1995 conducted batch sorption experiments to examine the influence of salinity on the partitioning of pyrene between natural sediments and water and they found that equilibrium partitioning coefficients increased with salinity tremblay et al 2005 used estuarine particles as sorbents to study the effects of temperature and salinity on the sorption of phenanthrene and fluoranthene in batch experiments and they found that a decrease in water temperature and an increase in salinity together increased the sorption to the particles the fate and transport of phcs at the coastal area of qatar a peninsular arab country may not be similar to other studies because of the combination of high saline seawater intrusion groundwater table fluctuations induced by groundwater and seawater interactions and qatar s harsh and fragile environment high temperature low rainfall strong winds and low nutrient availability in the soil alsharhan et al 2001 the understanding of the influence of the above factors is important due to the proximity of the large off shore oil and natural gas fields of the country and the challenges that qatar is facing with freshwater availability to the best of our knowledge there is no existing studies or data related to the sorption of phcs to qatari soils or aquifer materials especially from the coastal areas previous environmental studies in qatar regions have focused primarily on the characterization of phcs contaminated media potential methods of treatment for decontamination and biodegradation e g al kaabi 2016 al disi et al 2017 rushdi et al 2017 the main goal of this study was to extensively characterize soils from the eastern coast of qatar and conduct multiple series of batch experiments under variable temperatures and salinities to determine the sorption properties of two selected phcs with the specific objectives to determine the sorption isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics of the phcs for qatar semi arid coastal regions this study provides the first knowledge about the sorption of phcs on qatari coastal soils as a function of temperature and salinity moreover this study includes modeling of sorption kinetics which can be used to predict the fate and transport of phcs in these soils with possible implications of the findings to contribute in meeting the remediation targets in contaminated soil environment and as such will enhance qatar s capacity to sustain healthy soil ecosystems and the multiple ecosystem services that they provide the findings of the present study could also be useful for other coastal areas with similar climate and salinity conditions such as in iran and the other countries of the arabian peninsula including saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain kuwait oman and yemen 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and soil sampling the soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 to 75 cm below the ground surface on the eastern side of a small town called sumaysimah which lies on the eastern coast of qatar 25 34 26 61 n 51 29 18 77 e the selected field site provides a condition where seawater and groundwater interact salinity and nutrient concentrations are high and large temperature fluctuations are the norm baalousha 2016b qatar meteorology department 2018 shomar 2015 the site is also near the two largest off shore oil and natural gas fields of qatar north gas field and al shaheen oil field in an event of environmental contamination by these two oil and natural gas fields the soil and groundwater in sumaysimah regions and the population may be exposed to phcs the site therefore provides an ideal setting to study the fate of phcs under extreme environmental conditions e g variable salinity and temperature the soil samples were air dried and transported to the university of waterloo in canada for characterizations and laboratory experiments 2 2 soil characterizations the water content of the soil was determined gravimetrically after drying approximately 300 g of soil at 105 c for 48 h the grain size distribution of the soil was determined by sieve analysis prior to sieving 491 g of the soil was dried in an oven at 105 c and for 24 h the dry soil was then dry sieved using a series of sieves with mesh sizes of 0 063 0 125 0 25 0 5 0 6 1 2 4 and 13 5 mm the mesh sizes were selected in a way to cover the size range of soil particles including seashells and to have data points as close as possible to sediment size limits of standard soil classification systems the particle density of the soil was determined on samples with size smaller than 2 mm to make sure that the measured density is representative of the sediments in the soil 100 g of the sediment fraction of the soil samples was first dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h and three dried samples of 25 g each were used for particle density measurement the particle density was determined gravimetrically similarly to the pycnometer method using millipore water and by gentle boiling on a hot plate with frequent swirling to release air from the water saturated soil the chemical solid phase characterization of the sediment fractions of the samples was performed using a scanning electron microscope sem hitachi tm 3000 coupled with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer bruker quantax 70 eds total carbon organic and inorganic nitrogen and sulfur concentrations were measured on a chns carbo erba analyzer method detection limit 0 1 dry all sem and chns analyses were conducted in duplicates and the precision was 5 relative standard deviation according to certified reference materials a leaching experiment was conducted to measure the soluble salt content ph electrical conductivity ec total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and precipitated or deposited chemicals from the soil samples a purpose of this experiment was to measure the natural physico chemical parameters of the soil samples which could not be measured during the sorption experiments due to the addition of a biocide see 2 4 the leaching experiment consisted of mixing the air dried soil samples 4 mm particle size with millipore water liquid to solid ratio of 1 28 0 01 ml g 1 into two 60 ml glass bottles duplicates with open top unlined aluminum seals and teflon faced septa the bottles were agitated for 24 h on a tumbling wheel at a speed of 10 rounds per minute rpm and during the process of leaching the aqueous phase became very turbid indicating good dissolution of soluble salts in millipore water at the end of the agitation the bottles were left on bench for three hours to settle the particles before aqueous extraction the non turbid aqueous phase was extracted from the bottles and the samples were analyzed for ph and ec using a thermo scientific orion 2 star bench top ph meter thermo scientific orion versastar and for toc and tn using shimadzu toc lcph cpn

select representative phcs for qatar reviews on common naphthas used in qatar oil industries were conducted the aromatic compounds were given more attention in most reports and studies likely because they are easily found in the products of oil companies and giving a high probability to end up in the soil and groundwater environment as contaminants benzene c6h6 and naphthalene c10h8 were selected for the batch experiments in this study in qatar benzene is used for example in a designed production of 100 000 million tons per annum of linear alkyl benzene at the petrochemical company seef qatar petroleum 2014 based on an assay report of al shaheen crude oil naphthalene was estimated at 2 4 volume of the fraction of the crude extracted within 150 200 c caleb brett 2006 a percentage which when multiplied by the volume of crude extracted can give a significant volume of naphthalene in this study the high purity benzene 99 9 catalogue number 270709 and naphthalene 99 crystal form catalogue number 184500 from sigma aldrich canada were used benzene is more soluble than naphthalene in water table 1 and in a mixture of these two compounds the average density at 25 c would be 0 98 kg l 1 and thus the mixture could behave like a lnapl temperature and salinity are two factors affecting the solubility of benzene and naphthalene the following relationships were used to calculate the solubility as a function of temperature for benzene eq 1 and naphthalene eq 2 may et al 1978 1 s w benzene a 0 0247 t 3 0 6838 t 2 0 3166 t 1833 10 3 2 s w naphthalene a 0 0189 t 2 0 2499 t 13 66 10 3 where s w a is the water solubility Œºg l 1 at a known temperature t c the following empirical relationship which was derived by setschenow 1889 was used to calculate the solubility of benzene and naphthalene as a function of salinity 3 log s w b k s c s log s w where s w b Œºg l 1 and s w Œºg l 1 are the solubilities of a solute in salt and fresh water at a known temperature respectively k s l mol 1 is the setschenow constant and c s mol l 1 is the salt concentration examples of solubility of benzene and naphthalene in fresh and saline water are shown in table 1 2 4 batch sorption experiments the effects of temperature and salinity on the sorption of benzene and naphthalene on the soil were determined in multiple batch sorption experiments historical climate data in qatar show that the air temperature can vary between 10 c in january and 40 c in july ali et al 2016 lloyd et al 1987 qatar meteorology department 2018 qatar ministry of development planning and statistics 2014 surface water temperature in qatar can be similar to air temperature kahramaa 2014 groundwater temperatures in qatar were reported between 28 and 30 c u k institute of hydrology 1982 vecchioli 1976 thus the batch sorption experiments were conducted at three temperatures of 5 25 and 35 c to mimic the field condition in qatar babikir 1990 1984 determined that the soil in qatar has high salinity and they reported that chloride concentration varies from 631 1 mg l 1 to 2056 3 mg l 1 in sand dunes and 39 175 6 mg l 1 to 47 294 3 mg l 1 in sabkha soils which both can be found in coastal areas of qatar baalousha 2016b sodium concentrations in soil collected all over qatar were reported between 240 mg kg 1 and 93 120 mg kg 1 shomar 2015 and in groundwater collected in coastal and inland areas of qatar were between 9 5 mg l 1 and 9560 mg l 1 kuiper et al 2015 based on these studies two types of salinities as chloride concentrations were used in batch sorption experiments one as natural salinity in the soil ranging between 700 mg l 1 and 1000 mg l 1 salinity i and one as second salinity as high concentrations ranging between 3600 mg l 1 and 4000 mg l 1 salinity ii therefore sodium chloride nacl was used in batch sorption experiments with salinity ii only the temperature of 25 c was considered with salinity ii because this temperature is the closest to the range of groundwater temperatures in qatar regions mercury ii chloride hgcl2 with a concentration of 271 5 mg l 1 van de graaf et al 1995 was used as a biocide to inhibit microbial activity in the batch sorption experiments meta fluorotoluene c7h7f was used as an internal standard for the analysis of benzene and naphthalene by gas chromatography gc see below meta fluorotoluene was prepared in the organic solvent dichloromethane ch‚ÇÇcl‚ÇÇ and stored in a fridge until used for batch experiments dichloromethane was also used for the extraction of benzene and naphthalene from aqueous solutions prior to running the sorption rate experiments a preliminary assessment of the soil was performed to check if the soil samples were contaminated with benzene and naphthalene three soil samples were prepared like those of the leaching experiment and aqueous phases were analyzed by gc revealing that benzene and naphthalene were not present the initial concentration of benzene and naphthalene used in batch sorption experiments was 1 mg l 1 which is above the drinking water quality requirements of kahramaa 2014 table 1 fully dissolved benzene and naphthalene in millipore water were used in sorption experiments in order to achieve full dissolution of benzene and naphthalene they were quickly added to amber glass bottles already containing millipore water 271 5 mg l 1 of mercury ii chloride and a teflon coated magnetic stir bar after which the bottles were closed with tefon faced septa the headspace was minimized in each bottle to reduce loss by volatilization the solutions were stirred on a flat magnetic stirrer until full dissolution was expected which was within one to two weeks a micro extraction gas chromatographic technique was used to extract benzene and naphthalene from the prepared solutions for gc analysis in this extraction method two volumes of 19 ml each were sampled from each solution with a glass syringe and transferred to two 20 ml glass vials for the extraction 1 ml of previously prepared dichloromethane containing the internal standard meta fluorotoluene was immediately added in each of the 20 ml glass vials which were closed using open top caps with teflon faced septa the glass vials were then shaken on their side at 350 rpm on a lateral shaker for 20 min to allow benzene and naphthalene to mix with the organic solvent dichloromethane containing meta fluorotoluene following shaking the vials were inverted and left at rest for 20 to 30 min to allow the aqueous and organic phases to separate approximately 0 7 ml of the organic phase dichloromethane meta fluorotoluene and either benzene or naphthalene was removed from the inverted vials with a gas tight glass syringe through the teflon faced septa this organic phase was finally transferred to a teflon sealed auto sampler vial for injection into a gas chromatograph model agilent 7890a gc series minimum detection limit 0 005 mg l 1 equipped with a gc sampler 80 a 0 25 mm 30 m db5 capillary column with a film thickness of 0 25 Œºm and a flame ionization detector for measurement the chromatographic temperature conditions were as follows injection port temperature of 275 c initial column temperature of 35 c heating rate of 15 c per minute final temperature of 300 c and detector temperature of 325 c once the initial benzene and naphthalene solutions were prepared and the concentrations were confirmed the solutions were used for sorption rate and sorption isotherm experiments 2 4 1 sorption rate experiments sorption rate experiments were conducted to determine parameters which describe the kinetics of hydrocarbon sorption on the soil and the time needed to reach sorption equilibrium four types of sorption rate experiments were conducted at conditions with three temperatures 5 25 and 35 c and two salinities i and ii in sorption rate experiments for each benzene and naphthalene compound the soil samples were air dried homogenized and sieved to remove particles larger than 4 mm diameter and then the soil samples were filled in three sets of eight 60 ml glass bottles with a final mass of 35 0 02 g per bottle two other sets of eight empty bottles for controls were then disposed alongside the three sets containing the soil controls were used to check for potential losses through sorption on bottle glass surfaces and the caps the bottles of the five sets were then disposed in such a way that rows of triplicate bottles containing the soil and two empty bottles for controls would be used for one sampling time giving the possibility to have triplicates of eight concentration data points over time in other words rows of five bottles were sacrificed at each sampling time to get the concentration of the benzene and naphthalene compounds the initial solution was then dispensed in rows of five bottles three containing the soil and two empty for controls from the first up to the eighth row and the bottles were quickly capped with open top unlined aluminum seals with teflon faced septa the liquid to solid ratio was 1 28 0 01 ml g 1 two volumes of 19 ml of the initial solution were sampled before and after dispensing into the bottles to validate the initial concentration the bottles were loaded on a tumbling wheel and agitated at 10 rpm bottles in rows of five were successively removed from the wheel after 1 3 7 12 21 45 93 and 163 h and then they were left on the bench for 1 5 h to settle the particles before extraction the bottles were then opened in the same order for extraction of the supernatant after 2 5 10 15 24 48 96 and 168 h the latter time set was used in the analysis of the results since it was when the contact between the sampled solution and the soil stopped the same extraction procedure described for the initial solutions was used to extract the organic compounds from the aqueous supernatant from each 60 ml glass bottle and the concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were measured by gc aqueous samples were also collected from the 60 ml bottles containing the soils for ion chemistry analysis using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 5000 in order to check the concentrations of chloride i e salinity 2 4 2 sorption isotherm experiments the results of sorption rate experiments provided the time at which sorption equilibrium was reached as the equilibrium time was the same for all types of sorption rate experiments the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted only at 25 c and salinity i both representing a more natural temperature and salinity condition in qatar field sites moreover the langmuir sorption isotherm obtained at 25 c and salinity i see section 3 3 is limited by a maximum sorption capacity and thus the sorption parameters would not change much at other conditions the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted similarly to the sorption rate experiments with the difference that six different concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were used the concentrations were 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 12 mg l 1 for naphthalene and 0 5 1 3 6 9 and 14 mg l 1 for benzene after dispensing all the solutions in the 60 ml bottles these bottles were loaded on a tumbling wheel and agitated at 10 rpm up to the time required to reach sorption equilibrium see section 3 2 the methods of extraction and analysis were the same as the sorption rate experiments described above 2 4 3 sorption rate and isotherm data analyses and parameters the sorption of benzene and naphthalene compounds on the soil was quantified from the aqueous concentrations measured in the sorption rate and isotherm experiments the sorbed concentration of compounds onto the soil s mg kg 1 was calculated using 4 s v c 0 c m where c 0 mg l 1 and c mg l 1 are the initial and final aqueous concentrations of the compounds respectively v l is the volume of the aqueous solution and m kg is the mass of the initial dry soil in the experiment bottles three linear freundlich and langmuir models at equilibrium were used to determine the sorption isotherms the models are expressed by the following equations 5 s k d c linear model 6 s k fr c n fr nonlinear freundlich model 7 s s max c k c nonlinear langmuir model where k d l kg 1 is the linear partitioning coefficient k fr mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 is the freundlich partitioning coefficient n fr is the freundlich exponent s max mg kg 1 is the monolayer maximum sorbed concentration and k mg l 1 is the half saturation concentration related to the energy of adsorption for each compound the above models were fitted to each of the three experimental data sets a fourth data set containing the calculated mean concentrations of the three experimental data sets was also fitted sorption rate parameters were determined using a two site sorption kinetic model which assumes two sorption sites on the soil one site in local equilibrium and one undergoing first order kinetic sorption this model was similar to the two site first order non equilibrium model by maraqa and khashan 2014 but in the current study the nonlinear sorption isotherms were considered to best fit the experimental data for a more detailed explanation of the model the reader is referred to maraqa and khashan 2014 and the supplementary material in short the model constituted of the following eqs 8 9 10 and 11 when using the freundlich isotherm and 8 12 13 and 14 when using the langmuir isotherm 8 s s 1 s 2 9 s 1 t t f eq k fr c n fr 10 s 2 t Œª 1 f eq k fr c n fr s 2 11 v mf eq k fr n fr c n fr 1 c t m s 2 t 0 12 s 1 t t f eq s max c k c 13 s 2 t Œª 1 f eq s max c k c s 2 14 v mf eq s max k k c 2 c t m s 2 t 0 where s 1 mg kg 1 is the sorbed concentration at the site with instantaneous equilibrium sorption s 2 mg kg 1 is the sorbed concentration at the site with kinetic sorption t s is the time f eq is the fraction of equilibrium sorption bounded by the values of 0 and 1 and Œª s 1 is the first order rate coefficient of kinetic sorption the mass of the soil and volume of the aqueous solution in the bottles of the batch sorption experiments were fairly constant and therefore the mean values of the mass m 35 g and volume v 44 9 ml were used in the two site sorption kinetic model the fittings of the sorption isotherm and rate data were performed using the melder mead simplex algorithm incorporated in the matlab function fminsearch lagarias et al 1998 when necessary the matlab function fminsearchbnd was used to set up boundary values for the fitting parameters d errico 2012 purchase 2007 the goodness of the fits was determined by computing and minimizing the root mean square error rmse between experimental and model data 3 results and discussions 3 1 soil characterization the water content of the initial soil sample was low as 2 18 which is realistic for the soil in semi arid environment with warm to hot temperature and low precipitation shomar 2015 shomar et al 2013 shomar et al 2014 the soil samples contained a mixture of sediments small seashells which were either intact or fragmented and characteristics of soils located along a seashore and some small plant residues fig 1a visually the fraction of sediments was more than the seashells and plant residues and most seashells were smaller than 1 cm diameter and there was a very small number of long screw shaped seashells with sizes of 1 5 cm in their elongated side after sieving it was observed that most of seashells in the soil samples were retained within the size of 2 to 4 mm and the seashells in the size fraction smaller than 2 mm were fragmented grain size distribution analysis showed that organic matter as plant residues were smaller than 4 mm in diameter but in a very small fraction in the samples the results of particle size distribution are shown in fig 1b and compared with the unified soil classification system uscs astm d2487 06 2006 the soil used in this study contained 6 of silt and clay 0 075 mm 45 of fine sand 0 075 to 0 425 mm 33 of medium sand 0 425 to 2 mm 11 of coarse sand 2 to 4 75 mm and 5 of fine gravel 4 75 to 19 05 mm fig 1b the dominant sediment is sand which represents 89 of the soil the fraction of coarse sand was mostly seashells indicating that most of the soil particles excluding seashells were smaller than 2 mm the soil particle size distribution was used to calculate the specific particle diameters equivalent to 10 30 50 and 60 passing d 10 d 30 d 50 and d 60 as 0 11 0 22 0 40 and 0 58 mm respectively the median diameter d 50 falls within the range of fine sand and the coefficients of uniformity cu d 60 d 10 and curvature cc d 30 2 d 10 d 60 astm d2487 06 2006 were calculated as 5 27 and 0 76 respectively based on these classifications the dominant sediment was sand and thus the soil texture was a fine to medium grained sand cu 6 and or 1 cc 3 similar to beach sand and sabkha soils which are common at the coast of qatar and surrounding countries alnuaim and el naggar 2014 baalousha 2016b babikir 1990 kamal and ibrahim 2015 kinsman and park 1969 kinsman 1969 the coastal sabkha soils in particular are formed from depositional off lap of marine sediments of subtidal intertidal and supratidal facies where the salt content is the key parameter to characterize that type of soils kinsman 1969 the soil particle size distribution was also used to calculate the hydraulic conductivity k m s 1 using the following empirical formula of breyer which can be applied for the soils with 1 cu 20 and 0 06 mm d 10 0 6 mm kresic 2006 vukoviƒá and soro 1992 15 k g ŒΩ 6 10 4 log 500 c u d 10 2 where g 9 81 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration and ŒΩ m2 s 1 is the kinematic viscosity of water assuming the kinematic viscosity of water at 25 c equals to 0 899 10 6 m2 s 1 alam et al 2018 k was calculated as 1 6 10 4 m s 1 which is within the range of k in shallow aquifers in qatar 1 2 10 6 to 2 3 10 3 m s 1 baalousha 2016a the particle size distribution of the soil including seashells was also used to classify the soil using the system of the united state department of agriculture usda soil science division staff 2017 the analysis of the results led to the same conclusion as with the uscs and details are available in the supplementary material the particle density of the soil excluding seashells 2 mm was 2 72 0 02 kg l 1 and similar to that of calcite suggesting to assume that calcite is maybe the dominant mineral in the soil yigiterhan et al 2018 the result of the sem eds analysis of the sediment fraction of the soil samples excluding seashells 2 mm is shown in fig 1c the sem analysis indicates that most particles had a smooth and rounded surface which is indicative of their depositional environment characterized by series of seawater rise and retreat calcium had the highest concentration 15 91 wt suggesting that the calcium rich minerals are dominant in the soil which is common in the sediments of the arabian peninsula coastal areas ashour 2013 butler 1969 kinsman 1969 the concentration of silicon 6 19 wt in the soil indicates the presence of silica minerals ashour 2013 such as quartz and feldspars whereas bromine 2 41 wt and sodium 1 wt are indicative of solid salts precipitated or deposited on the soil the other chemical elements magnesium and iron were in the range of concentrations reported by other studies e g shomar 2015 total carbon was determined by chns as 10 01 0 28 dry including 9 19 0 18 dry inorganic and 0 84 0 47 dry organic carbon contents total nitrogen concentration was low as 0 07 0 00 dry whereas the sulfur was high as 2850 71 mg kg 1 which are common for the sediments of arabian peninsula coastal areas al naimi et al 2016 shomar 2015 the ph ec toc and tn from the leaching experiment at 25 c and salinity i were measured as 7 73 0 25 5730 396 Œºs cm 1 27 46 1 80 mg l 1 and 25 57 0 50 mg l 1 respectively the ph is slightly alkaline and the ec is very high as determined in previous studies on soil and groundwater in qatar babikir 1990 kuiper et al 2015 the alkaline ph was linked to the dissociation of calcite from calcareous sediments and rocks into bicarbonate and hydroxyl ions shomar 2015 whereas the ec indicates an influence by seawater the fairly high toc and tn are similar and could come from dissolved organic matter in the soil environment the toc is also similar to the maximum toc measured in groundwater in qatar kuiper et al 2015 the results of major soluble cations and anions analyses from the leaching experiment are shown in table 2 the concentrations of calcium ca magnesium mg manganese mn sodium na fluoride f chloride cl sulfate so4 2 and nitrate no3 were within the range of the concentrations measured in groundwater in qatar kuiper et al 2015 the concentrations of ca na cl and so4 2 were naturally very high indicating that the chemical properties of soils and groundwater in qatar are influenced by seawater intrusion where the main sources of ca and so4 2 are from the dissolution of carbonate and sulfate minerals 3 2 sorption rates the time series observed changes of aqueous and sorbed concentrations of benzene normalized to the initial concentration c 0 under three different temperatures 5 25 and 35 c and two salinities salinity i and ii with 1006 39 mg l 1 and 3941 02 mg l 1 of chloride respectively are shown in fig 2 the concentrations of benzene decreased by a sorption rate of 14 12 12 and 17 within the first 5 to 10 h in the samples at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively indicating a weak sorption on the soil and reached an equilibrium state after 24 to 48 h fig 2 a and b the selected equilibrium time for the benzene sorption isotherm experiment was then 48 h with about 20 14 15 and 25 sorption at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 2 a and b the strongest benzene sorption was observed for the soil at 25 c and salinity ii this high sorption indicates that the sorption rate increased with increase of salinity as it was reported in other previous studies on the sorption of organic compounds to sorbents at various salinities and ionic strengths el nahhal and safi 2004 karapanagioti 2007 karickhoff et al 1979 means 1995 sun et al 2009 wang et al 2015 you et al 2010 the sorption rate of benzene at different temperature and same salinity i showed that the sorption increased when the temperature decreased as the highest rate was measured at 5 c and salinity i fig 2 a and b which is in agreement with previous studies on temperature dependent sorption of organic compounds piatt et al 1996 wang et al 2011 the latter observation is however not easily applicable between the conditions at 25 and 35 c because the ranges of normalized aqueous concentrations were similar the similarity could be attributed to the weak sorption capacity of benzene on the soil which would require significant variations of environmental conditions for higher change of the sorption capacity of benzene seawater intrusion and large temperature variations between the seasons and the days and nights in qatar provide favorable conditions for the effects on sorption rates observed in the current study to occur fig 3 shows the normalized aqueous and sorbed concentrations of naphthalene over time for different temperature and salinity conditions as considered for benzene the measured concentrations of chloride for the two salinity conditions at 25 c were 1007 40 mg l 1 and 3674 40 mg l 1 for salinities i and ii respectively the sorption rates of naphthalene were in general stronger and measured as 72 63 60 and 67 within the first 2 to 5 h for the conditions at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 3 a and b the concentrations of naphthalene decreased until 48 h and then reached equilibrium state the selected equilibrium time for the naphthalene sorption isotherm experiment was then 48 h with about 79 75 65 and 73 sorption at 5 c salinity i 25 c salinity i 35 c salinity i and 25 c salinity ii respectively fig 3 a and b the sorption rate of naphthalene increased with decrease of temperature and the strongest naphthalene sorption was observed for the soil at 5 c with an increase of 18 when compared to 35 c the change in salinity did not show any effect on the sorption rate of naphthalene many studies have shown that the sorption of neutral hydrophobic hydrocarbons increases with the organic carbon content of natural soils and sediments e g karickhoff et al 1979 toul et al 2003 the measured organic carbon content of the soil used in this study was low 0 47 dry and based on this parameter only the predicted sorption of benzene and naphthalene would have possibly been weaker than the measured one it is therefore suggested that the high magnitude of sorption may have also resulted from the salting out effect which leads to an increase of sorption with increasing salinity oh et al 2013 because the solutions contained high concentrations of ions including the common divalent seawater ions calcium magnesium and sulfate table 2 in summary the sorption rate of naphthalene was stronger than benzene at all different temperature and salinity conditions fig 4 this difference can be explained by their affinity to organic carbon which is higher for naphthalene than benzene as shown by their organic carbon water partitioning coefficient table 1 moreover naphthalene is more hydrophobic than benzene and would therefore have a higher sorption capacity than benzene fig 4b shows that the sorption of benzene was not the weakest at 35 c salinity i like for naphthalene in order to follow a complete increasing trend of sorption with decreasing temperature this difference at 35 c salinity i suggests that salinity dominated over the effect of temperature for benzene and this was likely favored by its lower affinity to organic carbon on the other hand the sorption of naphthalene at 25 c salinity ii was not the strongest like for benzene likely because the sorption capacity of naphthalene was strongly influenced by its affinity to organic carbon 3 3 sorption isotherms based on the results of equilibrium time observed in the sorption rate experiments 3 2 the sorption isotherm experiments were conducted for duration of 48 h to reach the sufficient equilibrium the results of sorption isotherms for benzene and naphthalene at 25 c and salinity i are shown in fig 5 the experimental data are fitted with the linear freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms and the model parameters are presented in table 3 the best model fit for benzene was obtained with the langmuir sorption isotherm whereas the best fit for naphthalene was achieved with both freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms fig 5 ball and roberts 1991 also found the freundlich and langmuir sorption isotherms for sorption of tetrachloroethene on a low carbon sandy aquifer material from borden ontario canada the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient of naphthalene was calculated using the equation shown in karickhoff et al 1979 16 k oc fr k fr f oc where k oc fr mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 is the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient calculated using the freundlich partitioning coefficient toul et al 2003 zhang et al 2009 and f oc is the organic carbon content of the soil 0 0084 0 0047 using the minimum and maximum values of k fr in table 3 and the original values of f oc 0 00501 and 0 0117 the mean value of k oc fr is calculated as 425 mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 the calculated k oc fr value is smaller than the values reported for the sorption of naphthalene on low organic carbon soils k oc fr 900 mg1 nfr lnfr kg 1 site 2001 zhang et al 2009 this lower value indicates that partitioning is the main sorption mechanism of naphthalene to the soil used in this study where a greater value of k oc fr would suggest that other processes contributed to the sorption the study by piatt et al 1996 showed that the lower sorption magnitude of naphthalene provides the possibility for another sorption mechanisms to take place concerning the results of the langmuir sorption isotherm table 3 the half saturation concentrations k are similar for benzene and naphthalene the higher maximum sorbed concentration s max for naphthalene can be attributed to its stronger sorption capacity although salinity i is the natural salinity of the soil it corresponds to a saline condition as opposed to a freshwater condition due to the high concentrations of calcium sodium sulfur chloride and sulfate in the soil table 2 the model parameters therefore incorporate the effect of salinity on sorption 3 4 numerical modeling of sorption kinetics and thermodynamics of sorption the parameters of the best fitted sorption isotherm models determined for the experiments conducted at 25 c and salinity i were used in the two site sorption kinetic model to fit the data from the sorption rate experiments at the same temperature and salinity conditions the best fits to the normalized aqueous and sorbed concentrations of benzene and naphthalene were achieved with the sorption kinetic model parameters obtained from the langmuir isotherm figs 2 and 3 the model parameters are presented in table 4 for different temperature and salinity conditions where the s max and k values are within the corresponding ranges bounded by the minimum and maximum values table 3 the fraction of equilibrium sorption values f eq were estimated to be 0 5 for both benzene and naphthalene revealing that instantaneous equilibrium sorption dominated over rate limited one the rate limited sorptive uptake was very slow as indicated by the very small values of the first order rate coefficient of kinetic sorption Œª which had the same magnitude for the two compounds the magnitude of Œª values is however similar to that of kinetic desorption rate constants determined in batch sorption experiments by piatt et al 1996 on a low organic carbon aquifer sediment medium grained sand f oc 0 00019 0 00008 for naphthalene 3 89 10 5 s 1 and 1 58 10 5 s 1 at 4 and 26 c respectively and phenanthrene 1 03 10 5 s 1 and 2 61 10 5 s 1 at 4 and 26 c respectively the number of sites available for sorption is limited by a maximum in the langmuir sorption isotherm since it is described by a monolayer this means that the s max and k values at equilibrium would theoretically not change much if the same sorbent and mass are used like in the experiments conducted in this study therefore the ranges of s max 2 39 3 89 mg kg 1 for benzene and 30 23 59 42 mg kg 1 for naphthalene and k 7 12 15 04 mg l 1 for benzene and 8 93 20 90 mg l 1 for naphthalene in table 3 determined for the conditions at 25 c and salinity i were kept the same to fit the experimental data of the other environmental conditions the modeling results are also shown in figs 2 and 3 and table 4 and they clearly show that the models well described the sorption kinetics of benzene and naphthalene sorption remained dominated by the sites with instantaneous equilibrium sorption as shown by the values of f eq 0 5 the magnitude of Œª values remained similar for the different environmental conditions investigated and thus the overall magnitude of the mass transfer time scale of benzene and naphthalene between phases inverse of Œª was about 104 s an inverse correlation between the temperature and the sorption of benzene and naphthalene s max were found table 4 and consequently the values of k decrease with temperature the parameters of sorption thermodynamics such as the standard gibbs free energy Œ¥g kj mol 1 the standard enthalpy of sorption Œ¥h kj mol 1 and the standard entropy of sorption Œ¥s kj mol 1 k 1 could be calculated for neutral sorbates using the results of numerical modeling and the following equations liu 2009 17 Œ¥ g Œø rt ln k l 18 ln k l Œ¥ h Œø rt Œ¥ s Œø r where r is the gas constant equal to 8 314 10 3 kj mol 1 k 1 t k is the absolute temperature and k l l mol 1 is the langmuir equilibrium constant of adsorption equal to the inverse of the half saturation constant k the plot of ln k l against 1 t provides a straight line allowing to calculate Œ¥h and Œ¥s the best linear correlation between ln k l and 1 t was found only for naphthalene compound ln k l 1226 t 4 87 r2 0 98 where the Œ¥h and Œ¥s values were derived as the correlation between ln k l and 1 t was not linear for benzene compound because of similar k l values or k values at 5 and 25 c the following integrated van t hoff equation was used for benzene to calculate only Œ¥h 19 Œ¥ h Œø ln k l 5 Œø c k l 35 Œø c 1 t 35 Œø c 1 t 5 Œø c r where the Œ¥h is assumed to be constant over the considered temperature range the sorption thermodynamics parameters are shown in table 5 all Œ¥g values had the same magnitude and were negative suggesting that the sorption of benzene and naphthalene to the soil was spontaneous all Œ¥h values were comparable to the values reported by other studies for the sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds such as chlorinated benzenes naphthalene and acenaphthene to natural soils and within a temperature range of about 3 to 48 c piatt et al 1996 ten hulscher and cornelissen 1996 wang et al 2011 the negative Œ¥h values suggest that the sorption of benzene and naphthalene is an exothermic process and the more negative enthalpy of naphthalene could be explained by its molecular size relative to benzene since larger size organic compounds were found to exhibit more negative enthalpy than smaller ones piatt et al 1996 wang et al 2011 the negative enthalpy suggests that van der waals forces played a significant role in the sorption of the two compounds to the soil especially for naphthalene wang et al 2011 the very small Œ¥s value of naphthalene suggests that its sorption to the soil was not controlled by the entropy 4 conclusions findings of this study showed that the soil from the eastern coast of qatar can be classified as a low organic carbon sabkha soil and saline beach sandy soil the characterization of the soil revealed that its dominant mineral could be calcite the concentrations of dissolved chloride and sodium were higher than 400 mg l 1 and comparable to those measured in groundwater in qatar coastal regions the latter highlights that the chemical properties of soils and groundwater in qatar are influenced by seawater intrusions the sorption rate of phcs used in this study benzene and naphthalene showed that the sorption of naphthalene was stronger than benzene as the organic carbon water partitioning coefficient of naphthalene is higher than benzene the sorption of benzene increased when the temperature decreased and the salinity increased whereas the sorption of naphthalene increased with decrease of temperature only the langmuir sorption isotherm model well described the sorption of benzene and naphthalene on the soil for both sorption isotherms and kinetics the two site sorption kinetic modeling revealed that sites with instantaneous equilibrium sorption dominated over those with rate limited sorption overall this study showed that extreme environmental factors in coastal qatar regions can affect the sorption capacity of the phcs on the soil although contamination by phcs in the coastal soil may persist after a decrease or increase of temperature and salinity the variations of these environmental factors may help remediation processes to some extent sorption could indeed retain the phcs in the subsurface after an oil spill allowing the contaminated soil to be excavated before the phcs reach groundwater this process applies more for naphthalene at low temperature conditions at the contaminated sites for environmental site assessment one should consider the change in natural conditions such as alternating temperature and salinity as well as climate change which play an important role in the sorption of hydrocarbons the properties of benzene and naphthalene span the range of properties of compounds like toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes which could then be expected to have sorption behaviors in

1627,limited knowledge and experimental data exist on pesticide leaching through partially frozen soil the objective of this study was to better understand the complex processes of freezing and thawing and the effects these processes have on water flow and pesticide transport through soil to achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non reactive tracer and the herbicide mcpa in partially frozen soil in total 40 intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types silt and loam in south east norway were used in this experiment mcpa and bromide were applied on top of all columns half the columns were then frozen at 3 c while the other half of the columns were stored at 4 c columns were then subjected to repeated irrigation events at a rate of 5 mm artificial rainwater for 5 h at each event each irrigation was followed by 14 day periods of freezing or refrigeration percolate was collected and analysed for mcpa and bromide the results show that nearly 100 more mcpa leached from frozen than unfrozen topsoil columns of hov silt and kroer loam soils leaching patterns of bromide and mcpa were very similar in frozen columns with high concentrations and clear peaks early in the irrigation process and with lower concentrations leaching at later stages hardly any mcpa leached from unfrozen topsoil columns 0 4 0 5 of applied amount and concentrations were very low bromide showed a different flow pattern indicating a more uniform advective dispersive transport process in the unfrozen columns with higher concentrations leaching but without clear concentration peaks this study documents that pesticides can be preferentially transported through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil these findings indicate that monitoring programs should include sampling during snow melt or early spring in areas were soil frost is common as this period could imply exposure peaks in groundwater or surface water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords freeze thaw effects preferential flow macropores solute transport mcpa 1 introduction in cold climates increased pesticide concentrations are often detected in soil leachate drain discharge surface runoff and surface water bodies during freeze thaw periods in late winter and early spring eklo et al 1994 french 1999 riise et al 2004 riise et al 2006 siimes et al 2006 ul√©n et al 2013 with climate change this may become an increasingly relevant issue for example in the nordic countries climate models predict higher temperatures and more snowmelt episodes during winter and an increase in the frequency of freeze thaw cycles of up to 38 hanssen bauer et al 2015 mellander et al 2007 lundberg et al 2016 however the effects of freezing and thawing on the fate and behaviour of pesticides in soil are complex and still not well understood so the mechanisms underlying these field observations are unclear soil freezing and thawing potentially influences the pathways of water flow and solute transport through soils as well as chemical and biological processes affecting pesticide fate in the soil hayashi 2013 ireson et al 2013 the importance of macropores as non equilibrium or preferential flow paths for rapid water flow and solute transport has long since been recognized jarvis et al 2016 beven and germann 1982 the occurrence of macropore flow can result in dramatic increases in the leaching of pesticides to groundwater and to surface water via sub surface drainage pipes jarvis 2007 flury 1996 macropores can be defined as pores with diameters of 0 3 0 5 mm and larger jarvis et al 2017 jarvis 2007 these large pores have a smaller relative surface area than smaller pores and in cases where macropores dominate flow processes solutes in flowing water can bypass bulk soil and any potential binding sites luxmoore et al 1990 examples of macropores are biopores made by earthworms and plant roots and planar fissures formed by freezing thawing or drying wetting any water present in such large pores will freeze first as the temperature continue to decrease water in successively smaller pores will freeze ireson et al 2013 however large macropores will often be air filled when the soil freezes and can therefore function as effective pathways for preferential flow on thawing or if rain falls on frozen ground van der kamp et al 2003 with subsequent freeze thaw cycles they can become blocked with ice which reduces the hydraulic conductivity ireson et al 2013 models currently used in risk assessment and management do not account for the effects of freezing and thawing on pesticide leaching models should be tested against experimental data hence the need to perform controlled laboratory studies or field studies to generate the data required to support the development of such a model to date only relatively few studies have investigated experimentally the significance of freezing and thawing for preferential transport of solutes through soil stadler et al 2000 gentry et al 2000 barnes and wolfe 2008 wang et al 2016 hafsteinsd√≥ttir et al 2013 wei et al 2015 these referred studies focused mainly on the transport of tracers nitrogen petroleum or heavy metals in a laboratory study stenr√∏d et al 2008 reported higher mobility of metribuzin and transport to greater depths in frozen soil compared to unfrozen soil but this study did not focus on preferential flow per se and the results were not statistically significant to our knowledge no other studies of this type have been carried out specifically for pesticides the objective of the present study was therefore to increase understanding of the effects of freezing and thawing on water flow and pesticide transport through soil to achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non reactive tracer and the herbicide mcpa in partially frozen soil we hypothesize that columns subjected to freezing will show a higher degree of preferential transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and characterization intact soil columns were sampled in may 2016 from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types table 1 in south east norway kroer 59 38 37 n 10 49 58 e hov 60 12 45 n 12 1 58 e the kroer loam have been characterized earlier by greve et al 1998 so no additional characterization was performed in this study soil characterization of the hov silt had also been carried out earlier by the division of survey and statistics at nibio this characterization was done according to the world reference base for soil resources wrb iuss working group wrb 2014 additional information on the chemical characterization of the soils are summarized in fig a1 in appendix c the water content of the sampled soils was neither t measured in the columns at sampling nor in the laboratory before the experiment started this was to avoid disturbing the intact soil columns sampling was done in aluminium cylinders i d 9 2 cm height 20 cm fifty six columns were sampled 14 from both the topsoil 0 20 cm

were under winter wheat information about the use of pesticides on the sampled fields was obtained from the farmers and indicated no use of the herbicide mcpa during the last 2 3 years prior to sampling the soil columns were first scanned at the department of soil and environment at the swedish university of agricultural sciences using a high resolution industrial x ray ct scanner ge phoenix

stored at about 4 c in 20 l plastic containers 2 3 experimental set up twenty of the sampled soil columns from each of the sites kroer and hov in total 40 columns was included in the experiment the rest of the sampled columns were excluded due to their bad condition e g high content of straw in the bottom soil was too loose and crumbled out of the columns or due to big gaps between soil and cylinder walls the top of the soil columns was levelled to 2 cm below the rim of the top of the aluminium cylinders to ensure sufficient room for ponding during irrigation the columns were also carefully levelled at the bottom to achieve equal initial conditions the columns were then placed in a box of water with zero pressure potential at the bottom of the soil for a week to bring the samples close to saturation the columns were then placed on a sand box eijkelkamp where a pressure potential of 30 cm was applied at the bottom of the soil columns for a week to establish an identical initial condition for all columns one that also ensured that all continuous macropores would be air filled five columns were randomly chosen from each soil type and depth for the freezing treatment the remaining five columns were stored unfrozen analysis of variance anova tests performed using all pairwise multiple comparison procedures student newman keuls method in sigmaplot sigmaplot for windows version 13 0 systat software inc showed no significant differences for either of the soils or depths in any of the measured pore network characteristics between the columns that underwent the freezing treatment and the unfrozen columns all columns were then placed on fine meshed metal sieves filled with glass beads to allow for free drainage thermistors were installed in the columns that were subjected to freezing to monitor the temperature during the experiment these thermistors were installed horizontally into the center of the columns through holes in the cylinders at 7 and 14 cm depth from the soil surface the thermistors were then connected to a temperature data logger delta t burwell cambridge u k accuracy 0 5 c temperature was logged every 10 min throughout the experiment the columns were placed on a 5 cm thick polystyrene insulation board and the column walls were covered with two layers of 2 cm thick polyethylene insulation to ensure freezing from the top and downwards five ml of both the mcpa and potassium bromide kbr solutions were applied at the surface of each column as evenly as possible by hand using a 5 ml pipette finnpipette giving rates of 2 1 kg

considered low enough to ensure that all water in mesopores and macropores would be frozen the top of the columns were sealed with a plastic lid and incubated at these temperatures for about four weeks they were then subjected to repeated irrigation events with the prepared artificial rainwater followed by 14 day periods of freezing or refrigeration for the control columns between irrigations the experiment lasted for a total of 8 weeks for the silt soil 3 irrigations and 10 weeks for the loam 4 irrigations the frozen columns and the unfrozen columns were transported to the irrigation room in the morning of each irrigation event the irrigation room was at a temperature of about 5 8 c at the start of the irrigations but this increased to a maximum of ca 12 c during the day the artificial rain water was at a temperature of about 2 4 c at the start of each irrigation but this increased to a maximum of about 6 c at the end of the irrigations the columns were placed on top of funnels with collector flasks beneath this setup allowed free drainage at the base of the soil columns irrigation water was distributed to the columns using peristaltic pumps autoclude model vl adjusted to give a rate of 5 mm hr 1 for 5 h resulting in a total of about 25 mm of rainwater to each column per irrigation event water was transferred through pvc tubes vwr 4 6 mm and dripped onto filter paper whatman grade 1 85 mm ge healthcare life sciences placed on the surface of the columns to ensure uniform distribution the actual irrigation rates varied slightly between columns but there were no systematic differences between treatments soils or depths preliminary tests indicated that on average the columns received 5 to 9 less water than the nominal rate rough calculations suggest that the total amount of irrigation water supplied to the columns during the experiment would be equivalent to ca one pore volume percolate from the soil columns during and after each irrigation was sampled in 150 ml polycarbonate bottles corning vwr and sub samples for chemical analysis were collected manually at approximately every 25 ml until about 24 h after the start of each irrigation event from each sub sample 3 ml was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube corning vwr and stored cold 4 c for later analysis of bromide the remaining volume of leachate for each sample was stored frozen 20 c in amber 60 ml glass bottles for later pesticide analysis results of water and pesticides are reported as total amounts volumes transported through the soil columns during the irrigation events as of the applied amounts and as measured concentrations the term 5 arrival time is frequently used as an indicator of the degree of preferential flow koestel et al 2011 it is usually defined as the normalized time at which 5 of the applied amount of a solute has passed through a soil column small values indicate a high degree of preferential transport larsbo et al 2016 in our case as the outflows are not the same for all columns even if the boundary condition is the same a non steady state flow experiment we used the 5 arrival volume for bromide to assess whether there were any differences in the strength of preferential flow between the frozen and unfrozen columns the first 5 of the tracer mass in this instance is based on the initial applied bromide mass 2 4 chemical analysis bromide analysis was carried out using a thermo bromide ion selective electrode thermo fisher scientific orion 9635bnwp coupled to an ion meter mettler toledo seven compact ph ion meter s220 that was placed directly in the 3 ml leachate samples after addition of ionic strength adjuster isa thermo fisher scientific the concentrations of mcpa and the metabolite 2 mcp in the leachate samples were measured using lc ms ms waters alliance 2695 lc system coupled to a quattro ultima pt triple quadropole mass spectrometer from micromass manchester uk leachates were filtrated with a syringe filter ptfe 0 2 Œºm filter 13 mm diameter vwr into vials leachates from the unfrozen soil columns were analysed directly whereas the samples from the frozen columns were diluted 1 9 in water before analysis due to high mcpa concentrations 50 Œºl 2 4 d dr ehrensdorfer gmbh purity 99 was added as an internal standard to all samples at a final level of 10 ng ml to adjust for any variability during analysis a 5 Œºl sample volume was injected and the analytes separated on a phenomenex gemini c18 column 100 2 mm particle diameter 3 Œºm using 5 mm formic acid and methanol as mobile phases the analytes were detected in the negative electrospray mode with transitions m z 199 141 and m z 200 142 for mcpa and the pseudo transition m z 141 141 for 2 mcp the mcpa metabolite 2 mcp was not detected in any of the samples concentrations were measured using a 5 point internal standard calibration range from 0 5 500 ng mcpa ml the limits of quantification were 0 125 ng mcpa ml and 5 ng 2 mcp ml after removing water for mcpa analysis the remaining leachate was combined to make one bulk sample per column and irrigation as 2 mcp was not detected by the method used to analyse for mcpa selected bulk samples were concentrated and analysed for the metabolite 2 mcp 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of the differences in macropore characteristics water bromide and mcpa transport were carried out with an analysis of variance anova type iii test and a post hoc pairwise tukey test tukey s honest significant difference method in r commander r core team 2016 the mean total amounts of water bromide and mcpa leached were used as response variables and soil type and treatment frozen or unfrozen as predictor variables factors statistically significant results are reported at the 5 significance level unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 image analysis and soil characteristics the characteristics of the imaged macropore networks are summarized in table 2 as was also demonstrated by jarvis et al 2017 the results showed that the connectivity of the macropore networks depends strongly on imaged macroporosity with a threshold value for continuity percolation of ca 4 fig 1 in general the topsoils had larger imaged porosities than the subsoils while the loam soil at kroer was found to have a larger imaged porosity and better connected macropore network than the silt soil at hov fig 1 in particular the subsoil at hov appeared to have no connected macroporosity 3 2 temperatures temperatures in the initially frozen soil columns increased quickly towards 0 c after the start of the irrigations but then stabilized before starting to increase again fig 2 it generally took several hours before the temperatures continued to increase above 0 c and this lag phase was longer at each irrigation at the third irrigation of the silt soil temperatures did not increase much above 0 c until 27 30 h after the start of the irrigation another observation made was that loam subsoil started thawing before the loam topsoil measurements from all thermistors at both depths 7 and 14 cm were included in the figure but no clear difference between the two depths could be observed and the two thermistor depths have not been indicated in the figure the data logger stopped working under the third irrigation of the kroer loam soil columns so no temperature curve could be obtained from this irrigation event it took some time before the first irrigation of the kroer loam started hence the temperatures in the columns had risen to near 0 c at the beginning of the irrigation 3 3 infiltration and drainage anova for percolated volumes of water show that significantly larger amounts of percolation were collected from the unfrozen loam soil columns than from the frozen columns p 001 and significantly more from frozen topsoil columns than from frozen subsoil columns p 05 no significant differences were observed between the unfrozen topsoil and subsoil columns similar observations were made for the silt soil table 3 due to the different number of irrigations the two soils received a direct statistical comparison of the two soil types was not performed nevertheless some differences worth mentioning were observed for example ponding was observed on frozen columns already during the first irrigation and to a greater extent for the silt than for the loam soil in the silt soil ponding was even observed on unfrozen subsoil columns in general the extent of ponding increased in both soils for the later irrigations in the silt swelling or frost heave of the soil was also observed in addition to freezing of the irrigation water along the edges at the top of the soil columns especially during the later irrigations another observation made for both soil types was that when the frozen soil columns started to thaw during the irrigation the ponded water infiltrated quickly and percolated through the columns after thawing 25 ml samples were collected at ca 6 7 min intervals equivalent to flow rates of ca 35 mm h 1 this sudden infiltration was observed more often in the loam than in the silt in contrast the interval between each sampling in unfrozen soil was typically ca 30 min equivalent to a flow rate of ca 7 mm h 1 figs 3 and 4 show the accumulated amount of water that percolated from frozen and unfrozen kroer loam and hov silt soil columns plotted against time these figures show the constant outflow rate during irrigations of the unfrozen columns almost equal to the inflow rate and the rapid cessation when the irrigations stopped this was very clear for both the loam topsoil and subsoil as well as the silt topsoil whereas this difference was smaller for the unfrozen silt subsoil in the frozen columns the outflow started later especially for the later irrigations and many of the frozen columns continued to percolate slowly a long time after irrigation ceased during the second irrigation of the kroer loam some of the early samples from the frozen subsoil were lost due to leakages through the thermistor holes the holes were re sealed before the next irrigation this was not believed to influence the overall results 3 4 bromide leaching following the pattern observed for the percolation of water significantly p 001 more bromide leached from the unfrozen loam columns than from the frozen loam columns in both topsoil and subsoil table 3 on average significantly more bromide leached from the unfrozen loam subsoil than the unfrozen loam topsoil p 05 in the case of the silt soil there were no statistically significant differences between the amounts of bromide leached from frozen and unfrozen topsoil columns p 05 for subsoil on the other hand the results were similar to what was observed for the loam the leaching patterns of bromide are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 for typical columns from each soil and treatment combination it was difficult to pick representative columns but the purpose was to illustrate that for these soils and treatments preferential flow occurred although manifested slightly differently for different columns figs 5 show evidence of strong preferential flow through the frozen topsoils of the loam columns with the highest bromide concentrations found in the first sample of the second irrigation results from the other loam topsoil columns showed the same pattern albeit with some variations in the timing of the peak bromide concentrations fig a1 in appendix a the evidence of strong preferential flow was weaker for the frozen silt topsoil columns fig 6 though clearer for two of the columns fig a3 in appendix a where an early breakthrough of relatively high concentrations of bromide was observed in the first collected samples this pattern was not equally clear for the frozen silt subsoil fig 6 and fig a3 in appendix a contrary to the frozen soils the leaching patterns were quite different in the unfrozen soils with smoother breakthrough curves without distinct early concentration peaks especially evident in the loam soil fig 5 data for the other columns show the same pattern see appendix a the calculated 5 arrival volumes support the results shown above with smaller values found for the frozen soils than unfrozen soils table 3 however statistically significant differences between frozen and unfrozen columns were only found for the silt topsoil p 001 furthermore a statistically significant difference was found between unfrozen silt and loam columns for both topsoil and subsoil p 01 which confirms that preferential flow was generally stronger in the loam soil 3 5 mcpa leaching in contrast to water and bromide significantly more mcpa leached from frozen topsoil and subsoil loam columns than from the unfrozen soils p 001 table 3 similar results were found for the silt topsoil where the mean amount of mcpa leached from frozen columns was significantly larger p 01 than from the unfrozen columns for the unfrozen silt soil mcpa leaching was significantly larger p 05 from the subsoil than from the topsoil table 3 in the frozen loam columns the shapes of the breakthrough curves for mcpa were strikingly similar to those of bromide with peak concentrations of mcpa of ca 2 to 3 mg l 1 measured in leachate by the end of the first irrigation fig 5 mcpa concentrations also peaked early in the unfrozen loam columns peaks hidden because of the scale of the plots but the concentrations were much smaller and significantly less mcpa leached from unfrozen columns during the experiment fig 5 table 3 mcpa breakthrough curves for all loam columns are collected in appendix a fig a2 similar to the loam soil most of the frozen silt topsoil columns showed early concentration peaks for mcpa although the measured concentrations in the percolate were much smaller and the pattern was less clear than for the loam fig 6 fig a4 in appendix a mcpa concentrations in leachate from the unfrozen silt topsoil columns were much smaller than for the frozen columns fig 6 and hardly any mcpa leached from these columns table 3 leaching losses of mcpa were similar for frozen and unfrozen silt subsoil table 3 the breakthrough curves of the frozen silt subsoil columns peaked at different irrigations fig a 4 in appendix a but four of the unfrozen silt subsoil columns showed a pattern closer to the one observed for bromide leaching i e smoother breakthrough curves without clear concentration peaks one of the unfrozen silt subsoil columns differed from the others though by showing an early concentration peak fig 6 mcpa breakthrough curves for all silt columns are collected in appendix a fig a4 a general observation made for many of the columns was the smaller concentrations of mcpa and bromide in the first sample after the start of a new irrigation this applied especially to bromide fig 5 but was also observed for mcpa fig 6 the metabolite 2 mcp was detected in some of the bulk samples from both frozen and unfrozen soil columns both from loam and silt soils in leachate from frozen kroer loam topsoil columns 2 mcp was only detected in the samples from the last irrigation at concentrations of about 0 3 Œºg l 1 the metabolite was not detected in leachate from unfrozen loam topsoil or frozen loam subsoil in unfrozen loam subsoil the metabolite was found in all samples from three columns at concentrations between 0 04 and 0 49 Œºg l 1 mean 0 16 Œºg l 1 the maximum amounts detected of the metabolite was in unfrozen kroer loam subsoil and equalled to about 0 02 of the applied amount of mcpa the metabolite was not detected in leachate samples from the hov silt soil 4 discussion 4 1 freeze thaw effects on water flow and tracer transport the observed differences in leaching patterns for bromide between frozen and unfrozen columns suggest that preferential flow through continuous macropores occurred largely in the frozen soils the calculated lower 5 arrival volumes for frozen columns also support this conclusion table 3 contrary to this the bromide breakthrough curves from the unfrozen columns indicate a slower and more uniform advective dispersive transport process through the whole soil matrix the bromide breakthrough curves follow the same pattern in many of the frozen columns figs 5 6 and appendix a with large concentrations peaking after relatively small amounts of water had percolated through the columns followed by tailing to smaller concentrations this applied to both loam and silt soils although the silt did not show the same clear preferential flow pattern as the loam especially in the subsoil presumably because it was limited by the lack of continuity of the macropore network fig 1 and jarvis et al 2016 however even for the silt soil the 5 arrival volumes indicated stronger preferential flow for frozen soils than unfrozen soils table 3 the differences observed in 5 arrival volume were only statistically significant in topsoil although the breakthrough curves indicated the same tendency for both soils smaller concentrations of bromide were detected in the first percolate samples after the onset of a new irrigation than in the final samples of the previous irrigation this could be partly explained by the fact that as soil water freezes solutes may become concentrated in the unfrozen water in the smaller pores and as temperatures increase again solutes may only slowly diffuse back into the mobile water in larger pores st√§hli and stadler 1997 ireson et al 2013 thus when the soil thaws again the first water draining from the macropores may be relatively clean larsson et al 1999 in general the transport patterns indicating preferential flow through macropores occurred during the earliest irrigations when the macropores presumably were still air filled later when more water had been applied the larger pores also became blocked by ice resulting in reduced hydraulic conductivity and slower thawing ireson et al 2013 moghadas et al 2016 the ponding observed on top of many columns at the initial stages of the later irrigations supports this assumption for the frozen loam soil ponding was first observed during the second irrigation but some of the silt columns exhibited ponding already during the first irrigation hence water content is important for how fast the thawing process occurs in addition to the ponding this was observed as the frozen columns both started to thaw fig 2 and drain figs 2 3 later at later irrigations in this experiment these observations were more evident for the silt than the loam this could be explained by less pore space being available for infiltration of water and that infiltration was so slow that the increased exposure to ice caused its freezing on the way down moghadas et al 2016 this could also be the reason why it took so long for the water to infiltrate the silt subsoil during and after the last irrigation fig 4 when the frozen soil columns started to thaw during the irrigations the ponded water infiltrated quickly and percolated through the columns after thawing 25 ml samples were collected at ca 6 7 min intervals equivalent to flow rates of ca 35 mm h 1 being a lot faster than the fastest flow rates observed for unfrozen columns ca 7 mm h 1 this fast infiltration was not observed for silt subsoil being in line with the estimations of relatively high 5 arrival volume values table 3 indicating a little degree of preferential flow and the smaller content of connected macropores in this soil fig 1 in addition to the different leaching patterns observed for bromide between the two treatments significantly less amounts of bromide leached from frozen columns compared to unfrozen columns table 3 brown et al 2000 discussed that preferential flow rapidly can transport small amounts of bromide to depth but that over a longer leaching period preferential flow will give smaller total losses of bromide than matrix flow this is because preferential flow interacts with only a small part of the soil and associated solute in our case the difference observed in bromide leaching could also be due to the fact that significantly less water was collected from the frozen soil columns than the unfrozen columns as the frozen columns thawed one would not expect any difference in the total amount of water percolating there were indications that the frozen columns had not finished draining after the cessation of irrigation as a loss of water from the columns was observed while moving them before transportation between the freezing facilities and the lysimeter laboratory furthermore ice was observed under the frozen columns in the freezing cabinet continued sampling beyond 24 h after the start of irrigation would have been desirable to sample more water from the frozen columns but due to time constraints this was not possible 4 2 freeze thaw effects on mcpa leaching brown et al 2000 argues that preferential flow seems to be the most important process for pesticide transport and that residues can be transported rapidly to deeper soil layers while slower leaching via matrix flow not will result in larger losses over time because degradation or sorption might reduce the amounts that could leach in this study very little mcpa leached through the unfrozen loam and silt topsoil columns and it is possible that this could be due to faster degradation in these columns which were maintained at higher temperatures 4 c compared with 3 c the amount of mcpa retained in the soil was not measured so the extent of degradation and thus a complete mass balance cannot be determined with certainty however the metabolite 2 mcp was detected in low amounts in some bulk leachate samples both from frozen kroer loam topsoil and unfrozen kroer loam subsoil implying that some degradation did occur during the experiment this could be due to aerobic soil degradation or more probable due to aqueous photolysis during sampling and sample preparation since 2 mcp is a major aqueous photolysis metabolite it is highly unlikely though that differences in degradation rates between frozen and unfrozen columns could explain the large differences observed in the leached amounts of mcpa the markedly larger leaching losses of mcpa from frozen topsoil columns was therefore most probably a result of much weaker sorption during transport sorption has been shown to be a temperature dependent process and for most compounds sorption decreases with increasing temperature ten hulscher and cornelissen 1996 shariff and shareef 2011 it could then be hypothesized that sorption would be stronger at lower temperatures stenr√∏d et al 2008 on the other hand found smaller kd values and increased pore water concentrations for metribuzin upon release of frost in packed columns stored at 5 c indicating that this might not always be the case nevertheless the effect of freezing on the water flow pathways is probably the most important reason for the differences observed in our experiment due to the fast transport through macropores the time for adsorption of mcpa would be limited in the frozen soil columns where flow would have been mostly restricted to the larger pores that were either initially air filled or which drained quickly on thawing in addition compared to smaller pores macropores have a small ratio of surface area to pore volume reducing the number of available binding sites for passing solutes jarvis 2007 in contrast in the unfrozen soil with a slower and more uniform flow pattern mcpa although a relatively mobile substance would be exposed to more soil surfaces and binding sites resulting in a higher degree of sorption and less mcpa being transported through the columns freezing of soil can lead to frost heave formation of ice lenses and subsequent cracking of the soil and hence an increased hydraulic conductivity hotineanu et al 2015 in our case this could have explained some of the differences observed between frozen and unfrozen columns with regards to mcpa leaching however less water percolated through the frozen soil columns and less bromide leached so this was probably not a major factor the fact that the results were quite consistent across all columns supports this conclusion the similarity between the replicatet columns and consistent differences between the treatments also indicates that bypass of water along the side column walls was a minor problem compared with the unfrozen topsoil columns considerably more mcpa leached through the unfrozen subsoil columns table 3 this could have been due to significantly weaker sorption in subsoils because of smaller organic carbon contents hiller et al 2010 slower degradation in the subsoil columns during the experiment may also have been a contributing factor 5 conclusions this study documents the preferential transport of mcpa and a bromide tracer through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil very little mcpa leached from unfrozen columns while for bromide a more uniform advective dispersive transport process was found to our knowledge these contrasting solute transport processes in frozen and unfrozen soil columns have not previously been documented experimentally this study therefor contributes to filling an important knowledge gap the experiment was carried out under high flow conditions in the laboratory nevertheless the data collected in this study should prove useful for testing models of water flow and solute transport in partially frozen and structured soil our findings together with those from other studies eklo et al 1994 french 1999 riise et al 2004 riise et al 2006 ul√©n et al 2013 also suggest that monitoring programs in climates where soil

ensure that the z axis of the soil column in the images was vertical using the untilt stack plugin cooper 2015 differences in illumination were observed along the z axis of the image stack resulting possibly from the slight changes in the x ray beam cone with scanning time a pixel based mathematical operation was performed for illumination correction using the mean grey value of all pixels in the 3 d image and the mean grey value of the slice containing the pixel for illumination correction noise in the image and poor contrast between the background and the feature of interest often interfere with the segmentation process a 3 d median filter with a radius of 2 voxels was used for reducing the noise the contrast between the background soil matrix and pore features was improved by normalizing the image histogram using the enhance contrast algorithm saturated pixels 0 4 in imagej the 3 d image was cropped on the sides using a circular section to exclude the column wall and on the top and bottom to remove the uneven and or smeared soil surface segmentation of the pore features was performed using the local adaptive thresholding method of phansalkar et al 2011 briefly explained the algorithm calculates threshold value for each pixel in a slice based on the mean and standard deviation of the grey values of the neighboring pixels within a circular window specified by the user a pixel is classified as a pore if its grey value is smaller than the calculated threshold value for that pixel isolated features with one pixel width in the segmented images were removed by performing an erosion operation the segmented images were analysed for quantification of macropore properties using the particle analyzer plugin within the bonej plugin in imagej doube et al 2010 the

1627,limited knowledge and experimental data exist on pesticide leaching through partially frozen soil the objective of this study was to better understand the complex processes of freezing and thawing and the effects these processes have on water flow and pesticide transport through soil to achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non reactive tracer and the herbicide mcpa in partially frozen soil in total 40 intact topsoil and subsoil columns from two agricultural fields with contrasting soil types silt and loam in south east norway were used in this experiment mcpa and bromide were applied on top of all columns half the columns were then frozen at 3 c while the other half of the columns were stored at 4 c columns were then subjected to repeated irrigation events at a rate of 5 mm artificial rainwater for 5 h at each event each irrigation was followed by 14 day periods of freezing or refrigeration percolate was collected and analysed for mcpa and bromide the results show that nearly 100 more mcpa leached from frozen than unfrozen topsoil columns of hov silt and kroer loam soils leaching patterns of bromide and mcpa were very similar in frozen columns with high concentrations and clear peaks early in the irrigation process and with lower concentrations leaching at later stages hardly any mcpa leached from unfrozen topsoil columns 0 4 0 5 of applied amount and concentrations were very low bromide showed a different flow pattern indicating a more uniform advective dispersive transport process in the unfrozen columns with higher concentrations leaching but without clear concentration peaks this study documents that pesticides can be preferentially transported through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil these findings indicate that monitoring programs should include sampling during snow melt or early spring in areas were soil frost is common as this period could imply exposure peaks in groundwater or surface water graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords freeze thaw effects preferential flow macropores solute transport mcpa 1 introduction in cold climates increased pesticide concentrations are often detected in soil leachate drain discharge surface runoff and surface water bodies during freeze thaw periods in late winter and early spring eklo et al 1994 french 1999 riise et al 2004 riise et al 2006 siimes et al 2006 ul√©n et al 2013 with climate change this may become an increasingly relevant issue for example in the nordic countries climate models predict higher temperatures and more snowmelt episodes during winter and an increase in the frequency of freeze thaw cycles of up to 38 hanssen bauer et al 2015 mellander et al 2007 lundberg et al 2016 however the effects of freezing and thawing on the fate and behaviour of pesticides in soil are complex and still not well understood so the mechanisms underlying these field observations are unclear soil freezing and thawing potentially influences the pathways of water flow and solute transport through soils as well as chemical and biological processes affecting pesticide fate in the soil hayashi 2013 ireson et al 2013 the importance of macropores as non equilibrium or preferential flow paths for rapid water flow and solute transport has long since been recognized jarvis et al 2016 beven and germann 1982 the occurrence of macropore flow can result in dramatic increases in the leaching of pesticides to groundwater and to surface water via sub surface drainage pipes jarvis 2007 flury 1996 macropores can be defined as pores with diameters of 0 3 0 5 mm and larger jarvis et al 2017 jarvis 2007 these large pores have a smaller relative surface area than smaller pores and in cases where macropores dominate flow processes solutes in flowing water can bypass bulk soil and any potential binding sites luxmoore et al 1990 examples of macropores are biopores made by earthworms and plant roots and planar fissures formed by freezing thawing or drying wetting any water present in such large pores will freeze first as the temperature continue to decrease water in successively smaller pores will freeze ireson et al 2013 however large macropores will often be air filled when the soil freezes and can therefore function as effective pathways for preferential flow on thawing or if rain falls on frozen ground van der kamp et al 2003 with subsequent freeze thaw cycles they can become blocked with ice which reduces the hydraulic conductivity ireson et al 2013 models currently used in risk assessment and management do not account for the effects of freezing and thawing on pesticide leaching models should be tested against experimental data hence the need to perform controlled laboratory studies or field studies to generate the data required to support the development of such a model to date only relatively few studies have investigated experimentally the significance of freezing and thawing for preferential transport of solutes through soil stadler et al 2000 gentry et al 2000 barnes and wolfe 2008 wang et al 2016 hafsteinsd√≥ttir et al 2013 wei et al 2015 these referred studies focused mainly on the transport of tracers nitrogen petroleum or heavy metals in a laboratory study stenr√∏d et al 2008 reported higher mobility of metribuzin and transport to greater depths in frozen soil compared to unfrozen soil but this study did not focus on preferential flow per se and the results were not statistically significant to our knowledge no other studies of this type have been carried out specifically for pesticides the objective of the present study was therefore to increase understanding of the effects of freezing and thawing on water flow and pesticide transport through soil to achieve this we conducted a soil column irrigation experiment to quantify the transport of a non reactive tracer and the herbicide mcpa in partially frozen soil we hypothesize that columns subjected to freezing will show a higher degree of preferential transport 2 materials and methods 2 1 soil sampling and characterization intact soil

characterization of the soils are summarized in fig a1 in appendix c the water content of the sampled soils was neither t measured in the columns at sampling nor in the laboratory before the experiment started this was to avoid disturbing the intact soil columns sampling was done in aluminium cylinders i d 9 2 cm height 20 cm fifty six columns were sampled 14 from both the topsoil 0 20 cm

were under winter wheat information about the use of pesticides on the sampled fields was obtained from the farmers and indicated no use of the herbicide mcpa during the last 2 3 years prior to

stored at about 4 c in 20 l plastic containers 2 3 experimental set up twenty of the sampled soil columns from each of the sites kroer and hov in total 40 columns was included in the experiment the rest of the sampled columns were excluded due to their bad condition e g high content of straw in the bottom soil was too loose and crumbled out of the columns or due to big gaps between soil and cylinder walls the top of the soil columns was levelled to 2 cm below the rim of the top of the aluminium cylinders to ensure sufficient room for ponding during irrigation the columns were also carefully levelled at the bottom to achieve equal initial conditions the columns were then placed in a box of water with zero pressure potential at the bottom of the soil for a week to bring the samples close to saturation the columns were then placed on a sand box eijkelkamp where a pressure potential of 30 cm was applied at the bottom of the soil columns for a week to establish an identical initial condition for all columns one that also ensured that all continuous macropores would be air filled five columns were randomly chosen from each soil type and depth for the freezing treatment the remaining five columns were stored unfrozen analysis of variance anova tests performed using all pairwise multiple comparison procedures student newman keuls method in sigmaplot sigmaplot for windows version 13 0 systat software inc showed no significant differences for either of the soils or depths in any of the measured pore network characteristics between the columns that underwent the freezing treatment and the unfrozen columns all columns were then placed on fine meshed metal sieves filled with glass beads to allow for free drainage thermistors were installed in the columns that were subjected to freezing to monitor the temperature during the experiment these thermistors were installed horizontally into the center of the columns through holes in the cylinders at 7 and 14 cm depth from the soil surface the thermistors were then connected to a temperature data logger delta t burwell cambridge u k accuracy 0 5 c temperature was logged every 10 min throughout the experiment the columns were placed on a 5 cm thick polystyrene insulation board and the column walls were covered with two layers of 2 cm thick polyethylene insulation to ensure freezing from the top and downwards five ml of both the mcpa and potassium bromide kbr solutions were applied at the surface of each column as evenly as possible by hand using a 5 ml pipette finnpipette giving rates of 2 1 kg ha 1 of mcpa and 59 1 kg br ha 1 the application rate of mcpa is an agricultural relevant rate in norway the insulated columns in the freezing treatment were then placed in a 1 m3 freezing cabinet weisstechnik 1000sb weiss technik gmbh d 6301 reiskirchen germany accuracy 0 5 c at 3 c while the unfrozen columns were kept at ca 4 c in a refrigerated room a temperature of 3 c was chosen as it was considered low enough to ensure that all water in mesopores and macropores would be frozen the top of the columns were sealed with a plastic lid and incubated at these temperatures for about four weeks they were then subjected to repeated irrigation events with the prepared artificial rainwater followed by 14 day periods of freezing or refrigeration for the control columns between irrigations the experiment lasted for a total of 8 weeks for the silt soil 3 irrigations and 10 weeks for the loam 4 irrigations the frozen columns and the unfrozen columns were transported to the irrigation room in the morning of each irrigation event the irrigation room was at a temperature of about 5 8 c at the start of the irrigations but this increased to a maximum of ca 12 c during the day the artificial rain water was at a temperature of about 2 4 c at the start of each irrigation but this increased to a maximum of about 6 c at the end of the irrigations the columns were placed on top of funnels with collector flasks beneath this setup allowed free drainage at the base of the soil columns irrigation water was distributed to the columns using peristaltic pumps autoclude model vl adjusted to give a rate of 5 mm hr 1 for 5 h resulting in a total of about 25 mm of rainwater to each column per irrigation event water was transferred through pvc tubes vwr 4 6 mm and dripped onto filter paper whatman grade 1 85 mm ge healthcare life sciences placed on the surface of the columns to ensure uniform distribution the actual irrigation rates varied slightly between columns but there were no systematic differences between treatments soils or depths preliminary tests indicated that on average the columns received 5 to 9 less water than the nominal rate rough calculations suggest that the total amount of irrigation water supplied to the columns during the experiment would be equivalent to ca one pore volume percolate from the soil columns during and after each irrigation was sampled in 150 ml polycarbonate bottles corning vwr and sub samples for chemical analysis were collected manually at approximately every 25 ml until about 24 h after the start of each irrigation event from each sub sample 3 ml was transferred to a 15 ml polypropylene centrifuge tube corning vwr and stored cold 4 c for later analysis of bromide the remaining volume of leachate for each sample was stored frozen 20 c in amber 60 ml glass bottles for later pesticide analysis results of water and pesticides are reported as total amounts volumes transported through the soil columns during the irrigation events as of the applied amounts and as measured concentrations the term 5 arrival time is frequently used as an indicator of the degree of preferential flow koestel et al 2011 it is usually defined as the normalized time at which 5 of the applied amount of a solute has passed through a soil column small values indicate a high degree of preferential transport larsbo et al 2016 in our case as the outflows are not the same for all columns even if the boundary condition is the same a non steady state flow experiment we used the 5 arrival volume for bromide to assess whether there were any differences in the strength of preferential flow between the frozen and unfrozen columns the first 5 of the tracer mass in this instance is based on the initial applied bromide mass 2 4 chemical analysis bromide analysis was carried out using a thermo bromide ion selective electrode thermo fisher scientific orion 9635bnwp coupled to an ion meter mettler toledo seven compact ph ion meter s220

filter ptfe 0 2 Œºm filter 13 mm diameter vwr into vials leachates from the unfrozen soil columns were analysed directly whereas the samples from the frozen columns were diluted 1 9 in water before analysis due to high mcpa concentrations 50 Œºl 2 4 d dr ehrensdorfer gmbh purity 99 was added as an internal standard to all samples at a final level of 10 ng ml to adjust for any variability during

analytes were detected in the negative electrospray mode with transitions m z 199 141 and m z 200 142 for mcpa and the pseudo transition m z 141 141 for 2 mcp the mcpa metabolite 2 mcp was not detected in any of the samples concentrations were measured using a 5 point internal standard calibration range from 0 5 500 ng mcpa ml the limits of quantification were 0 125 ng mcpa ml and 5 ng 2 mcp ml after removing water for mcpa analysis the remaining leachate was combined to make one bulk sample per column and irrigation as 2 mcp was not detected by the method used to analyse for mcpa selected bulk samples were concentrated and analysed for the metabolite 2 mcp 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analysis of the differences in macropore characteristics water bromide and mcpa transport were carried out with an analysis of variance anova type iii test and a post hoc pairwise tukey test tukey s honest significant difference method in r commander r core team 2016 the mean total amounts of water bromide and mcpa leached were used as response variables and soil type and treatment frozen or unfrozen as predictor variables factors statistically significant results are reported at the 5 significance level unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 image analysis and soil characteristics the characteristics of the imaged macropore networks are summarized in table 2 as was also demonstrated by jarvis et al 2017 the results showed that the connectivity of the macropore networks depends strongly on imaged macroporosity with a threshold value for continuity percolation of ca 4 fig 1 in general the topsoils had larger imaged porosities than the subsoils while the loam soil at kroer was found to have a larger imaged porosity and better connected macropore network than the silt soil at hov fig 1 in particular the subsoil at hov appeared to have no connected macroporosity 3 2 temperatures temperatures in the initially frozen soil columns increased quickly towards 0 c after the start of the irrigations but then stabilized before starting to increase again fig 2 it generally took several hours before the temperatures continued to increase above 0 c and this lag phase was longer at each irrigation at the third irrigation of the silt soil temperatures did not increase much above 0 c until 27 30 h after the start of the irrigation another observation made was that loam subsoil started thawing before the loam topsoil measurements from all thermistors at both depths 7 and 14 cm were included in the figure but no clear difference between the two depths could be observed and the two thermistor depths have not been indicated in the figure the data logger stopped working under the third irrigation of the kroer loam soil columns so no temperature curve could be obtained from this irrigation event it took some time before the first irrigation of the kroer loam started hence the temperatures in the columns had risen to near 0 c at the beginning of the irrigation 3 3 infiltration and drainage anova for percolated volumes of water show that significantly larger amounts of percolation were collected from the unfrozen loam soil columns than from the frozen columns p 001 and significantly more from frozen topsoil columns than from frozen subsoil columns p 05 no significant differences were observed between the unfrozen topsoil and subsoil columns similar observations were made for the silt soil table 3 due to the different number of irrigations the two soils received a direct statistical comparison of the two soil types was not performed nevertheless some differences worth mentioning were observed for example ponding was observed on frozen columns already during the first irrigation and to a greater extent for the silt than for the loam soil in the silt soil ponding was even observed on unfrozen subsoil columns in general the extent of ponding increased in both soils for the later irrigations in the silt swelling or frost heave of the soil was also observed in addition to freezing of the irrigation water along the edges at the top of the soil columns especially during the later irrigations another observation made for both soil types was that when the frozen soil columns started to thaw during the irrigation the ponded water infiltrated quickly and percolated through the columns after thawing 25 ml samples were collected at ca 6 7 min intervals equivalent to flow rates of ca 35 mm h 1 this sudden infiltration was observed more often in the loam than in the silt in contrast the interval between each sampling in unfrozen soil was typically ca 30 min equivalent to a flow rate of ca 7 mm h 1 figs 3 and 4 show the accumulated amount of water that percolated from frozen and unfrozen kroer loam and hov silt soil columns plotted against time these figures show the constant outflow rate during irrigations of the unfrozen columns almost equal to the inflow rate and the rapid cessation when the irrigations stopped this was very clear for both the loam topsoil and subsoil as well as the silt topsoil whereas this difference was smaller for the unfrozen silt subsoil in the frozen columns the outflow started later especially for the later irrigations and many of the frozen columns continued to percolate slowly a long time after irrigation ceased during the second irrigation of the kroer loam some of the early samples from the frozen subsoil were lost due to leakages through the thermistor holes the holes were re sealed before the next irrigation this was not believed to influence the overall results 3 4 bromide leaching following the pattern observed for the percolation of water significantly p 001 more bromide leached from the unfrozen loam columns than from the frozen loam columns in both topsoil and subsoil table 3 on average significantly more bromide leached from the unfrozen loam subsoil than the unfrozen loam topsoil p 05 in the case of the silt soil there were no statistically significant differences between the amounts of bromide leached from frozen and unfrozen topsoil columns p 05 for subsoil on the other hand the results were similar to what was observed for the loam the leaching patterns of bromide are illustrated in figs 5 and 6 for typical columns from each soil and treatment combination it was difficult to pick representative columns but the purpose was to illustrate that for these soils and treatments preferential flow occurred although manifested slightly differently for different columns figs 5 show evidence of strong preferential flow through the frozen topsoils of the loam columns with the highest bromide concentrations found in the first sample of the second irrigation results from the other loam topsoil columns showed the same pattern albeit with some variations in the timing of the peak bromide concentrations fig a1 in appendix a the evidence of strong preferential flow was weaker for the frozen silt topsoil columns fig 6 though clearer for two of the columns fig a3 in appendix a where an early breakthrough of relatively high concentrations of bromide was observed in the first collected samples this pattern was not equally clear for the frozen silt subsoil fig 6 and fig a3 in appendix a contrary to the frozen soils the leaching patterns were quite different in the unfrozen soils with smoother breakthrough curves without distinct early concentration peaks especially evident in the loam soil fig 5 data for the other columns show the same pattern see appendix a the calculated 5 arrival volumes support the results shown above with smaller values found for the frozen soils than unfrozen soils table 3 however statistically significant differences between frozen and unfrozen columns were only found for the silt topsoil p 001 furthermore a statistically significant difference was found between unfrozen silt and loam columns for both topsoil and subsoil p 01 which confirms that preferential flow was generally stronger in the loam soil 3 5 mcpa leaching in contrast to water and bromide significantly more mcpa leached from frozen topsoil and subsoil loam columns than from the unfrozen soils p 001 table 3 similar results were found for the silt topsoil where the mean amount of mcpa leached from frozen columns was significantly larger p 01 than from the unfrozen columns for the unfrozen silt soil mcpa leaching was significantly larger p 05 from the subsoil than from the topsoil table 3 in the frozen loam columns the shapes of the breakthrough curves for mcpa were strikingly similar to those of bromide with peak concentrations of mcpa of ca 2 to 3 mg l 1 measured in leachate by the end of the first irrigation fig 5 mcpa concentrations also peaked early in the unfrozen loam columns peaks hidden because of the scale of the plots but the concentrations were much smaller and significantly less mcpa leached from unfrozen columns during the experiment fig 5 table 3 mcpa breakthrough curves for all loam columns are collected in appendix a fig a2 similar to the loam soil most of the frozen silt topsoil columns showed early concentration peaks for mcpa although the measured concentrations in the percolate were much smaller and the pattern was less clear than for the loam fig 6 fig a4 in appendix a mcpa concentrations in leachate from the unfrozen silt topsoil columns were much smaller than for the frozen columns fig 6 and hardly any mcpa leached from these columns table 3 leaching losses of mcpa were similar for frozen and unfrozen silt subsoil table 3 the breakthrough curves of the frozen silt subsoil columns peaked at different irrigations fig a 4 in appendix a but four of the unfrozen silt subsoil columns showed a pattern closer to the one observed for bromide leaching i e smoother breakthrough curves without clear concentration peaks one of the unfrozen silt subsoil columns differed from the others though by showing an early concentration peak fig 6 mcpa breakthrough curves for all silt columns are collected in appendix a fig a4 a general observation made for many of the columns was the smaller concentrations of mcpa and bromide in the first sample after the start of a new irrigation this applied especially to bromide fig 5 but was also observed for mcpa fig 6 the metabolite 2 mcp was detected in some of the bulk samples from both frozen and unfrozen soil columns both from loam and silt soils in leachate from frozen kroer loam topsoil columns 2 mcp was only detected in the samples from the last irrigation at concentrations of about 0 3 Œºg l 1 the metabolite was not detected in leachate from unfrozen loam topsoil or frozen loam subsoil in unfrozen loam subsoil the metabolite was found in all samples from three columns at concentrations between 0 04 and 0 49 Œºg l 1 mean 0 16 Œºg l 1 the maximum amounts detected of the metabolite was in unfrozen kroer loam subsoil and equalled to about 0 02 of the applied amount of mcpa the metabolite was not detected in leachate samples from the hov silt soil 4 discussion 4 1 freeze thaw effects on water flow and tracer transport the observed differences in leaching patterns for bromide between frozen and unfrozen columns suggest that preferential flow through continuous macropores occurred largely in the frozen soils the calculated lower 5 arrival volumes for frozen columns also support this conclusion table 3 contrary to this the bromide breakthrough curves from the unfrozen columns indicate a slower and more uniform advective dispersive transport process through the whole soil matrix the bromide breakthrough curves follow the same pattern in many of the frozen columns figs 5 6 and appendix a with large concentrations peaking after relatively small amounts of water had percolated through the columns followed by tailing to smaller concentrations this applied to both loam and silt soils although the silt did not show the same clear preferential flow pattern as the loam especially in the subsoil presumably because it was limited by the lack of continuity of the macropore network fig 1 and jarvis et al 2016 however even for the silt soil the 5 arrival volumes indicated stronger preferential flow for frozen soils than unfrozen soils table 3 the differences observed in 5 arrival volume were only statistically significant in topsoil although the breakthrough curves indicated the same tendency for both soils smaller concentrations of bromide were detected in the first percolate samples after the onset of a new irrigation than in the final samples of the previous irrigation this could be partly explained by the fact that as soil water freezes solutes may become concentrated in the unfrozen water in the smaller pores and as temperatures increase again solutes may only slowly diffuse back into the mobile water in larger pores st√§hli and stadler 1997 ireson et al 2013 thus when the soil thaws again the first water draining from the macropores may be relatively clean larsson et al 1999 in general the transport patterns indicating preferential flow through macropores occurred during the earliest irrigations when the macropores presumably were still air filled later when more water had been applied the larger pores also became blocked by ice resulting in reduced hydraulic conductivity and slower thawing ireson et al 2013 moghadas et al 2016 the ponding observed on top of many columns at the initial stages of the later irrigations supports this assumption for the frozen loam soil ponding was first observed during the second irrigation but some of the silt columns exhibited ponding already during the first irrigation hence water content is important for how fast the thawing process occurs in addition to the ponding this was observed as the frozen columns both started to thaw fig 2 and drain figs 2 3 later at later irrigations in this experiment these observations were more evident for the silt than the loam this could be explained by less pore space being available for infiltration of water and that infiltration was so slow that the increased exposure to ice caused its freezing on the way down moghadas et al 2016 this could also be the reason why it took so long for the water to infiltrate the silt subsoil during and after the last irrigation fig 4 when the frozen soil columns started to thaw during the irrigations the ponded water infiltrated quickly and percolated through the columns after thawing 25 ml samples were collected at ca 6 7 min intervals equivalent to flow rates of ca 35 mm h 1 being a lot faster than the fastest flow rates observed for unfrozen columns ca 7 mm h 1 this fast infiltration was not observed for silt subsoil being in line with the estimations of relatively high 5 arrival volume values table 3 indicating a little degree of preferential flow and the smaller content of connected macropores in this soil fig 1 in addition to the different leaching patterns observed for bromide between the two treatments significantly less amounts of bromide leached from frozen columns compared to unfrozen columns table 3 brown et al 2000 discussed that preferential flow rapidly can transport small amounts of bromide to depth but that over a longer leaching period preferential flow will give smaller total losses of bromide than matrix flow this is because preferential flow interacts with only a small part of the soil and associated solute in our case the difference observed in bromide leaching could also be due to the fact that significantly less water was collected from the frozen soil columns than the unfrozen columns as the frozen columns thawed one would not expect any difference in the total amount of water percolating there were indications that the frozen columns had not finished draining after the cessation of irrigation as a loss of water from the columns was observed while moving them before transportation between the freezing facilities and the lysimeter laboratory furthermore ice was observed under the frozen columns in the freezing cabinet continued sampling beyond 24 h after the start of irrigation would have been desirable to sample more water from the frozen columns but due to time constraints this was not possible 4 2 freeze thaw effects on mcpa leaching brown et al 2000 argues that preferential flow seems to be the most important process for pesticide transport and that residues can be transported rapidly to deeper soil layers while slower leaching via matrix flow not will result in larger losses over time because degradation or sorption might reduce the amounts that could leach in this study very little mcpa leached through the unfrozen loam and silt topsoil columns and it is possible that this could be due to faster degradation in these columns which were maintained at higher temperatures 4 c compared with 3 c the amount of mcpa retained in the soil was not measured so the extent of degradation and thus a complete mass balance cannot be determined with certainty however the metabolite 2 mcp was detected in low amounts in some bulk leachate samples both from frozen kroer loam topsoil and unfrozen kroer loam subsoil implying that some degradation did occur during the experiment this could be due to aerobic soil degradation or more probable due to aqueous photolysis during sampling and sample preparation since 2 mcp is a major aqueous photolysis metabolite it is highly unlikely though that differences in degradation rates between frozen and unfrozen columns could explain the large differences observed in the leached amounts of mcpa the markedly larger leaching losses of mcpa from frozen topsoil columns was therefore most probably a result of much weaker sorption during transport sorption has been shown to be a temperature dependent process and for most compounds sorption decreases with increasing temperature ten hulscher and cornelissen 1996 shariff and shareef 2011 it could then be hypothesized that sorption would be stronger at lower temperatures stenr√∏d et al 2008 on the other hand found smaller kd values and increased pore water concentrations for metribuzin upon release of frost in packed columns stored at 5 c indicating that this might not always be the case nevertheless the effect of freezing on the water flow pathways is probably the most important reason for the differences observed in our experiment due to the fast transport through macropores the time for adsorption of mcpa would be limited in the frozen soil columns where flow would have been mostly restricted to the larger pores that were either initially air filled or which drained quickly on thawing in addition compared to smaller pores macropores have a small ratio of surface area to pore volume reducing the number of available binding sites for passing solutes jarvis 2007 in contrast in the unfrozen soil with a slower and more uniform flow pattern mcpa although a relatively mobile substance would be exposed to more soil surfaces and binding sites resulting in a higher degree of sorption and less mcpa being transported through the columns freezing of soil can lead to frost heave formation of ice lenses and subsequent cracking of the soil and hence an increased hydraulic conductivity hotineanu et al 2015 in our case this could have explained some of the differences observed between frozen and unfrozen columns with regards to mcpa leaching however less water percolated through the frozen soil columns and less bromide leached so this was probably not a major factor the fact that the results were quite consistent across all columns supports this conclusion the similarity between the replicatet columns and consistent differences between the treatments also indicates that bypass of water along the side column walls was a minor problem compared with the unfrozen topsoil columns considerably more mcpa leached through the unfrozen subsoil columns table 3 this could have been due to significantly weaker sorption in subsoils because of smaller organic carbon contents hiller et al 2010 slower degradation in the subsoil columns during the experiment may also have been a contributing factor 5 conclusions this study documents the preferential transport of mcpa and a bromide tracer through soil macropores at relatively high concentrations in partially frozen soil very little mcpa leached from unfrozen columns while for bromide a more uniform advective dispersive transport process was found to our knowledge these contrasting solute transport processes in frozen and unfrozen soil columns have not previously been documented experimentally this study therefor contributes to filling an important knowledge gap the experiment was carried out under high flow conditions in the laboratory nevertheless the data collected in this study should prove useful for testing models of water flow and solute transport in partially frozen and structured soil our findings together with those from other studies eklo et al 1994 french 1999 riise et al 2004 riise et al 2006 ul√©n et al 2013 also suggest that monitoring programs in climates where soil

ensure that the z axis of the soil column in the images was vertical using the untilt stack plugin cooper 2015 differences in illumination were observed along the z axis of the image stack resulting possibly from the slight changes in the x ray beam cone with scanning time a pixel based mathematical operation was performed for illumination correction using the mean grey value of all pixels in the 3 d image and the mean grey value of the slice containing the pixel for illumination correction noise in the image and poor contrast between the background and the feature of interest often interfere

normalizing the image histogram using the enhance contrast algorithm saturated pixels 0 4 in imagej the 3 d image was cropped on the sides using a circular section to exclude the column wall and on

the user a pixel is classified as a pore if its grey value is smaller than the calculated threshold value for that pixel isolated features with one pixel width in the segmented images were removed by performing an erosion operation the segmented images were analysed for quantification of macropore properties using the particle analyzer plugin within the bonej plugin in imagej doube et al 2010 the

1628,nitrate contamination in groundwater has become an environmental problem of widespread concern in this study we used environmental isotopes Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 and an isotope mixing model siar to identify the main sources of nitrate pollution and factors controlling nitrate pollution and to quantify the relative contributions of potential no3 sources in an over exploited groundwater region north china the results showed that human activities had dramatically increased the mean concentration of groundwater no3 reaching 124 4 mg l in hutuo river pluvial fan region groundwater nitrate came from many kinds of pollution sources and the predominant sources were sewage and or manure nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes and groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution the highest contribution of groundwater no3 was sewage and or manure which the percent in the hutuo river valley plain unit upper pluvial fans of hutuo river and central pluvial fans of hutuo river was 54 9 55 0 and 61 8 respectively followed by soil n nh4 in fertilizer and rain no3 fertilizer and no3 in precipitation we suggested that the local government must strengthen the sewage treatment for the collection of domestic sewage and must prohibit over exploitation of groundwater in order to prevent no3 contamination of in groundwater keywords groundwater nitrate pollution sources over exploited groundwater region stable isotope siar mixing model 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution has become an environmental problem of widespread concern xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2015a high nitrate concentrations are mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities such as the excessive use of fertilizers and animal manures past√©n zapata et al 2014 and the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage matiatos 2016 in addition the elevated atmospheric n deposition is also a vital contamination source for water environments wakida and lerner 2005 groundwater is one of the most important water resources and is used for domestic consumption and agriculture irrigation excessively high levels of nitrate in drinking water can increase the risk of diseases such as methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome past√©n zapata et al 2014 spontaneous abortions and thyroid disorders yan et al 2014 in addition the export of nitrate into surface water may lead to many ecological and environmental problems including eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia li et al 2010 li et al 2013 as a result of these issues the world health organization who has set an upper limit of 50 mg l no3 for drinking water who 2011 an effective measure for controlling and managing nitrate pollution is to identify the sources of nitrate as different nitrate sources have distinct n and o isotope compositions nestler et al 2011 a dual isotope approach using both Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can provide useful information to trace the sources of no3 in water environment kim et al 2015 xue et al 2009 for example the Œ¥15n values of nitrate deposited via precipitation and sewage and manure range from 13 to 13 and from 4 to 25 respectively xue et al 2009 the Œ¥15n no3 values of chemical fertilizers range from 6 to 6 while Œ¥15n no3 values of soil nitrogen range from 3 to 9 jin et al 2015 kendall et al 2008 xiao and liu 2002 the Œ¥18o no3 can provide additional useful information because of the distinct isotopic characteristics the Œ¥18o no3 values of no3 from nitrification such as no3 from soil n nh4 in fertilizer and rain and sewage and manure fertilizers and precipitation range from 10 to 10 17 to 25 and 25 to 75 respectively fang et al 2012 liu et al 2006 saccon et al 2013 xue et al 2009 recently the dual Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 technique has been used successfully in many studies to identify the sources of no3 pollution in groundwater jin et al 2015 liu et al 2006 ma et al 2016 nitrogen transformations in the environment such as nitrification and denitrification can change the isotopic composition of nitrate due to physical chemical and biological fractionation processes ouml and berg 1997 nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria during denitrification nitrate is reduced via nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide to gaseous nitrogen by the enzymatic activity of denitrifying bacteria and generally occurs in anaerobic environments hedin et al 2008 nestler et al 2011 in general water nitrate comes from many sources therefore the quantification of the contribution ratio of different sources of no3 is important for helping to reduce the input of no3 into groundwater in recent years researchers have successfully quantified proportional contributions of the different no3 source in water using a bayesian isotopic mixing model stable isotope analysis in r or siar parnell et al 2010 zhang et al 2015b xue et al 2013 xue et al 2012 and gaouzi et al 2013 applied a bayesian isotopic mixing model to estimate the proportional apportionment of five different sources of no3 in rivers and kim et al 2015 and matiatos 2016 also applied this model to estimate the proportional apportionment of different sources of no3 in groundwater the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan is located in the western portion of the north china plain ncp ncp is the largest alluvial plain and one of the most densely populated regions of east asia groundwater in this region is the main source of industrial agricultural and drinking water and therefore directly influences daily life li et al 2016 in recent years as a result of rapid urbanization industrialization and population growth the influence of human activities on groundwater quality is becoming more and more serious in addition due to the over exploitation of groundwater the groundwater table has dropped rapidly and formed the cone of groundwater depression several studies have found that the shallow groundwater quality has deteriorated and the nitrate was the main pollution factor in this region li et al 2016 the objectives of this study are 1 to identify the mainly sources of no3 in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan of groundwater and surface water by using the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 method 2 to trace the main transformation of nitrogen 3 to quantify a proportional apportionment of different no3 sources by using a bayesian isotopic mixing model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area belongs to the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan shijiazhuang segment which is located in the piedmont of taihang mountain in southwestern hebei province china fig 1 the research region is nearly 2442 km2 and contains 5 5 million people it is under middle latitude continental semi humid monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 3 15 0 c and a mean annual precipitation of 400 750 mm which is mostly concentrated in june to august the aquifer is quaternary loose sediments and the lithology is primarily composed of gravel pebbles coarse sand and fine sand the types of groundwater in this area are fissure water and loose stratum pore water topographically high in the west and low in the east and the overall groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast the main recharge of groundwater is precipitation river and canal water infiltration and irrigation return etc the discharge mainly occurs by pumping over exploitation of groundwater results in the groundwater table lowering continuously forming a regional groundwater depression cone and reducing the exploitation volume of groundwater in a single well from 200 300 m3 h to 45 150 m3 h the well diameter is 10 15 cm according to the data provided by the water supply plant of shijiazhuang city li et al 2016 in this study we separated the aquifer into three hydrogeological subregions the hutuo river valley plain vht upper pluvial fans of hutuo river upf and central pluvial fans of hutuo river cpf 1 the vht are mainly distributed in the pingshan anticline metamorphic rock area this area belongs to the transitional zone between mountainous hills and plains including bedrock weathering fissure water and pore water which has small water volume and the thickness of aquifer is about 10 20 m the depth to water table is shallow generally about 2 21 m the hydraulic conductivity is well and the hydraulic connection with outside is closed which mainly supplied by precipitation 2 the upf is mainly sand gravel the thickness of the aquifer is about 20 35 m and the water conductivity and water yield property are good the upper first aquifer group has been basically drained and the second water group is the current exploitation aquifer 3 the groundwater depth is about 40 50 in cpf the thickness is nearly 25 60 m and the lithology of the aquifer is dominated by coarse sand with gravel sand gravel and medium sand the water conductivity and water yield property is both well the upper first and second aquifer groups have basically been drained currently the third and fourth water bearing groups are mainly exploited in recent years due to the rapid economic development land use types have changed greatly in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan region chaolin et al 2012 from 1995 to 2014 the cultivated land and forest land areas have been decreased from 5990 and 4620 km2 to 5287 and 3233 km2 respectively the city land area has been added from 85 to 264 km2 according to shijiazhuang statistical yearbook 1995 and 2014 nowadays the main land use types include cultivated land 38 62 wasteland including mountains and barren land 34 34 urban land 11 60 surface water 2 35 and countryside land 13 09 in addition results of different land use types in the three hydrogeological subregions have calculated in table 1 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study a total 33 samples groundwater samples 31 and surface water samples 2 were collected in january 2015 the 2 sites of the surface water r1 and r2 located near the outlet of two reservoirs the two reservoirs are located on the hutuo river channel and are concentrated water sources of surface water of shijiazhuang city and are mainly water sources of supply for groundwater in the study regions and sampling sites are located near the outlet of two reservoirs the well locations are shown in the land use map fig 1 all the wells chosen for groundwater sampling are commonly used for domestic and or agricultural purposes these wells have a mean depth of 82 4 m range 12 0 300 0 m and the mean depth of the groundwater table is 9 78 m range 4 0 50 0 m the conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured on site by using a wtw multi 340i set multiparameter instrument germany groundwater samples were extracted by pumping from the wells surface water samples were taken as a grab sample and the samples were collected at the depth of 50 cm below the water surface all samples were collected by using a high density polyethylene sampler filtered through 0 45 Œºm membranes and then stored in three 250 ml and one 4 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles for analyzing the main ion no3 no2 and nh4 and the isotopes Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥18o h2o respectively the samples without preprocessing were used for anion and isotope analyses the samples used for cation were acidified with hcl to ph 2 the analysis of mn in the water samples was performed by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan while the analyses of ions i e nitrate no3 nitrite no2 ammonia nh4 were carried out by using spectrophotometry perkin elmer lambda 35 united states the no3 no2 nh4 and mn analyses were carried out at the groundwater mineral water and environmental monitoring center at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the ratios of isotopic n and o of no3 were determined using a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer with an online flash elemental analyzer in the research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values were determined by ion exchange methods silva et al 2000 no3 was first collected on the ion exchange columns using an anion resin after which 15 ml of 3 m hcl were used to elute the no3 from the resins the so4 2 and po4 3 were removed by precipitation with excess bacl2 the sample was then passed through a cation exchange resin an excess of ag2o was used to remove the cl and neutralize the solution to achieve a ph of about 6 after which the agno3 solution was freeze dried for isotopic analysis the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta Œ¥ units and as a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 Œ¥ sam ple rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r sample and rstandard are the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratios of the samples and standards for Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o respectively the Œ¥15n values are reported relative to n2 in atmospheric air air and the Œ¥18o values are reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow zhang et al 2015b the ratios of isotopic o of h2o were determined using a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the isotope compositions were reported in standard Œ¥ notation represented as per mil deviation from the v smow vienna standard mean ocean water standard the precision of the Œ¥18o values is 0 2 2 3 multivariate data analysis the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to analyze the differences in groundwater no3 and no2 concentration and Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values in the three hydrogeological subregions and the rivers were evaluated using because the data failed to meet the assumption of normality for parametric statistical analyses the kruskal wallis test and mann whitney u test were performed using r software version 3 3 1 new zealand 2 4 bayesian isotopic mixing model the contributions of groundwater nitrate sources were quantified using the bayesian isotopic mixing model siar mixing model parnell et al 2010 the mixing model has been implemented using siar stable isotope analysis in r software package nowadays the siar mixing model has been successfully used to estimating multiple nitrate source contributions xue et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b a detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and jackson et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water chemistry and nitrate isotope 3 1 1 water chemistry the ph ec and do values of the groundwater and surface water samples are listed in table 2 results showed that groundwater ph was neutral to mildly alkaline 7 10 7 92 and the mean value was 7 39 while river ph values ranged from 7 86 to 8 14 with a mean value of 8 00 surface water ph values were higher than groundwater ph values which may be due to the strong evaporation of the surface water and the vadose zone environment was beneficial to nitrification and the oxidation of mineral because of over exploitation of groundwater resulted in lowing ph of groundwater zhang et al 2017 ec values ranged from 233 to 3120 Œºs cm in groundwater and from 548 to 966 Œºs cm in surface water as shown in table 1 the groundwater do levels ranged from 4 36 to 10 85 mg l with a mean value of 6 82 mg l while surface water do levels ranged from 8 88 to 9 88 mg l and the mean value was 9 38 mg l the mean levels of do in surface water were higher than those in groundwater 3 1 2 the concentration of nitrogenous species the concentrations of nh4 in groundwater and surface water samples were below the detection limit bdl 0 04 mg l no2 was present in a low concentration and showed no signification spatial variation in the three hydrogeological subregions and the surface water p 05 by using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and mann whitney u test the no2 concentrations varied from bdl 0 002 mg l to 0 021 mg l for the groundwater the mean values was 0 005 mg l and were bdl for the surface water the no3 concentrations varied from 1 64 to 509 0 mg l for the groundwater and were from 7 80 to 10 48 mg l for the surface water the mean concentration of groundwater and surface water was 124 4 and 9 14 mg l respectively there were 23 samples among the total analyzed groundwater samples n 31 that exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l thus the current groundwater nitrate contamination was very serious in the hutuo river pluvial fan as shown in fig 2 the no3 concentrations has a signification spatial variation in the three hydrogeological subregions and the surface water p 05 the mean no3 concentration was 229 1 mg l in the vht and significantly higher than in the upf cpf and the surface water due to the shallow groundwater table and the vadose zone comprises a coarse lithology with good permeability pollutants enter the aquifer easily the mean no3 concentration was 9 14 mg l in surface water and significantly lower than in the vht and upf which was mainly because sites r1 and r2 were located upstream of the study regions and was concentrated water source of surface water of shijiazhuang city the geographical position is higher than the surrounding area and there are protective walls around it therefore it was less affected by human activities meanwhile relative low agricultural nitrate source might be another reason for low nitrate in the surface water samples during the low flow season 3 1 3 nitrate isotope ratios the results of the stable isotope analysis are shown in fig 3 the range of measured Œ¥15n no3 values in the groundwater samples was between 4 79 and 16 03 with the mean values of 9 69 the range of measured Œ¥15n no3 values in the surface water samples was between 13 12 and 14 17 with the mean values of 13 65 the mean Œ¥15n no3 value in the surface water was significantly higher than in the groundwater vht 9 40 upf 9 30 and cpf 10 09 however the mean Œ¥15n no3 values were not significantly different between the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater the range of measured Œ¥18o no3 values in the groundwater was between 6 19 and 25 30 with the mean values of 11 86 and the range of measured Œ¥18o no3 values in the surface water samples was between 8 60 and 24 74 with the mean values of 16 67 there was no significantly difference in Œ¥18o no3 between the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater and surface water 3 2 nitrogen transformation processes 3 2 1 nitrification theoretically the Œ¥18o no3 values of nitrate produced by microbial nitrification could be calculated because approximately one third of the oxygen in no3 should be derived from oxygen in the air while two thirds should be derived from ambient water at the site of nitrate formation kendall 1998 li et al 2010 therefore the Œ¥18o no3 values produced by microbial nitrification could be calculated by using the measured Œ¥18o h2o table 3 of groundwater and assumed Œ¥18o o2 to be that of atmospheric o2 23 5 as indicated in fig 4 all the samples revealed that the Œ¥18o no3 values were higher than the theoretical values which may be caused by higher Œ¥18o h2o values due to the evaporation of soil water or it could be due to higher Œ¥18o values of the o2 caused by bacterial respiration kendall et al 2008 yue et al 2014 indeed the evaporation of soil water is very strong in the alluvial pluvial fan region because the deposit is mainly composed of coarse grained conglomerates and sands and therefore the soil moisture evaporates easily in addition in recent years the groundwater has been intensely exploited as a result of the rapid development of industry and agriculture in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan and recharge sources have been blocked by the construction of the two largely reservoir sites r1 and r2 in the upper part of the study area as a result the groundwater table has dropped rapidly and formed regional groundwater depression cones according to historical data between 1972 and 2000 the groundwater level depth has changed from 13 96 m to 35 54 m an average annual rate of decrease of 1 04 m a since 2005 the groundwater level has decreased slowly and it has been fluctuating between 42 and 43 m with the increasing of groundwater extraction the shallow groundwater table will continue decrease and the funnel area will reach 452 50 km2 by 2012 over exploitation of groundwater combined with a continually increasing thickness of the vadose zone has caused changes in both the hydrodynamic field and hydrogeochemical environment and has led to the formation of an artificially oxidizing environment li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore the vadose zone environment is beneficial to nitrification in this study region the Œ¥18o no3 values for most groundwater samples 97 and surface water site r2 were below those of precipitation from 25 to 75 and chemical fertilizers from 17 to 25 and the concentration of nh4 was below the detection limit bdl 0 04 mg l for all sampling sites therefore nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan region which suggests that the nitrate mainly came from the nitrification of multiple nitrogen sources including sewage and or manure soil nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer 3 2 2 denitrification another possible process causing significant alterations of the isotopic composition of no3 is microbial denitrification which occurs when oxygen is limited and organic carbon is available xue et al 2009 the combined use Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can also provide good constraints for the transformation processes of nitrate during transport for example Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can provide clues about denitrification which causes the enrichment of Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o of the remaining nitrate in roughly a 1 3 2 1 1 ratio through kinetic isotopes effects johannsen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 researchers also found that the increasing Œ¥15n Œ¥18o values at a 1 2 1 ratio indicated denitrification processes particularly when the sample pool nitrate concentrations were decreasing lehmann et al 2003 ma et al 2016 in this study the denitrification may not be a signification process due to the aquifer system is in oxidized environment as shown in table 1 the high mean level of do is 6 82 mg l and the low mean concentration of mn is 8 Œºg l in the alluvial pluvial fan region in addition researchers found that the microbial denitrification could cause increases in Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of residual nitrate with decreasing no3 kendall 1998 liu et al 2013 and could cause a relationship between Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o in a ratio of 1 3 2 1 1 in the water environment liu et al 2013 xue et al 2009 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the ratios between Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o for 7 sites g5 g6 g13 g14 g23 g31 and r2 were in this scope however for sites g5 g6 g13 g14 and g23 the levels of do 4 21 6 93 mg l were higher than the most suitable levels 2 0 mg l of denitrification xue et al 2012 and the concentration of no3 69 50 390 00 mg l were very high therefore denitrification may not occur in these sites site r2 was concentrated water source of surface water in shijiazhuang city there are protective walls around it it was less affected by human activities therefore the concentration of no3 was lower 10 48 mg l so site 2 may not occur denitrification for sites g31 the concentrations of do was 6 89 however the concentration of no3 1 64 mg l was lower desimone and howes 1998 found that slight denitrification could occur when the concentration of groundwater do was in the range 2 6 mg l therefore we thought that sites g31 may have a slight denitrification however the denitrification did not have a great impact on the isotope composition of no3 for this site as indicated by fig 5 there was no correlation between the no3 and do concentration and the Œ¥15n no3 values in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan expressed by a regression line of y 12 12 241 8 r2 0 03 and y 0 22 9 28 r2 0 06 respectively the relationship suggested that denitrification did not have a great impact on the isotope composition of no3 in hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan 3 3 identification of no3 sources using stable isotope methodology the no3 in groundwater could derive from various sources mainly including no3 in precipitation np no3 fertilizer nf nh4 in fertilizer and rain nfar soil n sn and sewage and manure sam kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 a dual isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 versus Œ¥18o no3 was used to identify no3 sources in the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater and the river water as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of most sampling sites did not fall into the scope of a specific pollution source therefore the nitrate may come from many kinds of pollution sources in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area such as no3 fertilizer soil n and manure and or sewage etc in the groundwater sampling sites the mean Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of the three hydrogeological subregions vht upf and cpf were 9 40 and 11 26 9 30 and 11 92 10 09 and 11 37 respectively and there was no significant difference between the three hydrogeological subregions therefore the three hydrogeological subregions maybe have the same sources of no3 the mean Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values were close to the range reported for sewage and or manure Œ¥15n 4 25 Œ¥18o 10 10 liu et al 2013 xue et al 2009 and soil nitrogen Œ¥15n 3 9 Œ¥18o 10 10 jin et al 2015 kendall et al 2008 suggesting that the predominant sources of no3 were most likely to be sewage and manure indeed during the study we found that there are more than 20 villages and towns in the vht area which those villages have no network of sewage pipes and domestic sewage is directly discharged into the hutuo river in addition in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area because the majority of land is cultivated for agricultural use 38 62 the application of nitrogenous fertilizer is likely one of important sources of no3 in groundwater as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥18o values for 7 sites were close to the range reported for no3 fertilizer Œ¥18o 17 25 fang et al 2012 liu et al 2006 however the precipitation may have less impact for the groundwater nitrate of the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area which is primarily because the Œ¥18o values were lower than the range reported for precipitation Œ¥15n no3 13 to 13 Œ¥18o no3 25 to 75 fang et al 2012 in the surface water sampling sites r1 and r2 the concentration of no3 was lower r1 7 80 mg l and r2 10 48 mg l which is mainly because sites r1 and r2 were located upstream of the study regions the geographical position is higher than the surrounding area and there are protective walls around it and in water conservation regions therefore are less affected by human activities as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of site r1 are 13 17 and 24 74 and are not within the specific pollution sources range however the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of site r1 are close to the range reported for precipitation Œ¥15n no3 13 to 13 Œ¥18o no3 25 to 75 fang et al 2012 and for no3 from fertilizers Œ¥18o no3 17 to 25 xue et al 2009 therefore the no3 pollution sources of site r1 may be mainly derived from precipitation the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of r2 are 14 17 and 8 60 within the range reported for sewage and manure 4 to 25 xue et al 2009 indeed during the study period we found that village domestic sewage around site r2 was drained directly into nearby rivers 3 4 estimates of proportional contributions of the various sources of nitrate after determining the number and characteristics of the possible sources of no3 in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan by a dual isotope study of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 the proportional contributions of the various sources were assessed by using the siar model the siar model was applied to estimate the proportional contributions of five potential no3 sources no3 in precipitation no3 in fertilizer nh4 in fertilizer and rain soil n and sewage manure based on the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values obtained using groundwater samples from the three hydrogeological subregions vht upf and cpf the source contribution of the no3 in surface water was not analyzed by the siar model due to the lower sample numbers r1 and r2 and that the variation of the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values was bigger the five potential no3 source values were obtained from the literature reviewed in zhang et al 2015b we assumed that the fractionation factor was equal to 0 because denitrification did not occur in this region except g31 in which a slight denitrification might be occurring however this did not have a great impact on the isotope composition the siar output showed that the order of the contribution ratio for the five potential pollution sources of no3 was same in vht upf and cpf fig 7 the highest contribution of no3 in the vht 54 9 upf 55 0 and cpf 61 8 was sewage and or manure which was in accordance with the results obtained by using the stable isotope methods this was followed by soil n mean contributions 18 8 18 6 and 16 2 nh4 in fertilizer and rain mean contributions 13 3 13 6 and 11 6 no3 fertilizer mean contributions 9 4 9 6 and 7 8 and no3 in precipitation mean contributions 3 7 3 3 and 2 5 it is worth noting that the contribution ratio is higher in nh4 in fertilizer and rain than in no3 fertilizer which is mainly due to the direct input of no3 fertilizer being small because no3 fertilizers such as kno3 and nh4no3 are not commonly used 2 in china li et al 2010 overall the precipitation contribution was least for no3 in this study areas which is probably because the rainfall volume was less in the dry season january and the concentration of no3 in rain was very low based on monitoring 50 rainfall events in 2015 2016 the concentration of no3 in rain was 8 94 mg l ding et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b and the recharge sources were blocked by the building of two big reservoirs in the upper reaches of the study area and the concentration of the nh4 and no3 in rain is lower the mean concentration of nh4 and no3 was 7 8 and 11 3 mg l respectively for 20 rain events in 2015 the siar model should be considered as a fingerprint of potential no3 pollution sources as it could identify the dominant no3 sources and also reveal other potential no3 sources which could not be deduced from the bi plot approach xue et al 2012 in addition the siar model offers many advantages as it can incorporate sources of uncertainty and isotope fractionation matiatos 2016 however some factors could lead to uncertainty in the siar model in our study the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of the five potential nitrate sources were taken from the literature zhang et al 2015b and the value range of the precipitation and sewage and manure was relatively wide and showed an overlap with nh4 in fertilizer and rain soil n and manure and sewage and thus small variations in the isotope values of samples might result in large changes in source apportionment as estimated using siar 3 5 management implications nitrate pollution originates from multiple sources in the water environment via different pathways as point and diffuse sources nestler et al 2011 control of groundwater nitrate pollution is very difficult with a management strategy in this study we identify the five kinds of no3 sources in this region by combining the use of stable isotope techniques and an isotopic mixing model siar which could provide technical support for governmental agencies to implement an integrated regional management firstly because sewage and or manure were the primary sources of no3 the mean contribution ratio was 57 2 the local government must rebuild sewage pipelines for collecting domestic sewage and build waste storage tanks for collecting the manure and processing it in an appropriate manner secondly considering that the groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for no3 pollution thus the local government should develop strict laws to prohibit over exploitation of groundwater such as a change in the agricultural irrigation methods from the broad irrigation to drip or sprinkler irrigation in addition the main canal in the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china was completed and this project passes through the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan regions and therefore the governmental agencies could use this water resource to supply the groundwater of the study area in order to prevent the groundwater table continuing to decline finally the other important source of no3 was fertilizers the mean contribution ratio of the nh4 and no3 fertilizer accounted for 21 7 and thus government departments and research institutions should pay much attention to minimize the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and to improve nitrogen use efficiency 4 conclusions this study evaluated nitrate contamination in the overexploited groundwater region of north china we found that the concentrations of nh4 in the groundwater and surface water samples were below the detection limit and no2 was present in low concentration and showed no signification spatial variation however the mean concentrations of no3 in groundwater and surface water were 124 39 and 9 14 mg l there was approximately 74 19 of the groundwater sample in the upper and central pluvial fans of hutuo river regions exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l therefore human activity had dramatically impacted the groundwater quality in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan regions we identified the nitrogen transformation processes and the primary sources of no3 pollution in the overexploited groundwater region by using a water chemistry and stable isotope approach Œ¥d and Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 the results showed that the nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes in the overexploited groundwater region the groundwater nitrate mainly came from the nitrification of multiple nitrogen sources and the predominant sources of no3 were most likely to be sewage and manure in addition groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution a siar model was applied to identify the proportional contributions of five potential no3 sources at the groundwater sites the results showed that the highest contribution of no3 in the vht 54 9 upf 55 0 and cpf 61 8 was from sewage and manure followed by soil n mean contributions 18 8 18 6 and 16 2 nh4 in fertilizer and rain mean contributions were 13 3 13 6 and 11 6 no3 fertilizer mean contributions were 9 4 9 6 and 7 8 and no3 in precipitation mean contributions were 3 7 3 3 and 2 5 in summary domestic sewage is still the dominant contributor to nitrate pollution in overexploited groundwater regions in china the local government must strengthen sewage treatment for collecting domestic sewage in order to prevent contamination of groundwater by no3 in addition considering that the intensely exploited groundwater was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution the local government should develop strict laws to prohibit enterprises that over exploit groundwater adjust the agricultural irrigation methods and supply the groundwater of these areas acknowledgements this study has been funded by the natural science foundation of hebei province of china no d2015504008 the project of the financial allocation of

1628,nitrate contamination in groundwater has become an environmental problem of widespread concern in this study we used environmental isotopes Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 and an isotope mixing model siar to identify the main sources of nitrate pollution and factors controlling nitrate pollution and to quantify the relative contributions of potential no3 sources in an over exploited groundwater region north china the results showed that human activities had dramatically increased the mean concentration of groundwater no3 reaching 124 4 mg l in hutuo river pluvial fan region groundwater nitrate came from many kinds of pollution sources and the predominant sources were sewage and or manure nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes and groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution the highest contribution of groundwater no3 was sewage and or manure which the percent in the hutuo river valley plain unit upper pluvial fans of hutuo river and central pluvial fans of hutuo river was 54 9 55 0 and 61 8 respectively followed by soil n nh4 in fertilizer and rain no3 fertilizer and no3 in precipitation we suggested that the local government must strengthen the sewage treatment for the collection of domestic sewage and must prohibit over exploitation of groundwater in order to prevent no3 contamination of in groundwater keywords groundwater nitrate pollution sources over exploited groundwater region stable isotope siar mixing model 1 introduction groundwater nitrate pollution has become an environmental problem of widespread concern xue et al 2009 zhang et al 2015a high nitrate concentrations are mainly attributed to anthropogenic activities such as the excessive use of fertilizers and animal manures past√©n zapata et al 2014 and the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage matiatos 2016 in addition the elevated atmospheric n deposition is also a vital contamination source for water environments wakida and lerner 2005 groundwater is one of the most important water resources and is used for domestic consumption and agriculture irrigation excessively high levels of nitrate in drinking water can increase the risk of diseases such as methemoglobinemia or blue baby syndrome past√©n zapata et al 2014 spontaneous abortions and thyroid disorders yan et al 2014 in addition the export of nitrate into surface water may lead to many ecological and environmental problems including eutrophication and seasonal hypoxia li et al 2010 li et al 2013 as a result of these issues the world health organization who has set an upper limit of 50 mg l no3 for drinking water who 2011 an effective measure for controlling and managing nitrate pollution is to identify the sources of nitrate as different nitrate sources have distinct n and o isotope compositions nestler et al 2011 a dual isotope approach using both Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can provide useful information to trace the sources of no3 in water environment kim et al 2015 xue et al 2009 for example the Œ¥15n values of nitrate deposited via precipitation and sewage and manure range from 13 to 13 and from 4 to 25 respectively xue et al 2009 the Œ¥15n no3 values of chemical fertilizers range from 6 to 6 while Œ¥15n no3 values of soil nitrogen range from 3 to 9 jin et al 2015 kendall et al 2008 xiao and liu 2002 the Œ¥18o no3 can provide additional useful information because of the distinct isotopic characteristics the Œ¥18o no3 values of no3 from nitrification such as no3 from soil n nh4 in fertilizer and rain and sewage and manure fertilizers and precipitation range from 10 to 10 17 to 25 and 25 to 75 respectively fang et al 2012 liu et al 2006 saccon et al 2013 xue et al 2009 recently the dual Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 technique has been used successfully in many studies to identify the sources of no3 pollution in groundwater jin et al 2015 liu et al 2006 ma et al 2016 nitrogen transformations in the environment such as nitrification and denitrification can change the isotopic composition of nitrate due to physical chemical and biological fractionation processes ouml and berg 1997 nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite to nitrate by nitrifying bacteria during denitrification nitrate is reduced via nitrite nitric oxide and nitrous oxide to gaseous nitrogen by the enzymatic activity of denitrifying bacteria and generally occurs in anaerobic environments hedin et al 2008 nestler et al 2011 in general water nitrate comes from many sources therefore the quantification of the contribution ratio of different sources of no3 is important for helping to reduce the input of no3 into groundwater in recent years researchers have successfully quantified proportional contributions of the different no3 source in water using a bayesian isotopic mixing model stable isotope analysis in r or siar parnell et al 2010 zhang et al 2015b xue et al 2013 xue et al 2012 and gaouzi et al 2013 applied a bayesian isotopic mixing model to estimate the proportional apportionment of five different sources of no3 in rivers and kim et al 2015 and matiatos 2016 also applied this model to estimate the proportional apportionment of different sources of no3 in groundwater the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan is located in the western portion of the north china plain ncp ncp is the largest alluvial plain and one of the most densely populated regions of east asia groundwater in this region is the main source of industrial agricultural and drinking water and therefore directly influences daily life li et al 2016 in recent years as a result of rapid urbanization industrialization and population growth the influence of human activities on groundwater quality is becoming more and more serious in addition due to the over exploitation of groundwater the groundwater table has dropped rapidly and formed the cone of groundwater depression several studies have found that the shallow groundwater quality has deteriorated and the nitrate was the main pollution factor in this region li et al 2016 the objectives of this study are 1 to identify the mainly sources of no3 in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan of groundwater and surface water by using the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 method 2 to trace the main transformation of nitrogen 3 to quantify a proportional apportionment of different no3 sources by using a bayesian isotopic mixing model 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study area belongs to the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan shijiazhuang segment which is located in the piedmont of taihang mountain in southwestern hebei province china fig 1 the research region is nearly 2442 km2 and contains 5 5 million people it is under middle latitude continental semi humid monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 3 15 0 c and a mean annual precipitation of 400 750 mm which is mostly concentrated in june to august the aquifer is quaternary loose sediments and the lithology is primarily composed of gravel pebbles coarse sand and fine sand the types of groundwater in this area are fissure water and loose stratum pore water topographically high in the west and low in the east and the overall groundwater flow is from northwest to southeast the main recharge of groundwater is precipitation river and canal water infiltration and irrigation return etc the discharge mainly occurs by pumping over exploitation of groundwater results in the groundwater table lowering continuously forming a regional groundwater depression cone and reducing the exploitation volume of groundwater in a single well from 200 300 m3 h to 45 150 m3 h the well diameter is 10 15 cm according to the data provided by the water supply plant of shijiazhuang city li et al 2016 in this study we separated the aquifer into three hydrogeological subregions the hutuo river valley plain vht upper pluvial fans of hutuo river upf and central pluvial fans of hutuo river cpf 1 the vht are mainly distributed in the pingshan anticline metamorphic rock area this area belongs to the transitional zone between mountainous hills and plains including bedrock weathering fissure water and pore water which has small water volume and the thickness of aquifer is about 10 20 m the depth to water table is shallow generally about 2 21 m the hydraulic conductivity is well and the hydraulic connection with outside is closed which mainly supplied by precipitation 2 the upf is mainly sand gravel the thickness of the aquifer is about 20 35 m and the water conductivity and water yield property are good the upper first aquifer group has been basically drained and the second water group is the current exploitation aquifer 3 the groundwater depth is about 40 50 in cpf the thickness is nearly 25 60 m and the lithology of the aquifer is dominated by coarse sand with gravel sand gravel and medium sand the water conductivity and water yield property is both well the upper first and second aquifer groups have basically been drained currently the third and fourth water bearing groups are mainly exploited in recent years due to the rapid economic development land use types have changed greatly in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan region chaolin et al 2012 from 1995 to 2014 the cultivated land and forest land areas have been decreased from 5990 and 4620 km2 to 5287 and 3233 km2 respectively the city land area has been added from 85 to 264 km2 according to shijiazhuang statistical yearbook 1995 and 2014 nowadays the main land use types include cultivated land 38 62 wasteland including mountains and barren land 34 34 urban land 11 60 surface water 2 35 and countryside land 13 09 in addition results of different land use types in the three hydrogeological subregions have calculated in table 1 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study a total 33 samples groundwater samples 31 and surface water samples 2 were collected in january 2015 the 2 sites of the surface water r1 and r2 located near the outlet of two reservoirs the two reservoirs are located on the hutuo river channel and are concentrated water sources of surface water of shijiazhuang city and are mainly water sources of supply for groundwater in the study regions and sampling sites are located near the outlet of two reservoirs the well locations are shown in the land use map fig 1 all the wells chosen for groundwater sampling are commonly used for domestic and or agricultural purposes these wells have a mean depth of 82 4 m range 12 0 300 0 m and the mean depth of the groundwater table is 9 78 m range 4 0 50 0 m the conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do and ph were measured on site by using a wtw multi 340i set multiparameter instrument germany groundwater samples were extracted by pumping from the wells surface water samples were taken as a grab sample and the samples were collected at the depth of 50 cm below the water surface all samples were collected by using a high density polyethylene sampler filtered through 0 45 Œºm membranes and then stored in three 250 ml and one 4 l high density polyethylene sampling bottles for analyzing the main ion no3 no2 and nh4 and the isotopes Œ¥15n no3 Œ¥18o no3 and Œ¥18o h2o respectively the samples without preprocessing were used for anion and isotope analyses the samples used for cation were acidified with hcl to ph 2 the analysis of mn in the water samples was performed by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan while the analyses of ions i e nitrate no3 nitrite no2 ammonia nh4 were carried out by using spectrophotometry perkin elmer lambda 35 united states the no3 no2 nh4 and mn analyses were carried out at the groundwater mineral water and environmental monitoring center at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the ratios of isotopic n and o of no3 were determined using a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer with an online flash elemental analyzer in the research center for eco environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values were determined by ion exchange methods silva et al 2000 no3 was first collected on the ion exchange columns using an anion resin after which 15 ml of 3 m hcl were used to elute the no3 from the resins the so4 2 and po4 3 were removed by precipitation with excess bacl2 the sample was then passed through a cation exchange resin an excess of ag2o was used to remove the cl and neutralize the solution to achieve a ph of about 6 after which the agno3 solution was freeze dried for isotopic analysis the stable isotope ratios are expressed in delta Œ¥ units and as a per mil notation relative to an international standard 1 Œ¥ sam ple rsample rstandard 1 1000 where r sample and rstandard are the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratios of the samples and standards for Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o respectively the Œ¥15n values are reported relative to n2 in atmospheric air air and the Œ¥18o values are reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow zhang et al 2015b the ratios of isotopic o of h2o were determined using a finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer at the institute of hydrogeology and environmental geology chinese academy of geological sciences the isotope compositions were reported in standard Œ¥ notation represented as per mil deviation from the v smow vienna standard mean ocean water standard the precision of the Œ¥18o values is 0 2 2 3 multivariate data analysis the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and the nonparametric mann whitney u test was used to analyze the differences in groundwater no3 and no2 concentration and Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values in the three hydrogeological subregions and the rivers were evaluated using because the data failed to meet the assumption of normality for parametric statistical analyses the kruskal wallis test and mann whitney u test were performed using r software version 3 3 1 new zealand 2 4 bayesian isotopic mixing model the contributions of groundwater nitrate sources were quantified using the bayesian isotopic mixing model siar mixing model parnell et al 2010 the mixing model has been implemented using siar stable isotope analysis in r software package nowadays the siar mixing model has been successfully used to estimating multiple nitrate source contributions xue et al 2012 zhang et al 2015b a detailed description of this model can be found in parnell et al 2010 and jackson et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of water chemistry and nitrate isotope 3 1 1 water chemistry the ph ec and do values of the groundwater and surface water samples are listed in table 2 results showed that groundwater ph was neutral to mildly alkaline 7 10 7 92 and the mean value was 7 39 while river ph values ranged from 7 86 to 8 14 with a mean value of 8 00 surface water ph values were higher than groundwater ph values which may be due to the strong evaporation of the surface water and the vadose zone environment was beneficial to nitrification and the oxidation of mineral because of over exploitation of groundwater resulted in lowing ph of groundwater zhang et al 2017 ec values ranged from 233 to 3120 Œºs cm in groundwater and from 548 to 966 Œºs cm in surface water as shown in table 1 the groundwater do levels ranged from 4 36 to 10 85 mg l with a mean value of 6 82 mg l while surface water do levels ranged from 8 88 to 9 88 mg l and the mean value was 9 38 mg l the mean levels of do in surface water were higher than those in groundwater 3 1 2 the concentration of nitrogenous species the concentrations of nh4 in groundwater and surface water samples were below the detection limit bdl 0 04 mg l no2 was present in a low concentration and showed no signification spatial variation in the three hydrogeological subregions and the surface water p 05 by using the nonparametric kruskal wallis test and mann whitney u test the no2 concentrations varied from bdl 0 002 mg l to 0 021 mg l for the groundwater the mean values was 0 005 mg l and were bdl for the surface water the no3 concentrations varied from 1 64 to 509 0 mg l for the groundwater and were from 7 80 to 10 48 mg l for the surface water the mean concentration of groundwater and surface water was 124 4 and 9 14 mg l respectively there were 23 samples among the total analyzed groundwater samples n 31 that exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l thus the current groundwater nitrate contamination was very serious in the hutuo river pluvial fan as shown in fig 2 the no3 concentrations has a signification spatial variation in the three hydrogeological subregions and the surface water p 05 the mean no3 concentration was 229 1 mg l in the vht and significantly higher than in the upf cpf and the surface water due to the shallow groundwater table and the vadose zone comprises a coarse lithology with good permeability pollutants enter the aquifer easily the mean no3 concentration was 9 14 mg l in surface water and significantly lower than in the vht and upf which was mainly because sites r1 and r2 were located upstream of the study regions and was concentrated water source of surface water of shijiazhuang city the geographical position is higher than the surrounding area and there are protective walls around it therefore it was less affected by human activities meanwhile relative low agricultural nitrate source might be another reason for low nitrate in the surface water samples during the low flow season 3 1 3 nitrate isotope ratios the results of the stable isotope analysis are shown in fig 3 the range of measured Œ¥15n no3 values in the groundwater samples was between 4 79 and 16 03 with the mean values of 9 69 the range of measured Œ¥15n no3 values in the surface water samples was between 13 12 and 14 17 with the mean values of 13 65 the mean Œ¥15n no3 value in the surface water was significantly higher than in the groundwater vht 9 40 upf 9 30 and cpf 10 09 however the mean Œ¥15n no3 values were not significantly different between the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater the range of measured Œ¥18o no3 values in the groundwater was between 6 19 and 25 30 with the mean values of 11 86 and the range of measured Œ¥18o no3 values in the surface water samples was between 8 60 and 24 74 with the mean values of 16 67 there was no significantly difference in Œ¥18o no3 between the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater and surface water 3 2 nitrogen transformation processes 3 2 1 nitrification theoretically the Œ¥18o no3 values of nitrate produced by microbial nitrification could be calculated because approximately one third of the oxygen in no3 should be derived from oxygen in the air while two thirds should be derived from ambient water at the site of nitrate formation kendall 1998 li et al 2010 therefore the Œ¥18o no3 values produced by microbial nitrification could be calculated by using the measured Œ¥18o h2o table 3 of groundwater and assumed Œ¥18o o2 to be that of atmospheric o2 23 5 as indicated in fig 4 all the samples revealed that the Œ¥18o no3 values were higher than the theoretical values which may be caused by higher Œ¥18o h2o values due to the evaporation of soil water or it could be due to higher Œ¥18o values of the o2 caused by bacterial respiration kendall et al 2008 yue et al 2014 indeed the evaporation of soil water is very strong in the alluvial pluvial fan region because the deposit is mainly composed of coarse grained conglomerates and sands and therefore the soil moisture evaporates easily in addition in recent years the groundwater has been intensely exploited as a result of the rapid development of industry and agriculture in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan and recharge sources have been blocked by the construction of the two largely reservoir sites r1 and r2 in the upper part of the study area as a result the groundwater table has dropped rapidly and formed regional groundwater depression cones according to historical data between 1972 and 2000 the groundwater level depth has changed from 13 96 m to 35 54 m an average annual rate of decrease of 1 04 m a since 2005 the groundwater level has decreased slowly and it has been fluctuating between 42 and 43 m with the increasing of groundwater extraction the shallow groundwater table will continue decrease and the funnel area will reach 452 50 km2 by 2012 over exploitation of groundwater combined with a continually increasing thickness of the vadose zone has caused changes in both the hydrodynamic field and hydrogeochemical environment and has led to the formation of an artificially oxidizing environment li et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 therefore the vadose zone environment is beneficial to nitrification in this study region the Œ¥18o no3 values for most groundwater samples 97 and surface water site r2 were below those of precipitation from 25 to 75 and chemical fertilizers from 17 to 25 and the concentration of nh4 was below the detection limit bdl 0 04 mg l for all sampling sites therefore nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan region which suggests that the nitrate mainly came from the nitrification of multiple nitrogen sources including sewage and or manure soil nitrogen and ammonium fertilizer 3 2 2 denitrification another possible process causing significant alterations of the isotopic composition of no3 is microbial denitrification which occurs when oxygen is limited and organic carbon is available xue et al 2009 the combined use Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can also provide good constraints for the transformation processes of nitrate during transport for example Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 can provide clues about denitrification which causes the enrichment of Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o of the remaining nitrate in roughly a 1 3 2 1 1 ratio through kinetic isotopes effects johannsen et al 2008 liu et al 2013 researchers also found that the increasing Œ¥15n Œ¥18o values at a 1 2 1 ratio indicated denitrification processes particularly when the sample pool nitrate concentrations were decreasing lehmann et al 2003 ma et al 2016 in this study the denitrification may not be a signification process due to the aquifer system is in oxidized environment as shown in table 1 the high mean level of do is 6 82 mg l and the low mean concentration of mn is 8 Œºg l in the alluvial pluvial fan region in addition researchers found that the microbial denitrification could cause increases in Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of residual nitrate with decreasing no3 kendall 1998 liu et al 2013 and could cause a relationship between Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o in a ratio of 1 3 2 1 1 in the water environment liu et al 2013 xue et al 2009 yue et al 2014 as shown in fig 6 the ratios between Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o for 7 sites g5 g6 g13 g14 g23 g31 and r2 were in this scope however for sites g5 g6 g13 g14 and g23 the levels of do 4 21 6 93 mg l were higher than the most suitable levels 2 0 mg l of denitrification xue et al 2012 and the concentration of no3 69 50 390 00 mg l were very high therefore denitrification may not occur in these sites site r2 was concentrated water source of surface water in shijiazhuang city there are protective walls around it it was less affected by human activities therefore the concentration of no3 was lower 10 48 mg l so site 2 may not occur denitrification for sites g31 the concentrations of do was 6 89 however the concentration of no3 1 64 mg l was lower desimone and howes 1998 found that slight denitrification could occur when the concentration of groundwater do was in the range 2 6 mg l therefore we thought that sites g31 may have a slight denitrification however the denitrification did not have a great impact on the isotope composition of no3 for this site as indicated by fig 5 there was no correlation between the no3 and do concentration and the Œ¥15n no3 values in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan expressed by a regression line of y 12 12 241 8 r2 0 03 and y 0 22 9 28 r2 0 06 respectively the relationship suggested that denitrification did not have a great impact on the isotope composition of no3 in hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan 3 3 identification of no3 sources using stable isotope methodology the no3 in groundwater could derive from various sources mainly including no3 in precipitation np no3 fertilizer nf nh4 in fertilizer and rain nfar soil n sn and sewage and manure sam kendall 1998 xue et al 2009 a dual isotope approach Œ¥15n no3 versus Œ¥18o no3 was used to identify no3 sources in the three hydrogeological subregions of groundwater and the river water as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of most sampling sites did not fall into the scope of a specific pollution source therefore the nitrate may come from many kinds of pollution sources in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area such as no3 fertilizer soil n and manure and or sewage etc in the groundwater sampling sites the mean Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values of the three hydrogeological subregions vht upf and cpf were 9 40 and 11 26 9 30 and 11 92 10 09 and 11 37 respectively and there was no significant difference between the three hydrogeological subregions therefore the three hydrogeological subregions maybe have the same sources of no3 the mean Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values were close to the range reported for sewage and or manure Œ¥15n 4 25 Œ¥18o 10 10 liu et al 2013 xue et al 2009 and soil nitrogen Œ¥15n 3 9 Œ¥18o 10 10 jin et al 2015 kendall et al 2008 suggesting that the predominant sources of no3 were most likely to be sewage and manure indeed during the study we found that there are more than 20 villages and towns in the vht area which those villages have no network of sewage pipes and domestic sewage is directly discharged into the hutuo river in addition in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area because the majority of land is cultivated for agricultural use 38 62 the application of nitrogenous fertilizer is likely one of important sources of no3 in groundwater as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥18o values for 7 sites were close to the range reported for no3 fertilizer Œ¥18o 17 25 fang et al 2012 liu et al 2006 however the precipitation may have less impact for the groundwater nitrate of the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan area which is primarily because the Œ¥18o values were lower than the range reported for precipitation Œ¥15n no3 13 to 13 Œ¥18o no3 25 to 75 fang et al 2012 in the surface water sampling sites r1 and r2 the concentration of no3 was lower r1 7 80 mg l and r2 10 48 mg l which is mainly because sites r1 and r2 were located upstream of the study regions the geographical position is higher than the surrounding area and there are protective walls around it and in water conservation regions therefore are less affected by human activities as shown in fig 6 the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of site r1 are 13 17 and 24 74 and are not within the specific pollution sources range however the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of site r1 are close to the range reported for precipitation Œ¥15n no3 13 to 13 Œ¥18o no3 25 to 75 fang et al 2012 and for no3 from fertilizers Œ¥18o no3 17 to 25 xue et al 2009 therefore the no3 pollution sources of site r1 may be mainly derived from precipitation the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of r2 are 14 17 and 8 60 within the range reported for sewage and manure 4 to 25 xue et al 2009 indeed during the study period we found that village domestic sewage around site r2 was drained directly into nearby rivers 3 4 estimates of proportional contributions of the various sources of nitrate after determining the number and characteristics of the possible sources of no3 in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan by a dual isotope study of Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 the proportional contributions of the various sources were assessed by using the siar model the siar model was applied to estimate the proportional contributions of five potential no3 sources no3 in precipitation no3 in fertilizer nh4 in fertilizer and rain soil n and sewage manure based on the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 values obtained using groundwater samples from the three hydrogeological subregions vht upf and cpf the source contribution of the no3 in surface water was not analyzed by the siar model due to the lower sample numbers r1 and r2 and that the variation of the Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o values was bigger the five potential no3 source values were obtained from the literature reviewed in zhang et al 2015b we assumed that the fractionation factor was equal to 0 because denitrification did not occur in this region except g31 in which a slight denitrification might be occurring however this did not have a great impact on the isotope composition the siar output showed that the order of the contribution ratio for the five potential pollution sources of no3 was same in vht upf and cpf fig 7 the highest contribution of no3 in the vht 54 9 upf 55 0 and cpf 61 8 was sewage and or manure which was in accordance with the results obtained by using the stable isotope methods this was followed by soil n mean contributions 18 8 18 6 and 16 2 nh4 in fertilizer and rain mean contributions 13 3 13 6 and 11 6 no3 fertilizer mean contributions 9 4 9 6 and 7 8 and no3 in precipitation mean contributions 3 7 3 3 and 2 5 it is worth noting that the contribution ratio is higher in nh4 in fertilizer and rain than in no3 fertilizer which is mainly due to the direct input of no3 fertilizer being small because no3 fertilizers such as kno3 and nh4no3 are not commonly used 2 in china li et al 2010 overall the precipitation contribution was least for no3 in this study areas which is probably because the rainfall volume was less in the dry season january and the concentration of no3 in rain was very low based on monitoring 50 rainfall events in 2015 2016 the concentration of no3 in rain was 8 94 mg l ding et al 2014 zhang et al 2015b and the recharge sources were blocked by the building of two big reservoirs in the upper reaches of the study area and the concentration of the nh4 and no3 in rain is lower the mean concentration of nh4 and no3 was 7 8 and 11 3 mg l respectively for 20 rain events in 2015 the siar model should be considered as a fingerprint of potential no3 pollution sources as it could identify the dominant no3 sources and also reveal other potential no3 sources which could not be deduced from the bi plot approach xue et al 2012 in addition the siar model offers many advantages as it can incorporate sources of uncertainty and isotope fractionation matiatos 2016 however some factors could lead to uncertainty in the siar model in our study the Œ¥15n no3 and Œ¥18o no3 values of the five potential nitrate sources were taken from the literature zhang et al 2015b and the value range of the precipitation and sewage and manure was relatively wide and showed an overlap with nh4 in fertilizer and rain soil n and manure and sewage and thus small variations in the isotope values of samples might result in large changes in source apportionment as estimated using siar 3 5 management implications nitrate pollution originates from multiple sources in the water environment via different pathways as point and diffuse sources nestler et al 2011 control of groundwater nitrate pollution is very difficult with a management strategy in this study we identify the five kinds of no3 sources in this region by combining the use of stable isotope techniques and an isotopic mixing model siar which could provide technical support for governmental agencies to implement an integrated regional management firstly because sewage and or manure were the primary sources of no3 the mean contribution ratio was 57 2 the local government must rebuild sewage pipelines for collecting domestic sewage and build waste storage tanks for collecting the manure and processing it in an appropriate manner secondly considering that the groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for no3 pollution thus the local government should develop strict laws to prohibit over exploitation of groundwater such as a change in the agricultural irrigation methods from the broad irrigation to drip or sprinkler irrigation in addition the main canal in the middle route of the south to north water diversion project in china was completed and this project passes through the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan regions and therefore the governmental agencies could use this water resource to supply the groundwater of the study area in order to prevent the groundwater table continuing to decline finally the other important source of no3 was fertilizers the mean contribution ratio of the nh4 and no3 fertilizer accounted for 21 7 and thus government departments and research institutions should pay much attention to minimize the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and to improve nitrogen use efficiency 4 conclusions this study evaluated nitrate contamination in the overexploited groundwater region of north china we found that the concentrations of nh4 in the groundwater and surface water samples were below the detection limit and no2 was present in low concentration and showed no signification spatial variation however the mean concentrations of no3 in groundwater and surface water were 124 39 and 9 14 mg l there was approximately 74 19 of the groundwater sample in the upper and central pluvial fans of hutuo river regions exceeded the world health organization limit of 50 mg l therefore human activity had dramatically impacted the groundwater quality in the hutuo river alluvial pluvial fan regions we identified the nitrogen transformation processes and the primary sources of no3 pollution in the overexploited groundwater region by using a water chemistry and stable isotope approach Œ¥d and Œ¥18o h2o Œ¥15n and Œ¥18o no3 the results showed that the nitrification might be one of the most important nitrogen transformation processes in the overexploited groundwater region the groundwater nitrate mainly came from the nitrification of multiple nitrogen sources and the predominant sources of no3 were most likely to be sewage and manure in addition groundwater intensely exploited was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution a siar model was applied to identify the proportional contributions of five potential no3 sources at the groundwater sites the results showed that the highest contribution of no3 in the vht 54 9 upf 55 0 and cpf 61 8 was from sewage and manure followed by soil n mean contributions 18 8 18 6 and 16 2 nh4 in fertilizer and rain mean contributions were 13 3 13 6 and 11 6 no3 fertilizer mean contributions were 9 4 9 6 and 7 8 and no3 in precipitation mean contributions were 3 7 3 3 and 2 5 in summary domestic sewage is still the dominant contributor to nitrate pollution in overexploited groundwater regions in china the local government must strengthen sewage treatment for collecting domestic sewage in order to prevent contamination of groundwater by no3 in addition considering that the intensely exploited groundwater was a major inducing factor for the no3 pollution the local government should develop strict laws to prohibit enterprises that over exploit groundwater adjust the agricultural irrigation methods and

1629,shallow groundwater in alluvial plains is vulnerable to contamination due to infiltration of pollutants from anthropogenic activities in the alluvial plain of the yangtze river near poyang lake a silicone monomer industrial park was found to discharge undisclosed amount of effluents containing high levels of hydrochloric acid and total dissolved solids into ponds and ditches that in turn displayed characteristics of acidic water with high total dissolved solids however most shallow groundwater n 35 depth 5 5 22 m collected from the alluvial aquifer downgradient of the industrial park contained low cl 59 mg l only 4 groundwater samples showed high cl 59 790 mg l with two containing superlative levels 449 mg l and 790 mg l located within a 50 m distance from the polluted ponds and ditches in addition to hydrochemical data modeling was used to explain why a highly vulnerable alluvial aquifer was not more contaminated when subjected to such intense point source pollution and to estimate the effluent discharge flow and solute transport modeling suggests that a hydrological buffering mechanism resulting from a topography driven groundwater outflow along the boundary between the pleistocene qpw and the holocene qhl aquifers where the polluted ponds and ditches are fortuitously located has restricted acid infiltration with only a few percent of the estimated acid discharge in the amount of 1700 4200 tons per year entering the aquifer our model results show that pumping from the upland qpw aquifer breaks this hydrological buffering much more easily than pumping from the downgradient qhl aquifer suggesting the vulnerability of this buffering mechanism thus compromising groundwater utilization in the future keywords alluvial plain aquifer groundwater acidification hydrological buffering chloride poyang lake 1 introduction point source pollution such as untreated or inadequately treated industrial discharge and landfill leachate often causes groundwater quality to deteriorate henry 1988 however the degree of contamination by point source pollutants depends on the hydrogeological condition of the site and the chemical characteristics of the contaminants net

alluvial groundwater aquifer receives highly acidic industrial effluents xu and wang 2016 although surface water exhibited chemical characteristic with low ph and high tds suggesting pollution from effluents only 4 alluvial groundwater samples in the close vicinity of the point sources showed signs of pollution the limited extent of groundwater pollution is unexpected because the highly permeable alluvial aquifer with shallow water table is commonly known as being vulnerable to point source contamination ahmed et al 2010 el alfy 2010 halfman et al 1991 nalbantcilar et al 2009 subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2014 surveys of shallow groundwater quality in poyang lake catchment also showed characteristics of non point source contamination such as no3 from agriculture with more than half of the groundwater bodies around poyang lake containing 4 4 mg l of no3 the presumed background concentration of nitrate in the local groundwater system hu 2013 and about 20 of the local groundwater exceeding the drinking water standards of the world health organization 50 mg l soldatova et al 2014 acidification ph 5 as well as so4 2 and cl contaminations were also found in industrial and mining areas close to the poyang lake hu et al 2013 yang 2012 this study aims to explain the reasons why the shallow groundwater aquifer system near the poyang lake shows a high level of resistance to a point source contamination limiting the spatial spread of the contaminant plume to a relatively small extent additional sampling hydrochemical and stable isotopic analyses of effluent n 2 surface water n 9 and groundwater n 39 in the study area vulnerable to contamination were obtained to assess the extent of groundwater contamination and to understand the resultant hydrochemical evolution a groundwater flow model was constructed to investigate how groundwater flow regulates the spatial distribution of contaminants and acts as a hydrological buffer the solute transport model results were utilized to estimate the industrial discharge from unknown sources as well as to reconstruct the pollution history the observed data and modeling results allowed for projections of the extent of groundwater pollution under different water use scenarios implications for the local water management are also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in jiangxi province to the west of poyang lake the largest fresh water lake in china s lower yangtze river region with significant ecosystem values zhang et al 2014 it is characterized by a subtropical monsoonal climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 0 c an annual mean precipitation of 1428 7 mm and a potential evaporation of 1386 4 mm flowing through the study area from the southwest to the northeast is the yangliujin river fig 1a a branch of the xiu river that eventually flows into the poyang lake to the east the regional groundwater flow path is from the northwest to the southeast fig s1a the seasonal ranges of the hydraulic heads obtained from 13 local observation wells range from 0 41 m to 2 1 m table s1 fig s2a the study area is a part of a thin alluvial plain of quaternary deposits with the thickness of the pleistocene and the holocene deposits 30 m in most places in a complex and interbedded sequence of sand clay silt and gravel hu et al 2013 zeng et al 1990 jiangxi provincial bureau of geology and mineral resources 1984 the quaternary pleistocene deposits of the wangchenggang formation qpw in the study area are eluvial with a thickness of 9 20 m while the quaternary holocene deposits the lianxu formation qhl are alluvial with a thickness of 16 22 m underneath the alluvium is a sandstone formation the qpw stratum has a higher average elevation with an average slope of about 0 01 from the northwest to the southeast fig s1a the holocene deposits qhl are from the less elevated areas with a flat topography there is a sudden change of topography at the boundary between the qpw and qhl strata fig s1a based on the lithology the study site is divided into 6 hydrogeological units fig 1b the hydraulic conductivity of each unit table 1 was estimated from sediment core data and pumping tests conducted in boreholes b1 b15 obtained by the groundwater and soil contamination survey of huadong region unpublished 2 1 2 pollutants from industrial activities since the 1990s the poyang lake region has witnessed a growth of the organosilicon industry including an industrial park built in the upland portion of the study area the industrial park produces 250 000 300 000 tons of silicone monomers annually after an expansion in 2008 which has been estimated to generate 9300 to 23 000 tons of 19 wt hcl discharge equivalent to 1700 to 4300 tons of cl zhang 2003 li 2008 three discharge outfalls e1 e2 and e3 in fig 1a were identified by our investigation with potentially more unknown outfalls outfalls e1 and e2 discharged into a natural un lined ditch connected to two small ponds p1 and p2 at either end the ditch and the connected ponds were located right along the boundary of the qpw and qhl deposits where artesian or semi artesian zones were observed xu and wang 2016 2 2 sample collection and field analysis procedures in june 2015 39 groundwater samples fig 1a were collected from 15 boreholes b1 b15 and 24 dug wells w1 w24 this sampling expanded a prior sampling campaign of 13 boreholes and 13 dug wells in june 2014 that provided the preliminary evidence for the limited spatial extent of groundwater pollution xu and wang 2016 the depths of the boreholes and the dug wells ranged from 5 5 to 22 m the screened intervals of the boreholes were usually at the depths of 6 10 m below the ground level before sampling the boreholes and the dug wells were primed with a portable submersible pump at a flow rate of 25 l min usually for 15 min until the electrical conductivity ec and the ph reached stable readings monitored using a multi probe meas eureka manta 2 various surface water samples were also collected fig 1a river water sample r1 was collected from the yangliujin river adding to the three river water samples r2 r3 and r4 collected in our previous study xu and wang 2016 two industrial effluents e2 and e3 were also sampled fig 1a although industrial effluent discharge point e1 was not accessible two water samples d1 and d2 were collected 750 m apart from each other in the ditch receiving the industrial effluents additionally three pond water samples p1 p2 and p3 were obtained from the ponds 1 2 and 3 respectively ponds 1 and 2 were connected to the southwest and the northeast ends of the ditch respectively pond 3 is a pond northeast of the ditch all water samples were collected into high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after filtration 0 45 Œºm samples for cations and nitrate ammonia nitrogen analyses were acidified with hno3 and h2so4 respectively in the field water samples for Œ¥d and Œ¥18o analyses were collected in hdpe bottles with no headspace all samples were brought back to the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology at the china university of geosciences beijing and stored at 4 c before analysis 2 3 chemical and stable isotope analysis the major cations ca2 mg2 k and na were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy spectro blue 201300x1 with the limit of detection lod of 0 1 mg l the major anions cl and so4 2 were measured by ion chromatography dx 120 with an lod of 0 2 mg l the concentrations of nh4 and no3 were measured by a spectrophotometer uv1800 with an lod of 0 2 mg l alkalinity as carbonate alkalinity was obtained by titration carbonate species co2 aq hco3 and co3 2 as well as total inorganic carbon tic saturation index si of calcite and dolomite were calculated using phreeqc version 3 using the measured ph and alkalinity values because the temperatures of groundwater obtained in the field were all within 25 1 c the temperature used to calculate the si was set at 25 c for simplicity tds was calculated from measured major constituents k na ca2 mg2 nh4 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 tables s2 and s3 charge balances of cations and anions show errors usually within 10 deuterium Œ¥d and oxygen Œ¥18o isotopes were measured with lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia v2 dlt 100 the precision is 0 1 for 18o 16o and 0 3 for d h the isotopic results were given in Œ¥ unit relative to vsmow tables s2 and s3 statistical analysis of hydrochemical data was done using ibm spss statistics 22 2 4 numerical modeling 2 4 1 steady state flow model a three dimensional 3d groundwater steady state flow model was first constructed using the modflow code harbaugh et al 2000 the model consisted of 200 rows and 200 columns spanning an area of 13 7 km2 dotted box in fig 1a vertically the model is represented by a three layer aquifer system fig 1b and table 1 mawan lake in the elevated areas to the northwest was treated as a recharge source and assigned a constant head of 44 m as boundary 1 fig 1a and fig s1 yangliujin river in the low lying area to the southeast and its tributary to the northeast were assigned specific heads based on linear interpolation of the observed river levels ranging from 17 m in the northeast to 20 m in the southwest boundary 2 the west and the north ridges of the topographic high points were set as no flow boundaries boundaries 4 and 5 the ditch and the ponds receiving industrial effluents as boundary 3 were assigned specific heads based on average hydraulic heads 20 24 m along the ditch and the ponds observed in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig s1a these areas of ditch and ponds were not treated as effluent recharge areas alone because groundwater in the vicinity has displayed semi artesian behavior suggesting a possibility of active two way exchanges between the ditch ponds and the underlying aquifers a vertical recharge rate of 140 mm year is applied to the top cells of the modeling domain this recharge rate is estimated using the empirical equation r p Œ± p where r p is the recharge rate of precipitation infiltration mm year p is the annual precipitation rate 1428 7 mm year Œ± 10 is the precipitation infiltration recharge coefficient related to aquifer lithology groundwater depth micro topography as well as precipitation intensity gau and liu 2000 lu 2006 zhang and li 2009 xue et al 2008 this estimated rate is comparable to another recharge estimate of 98 173 mm year for alluvial groundwater in the larger poyang lake catchment water resources bulletin of jiangxi province in 2010 2015 because groundwater discharges primarily through evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration evt package is applied to the top cells of the model domain data input included surface water evaporation rate 1386 4 mm year and et extinction depth 2 3 m considering the local hydrogeological setting banta 2000 xu and chen 2005 renger and wessolek 2010 the steady state flow model was calibrated using average hydraulic heads of nov 2013 aug 2014 and june 2015 fig s1a from 23 observation wells after calibration the root mean square error rmse of the hydraulic head was 0 23 m which represented approximately 2 4 of the accumulated head errors for a total of 23 observations absolute value of 9 7 m and was judged acceptable fig s2 horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x horizontal anisotropy k y k x and vertical anisotropy k z k v of six zones were adjusted from the estimated ranges based on field pumping tests to the best fit table 1 calibrated horizontal anisotropy values were 0 8 0 9 while vertical anisotropy values ranged from 8 to 10 2 4 2 solute transport model a solute transport model for chloride was constructed using mt3dms code zheng 1999 in gms 7 1 to evaluate the impact of the industrial effluent discharge on groundwater quality the solute transport model included advection and dispersion but not diffusion at the microscales chloride was considered conservative due to its largely non reactive nature the groundwater wells available for sampling were few and unevenly distributed in the study area fig 1a thus not ideal to reveal the initial spatial distribution of cl however cl concentration observed in the upland study area is generally low ranging from 1 4 to 10 2 mg l n 5 comparable with the low value of cl about 1 mg l in shallow alluvial groundwater in the poyang lake area zeng et al 1990 in the solute transport model the initial concentration for cl was thus set at 0 mg l and not the interpolated cl concentrations due to difficulty in discerning the true uncontaminated cl level nevertheless when the interpolated cl concentrations from low cl groundwater 58 6 mg l details of classification in section 3 2 were used as the initial condition in the model similar results were obtained fig s3 the solute transport models were set as 20 years considering the history of the local silicon production started in the late 1990s the solute transport modeling simulated the impact of industrial outfalls e1 and e2 only fig s1b tracking the contaminant plume migrating from boundary 3 fig s1b the source loading for cl was simulated by assigning an elevated value to cells where the specific head boundary was used for the ditches ponds portion of the modeling domain part of boundary 3 24 cells fig s1b since we were unable to obtain a water sample from e1 the cl value 2000 mg l of pond water p1 receiving effluent from e1 was used as one of the initial concentrations considering that p1 water was probably diluted by the discharging low chloride groundwater the actual chloride mass loading of effluents might have been higher therefore a range of cl concentrations of effluents were tested to determine this initial cl loading by comparing the calculated mass in the simulated cl plume with that in the interpolated cl plume the reasons to simulate solute transport from e1 and e2 only are as follows first the industrial outfall e3 has been shut down since the end of 2015 and is thus probably no longer a source of pollution second it allows us to focus on the two main effluent discharge sources and how they affect the most highly contaminated part of the aquifer a limitation of this approach is that historical pollution from e3 is not considered and hence both the spatial pattern and mass accumulation of cl may be underestimated in the eastern part of the study area we estimated the cl mass loading of effluents through solute transport modeling to compare to the observed cl mass loading in the aquifer as a way to validate our models and to constrain the effluent loading cl concentration as well as the pollution history to calculate total cl mass in the plume from observation interpolated cl values were obtained by a log normal inverse distance weighting idm method with gradient hyperplane nodal functions gms 7 1 3d scatter data interpolation idw has been extensively used as a three dimensional interpolation method in groundwater contamination investigations mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 the gradients of topography were estimated in gms based on the geological data as in the flow model as well as the basic grids and nodes conditions 58 132 cells and 81 892 nodes concentrations of cl of 35 groundwater samples with known well depths were used for this interpolation in addition cl concentrations of the ditch water and pond water samples in the artesian area d1 d2 p1and p2 were also used with a depth of 0 m sensitivity tests have been performed on effective porosity n range 0 35 to 0 55 and longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l range 1 to 10 m the former affects the rate of solute transport while the later affects the shape of contamination plume the range of n values were based on what was typical for unconfined or poorly confined alluvial sediment aquifers with unsorted sand and loam ahuja et al 1989 fallico 2014 niwas and celik 2012 while the range of Œ± l was estimated using the empirical power law Œ± l c l m accounting for unconsolidated sediment with sand silt and clay c 0 02 0 05 and flow scales l 800 m davis 1986 schulze makuch 2005 transverse dispersivity Œ± t was an order of magnitude smaller than longitudinal dispersivity delgado 2007 the effective diffusion coefficient d d was estimated as 3 10 6 4 10 6 cm2 s using equation d d Œºndd greenkorn 1983 Œº ranged from 0 25 to 0 5 estimated based on porosity greenkorn 1983 n is porosity and d d is the bulk diffusion coefficient set as 2 03 10 7 cm2 s for cl domenico and schwartz 1998 the parameters used in solute transport modeling n Œ± l Œ± t and d d were shown in table 1 2 4 3 transient state flow model transient state flow modeling was performed to evaluate the impacts of two hypothetical pumping scenarios in the upland qpw aquifer and the downgradient qhl aquifer respectively results from the calibrated steady state flow model were used to provide the initial condition for the transient flow model in the 7th year pumping was allowed to begin from the 7th year of the modeled 20 year stress period a range of pumping rates of 400 800 and 1000 t d were examined in both upland and downgradient pumping scenarios and assigned to a group of 4 pumping wells fig s4 these pumping rates were chosen based on local well yield calculated using depuit equation rosenshein 1984 unpublished pumping test results from boreholes b1 b15 obtained by the groundwater and soil contamination survey of huadong region suggest that the well yield is 200 250 tons d another assessment determined the yield to be 120 286 tons d for the qpw aquifer and up to 700 tons d in the most productive qhl aquifer environmental geological survey of jiangxi province 1982 finally to the northwest of the study area lays a permian karst aquifer where groundwater storage is abundant with a well yield over 550 tons d and up to 1900 tons d environmental geological survey in jiujiang city therefore it is likely that water can be brought in from boundary 1 at these hypothetical pumping rates although the long term consequences would need to be assessed by a regional groundwater study these wells were put in 4 neighboring cells and assumed to be complete wells with a full screen of in situ aquifer thickness 17 m in upland pumping wells and 20 m in lowland pumping wells in both upland and downgradient pumping scenarios the pumping wells were set at equal distance from boundary 3 effluent ditch and ponds instead of specific heads the upland lake boundary 1 downstream river and its tributary boundary 2 as well as the effluent discharge area boundary 3 were set to a general head boundary condition to allow examining the influence of pumping and was given the initial head values from the steady state flow model output this boundary condition was also constrained by the conductance of the aquifer c arc conductance per unit length m2 d m which can be estimated based on the formula c arc wk v m accounting for the calibrated results of vertical hydraulic conductivity of underlying sediments k v 0 1 0 5 m d estimated thickness of sediments m 0 5 4 m and width w approximate 80 m 70 250 m 1 5 4 m separately for boundary 1 2 and 3 the conductance c arc for boundary 1 upland lake 10 20 m2 d m boundary 2 downstream river 2 5 10 m2 d m and boundary 3 ditch area 0 4 1 5 m2 d m was calibrated using data from 23 observational wells assuming they also represented the flow pattern in the 7th year of the transient flow modeling period as well as the flow at each boundary the rmse of the data from the 23 observation wells was 0 50 m when compared with the groundwater table in the 7th year of the transient flow modeling which was greater than the rmse 0 23 m calibrated in the steady flow model solute transport simulations for two pumping scenarios were also obtained with assumed 3600 mg l of cl loading from e1 effluents 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of effluent and polluted surface water there were significant anomalies in ph cl major cations k na ca2 and mg2 in the effluent and polluted surface water collected from the ditches and ponds compared to river water table 2 all four river water samples were slightly alkaline ph 7 with very low tds content as well as cl and major cation concentrations table 2 with the upstream river sample r1 showing the lowest values of both cl and tds the industrial park draws water from the river thus the anomalies in the effluent and effluent impacted ditches and ponds reflect pollution access to the industrial park s effluent discharge points was limited so only two locations were sampled nevertheless the effluents collected from e2 and e3 displayed high tds with hundreds of mg l cl although the waters were only slightly acidic ph 6 table 2 sampling of e2 in 2014 xu and wang 2016 found concentrations of cl na and ca2 to be lower compared to the values in 2015 by one half 327 9 mg l one third 52 3 mg l and one half 63 9 mg l respectively table 2 yet a much more acidic ph of 3 8 was measured this suggests that before our 2015 sampling took place soda lime a mixture of ca oh 2 and naoh may have been used to neutralize the effluent before its discharge these data show that the effluent is cl rich and sometimes with significant acidity the data gathered showed that ponds and ditches receiving effluents all displayed hydrochemical characteristics suggesting pollution although the extent varied p1 and d1 located near effluent e1 showed the lowest ph value of 3 6 the highest cl 2000 mg l as well as the highest tds 3100 mg l these features illustrated the possibility of a prominent contaminant source from e1 although this cannot be ascertained because access to e1 was not provided for in comparison p2 and d2 located closer to effluent e2 showed a slightly acidic ph value of about 6 and 10 times lower cl concentrations 183 mg l and 112 mg l respectively and tds levels 297 and 189 mg l respectively than those of p1 and d1 interestingly despite being located about 700 m up gradient from the e1 and e2 effluent impacted ditch pond area fig 1a pond p3 displayed similar hydrochemical characteristics to p2 and d2 with cl of 247 mg l of cl 416 mg l of tds albeit a lower ph of 4 1 there was no visible connection between p3 and industrial outfalls e1 e2 and e3 suggesting there might be additional industrial outfalls that discharged to p3 4 hydrochemical evidence for limited groundwater pollution because cl is highly elevated in industrial effluents and is mostly chemically conservative in groundwater it is used as a tracer to delineate acid pollution from the industrial park discharge the median value 18 0 mg l and interquartile range 21 0 mg l iqr the difference between the 75th and the 25th quantiles of cl concentrations of groundwater samples were used to classify groundwater into low cl and high cl groups table 3 the high cl group consisted of 4 samples b4 b6 w4 and w10 only and displayed 58 6 mg l of cl or the 75th percentile value plus 1 5 times the iqr john et al 2014 uddameri et al 2013 b4 and b6 fig 1a two of the 4 high cl groundwater samples contained superlative cl of 449 mg l and 790 mg l respectively table 2 there is little doubt that b4 and b6 have been impacted by industrial effluents although the case for w10 and w4 with 130 mg l and 66 mg l of cl respectively are less obvious based on the cl evidence alone the low cl group n 35 displayed an average cl of 16 6 mg l an average tds of 168 5 mg l with ph values ranging from 5 5 to 7 6 even if all 4 groundwater samples with anomalously high cl are interpreted as representing pollution the spatial extent of the plume is limited b4 and b6 are located within 50 m of the ditches d1 and d2 w10 is about 200 m northeast of d1 and d2 and 450 m down gradient from p3 w4 is located 750 m further downgradient from w10 fig 1a these hydrochemical anomalies were also evident in a transect along the groundwater flow path fig 1a b b when compared to hydrochemical data of 35 groundwater samples fig 2 b4 and b6 had lower ph and higher cl tds and ca2 values but not very different alkalinity compared to ambient groundwater samples from similar depths and distances from upland the signals at w4 and w10 were less distinguishable from the ambient groundwater fig 2 4 1 acidification of groundwater and carbonate mineral buffering the upland qpw aquifer has the freshest groundwater w20 w24 n 5 average tds 33 1 mg l and belonged to the low cl group cl 1 4 10 2 mg l the average ph value of these groundwater was 5 89 comparable to an average ph value of 5 98 obtained from shallow groundwater surveys n 21 in the entire poyang lake catchment of 14 500 km2 yang 2012 the slight acidity has been attributed to acid rain hu 2013 the qpw aquifer is likely to be carbonate mineral poor because all five upland groundwater samples are significantly under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 3c fortunately the upland qpw aquifer does not appear to have been influenced by the acid discharge from the industrial park fig 3b because it would have lacked much carbonate mineral buffering capacity if acids infiltrated the high cl groundwater pond and ditch waters reflect mixing between concentrated acid effluent and ambient lowland qhl aquifer water as evidenced by the linear correlations between tds and cl fig 3a and between ph and log cl fig 3b the most concentrated acid effluent is likely to have been discharged from e1 for which a sample could not be obtained although we can make an educated guess that it is likely to be even more concentrated than waters from d1 and p1 fig 3a the negative slope of 1 between ph and log cl n 45 excluding 5 upland qpw groundwater samples r2 0 67 fig 3b suggests that the ph variations spanning more than three orders of magnitude i e from 7 to 4 is caused by acidification due to hcl discharge and infiltration compared to the upland qpw low cl groundwater that are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the lowland ambient qhl groundwater from boreholes near the ditch with low cl average 5 57 mg l n 7 grouped in an oval in fig 3c however are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite these boreholes near the ditch contained about an order of magnitude higher dic fig 3d and 13 times more ca2 than those of the upland qpw low cl groundwater suggesting dissolution of carbonate minerals that resulted in an average ph value of 7 3 the two highly contaminated samples b4 and b6 are also located near the ditch and display similar dic concentrations as these aforementioned ambient low cl groundwater grouped in an oval fig 3d due to the amount of protons introduced at b4 and b6 the aqueous carbonic acid equilibrium has shifted from bicarbonate dominant to co2 aq dominant with 87 of dic being co2 aq in both samples and nearly negligible carbonate ion therefore calcite and dolomite are under saturated at b4 and b6 large solid circles in fig 3c the under saturation with respect to calcite dolomite and comparable dic concentrations with the ambient low cl groundwater nearby suggest that the carbonate mineral buffering has reached its limit there are now probably no more carbonate minerals left in the aquifer to buffer further acid pollution on the other hand groundwater from w4 and w10 shows higher dic levels than the low cl groundwater away from the ditch fig 3d its most appropriate ambient comparison additionally they are close to saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite this suggests that even if small amounts of acids may have migrated to these two sites the ph values are still largely buffered by aquifer carbonate minerals to remain to be circumneutral fig 3b 4 2 isotopic evidence for limited groundwater pollution the water stable isotopic compositions are consistent with the limited spatial influence of acid discharge on groundwater although the wide range of stable isotope compositions in the effluent ditch and pond water renders the stable isotopic data less useful effluents e2 and e3 displayed heavier isotopic ratios than those of the river and the groundwaters fig 4 although we do not know whether this enrichment reflected evaporation during the manufacturing processes or not if we were to use the somewhat heavier isotopic ratios to indicate pollution then the polluted groundwater would have shifted toward heavier isotopic compositions than their ambient low cl groundwater when the stable isotopic compositions of two most contaminated groundwater b4 and b6 were compared with the 7 low cl groundwater also near the ditch those grouped in the oval in fig 3c it was not obvious there were any differences the Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values of the 7 low cl groundwater were 41 72 to 34 11 6 8 to 4 67 respectively table s2 furthermore the ditch and pond water d1 and p1 with the highest tds and cl levels displayed unremarkable stable isotope compositions that also fell within the cluster of low cl ambient groundwater fig 4 the stable isotope compositions of groundwater from w4 and w10 of the high cl groundwater group were also unremarkable fig 4 the heaviest isotopic composition belonged to pond p3 therefore until there is a better understanding of why the stable isotopic compositions of the effluent ditch and pond waters vary so much it is difficult to use it to track pollution the data are nevertheless consistent with limited acid infiltration to groundwater on the basis that the high cl groundwater isotopic compositions are comparable to that of the low cl groundwater fig 4 and table s2 finally the stable isotope composition Œ¥d and Œ¥18o of the river water falls on the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 7 16Œ¥18o 8 83 obtained in lushan northern jiangxi li 1988 which is about 65 km away from the study area linear regression of all groundwater samples n 39 yields an equation of Œ¥d 5 41Œ¥18o 4 65 r2 0 7 because we do not have precipitation data from the study site the stable isotope signature of river and groundwater are not inconsistent with a meteoric water source upland groundwater in the qpw aquifer big open circle in fig 4 tend to gravitate toward the lighter isotopic compositions with Œ¥d ranging from 41 28 to 35 79 and Œ¥18o ranging from 6 83 to 5 57 4 3 acidification of groundwater mass loading of chloride based on idw interpolated cl concentrations 1 4 2055 mg l the plume resulting from the acidification of groundwater beneath the ditches and ponds with a volume of 3 7 105 m3 fig 5a contains about 554 tons of cl the down gradient blue bubbles fig 5a represented local cl concentration anomalies of w4 66 mg l and w1 26 mg l these tiny plumes plus the one around w10 were not included in the solute transport modeling because they might reflect either pollution from p3 with no identifiable effluent point or very localized cl infiltration because we didn t quantify the actual cl concentration of the effluent due to lack of access to e1 we varied the concentration of cl from 2000 to 4000 mg l fig 5c as effluent loading over a period of 10 years in the solute transport model for simulation of the most prominent plume centered around b4 and b6 fig 5b the effluent loading most likely contained 3000 to 3600 mg l cl because this range allowed for both the simulated maximum cl concentration in the plume and the simulated total cl mass to compare well with their observed values respectively fig 5c and d the simulated cl plume also resembles the observed plume spatially fig 5a and b note that the solute transport modeling did not simulate w1 w4 and w10 the sensitivity tests for porosity n and longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l showed that the cl transport modeling results are robust conducted with a cl effluent loading concentration of 3600 mg l when n increased from 0 35 to 0 55 Œ± l was kept at 10 m the total mass in cl plume cl 1 mg l increased only 0 0018 ton each year this is an average value over the entire 20 year stress period or only about 0 0023 of the average 80 tons of cl increase in the plume every year similarly there was a very limited change in the shape of the contaminant plume as well as the plume mass when Œ± l varied from 1 to 20 m the plume area as well as its length along the flow distance displayed no notable differences for the modeling parameters used 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological buffering at present although we do not know exactly how much acid the industrial park discharges each year we have estimated that it may have ranged from 1700 to 4300 tons of cl per year based on the production scale and process this range makes sense when water consumption figures are considered as follows water demand by the industrial park is 17 000 m3 per day based on a production rate of silicone monomers at 250 000 tons per year and that 25 tons of water is needed to produce 1 ton of monomer ma 2000 however most of this water 80 to 90 is used for cooling and is separately discharged aquaprox 2009 thus industrial park effluents containing acids probably are being discharged at a rate between 1700 and 3400 m3 d using our aforementioned modeling constrained cl concentration of 3600 mg l for effluent e1 and our observed cl concentrations for e2 and e3 of 742 mg l and 529 mg l respectively assuming that the effluents discharge were in equal amounts form the three outfalls then approximately 2 8 to 5 5 tons of cl was estimated to have been discharged by the industrial park each day the equivalent amounts were 1022 to 2008 tons of cl per year corresponding to effluent water discharge rates of 1700 and 3400 m3 d respectively considering that 1700 to 4300 tons of acids are discharged every year it is interesting that only about 2 to 5 of the acids discharged from the industrial park is infiltrating and polluting the groundwater for a pollution history of 7 years and a total observed cl plume mass of 554 tons average cl mass infiltrated is 79 tons per year the simulated cl plume at the 7th year of the modeling periods with the concentration of cl loading of 3600 mg l also shows a rate of about 80 tons per year fig 6a why is the infiltration of acid to groundwater of such limited extent the answer lies in the groundwater flow system which we will refer to as hydrological buffering the key here is the topography driven groundwater flow from the upland qpw aquifer it so happens that it naturally discharges along the boundary between qpw and qhl aquifers where the pollutant receiving ditches and ponds are also located fig 1 the water budget from the flow modeling supports this mechanism table 4 the ditches and ponds are represented by boundary 3 where there is a dynamic and large exchange of water the steady flow model estimates that groundwater flows out at a rate of 435 m3 d and that surface water flows in at a rate of 494 m3 d while the transient flow model estimates that groundwater flows out at 368 m3 d and that surface water flows in at 424 m3 d despite the somewhat different flow in and out water fluxes across boundary 3 obtained by the steady flow and transient flow models it is important that both found that the ratio of flow in and out is about 1 this means discharging groundwater with barely any cl is mixing with the effluent possibly with 3600 mg l cl at a ratio of approximately 1 to 1 along boundary 3 this mixing ratio is thus consistent with the observed cl level from p1 and d1 of 1800 mg l using the simulated total groundwater flux 7074 m3 d in the steady flow model table 4 the groundwater residence time was estimated to be about 40 years given the aquifer volume of 0 1025 km3 for an area of 13 67 km2 with an average aquifer thickness of 15 m and a porosity of 0 5 focazio et al 1998 the residence time was shorter 22 years for the upland qpw aquifer than that of the lowland qhl aquifer 61 years the simulated residence time scales were comparable with prior studies that evaluated shallow alluvial aquifer groundwater elsewhere cook et al 1995 reilly et al 1994 in which isotopic dating methods such as 3h cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 as well as flow simulation methods were applied these studies reported that the mean residence time of shallow alluvial groundwater depth 30 m could range from one year to many decades the more conductive k 100 m d and or faster recharging 100 mm yr the shorter 10 years the mean residence time portniaguine and solomon 1998 furthermore in the heterogeneous alluvial system hydraulic gradient varies with permeability spatially and considerably resulting in dispersed groundwater ages goode 1996 weissmann 2002 that could be much older in discharge areas with much longer residence time than the mean residence time dunkle et al 1993 groundwater evapotranspiration et g calculated using evt package is 5868 m3 d in the steady state flow model which was about 157 mm year or about 11 of the local surface water evaporation rate et 0 1386 mm year this subsurface evapotranspiration rate was comparable with prior regional alluvial aquifer surveys in south china the evapotranspiration coefficient c et g et 0 ranged from 5 to 20 when surface water evaporation is 800 1400 mm year with groundwater depths of 1 3 m lan et al 2015 liu 2011 evapotranspiration discharge turned out to account for most 83 of groundwater discharge 7074 m3 d in the modeling domain table 4 this is considered reasonable because groundwater in low lying areas is stagnant and the water table is very shallow which increases evapotranspiration our results are similar to prior piedmont alluvial groundwater studies whereby evapotranspiration discharge account for 60 groundwater discharge when groundwater pumping is limited xu et al 2016 luo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 5 2 vulnerability of hydrological buffering due to a planned increase by the industrial park to double the annual monomer production to 500 000 tons by 2020 this means that the water demand will double to about 34 000 tons per day combined with domestic water consumption 9000 tons d and agricultural irrigation 25 000 tons d the water utility is expected to increase their supply to about 68 000 tons per day jiangxi water resource department 2014 the local surface water reservoir has a capacity to supply 60 000 tons per day li 2008 this means that the water utility will likely seek new source water including groundwater because the limited pollution of the acids was due to a fortuitous feature of the groundwater flow system that enacted a hydrological buffering process any utilization of groundwater that disturbs the flow may render the hydrological buffering ineffective therefore we investigated the consequences of pumping in the upland qpw aquifer or the lowland ohl aquifer through transient flow modeling fig 6 at a hypothetical future pumping rate of 1000 tons per day by a group of 4 pumping wells the groundwater flow system was disturbed differently when pumping took place upland or downgradient resulting in different vulnerability to acid infiltration along boundary 3 s ditches and ponds upland pumping generated a depression cone that significantly lowered the hydraulic head at boundary 3 enhancing the leakage of acids from the ditches and ponds into groundwater fig 7 and fig s4 eventually breaking the hydrological buffer more than doubling the rate of acid infiltration fig 6a it also resulted in a plume with a larger spatial extent with high cl values 1400 mg l red in fig 6b 3 in comparison downgradient pumping induced flow into the aquifer roughly evenly through boundaries 1 and 2 but it did not significantly alter the flow balance along boundary 3 fig s4 fig 7 corresponding to this different flow pattern downgradient pumping resulted in similar acid infiltration as before fig 6a and a smaller plume with high cl values 1400 mg l red in fig 6b 4 to determine an upland pumping rate that would not break the hydrological buffer we lowered the pumping rate from 1000 tons d to 800 and 400 tons d the corresponding increases of effluents recharge along boundary 3 were lowered from 262 m3 d to 219 m3 d and 150 m3 d the cl mass infiltration in the plume decreased as well 193 tons a 155 tons a and 102 tons a respectively 5 3 implications for groundwater management our study has identified potential risks in managing alluvial aquifer groundwater in industrial regions with point source pollutions and high water demands the hydrological buffering mechanism resulting from fortuitous groundwater flow patterns should be carefully considered by the local groundwater management authority our modeling exercise shows that rather than being resilient the hydrological buffering mechanism is vulnerable to intensive pumping and thus raises concerns for the local groundwater development plans if pumping were to proceed it would be better to pump from the qhl aquifer if the qpw aquifer were to be developed pumping rate should not exceed 400 tons d neither pumping scenario is ideal because both induce pollution of the groundwaters albeit pumping from the qhl aquifer would have less impact our study further illustrates the broader environmental risks associated with silicone monomer production in the yangtze river alluvial plains silicone monomer production is rapidly expanding in the world including china us geological survey 2015 over 60 of silicone monomer production facilities in china are located in lower yangtze catchments where alluvial plains dominate the lack of enforcement of industrial effluent discharge standards suggests that many more alluvial aquifers will experience some degrees of acidification the yangtze alluvial groundwater has a close connection with surface water hu 2010 thus alluvial groundwater contamination may affect surface water bodies deng et al 2014 hu et al 2013 soldatova et al 2014 it is demonstrated here that cl can be used as a useful tracer to delineate groundwater pollution by effluent discharging from silicone monomer production facilities in the yangtze alluvial plain in addition solute transport modeling can be used to provide constraints on undisclosed discharge amounts this makes a characterization of large varieties of organic contamination and heavy metals in such discharge more targeted and cost effective 6 conclusion acidification of yangtze river alluvial plain shallow groundwater influenced by acidic major cation and chloride rich effluent discharged from a silicone monomer production facility is found to be of limited spatial extent with only a few percent of chloride discharged as effluent infiltrating to the aquifer despite expected hydraulic connectivity this is attributed to a hydrological buffering process in that artesian groundwater is fortuitously flowing out at a depression joining the upland pleistocene and the downgradient holocene aquifer the industrial effluent is thus only infiltrating very locally due to the topography driven groundwater flow pattern however solute transport coupled with steady state and transient flow modeling identified the vulnerability of this hydrological buffering mechanism such that pumping from the upland aquifer will break the buffer faster than pumping from the downgradient aquifer as a result groundwater development is not recommended until the effluent has been properly treated careful characterization of cl major ions and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes further show that carbonate mineral buffering reduces the extent of groundwater acidification suggesting that cl is a good tracer for delineating pollution in alluvial plains associated with silicone monomer production facilities that do not reuse all of their acids finally modeling of cl transport can quantify the undisclosed acid discharge by such polluting facilities acknowledgments the study was supported by the

1629,shallow groundwater in alluvial plains is vulnerable to contamination due to infiltration of pollutants from anthropogenic activities in the alluvial plain of the yangtze river near poyang lake a silicone monomer industrial park was found to discharge undisclosed amount of effluents containing high levels of hydrochloric acid and total dissolved solids into ponds and ditches that in turn displayed characteristics of acidic water with high total dissolved solids however most shallow groundwater n 35 depth 5 5 22 m collected from the alluvial aquifer downgradient of the industrial park contained low cl 59 mg l only 4 groundwater samples showed high cl 59 790 mg l with two containing superlative levels 449 mg l and 790 mg l located within a 50 m distance from the polluted ponds and ditches in addition to hydrochemical data modeling was used to explain why a highly vulnerable alluvial aquifer was not more contaminated when subjected to such intense point source pollution and to estimate the effluent discharge flow and solute transport modeling suggests that a hydrological buffering mechanism resulting from a topography driven groundwater outflow along the boundary between the pleistocene qpw and the holocene qhl aquifers where the polluted ponds and ditches are fortuitously located has restricted acid infiltration with only a few percent of the estimated acid discharge in the amount of 1700 4200 tons per year entering the aquifer our model results show that pumping from the upland qpw aquifer breaks this hydrological buffering much more easily than pumping from the downgradient qhl aquifer suggesting the vulnerability of this buffering mechanism thus compromising groundwater utilization in the future keywords alluvial plain aquifer groundwater acidification

alluvial groundwater aquifer receives highly acidic industrial effluents xu and wang 2016 although surface water exhibited chemical characteristic with low ph and high tds suggesting pollution from effluents only 4 alluvial groundwater samples in the close vicinity of the point sources showed signs of pollution the limited extent of groundwater pollution is unexpected because the highly

subrahmanyam and yadaiah 2014 surveys of shallow groundwater quality in poyang lake catchment also showed characteristics of non point source contamination such as no3 from agriculture with more than

resistance to a point source contamination limiting the spatial spread of the contaminant plume to a relatively small extent additional sampling hydrochemical and stable isotopic analyses of effluent n 2 surface water n 9 and groundwater n 39 in the study area vulnerable to contamination were obtained to assess the extent of groundwater contamination and to understand the resultant hydrochemical evolution a groundwater flow model was constructed to investigate how groundwater flow regulates the spatial distribution of contaminants and acts as a hydrological buffer the solute transport model results were utilized to estimate the industrial discharge from unknown sources as well as to reconstruct the pollution history the observed data and modeling results allowed for projections of the extent of groundwater pollution under different water use scenarios implications for the local water management are also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 hydrogeological setting the study area is located in jiangxi province to the west of poyang lake the largest fresh water lake in china s lower yangtze river region with significant ecosystem values zhang et al 2014 it is characterized by a subtropical monsoonal climate with an annual mean temperature of 17 0 c an annual mean precipitation of 1428 7 mm and a potential evaporation of 1386 4 mm flowing through the study area from the southwest to the northeast is the yangliujin river fig 1a a branch of the xiu river that eventually flows into the poyang lake to the east the regional groundwater flow path is from the northwest to the southeast fig s1a the seasonal ranges of the hydraulic heads obtained from 13 local observation wells range from 0 41 m to 2 1 m table s1 fig s2a the study area is a part of a thin alluvial plain of quaternary deposits with the thickness of the pleistocene and the holocene deposits 30 m in most places in a complex and interbedded sequence of sand clay silt and gravel hu et al 2013 zeng et al 1990 jiangxi provincial bureau of geology and mineral resources 1984 the quaternary pleistocene deposits of the wangchenggang formation qpw in the study area are eluvial with a thickness of 9 20 m while the quaternary holocene deposits the lianxu formation qhl are alluvial with a thickness of 16 22 m underneath the alluvium is a sandstone formation the qpw stratum has a higher average elevation with an average slope of about 0 01 from the northwest to the southeast fig s1a the holocene deposits qhl are from the less elevated areas with a flat topography there is a sudden change of topography at the boundary between the qpw and qhl strata fig s1a based on the lithology the study site is divided into 6 hydrogeological units fig 1b the hydraulic conductivity of

pollutants from industrial activities since the 1990s the poyang lake region has witnessed a growth of the organosilicon industry including an industrial park built in the upland portion of the study area the industrial park produces 250 000 300 000 tons of silicone monomers annually after an expansion in 2008 which has been estimated to generate 9300 to 23 000 tons of 19 wt hcl discharge equivalent to 1700 to 4300 tons of cl zhang 2003 li 2008 three discharge outfalls e1 e2 and e3 in fig 1a were identified by our investigation with potentially more unknown outfalls outfalls e1 and e2 discharged into a natural un lined ditch connected to two small ponds p1 and p2 at either end the ditch and the connected ponds were located right along the boundary of the qpw and qhl deposits where artesian or semi artesian zones were observed xu and wang 2016 2 2 sample collection and field analysis procedures in june 2015 39 groundwater samples fig 1a were collected from 15 boreholes b1 b15 and 24 dug wells w1 w24 this sampling expanded a prior sampling campaign of 13 boreholes and 13 dug wells in june 2014 that provided the preliminary evidence for the limited spatial extent of groundwater pollution xu and wang 2016 the depths of the boreholes and the dug wells ranged from 5 5 to 22 m the screened intervals of the boreholes were usually at the depths of 6 10 m below the ground level before sampling the boreholes and the dug wells were primed with a portable submersible pump at a flow rate of 25 l min usually for 15 min until the electrical conductivity ec and the ph reached stable readings monitored using a multi probe meas eureka manta 2 various surface water samples were also collected fig 1a river water sample r1 was collected from the yangliujin river adding to the three river water samples r2 r3 and r4 collected in our previous study xu and wang 2016 two industrial effluents e2 and e3 were also sampled fig 1a although industrial effluent discharge point e1 was not accessible two water samples d1 and d2 were collected 750 m apart from each other in the ditch receiving the industrial effluents additionally three pond water samples p1 p2 and p3 were obtained from the ponds 1 2 and 3 respectively ponds 1 and 2 were connected to the southwest and the northeast ends of the ditch respectively pond 3 is a pond northeast of the ditch all water samples were collected into high density polyethylene hdpe bottles after filtration 0 45 Œºm samples for cations and nitrate ammonia nitrogen analyses were acidified with hno3 and h2so4 respectively in the field water samples for Œ¥d and Œ¥18o analyses were collected in hdpe bottles with no headspace all samples were brought back to the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology at the china university of geosciences beijing and stored at 4 c before analysis 2 3 chemical and stable isotope analysis the major cations ca2 mg2 k and na were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy spectro blue 201300x1 with the limit of detection lod of 0 1 mg l the major anions cl and so4 2 were measured by ion chromatography dx 120 with an lod of 0 2 mg l the

as well as total inorganic carbon tic saturation index si of calcite and dolomite were calculated using phreeqc version 3 using the measured ph and alkalinity values because the temperatures of groundwater obtained in the field were all within 25 1 c the temperature used to calculate the si was set at 25 c for simplicity tds was calculated from measured major constituents k na ca2 mg2 nh4 cl so4 2 hco3 no3 tables s2 and s3 charge balances of cations and anions show errors usually within 10 deuterium Œ¥d and oxygen Œ¥18o isotopes were measured with lgr liquid water isotope analyzer lwia v2 dlt 100 the precision is 0 1 for 18o 16o and 0 3 for d h the isotopic results were given in Œ¥ unit relative to vsmow tables s2 and s3 statistical analysis of hydrochemical data was done using ibm spss statistics 22 2 4 numerical modeling 2 4 1 steady state flow model a three dimensional 3d groundwater steady state flow model was first constructed using the modflow code harbaugh et al 2000 the model consisted of 200 rows and 200 columns spanning an area of 13 7 km2 dotted box in fig 1a vertically the model is represented by a three layer aquifer system fig 1b and table 1 mawan lake in the elevated areas to the northwest was treated as a recharge source and assigned a constant head of 44 m as boundary 1 fig 1a and fig s1 yangliujin river in the low lying area to the southeast and its tributary to the northeast were assigned specific heads based on linear interpolation of the observed river levels ranging from 17 m in the northeast to 20 m in the southwest boundary 2 the west and the north ridges of the topographic high points were set as no flow boundaries boundaries 4 and 5 the ditch and the ponds receiving industrial effluents as boundary 3 were assigned specific heads based on average hydraulic heads 20 24 m along the ditch and the ponds observed in 2013 2014 and 2015 fig s1a these areas of ditch and ponds were not treated as effluent recharge areas alone because groundwater in the vicinity has displayed semi artesian behavior suggesting a possibility of active two way exchanges between the ditch ponds and the underlying aquifers a vertical recharge rate of 140 mm year is applied to the top cells of the modeling domain this recharge rate is estimated using the empirical equation r p Œ± p where r p is the recharge rate of precipitation infiltration mm year p is the annual precipitation rate 1428 7 mm year Œ± 10 is the precipitation infiltration recharge coefficient related to aquifer lithology groundwater depth micro topography as well as precipitation intensity gau and liu 2000 lu 2006 zhang and li 2009 xue et al 2008 this estimated rate is comparable to another recharge estimate of 98 173 mm year for alluvial groundwater in the larger poyang lake catchment water resources bulletin of jiangxi province in 2010 2015 because groundwater discharges primarily through evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration evt package is applied to the top cells of the model domain data input included surface water evaporation rate 1386 4 mm year and et extinction depth 2 3 m considering the local hydrogeological setting banta 2000 xu and chen 2005 renger and wessolek 2010 the steady state flow model was calibrated using average hydraulic heads of nov 2013 aug 2014 and june 2015 fig s1a from 23 observation wells after calibration the root mean square error rmse of the hydraulic head was 0 23 m which represented approximately 2 4 of the accumulated head errors for a total of 23 observations absolute value of 9 7 m and was judged acceptable fig s2 horizontal hydraulic conductivity k x horizontal anisotropy k y k x and vertical anisotropy k z k v of six zones were adjusted from the estimated ranges based on field pumping tests to the best fit table 1 calibrated horizontal anisotropy values were 0 8 0 9 while vertical anisotropy values ranged from 8 to 10 2 4 2 solute transport model a solute transport model for chloride was constructed using mt3dms code zheng 1999 in gms 7 1 to evaluate the impact of the industrial effluent discharge on groundwater quality the solute transport model included advection and dispersion but not diffusion at the microscales chloride was considered conservative due to its largely non reactive nature the groundwater wells available for sampling were few and unevenly distributed in the study area fig 1a thus not ideal to reveal the initial spatial distribution of cl however cl concentration observed in the upland study area is generally low ranging from 1 4 to 10 2 mg l n 5 comparable with the low value of cl about 1 mg l in shallow alluvial groundwater in the poyang lake area zeng et al 1990 in the solute transport model the initial concentration for cl was thus set at 0 mg l and not the interpolated cl concentrations due to difficulty in discerning the true uncontaminated cl level nevertheless when the interpolated cl concentrations from low cl groundwater 58 6 mg l details of classification in section 3 2 were used as the initial condition in the model similar results were obtained fig s3 the solute transport models were set as 20 years considering the history of the local silicon production started in the late 1990s the solute transport modeling simulated the impact of industrial outfalls e1 and e2 only fig s1b tracking the contaminant plume migrating from boundary 3 fig s1b the source loading for cl was simulated by assigning an elevated value to cells where the specific head boundary was used for the ditches ponds portion of the modeling domain part of boundary 3 24 cells fig s1b since we were unable to obtain a water sample from e1 the cl value 2000 mg l of pond water p1 receiving effluent from e1 was used as one of the initial concentrations considering that p1 water was probably diluted by the discharging low chloride groundwater the actual chloride mass loading of effluents might have been higher therefore a range of cl concentrations of effluents were tested to determine this initial cl loading by comparing the calculated mass in the simulated cl plume with that in the interpolated cl plume the reasons to simulate solute transport from e1 and e2 only are as follows first the industrial outfall e3 has been shut down since the end of 2015 and is thus probably no longer a source of pollution second it allows us to focus on the two main effluent discharge sources and how they affect the most highly contaminated part of the aquifer a limitation of this approach is that historical pollution from e3 is not considered and hence both the spatial pattern and mass accumulation of cl may be underestimated in the eastern part of the study area we estimated the cl mass loading of effluents through solute transport modeling to compare to the observed cl mass loading in the aquifer as a way to validate our models and to constrain the effluent loading cl concentration as well as the pollution history to calculate total cl mass in the plume from observation interpolated cl values were obtained by a log normal inverse distance weighting idm method with gradient hyperplane nodal functions gms 7 1 3d scatter data interpolation idw has been extensively used as a three dimensional interpolation method in groundwater contamination investigations mirzaei and sakizadeh 2016 the gradients of topography were estimated in gms based on the geological data as in the flow model as well as the basic grids and nodes conditions 58 132 cells and 81 892 nodes concentrations of cl of 35 groundwater samples with known well depths were used for this interpolation in addition cl concentrations of the ditch water and pond water samples in the artesian area d1 d2 p1and p2 were also used with a depth of 0 m sensitivity tests have been performed on effective porosity n range 0 35 to 0 55 and longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l range 1 to 10 m the former affects the rate of solute transport while the later affects the shape of contamination plume the range of n values were based on what was typical for unconfined or poorly confined alluvial sediment aquifers with unsorted sand and loam ahuja et al 1989 fallico 2014 niwas and celik 2012 while the range of Œ± l was estimated using the empirical power law Œ± l c l m accounting for unconsolidated sediment with sand silt and clay c 0 02 0 05 and flow scales l 800 m davis 1986 schulze makuch

and schwartz 1998 the parameters used in solute transport modeling n Œ± l Œ± t and d d were shown in table 1 2 4 3 transient state flow model transient state flow modeling was performed to evaluate the impacts of two hypothetical pumping scenarios in the upland qpw aquifer and the downgradient qhl aquifer respectively results from the calibrated steady state flow model were used to provide the initial condition for the transient flow model in the 7th year pumping was allowed to begin from the 7th year of the modeled 20 year stress period a range of pumping rates of 400 800 and 1000 t d were examined in both upland and downgradient pumping scenarios and assigned to a group of 4 pumping wells fig s4 these pumping rates were chosen based on local well yield calculated using depuit equation rosenshein 1984 unpublished pumping test results from boreholes b1 b15 obtained by the groundwater and soil contamination survey of huadong region suggest that the well yield is 200 250 tons d another assessment determined the yield to be 120 286 tons d for the qpw aquifer and up to 700 tons d in the most productive qhl aquifer environmental geological survey of jiangxi province 1982 finally to the northwest of the study area lays a permian karst aquifer where groundwater storage is abundant with a well yield over 550 tons d and up to 1900 tons d environmental geological survey in jiujiang city therefore it is likely that water can be brought in from boundary 1 at these hypothetical pumping rates although the long term consequences would need to be assessed by a regional groundwater study these wells were put in 4 neighboring cells and assumed to be complete wells with a full screen of in situ aquifer thickness 17 m in upland pumping wells and 20 m in lowland pumping wells in both upland and downgradient pumping scenarios the pumping wells were set at equal distance from boundary 3 effluent ditch and ponds instead of specific heads the upland lake boundary 1 downstream river and its tributary boundary 2 as well as the effluent discharge area boundary 3 were set to a general head boundary condition to allow examining the influence of pumping and was given the initial head values from the steady state flow model output this boundary condition was also constrained by the conductance of the aquifer c arc conductance per unit length m2 d m which can be estimated based on the formula c arc wk v m accounting for the calibrated results of vertical hydraulic conductivity of underlying sediments k v 0 1 0 5 m d estimated thickness of sediments m 0 5 4 m and width w

4 1 5 m2 d m was calibrated using data from 23 observational wells assuming they also represented the flow pattern in the 7th year of the transient flow modeling period as well as the flow at each boundary the rmse of the data from the 23 observation wells was 0 50 m when compared with the groundwater table in the 7th year of the transient flow modeling which was greater than the rmse 0 23 m calibrated in the steady flow model solute transport simulations for two pumping scenarios were also obtained with assumed 3600 mg l of cl loading from e1 effluents 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of effluent and polluted surface water there were significant anomalies in ph cl major cations k na ca2 and mg2 in the effluent and polluted surface water collected from the ditches and ponds compared to river water table 2 all four river water samples were slightly alkaline ph 7 with very low tds content as well as cl and major cation concentrations table 2 with the upstream river sample r1 showing the lowest values of both cl and tds the industrial park draws water from the river thus the anomalies in the effluent and effluent impacted ditches and ponds reflect pollution access to the industrial park s effluent discharge points was limited so only two locations were sampled nevertheless the effluents collected from e2 and e3 displayed high tds with hundreds of mg l cl although the waters were only slightly acidic ph 6 table 2 sampling of e2 in 2014 xu and wang 2016 found concentrations of cl na and ca2 to be lower compared to the values in 2015 by one half 327 9 mg l one third 52 3 mg l and one half 63 9 mg l respectively table 2 yet a much more acidic ph of 3 8 was measured this suggests that before our 2015 sampling took place soda lime a mixture of ca oh 2 and naoh may have been used to neutralize the effluent before its discharge these data show that the effluent is cl rich and sometimes with significant acidity the data gathered showed that ponds and ditches receiving effluents all displayed hydrochemical characteristics suggesting pollution although the extent varied p1 and d1 located near effluent e1 showed the lowest ph value of 3 6 the highest cl 2000 mg l as well as the highest tds 3100 mg l these features illustrated the possibility of a prominent contaminant source from e1 although this cannot be ascertained because access to e1 was not provided for in comparison p2 and d2 located closer to effluent e2 showed a slightly acidic ph value of about 6 and 10 times lower cl concentrations 183 mg l and 112 mg l respectively and tds levels 297 and 189 mg l respectively than those of p1 and d1 interestingly despite being located about 700 m up gradient from the e1 and e2 effluent impacted ditch pond area fig 1a pond p3 displayed similar hydrochemical characteristics to p2 and d2 with cl of 247 mg l of cl 416 mg l of tds albeit a lower ph of 4 1 there was no visible connection between p3 and industrial outfalls e1 e2 and e3 suggesting there might be additional industrial outfalls that discharged to p3 4 hydrochemical evidence for limited groundwater pollution because cl is highly elevated in industrial effluents and is mostly chemically conservative in groundwater it is used as a tracer to delineate acid pollution from the industrial park discharge the median value 18 0 mg l and interquartile range 21 0 mg l iqr the difference between the 75th and the 25th quantiles of cl concentrations of groundwater samples were used to classify groundwater into low cl and high cl groups table 3 the high cl group consisted of 4 samples b4 b6 w4 and w10 only and displayed 58 6 mg l of cl or the 75th percentile value plus 1 5 times the iqr john et al 2014 uddameri et al 2013 b4 and b6 fig 1a two of the 4 high cl groundwater samples contained superlative cl of 449 mg l and 790 mg l respectively table 2 there is little doubt that b4 and b6 have been impacted by industrial effluents although the case for w10 and w4 with 130 mg l and 66 mg l of cl respectively are less obvious based on the cl evidence alone the low cl group n 35 displayed an average cl of 16 6 mg l an average tds of 168 5 mg l with ph values ranging from 5 5 to 7 6 even if all 4 groundwater samples with anomalously high cl are interpreted as representing pollution the spatial extent of the plume is limited b4 and b6 are located within 50 m of the ditches d1 and d2 w10 is about 200 m northeast of d1 and d2 and 450 m down gradient from p3 w4 is located 750 m further downgradient from w10 fig 1a these hydrochemical anomalies were also evident in a transect along the groundwater flow path fig 1a b b when compared to hydrochemical data of 35 groundwater samples fig 2 b4 and b6 had lower ph and higher cl tds and ca2 values but not very different alkalinity compared to ambient groundwater samples from similar depths and distances from upland the signals at w4 and w10 were less distinguishable from the ambient groundwater fig 2 4 1 acidification of groundwater and carbonate mineral buffering the upland qpw aquifer has the freshest groundwater w20 w24 n 5 average tds 33 1 mg l and belonged to the low cl group cl 1 4 10 2 mg l the average ph value of these groundwater was 5 89 comparable to an average ph value of 5 98 obtained from shallow groundwater surveys n 21 in the entire poyang lake catchment of 14 500 km2 yang 2012 the slight acidity has been attributed to acid rain hu 2013 the qpw aquifer is likely to be carbonate mineral poor because all five upland groundwater samples are significantly under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 3c fortunately the upland qpw aquifer does not appear to have been influenced by the acid discharge from the industrial park fig 3b because it would have lacked much carbonate mineral buffering capacity if acids infiltrated the high cl groundwater pond and ditch waters reflect mixing between concentrated acid effluent and ambient lowland qhl aquifer water as evidenced by the linear correlations between tds and cl fig 3a and between ph and log cl fig 3b the most concentrated acid effluent is likely to have been discharged from e1 for which a sample could not be obtained although we can make an educated guess that it is likely to be even more concentrated than waters from d1 and p1 fig 3a the negative slope of 1 between ph and log cl n 45 excluding 5 upland qpw groundwater samples r2 0 67 fig 3b suggests that the ph variations spanning more than three orders of magnitude i e from 7 to 4 is caused by acidification due to hcl discharge and infiltration compared to the upland qpw low cl groundwater that are under saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite the lowland ambient qhl groundwater from boreholes near the ditch with low cl average 5 57 mg l n 7 grouped in an oval in fig 3c however are saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite these boreholes near the ditch contained about an order of magnitude higher dic fig 3d and 13 times more ca2 than those of the upland qpw low cl groundwater suggesting dissolution of carbonate minerals that resulted in an average ph value of 7 3 the two highly contaminated samples b4 and b6 are also located near the ditch and display similar dic concentrations as these aforementioned ambient low cl groundwater grouped in an oval fig 3d due to the amount of protons introduced at b4 and b6 the aqueous carbonic acid equilibrium has shifted from bicarbonate dominant to co2 aq dominant with 87 of dic being co2 aq in both samples and nearly negligible carbonate ion therefore calcite and dolomite are under saturated at b4 and b6 large solid circles in fig 3c the under saturation with respect to calcite dolomite and comparable dic concentrations with the ambient low cl groundwater nearby suggest that the carbonate mineral buffering has reached its limit there are now probably no more carbonate minerals left in the aquifer to buffer further acid pollution on the other hand groundwater from w4 and w10 shows higher dic levels than the low cl groundwater away from the ditch fig 3d its most appropriate ambient comparison additionally they are close to saturation with respect to calcite and dolomite this suggests that even if small amounts of acids may have migrated to these two sites the ph values are still largely buffered by aquifer carbonate minerals to remain to be circumneutral fig 3b 4 2 isotopic evidence for limited groundwater pollution the water stable isotopic compositions are consistent with the limited spatial influence of acid discharge on groundwater although the wide range of stable isotope compositions in the effluent ditch and pond water renders the stable isotopic data less useful effluents e2 and e3 displayed heavier isotopic ratios than those of the river and the groundwaters fig 4 although we do not know whether this enrichment reflected evaporation during the manufacturing processes or not if we were to use the somewhat heavier isotopic ratios to indicate pollution then the polluted groundwater would have shifted toward heavier isotopic compositions than their ambient low cl groundwater when the stable isotopic compositions of two most contaminated groundwater b4 and b6 were compared with the 7 low cl groundwater also near the ditch those grouped in the oval in fig 3c it was not obvious there were any differences the Œ¥d and Œ¥18o values of the 7 low cl groundwater were 41 72 to 34 11 6 8 to 4 67 respectively table s2 furthermore the ditch and pond water d1 and p1 with the highest tds and cl levels displayed unremarkable stable isotope compositions that also fell within the cluster of low cl ambient groundwater fig 4 the stable isotope compositions of groundwater from w4 and w10 of the high cl groundwater group were also unremarkable fig 4 the heaviest isotopic composition belonged to pond p3 therefore until there is a better understanding of why the stable isotopic compositions of the effluent ditch and pond waters vary so much it is difficult to use it to track pollution the data are nevertheless consistent with limited acid infiltration to groundwater on the basis that the high cl groundwater isotopic compositions are comparable to that of the low cl groundwater fig 4 and table s2 finally the stable isotope composition Œ¥d and Œ¥18o of the river water falls on the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 7 16Œ¥18o 8 83 obtained in lushan northern jiangxi li 1988 which is about 65 km away from the study area linear regression of all groundwater samples n 39 yields an equation of Œ¥d 5 41Œ¥18o 4 65 r2 0 7 because we do not have precipitation data from the study site the stable isotope signature of river and groundwater are not inconsistent with a meteoric water source upland groundwater in the qpw aquifer big open circle in fig 4 tend to gravitate toward the lighter isotopic compositions with Œ¥d ranging from 41 28 to 35 79 and Œ¥18o ranging from 6 83 to 5 57 4 3 acidification of groundwater mass loading of chloride based on idw interpolated cl concentrations 1 4 2055 mg l the plume resulting from the acidification of groundwater beneath the ditches and ponds with a volume of 3 7 105 m3 fig 5a contains about 554 tons of cl the down gradient blue bubbles fig 5a represented local cl concentration anomalies of w4 66 mg l and w1 26 mg l these tiny plumes plus the one around w10 were not included in the solute transport modeling because they might reflect either pollution from p3 with no identifiable effluent point or very localized cl infiltration because we didn t quantify the actual cl concentration of the effluent due to lack of access to e1 we varied the concentration of cl from 2000 to 4000 mg l fig 5c as effluent loading over a period of 10 years in the solute transport model for simulation of the most prominent plume centered around b4 and b6 fig 5b the effluent loading most likely contained 3000 to 3600 mg l cl because this range allowed for both the simulated maximum cl concentration in the plume and the simulated total cl mass to compare well with their observed values respectively fig 5c and d the simulated cl plume also resembles the observed plume spatially fig 5a and b note that the solute transport modeling did not simulate w1 w4 and w10 the sensitivity tests for porosity n and longitudinal dispersivity Œ± l showed that the cl transport modeling results are robust conducted with a cl effluent loading concentration of 3600 mg l when n increased from 0 35 to 0 55 Œ± l was kept at 10 m the total mass in cl plume cl 1 mg l increased only 0 0018 ton each year this is an average value over the entire 20 year stress period or only about 0 0023 of the average 80 tons of cl increase in the plume every year similarly there was a very limited change in the shape of the contaminant plume as well as the plume mass when Œ± l varied from 1 to 20 m the plume area as well as its length along the flow distance displayed no notable differences for the modeling parameters used 5 discussion 5 1 hydrological buffering at present although we do not know exactly how much acid the industrial park discharges each year we have estimated that it may have ranged from 1700 to 4300 tons of cl per year based on the production scale and process this range makes sense when water consumption figures are considered as follows water demand by the industrial park is 17 000 m3 per day based on a production rate of silicone monomers at 250 000 tons per year and that 25 tons of water is needed to produce 1 ton of monomer ma 2000 however most of this water 80 to 90 is used for cooling and is separately discharged aquaprox 2009 thus industrial park effluents containing acids probably are being discharged at a rate between 1700 and 3400 m3 d using our aforementioned modeling constrained cl concentration of 3600 mg l for effluent e1 and our observed cl concentrations for e2 and e3 of 742 mg l and 529 mg l respectively assuming that the effluents discharge were in equal amounts form the three outfalls then approximately 2 8 to 5 5 tons of cl was estimated to have been discharged by the industrial park each day the equivalent amounts were 1022 to 2008 tons of cl per year corresponding to effluent water discharge rates of 1700 and 3400 m3 d respectively considering that 1700 to 4300 tons of acids are discharged every year it is interesting that only about 2 to 5 of the acids discharged from the industrial park is infiltrating and polluting the groundwater for a pollution history of 7 years and a total observed cl plume mass of 554 tons average cl mass infiltrated is 79 tons per year the simulated cl plume at the 7th year of the modeling periods with the concentration of cl loading of 3600 mg l also shows a rate of about 80 tons per year fig 6a why is the infiltration of acid to groundwater of such limited extent the answer lies in the groundwater flow system which we will refer to as hydrological buffering the key here is the topography driven groundwater flow from the upland qpw aquifer it so happens that it naturally discharges along the boundary between qpw and qhl aquifers where the pollutant receiving ditches and ponds are also located fig 1 the water budget from the flow modeling supports this mechanism table 4 the ditches and ponds are represented by boundary 3 where there is a dynamic and large exchange of water the steady flow model estimates that groundwater flows out at a rate of 435 m3 d and that surface water flows in at a rate of 494 m3 d while the transient flow model estimates that groundwater flows out at 368 m3 d and that surface water flows in at 424 m3 d despite the somewhat different flow in and out water fluxes across boundary 3 obtained by the steady flow and transient flow models it is important that both found that the ratio of flow in and out is about 1 this means discharging groundwater with barely any cl is mixing with the effluent possibly with 3600 mg l cl at a ratio of approximately 1 to 1 along boundary 3 this mixing ratio is thus consistent with the observed cl level from p1 and d1 of 1800 mg l using the simulated total groundwater flux 7074 m3 d in the steady flow model table 4 the groundwater residence time was estimated to be about 40 years given the aquifer volume of 0 1025 km3 for an area of 13 67 km2 with an average aquifer thickness of 15 m and a porosity of 0 5 focazio et al 1998 the residence time was shorter 22 years for the upland qpw aquifer than that of the lowland qhl aquifer 61 years the simulated residence time scales were comparable with prior studies that evaluated shallow alluvial aquifer groundwater elsewhere cook et al 1995 reilly et al 1994 in which isotopic dating methods such as 3h cfc 11 cfc 12 and cfc 113 as well as flow simulation methods were applied these studies reported that the mean residence time of shallow alluvial groundwater depth 30 m could range from one year to many decades the more conductive k 100 m d and or faster recharging 100 mm yr the shorter 10 years the mean residence time portniaguine and solomon 1998 furthermore in the heterogeneous alluvial system hydraulic gradient varies with permeability spatially and considerably resulting in dispersed groundwater ages goode 1996 weissmann 2002 that could be much older in discharge areas with much longer residence time than the mean residence time dunkle et al 1993 groundwater evapotranspiration et g calculated using evt package is 5868 m3 d in the steady state flow model which was about 157 mm year or about 11 of the local surface water evaporation rate et 0 1386 mm year this subsurface evapotranspiration rate was comparable with prior regional alluvial aquifer surveys in south china the evapotranspiration coefficient c et g et 0 ranged from 5 to 20 when surface water evaporation is 800 1400 mm year with groundwater depths of 1 3 m lan et al 2015 liu 2011 evapotranspiration discharge turned out to account for most 83 of groundwater discharge 7074 m3 d in the modeling domain table 4 this is considered reasonable because groundwater in low lying areas is stagnant and the water table is very shallow which increases evapotranspiration our results are similar to prior piedmont alluvial groundwater studies whereby evapotranspiration discharge account for 60 groundwater discharge when groundwater pumping is limited xu et al 2016 luo et al 2015 wang et al 2015 5 2 vulnerability of hydrological buffering due to a planned increase by the industrial park to double the annual monomer production to 500 000 tons by 2020 this means that the water demand will double to about 34 000 tons per day combined with domestic water consumption 9000 tons d and agricultural irrigation 25 000 tons d the water utility is expected to increase their supply to about 68 000 tons per day jiangxi water resource department 2014 the local surface water reservoir has a capacity to supply 60 000 tons per day li 2008 this means that the water utility will likely seek new source water including groundwater because the limited pollution of the acids was due to a fortuitous feature of the groundwater flow system that enacted a hydrological buffering process any utilization of groundwater that disturbs the flow may render the hydrological buffering ineffective therefore we investigated the consequences of pumping in the upland qpw aquifer or the lowland ohl aquifer through transient flow modeling fig 6 at a hypothetical future pumping rate of 1000 tons per day by a group of 4 pumping wells the groundwater flow system was disturbed differently when pumping took place upland or downgradient resulting in different vulnerability to acid infiltration along boundary 3 s ditches and ponds upland pumping generated a depression cone that significantly lowered the hydraulic head at boundary 3 enhancing the leakage of acids from the ditches and ponds into groundwater fig 7 and fig s4 eventually breaking the hydrological buffer more than doubling the rate of acid infiltration fig 6a it also resulted in a plume with a larger spatial extent with high cl values 1400 mg l red in fig 6b 3 in comparison downgradient pumping induced flow into the aquifer roughly evenly through boundaries 1 and 2 but it did not significantly alter the flow balance along boundary 3 fig s4 fig 7 corresponding to this different flow pattern downgradient pumping resulted in similar acid infiltration as before fig 6a and a smaller plume with high cl values 1400 mg l red in fig 6b 4 to determine an upland pumping rate that would not break the hydrological buffer we lowered the pumping rate from 1000 tons d to 800 and 400 tons d the corresponding increases of effluents recharge along boundary 3 were lowered from 262 m3 d to 219 m3 d and 150 m3 d the cl mass infiltration in the plume decreased as well 193 tons a 155 tons a and 102 tons a respectively 5 3 implications for groundwater management our study has identified potential risks in managing alluvial aquifer groundwater in industrial regions with point source pollutions and high water demands the hydrological buffering mechanism resulting from fortuitous groundwater flow patterns should be carefully considered by the local groundwater management authority our modeling exercise shows that rather than being resilient the hydrological buffering mechanism is vulnerable to intensive pumping and thus raises concerns for the local groundwater development plans if pumping were to proceed it would be better to pump from the qhl aquifer if the qpw aquifer were to be developed pumping rate should not exceed 400 tons d neither pumping scenario is ideal because both induce pollution of the groundwaters albeit pumping from the qhl aquifer would have less impact our study further illustrates the broader environmental risks associated with silicone monomer production in the yangtze river alluvial plains silicone monomer production is rapidly expanding in the world including china us geological survey 2015 over 60 of silicone monomer production facilities in china are located in lower yangtze catchments where alluvial plains dominate the lack of enforcement of industrial effluent discharge standards suggests that many more alluvial aquifers will experience some degrees of acidification the yangtze alluvial groundwater has a close connection with surface water hu 2010 thus alluvial groundwater contamination may affect surface water bodies deng et al 2014 hu et al 2013 soldatova et al 2014 it is demonstrated here that cl can be used as a useful tracer to delineate groundwater pollution by effluent discharging from silicone monomer production facilities in the yangtze alluvial plain in addition solute transport modeling can be used to provide constraints on undisclosed discharge amounts this makes a characterization of large varieties of organic contamination and heavy metals in such discharge more targeted and cost effective 6 conclusion acidification of yangtze river alluvial plain shallow groundwater influenced by acidic major cation and chloride rich effluent discharged from a silicone monomer production facility is found to be of limited spatial extent with only a few percent of chloride discharged as effluent infiltrating to the aquifer despite expected hydraulic connectivity this is attributed to a hydrological buffering process in that artesian groundwater is fortuitously flowing out at a depression joining the upland pleistocene and the downgradient holocene aquifer the industrial effluent is thus only infiltrating very locally due to the topography driven groundwater flow pattern however solute transport coupled with steady state and transient flow modeling identified the vulnerability of this hydrological buffering mechanism such that pumping from the upland aquifer will break the buffer faster than pumping from the downgradient aquifer as a result groundwater development is not recommended until the effluent has been properly treated careful characterization of cl major ions and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes further show that carbonate mineral buffering reduces the extent of groundwater acidification suggesting that cl is a good tracer for delineating pollution in alluvial plains associated with silicone monomer production facilities that do not reuse all of their acids finally modeling of cl transport can quantify the undisclosed acid discharge by such polluting facilities acknowledgments the study was supported by the
