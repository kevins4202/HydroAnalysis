21140,otter boards are important device that provide a desired horizontal opening of a mid water trawl net high lift coefficients are essential for an otter board to maintain favorable fishing efficiency especially for fishing target like antarctic krill euphausia superba which is often found in layers very close to the sea surface response surface method rsm was used to optimize the parameters of a rectangular cambered otter board in this study the aspect ratio 0 8 2 0 maximum relative camber 2 18 and maximum camber position 10 50 were adopted as the independent variables hydrodynamic performances of twenty otter board models were simulated using numerical simulation results showed that rsm was applicable to describe the relationship between the selected variables and the maximum lift coefficient the maximum lift coefficient was significantly affected by these three variables an optimal otter was extracted in the optimal solutions and the optimal parameters of

initial otter board the relative error differed by only 1 6 from rsm model predictions which indicated the availability of the model experimentally keywords rectangular cambered otter board response surface method numerical simulation hydrodynamic characteristics 1 introduction otter boards are hydrodynamic wings operating at an angle of attack aoa to generate a pressure difference between the pressure and suction side of the board surfaces the otter boards generate a hydrodynamic lift spreading force that horizontally opening the trawl at the cost of creating a drag force that acting against the towing direction lift directly relates to the effectiveness drag relates to the energy consumption and lift to drag ratio characterizes the efficiency of the otter board balash and sterling 2014 during trawling operations otter boards account for approximately 10 30 of the drag force of the entire trawl system sterling and eayrs 2010 you et al 2020 in general high effectiveness and high efficiency are required in designing and optimizing otter boards over the years numerous model experiments have been carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the otter boards flat rectangular otter boards are inefficient with the lift to drag ratio around 1 05 at its operational aoa sfia and difta 1995 the v type otter board has a maximum lift to drag ratio of 2 20 at 15 aoa xu et al 2017 a the biplane otter board creates its maximum lift of 1 65 at a low aoa of 20 takahashi et al 2015 while the fundamentally different design of sail type batwing otter board generates a lift to drag ratio of 3 at the design aoa of 20 balash et al 2015 rectangular cambered otter board which is designed to high aspect ratio and hollow structures is used in the conventional trawl system of the chinese antarctic krill euphausia superba fishery for its low weight and high efficiency during fishing liu et al 2017 antarctic krill is recognized as one of the most pronounced aggregate marine invertebrates throughout large parts of its life cycle it occurs within 100 m of the sea surface in swarms marr 1962 hamner et al 1983 considering these biological and swarm characteristics of antarctic krill otter trawling should be operated at a low towing speed xu et al 2011 therefore the otter boards used in antarctic krill fishing need to generate a high lift at a low towing speed to improve catch efficiency wan et al 2019 as demonstrated by xu et al 2017 b and liu et al 2018 higher aspect ratio otter boards create maximum lifts at a lower aoa as a result higher lift to drag ratios are generated during the operation while camber surfaces foil shaped leading edge and slots can also greatly affect the performance of otter boards as shown by fukuda et al 1999 shen et al 2015 and wang et al 2017 in the present study the purpose was to improve the lift by optimizing parameters of the otter board to improve the hydrodynamic performances of otter boards single factor analysis orthogonal experiments response surface method and multi objective genetic algorithm methods are used to optimize parameters of otter boards takahashi et al 2017 xu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 balash

the distance between f max and leading edge of the otter board was x f whose value was 1 40 m for this model its relative values were calculated as eqs 1 and 2 1 f f max c 100 2 x f x f c 100 where f and x f stand for the maximum relative camber and maximum camber position respectively 2 2 experimental design based on the single factor experiment rsm was carried out to optimize the parameters of the otter board to obtain a high effectiveness lift otter board and central composite design method was used to design the experiment these methods helped to optimize parameters of the otter board

correlations between the dimensionless variables and maximum lift coefficients of the otter board were studied the actual results of c lmax were obtained and showed in table 2 it ranged from 0 928 to 2 283 within the range of the study in accordance with the sequential model zhang et al 2009 the cubic model was selected to investigate the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board and the final empirical equation in terms of coded factors of the c lmax y was obtained as eq 11 11 y 2 03 0 095 a 0 3 b 0 042 c 0 05 a b 0 004 a c 0 031 b c 0 011 a 2 0 12 b 2 0 056 c 2 0 031 a b c 0 021 a 2 b 0 075 a 2 c 0 007 a b 2 the validity of the model was demonstrated based on the results from analysis of variance anova the anova for the response surface cubic model of c lmax is shown in table 3 the value of r 2 for eq 11 was 0 9994 in the present study indicating that the total variation of 99 9 for the maximum lift coefficient can be attributed to the selected dimensionless variables which means that there was a good correlation between the experimental and predicted c lmax of the otter board the f value of the model and p value of the model were 808 35 and 0 0001 respectively implying that the model was extremely significant at the 95 confidence intervals adequacy of the model was inspected based on the lack of fit f value it showed that the lack of fit f value and lack of fit p value was greater than 0 05 which indicates that the lack of fit of the model was not significant compared to the pure error kong et al 2012 moreover the adeq precision measures the signal to noise ratio and a ratio greater than 4 is desirable mannan et al 2007 the ratio of 118 68 of the model in this study indicating that the model was able to describe the relationship between maximum lift coefficient and the selected variables table 4 shows the response relationships between the c lmax and the selected variables p values less than 0 05 means the model is significant in this case the coded factors of a b c ab bc a 2 b 2 c 2 abc a 2 b and a 2 c were significant model terms on the other hand the rest of the interaction terms ac and ab 2 were not significant to the response 3 2 analysis of response surface fig 4 shows the comparison of experimental values of c lmax measured by cfx and predicted values the color points calculated from the empirical equation mentioned above eq 11 a linear distribution was obtained which indicates an appropriate model lee et al 2010 based on fig 4 the predicted values were very close to the experimental values which shows that the model was suitable to describe the relevance between the dimensionless variables and maximum lift coefficients to analyze the influences of the dimensionless variables on the response values the three dimensional response surface using the cubic polynomial equation obtained from the regression analysis are shown in figs 5 and 6 fig 5 shows the influences of aspect ratio and maximum relative camber on the c lmax at the fixed maximum camber position of 30 the c lmax was significantly increased with an increasing maximum relative camber within the range of the study when the maximum relative camber increased from 6 to 14 there was an apparent effect on the c lmax and the maximum predicted value of c lmax was greater than 2 20 the f value of the maximum relative camber reached 3893 26 table 4 which indicates that the effect of the maximum relative camber was more significant than the aspect ratio under the same aspect ratio a higher maximum relative camber was beneficial to increase the lift coefficients of the otter boards fig 6 describes a 3d plot showing the effect of maximum relative camber and maximum camber position on the c lmax with a fixed aspect ratio of 1 60 when the maximum camber position increased from 20 to 40 there was no obvious effect on the c lmax based on the f values table 4 the maximum camber position had the smallest value of 74 44 which indicates that the maximum camber position was the least significant factor on the c lmax when compared to aspect ratio and maximum relative camber 3 3 optimization and validation based on the above analysis the optimal parameters of the otter board were predicted as follows aspect ratio of 2 0 maximum relative camber of 15 5 and maximum camber position of 35 1 under these conditions the predicted maximum lift coefficient of the optimal otter board was c lmax 2 333 to confirm the reliability of the optimized parameters numerical simulation was carried out to the optimal otter board consisted of the suggested parameters and hydrodynamic performance of the optimal otter board was researched and compared with the initial prototype otter board fig 7 shows the hydrodynamic coefficients of the optimal and initial otter boards lift coefficients of the optimal model were significantly higher than that of the initial otter board within the aoas studied when the otter boards attacked at the operating aoa i e 20 30 the lift to drag ratio was similar between the optimal and initial model which indicates that the optimal model can significantly improve the effectiveness of the otter board while maintaining efficiency the c lmax of the optimal and initial board were 2 296 and 1 905 respectively indicating that the c lmax was improved by 20 5 compared the value to the theoretical predicted value c lmax 2 333 according to eq 11 the relative error was only 1 6 as the aoa increased from 0 to 15 there was a diversity of location for the longitudinal centre of pressure cop x however when aoa was larger than 15 cop x for both the initial and optimal otter boards decreased and converged to about 40 of chord length c from the leading edge fig 8 cop x was similar between initial and optimal otter board when it was attacked at the working aoa range values of vertical centre of pressure cop z were stable within the ranged studied and converged to about 50 span length l from the top edge of the otter board 4 discussion rsm was used to optimize the parameters of an otter board and the final empirical equation was obtained as eq 11 in the present study based on the significance test values of r 2 and p value lee et al 2010 zi et al 2013 showed that the cubic model of the ccd was reliable in the present study the empirical equation by ccd predicted the optimal parameters of the otter board as aspect ratio of 2 0 maximum relative camber of 15 5 and maximum camber position of 35 1 according to the p values table 4 the selected three dimensionless variables were all significant factors that affect the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board based on the f values the maximum relative camber had the largest f value of 3893 26 in this study which implied that the relative camber was the most significant factor on the maximum lift coefficient when compared to aspect ratio and maximum camber position while the maximum camber position was the least significant factor for its smallest value of 74 44 according to eq 11 the predicted maximum lift coefficient of the otter board with predicted optimal parameter was 2 333 moreover the c lmax of the optimal otter board was calculated as 2 296 with a relative error of 1 6 compared to the predicted value therefore based on the response surface method the optimization of the parameters of the otter board was accurate and reliable implicating a good and practical application in otter board design the maximum lift coefficient of the optimal otter board was improve by 20 5 compared to that of the initial otter board while the lift to drag ratio was similar between the two otter boards fig 7 as a result the optimal otter board can significantly improve the effectiveness of the otter board while maintaining efficiency however the present study just researched the correlations between the selected parameters and the c lmax of the otter board while the drag coefficient was also an important coefficients for the performance of otter boards moreover response surfaces and parameter optimization of the otter board based on multiple dependent variables need to be studied in the further study 5 conclusions parameters of the otter board were optimized using response surface method and the hydrodynamic performance was investigated numerically based on the finite volume method based on ccd experiments an optimal otter board was obtained and the conclusions of the study were drawn as follows 1 aspect ratio maximum relative camber and maximum camber position were all significant factors affecting the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board for these three factors maximum relative camber was the most significant factor followed by aspect ratio and finally the maximum camber position 2 according to ccd experiments and response surface analysis the optimal parameters of the otter board were obtained as aspect ratio of 2 0 maximum relative camber of 15 5 and maximum camber position of 35 1 3 the maximum lift coefficient of the optimized otter board was improved by 20 5 compared to the prototype otter board credit authorship contribution statement

cop x however when aoa was larger than 15 cop x for both the initial and optimal otter boards decreased and converged to about 40 of chord length c from the leading edge fig 8 cop x was similar between initial and optimal otter board when it was attacked at the working aoa range values of vertical centre of pressure cop z were stable within the ranged studied and converged to about 50 span length l from the top edge of the otter board 4 discussion rsm was used to optimize the parameters of an otter board and the final empirical equation was obtained as eq 11 in the present study based on the significance test values of r 2 and p value lee et al 2010 zi et al 2013 showed that the cubic model of the ccd was reliable in the present study the empirical equation by ccd predicted the optimal parameters of the otter board as aspect ratio of 2 0 maximum relative camber of 15 5 and maximum camber position of 35 1 according to the p values table 4 the selected three dimensionless variables were all significant factors that affect the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board based on the f values the maximum relative camber had the largest f value of 3893 26 in this study which implied that the relative camber was the most significant factor on the maximum lift coefficient when compared to aspect ratio and maximum camber position while the maximum camber position was the least significant factor for its smallest value of 74 44 according to eq 11 the predicted maximum lift coefficient of the otter board with predicted optimal parameter was 2 333 moreover the c lmax of the optimal otter board was calculated as 2 296 with a relative error of 1 6 compared to the predicted value therefore based on the response surface method the optimization of the parameters of the otter board was accurate and reliable implicating a good and practical application in otter board design the maximum lift coefficient of the optimal otter board was improve by 20 5 compared to that of the initial otter board while the lift to drag ratio was similar between the two otter boards fig 7 as a result the optimal otter board can significantly improve the effectiveness of the otter board while maintaining efficiency however the present study just researched the correlations between the selected parameters and the c lmax of the otter board while the drag coefficient was also an important coefficients for the performance of otter boards moreover response surfaces and parameter optimization of the otter board based on multiple dependent variables need to be studied in the further study 5 conclusions parameters of the otter board were optimized using response surface method and the hydrodynamic performance was investigated numerically based on the finite volume method based on ccd experiments an optimal otter board was obtained and the conclusions of the study were drawn as follows 1 aspect ratio maximum relative camber and maximum camber position were all significant factors affecting the maximum lift coefficient of the otter board for these three factors maximum relative camber was the most significant factor followed by aspect ratio and finally the maximum camber position 2 according to ccd experiments and response surface analysis the optimal parameters of the otter board were obtained as aspect ratio of 2 0 maximum relative camber of 15 5 and maximum camber position of 35 1 3 the maximum lift coefficient of the optimized otter board was improved by 20 5 compared to the prototype otter board credit authorship contribution statement

21141,liquid sloshing in square or nearly square base tanks becomes more complex due to the emergence of three dimensional waves around resonance because of symmetrical base in a square tank two predominant sloshing modes along the plane of excitation and orthogonal to the excitation plane simultaneously emerge even if the tank is resonantly excited in one direction for relatively small liquid depth nonlinear effects shift the resonant sloshing frequency so the effectiveness of devices tuned liquid dampers designed based on the linear theory will be affected the present study investigates the existence of the sloshing wave systems and their frequency bounds with an extensive experimental data the tank is subjected to horizontal harmonic excitation for a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes sloshing induces different wave systems which depend on excitation frequency excitation amplitude and liquid depth the main focus is to determine the frequency bound of swirling waves for a range of excitation amplitudes and liquid depths it has been found that the frequency bound of swirling increases with excitation amplitude keywords sloshing square tank frequency bound swirling 1 introduction the effect of liquid free surface oscillation or sloshing can be seen in several engineering devices such as liquefied natural gas lng containers liquid ballast tanks of ship liquid metal cooled reactor vessels oil storage tanks and trucks carrying liquid extensive studies have been conducted by several researchers to analyze the two dimensional sloshing in rectangular tank however when the tank length and width become significantly close three dimensional waves can emerge around the resonant excitation in that case the respective natural frequencies of free surface oscillation along the tank length and width become closer and they induce complex resonance similarly nonlinear three dimensional wave motions and swirling also known as rotary sloshing can be observed in upright cylindrical and spherical tanks a comprehensive review on sloshing dynamics in various tank geometries can be referred in ibrahim 2005 and faltinsen et al 2009 due to complex behaviour of sloshing the studies on square tank became popular among several researchers most of the initial studies silber et al 1989 feng et al 1989 simonelli et al 1989 henderson et al 1990 crawford 1991 nagata 1991 miles 1994 perlin et al 2000 are focused on parametric sloshing or faraday waves appears in a vertically excited tank with a forcing frequency nearly equals to twice the natural frequency of free surface oscillation there are also few studies bridges 1986 1987 bryant et al 1994 1995 related to free sloshing in deep square basin later advanced investigations waterhouse 1994 ockendon et al 1996 yoshimatsu et al 2001 faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a 2005 b 2006 a 2006 b 2017 ikeda et al 2012 on resonant sloshing in horizontally excited square containers are reported the pioneer studies bridges 1987 simonelli et al 1989 yoshimatsu et al 2001 bryant 1993 have mainly focused on bifurcation and linear stability analyses the effects of degeneracy existence of two or more modes of free surface oscillation for the same frequency and commensurability natural frequencies of the sloshing modes are rationally related to each other on the free surface evolution bridges 1987 found from the theoretical analysis that the perturbation of double eigenvalues natural frequencies results in a secondary bifurcation of periodic solutions which lead to change in surface wave field however he has not reported the existence of swirling in his study the effects of geometric symmetry and degeneracy on the free surface mode interactions have been reported by simonelli et al 1989 further silber et al 1989 have qualitatively reproduced the results of simonelli et al 1989 using theoretical study having motivated by the work of gu et al 1987 feng et al 1989 have investigated the resonant surface waves in a nearly square container subjected to vertical oscillation and they verified the conclusions of simonelli et al 1989 bryant 1993 has presented the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear time evolution of surface waves ockendon and ockendon 2001 highlighted the effect of commensurability and degeneracy on resonant sloshing yoshimatsu et al 2001 examined resonant sloshing in case of infinite liquid depth they reported that the bifurcations of the stationary solutions for a square tank are a little more complicated than those for a circular cylinder la rocca et al 1997 2000 have developed the variational method to model 2d and 3d nonlinear sloshing wave systems multi modal theory has been extensively used to investigate the wave systems in square base tanks with finite liquid depth in fact faltinsen and co researchers have advanced the multimodal techniques to classify the effective frequency range of different sloshing wave systems they found that swirling is the sole common wave phenomenon in a square tank subjected to longitudinal and diagonal excitations using asymptotic modal system faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a it has been found that the effective frequency range of stable steady state motion as a function of liquid depth and forcing amplitude in order to improve the theoretical model faltinsen et al 2005 b proposed a modified modal system namely adaptive modal system which accounts for linear viscous damping in dominant modes faltinsen et al 2006 a have addressed a few limitations of earlier studies faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a by using the adaptive asymptotic nonlinear modal system and studied the effect of small perturbation of tank base ratio on the effective frequency range for different wave systems later on royon lebeaud et al 2007 experimentally verified that the frequency bounds of different wave regimes agree qualitatively with findings of faltinsen et al 2003 recently faltinsen et al 2017 used narimanov moiseev asymptotic modal model with linear viscous damping terms due to damping effects it has been found that the regime of square like standing wave fully disappears and being replaced by the regime of swirling though the multi modal theory predicts several phenomena it is limited for finite liquid depth and small excitation amplitude further the theory does not account the local phenomena such as run up breaking at walls overturning waves and roof impacts faltinsen et al 2003 theory is also limited in quantifying the effective frequency range of different wave systems for small excitation amplitude there are few studies available on shallow water sloshing in square tanks frandsen et al 2006 have experimentally studied the sloshing in a square tank with water depth to tank length ratios 0 2 0 3 and 0 6 and observed that the free surface behaves as a hard spring oscillator for shallow water depth ratio 0 2 ikeda et al 2013 have theoretically studied the nonlinear sloshing in square tanks subjected to horizontal random excitation for the water depth to tank length ratios 0 28 0 34 and 0 6 for water depth ratio 0 28 they found that the peak of mean square response shifts to the right of the centre frequency that shows the hard spring behaviour further they reported that the auto parametric interaction becomes less effective as the water depth decreases zhang et al 2018 numerically analyzed the secondary resonance in square base tanks subjected to the circular orbit motion for water depth to tank length ratios 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 during the secondary resonance they observed three typical wave systems swirling wave standing wave and double peak travelling wave they reported that the wave in shallower tank increases its amplitude more rapidly at secondary resonance chern et al 2012 shown that in shallow water containers of nearly square base with aspect ratio 1 1111 and square base with aspect ratio 1 the pattern of wave systems strongly depends on the tank aspect ratio they have limited their study for small non dimensional excitation amplitudes 0 001 and 0 01 even though the earlier studies chern et al 2012 ikeda et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 explore several nonlinear phenomena they are limited to small excitation amplitude the local phenomena have not been accounted in the theoretical models they fail to predict shallow water sloshing response for high excitation amplitude at which local phenomena dominate the rectangular tuned liquid dampers tlds have conventionally been used for structural vibration control hence most of the researchers bauer 1984 fujino et al 1992 anderson et al 2000 tait 2008 faltinsen et al 2011 turner et al 2013 gurusamy et al 2017 2019 focused on rectangular tanks however recently a few studies on auto parametric vibration absorbers using square tanks have been conducted ikeda 2010 has studied the response control of flexible structures based on the concept of internal resonance in a square tank he has showed that the square tld was more effective than the conventional rectangular tld in controlling the structural vibration ikeda et al 2017 a have improved the theoretical model ikeda 2010 by considering the sloshing coupled mode very recently ikeda et al 2017 b have reported a study on vibration control of two degrees of freedom structure using square and nearly square base tanks even though a lot of studies on sloshing tanks of different geometries available in the literature the research pertaining to square and nearly square tanks subjected to horizontal excitation are limited the existing theories in literature are valid for small excitation amplitude only the nonlinear characteristics of shallow water sloshing in square or nearly square tanks subjected to horizontal excitation are not explored in detail further according to author s best knowledge the effect of large excitation amplitude on shallow water sloshing in square tank is not explored much as proved by ikeda 2017 b that square tank shows better result as a tld in comparison to rectangular tanks so the study on square tank behaviour have importance in research also the possibility of being a non perfect square geometry due to practical constraints makes it more vulnerable in the sense of response behaviour therefore having identified the limitations of the theoretical models the present study is aimed to comprehend the nonlinear wave systems in a square tank through experiments the main objective of the present study is to quantify the frequency bounds of wave systems particularly swirling wave systems in a square base tank the highlights of the present study as follows to carry out an extensive experimental campaign for classification of different wave systems under the influence of excitation frequency and excitation amplitude to understand the sloshing responses around resonance zone for a wide range of excitation amplitudes to establish the frequency bounds of swirling wave as a function of excitation amplitude for a range of liquid depths 2 theoretical background on sloshing in a square base tank consider a square tank with l1 l2 l and liquid depth h as shown in fig 1 a based on the linear theory faltinsen and timokha 2009 the natural frequency of sloshing mode i j in a square basin can be derived as follows 1 f i j 1 2 π g λ i j tanh λ i j h for i j 0 2 where λ i j π i l 1 2 j l 2 2 for i j 0 the corresponding natural modes of sloshing are given as follows 3 φ i j x y z φ i x ϕ j y cosh z h λ i j cosh λ i j h where φ i x cos i π x l 1 2 l 1 and ϕ j y cos j π y l 2 2 l 2 in a square tank the natural frequencies of the sloshing modes 1 0 and 0 1 become equal and they satisfy the internal resonance condition though the external excitation directly excites only one mode both 1 0 and 0 1 modes emerge because they are degenerate modes and nonlinearly coupled with each other this phenomenon is known as auto parametric resonance ikeda et al 2017 a the wave profiles can be determined by the expressions φ i j x y z on z 0 4 φ i j x y 0 φ i x ϕ j y faltinsen et al 2003 have developed an asymptotic modal system to model sloshing in a square tank subjected to longitudinal harmonic excitation they have obtained the analytical expressions for three possible steady state waves the linear theory is valid for relatively deep water depths and small non dimensional excitation amplitudes ε 0 01 and further the non linear corrections can be referred in faltinsen and timokha 2009 5 1 planar wave φ x y t a φ 1 x cos σ t o ε 1 3 6 2 diagonal

the liquid square tank and its top view the points p1 and p2 denote the location at which the free surface elevation can be predicted fig 2 exhibits the theoretical prediction faltinsen et al 2003 of parametric curves for different wave systems as given in eqs 5 7 and the curves are not drawn with scale 3 experimental setup and procedure in order to conduct the sloshing experiments a unidirectional shake table is used to excite the liquid tank the shake table is capable of generating harmonic excitation at varying frequencies and amplitudes to ensure the accuracy of excitation amplitude and frequency of the shake table a linear variable differential transformer lvdt is also fixed at the edge of the shake table the shake table has limitation of providing maximum displacement up to 50 mm the displacement time history of lvdt is utilized to check the amplitude and frequency of the displacement of shake table fig 3 shows the experimental setup along with other essential equipments a square base tank of length l1 0 291 m width l2 0 288 m l1 l2 1 0104 and height h 0 375 m is prepared using acrylic material with 12 mm thickness to avoid the hydro elastic effects the container is closed on the top and filled with tap water with blue coloured ink to the required depth the global response of free surface has been recorded by video with 30 fps the recorded images are also useful to analyze the local phenomena near the tank walls as shown in fig 3 wave gauges are used to measure the free surface response the wave gauge consists of two 3 mm diameter stainless steel wires spaced 10 mm apart wave gauges have been calibrated at each test and they are positioned at 10 mm away from the tank wall from static calibrations and repeated experimental tests it has been found that the measurement of the wave gauges has less than 1 error wave gauges are connected to the data acquisition system oscilloscope through wave meter a single wave gauge is fixed on each side of the tank fig 4 shows the locations of two wave gauges which are orthogonally placed this arrangement of wave gauges are useful in identifying the three dimensional free surface response the sampling frequency of data acquisition system is kept at 100 hz to ensure that sharp fluctuation in free surface response is captured in total around 700 experimental tests have been conducted by varying excitation amplitude and frequency as the experimental test cases are large in number most of the tests have been performed thrice and few cases are repeated twice to confirm the wave systems either two or three dimensional waves for each excitation frequency the experimental test has been carried out for more than 120 s for non breaking sloshing motions the steady state was reached after about 60 s in case of breaking motions the response attains only its quasi steady state for the acquired data low pass filter of order 5 and cut off frequency 7 hz has been applied for post processing and the sloshing responses of all test cases are processed using matlab table 1 shows the experimental test cases with different parameters the water depth ratio h l covers relatively shallow intermediate and relatively deep water cases to understand the effect of excitation amplitude ratio a l on the free surface response the excitation amplitude a varies from very small to high value of 50 mm considered the limitation of shake table 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 sloshing response for small excitation amplitude let β fe f 1 0 denote the ratio of excitation frequency to the first modal sloshing frequency f 1 0 a l denotes the non dimensional excitation amplitude normalized with tank length and h l denotes dispersion parameter which is the ratio of water depth to tank length fig 5 shows the steady state sloshing response η1 measured at p1 for different excitation frequency ratios β for h l 0 1718 and a l 0 01718 as β increases gradually different wave systems are observed at relatively low excitation frequency ratios β 0 7748 and 0 8135 a standing wave along the plane of excitation is noticed at β 0 8523 the standing wave response changes to the small amplitude travelling waves at β 0 8910 three dimensional wave is observed 2fe is very close to both the sloshing frequencies f 2 0 and f 0 2 this causes the secondary resonance however for β 0 9297 the response changes to a planar travelling wave along the plane of excitation and the beat effect is also observed for β 0 9879 the beat effect disappears and the response remains as a planar travelling wave around the resonant excitation β 1 0266 a diagonal wave system is observed where fe is very close to both f 1 0 and f 0 1 for β 1 0653 the response changes to a planar travelling wave and the free surface reaches its maximum elevation moreover one can note that soon after the resonance the response magnitude reduces drastically for β 1 1234 further the increase in β shows that the response to be a planar travelling wave the time histories of sloshing response η2 measured at station p2 for the same experimental test as considered in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 from figs 5 and 6 it is observed that the magnitude of η2 is relatively smaller than that of η1 this is because of p2 which is located at the wall perpendicular to the plane of excitation at relatively low β s 0 7748 and 0 8135 the response magnitude is almost negligible a gradual increase in β towards the resonant zone develops different wave systems and amplifies the response at p2 the response η2 reaches its peak at β 1 0266 however for η1 the maximum elevation has been achieved at β 1 0653 the reason is that the frequency of free surface oscillation along the tank length f 1 0 1 1498 hz is slightly smaller than the frequency f 0 1 1 1608 hz of free surface oscillation along the tank width the parametric curves of sloshing response are plotted in the η1 η2 plane as shown in fig 7 for relatively low β s 0 7748 and 0 8135 the response curve is nearly a finite horizontal strip representing a planar wave along the plane of excitation in particular at these low frequency ratios β 1 the free surface motion along the plane of excitation is predominant as it is directly being excited however as β increases towards the primary resonance zone the free surface motion along tank width l2 also gets activated through auto parametric interaction hence the different shapes of parametric curves arise around the resonant region at β 0 8910 a small closed trajectory representing a three dimensional wave is noticed further the increase in β 0 9297 and 0 9879 transforms the three dimensional wave to the progressive waves along the plane of excitation at β 1 0266 the set of frequencies fe f 1 0 f 0 1 follow the ratio of 1 1 1 approximately and the diagonal wave is being induced due to the nonlinear coupling between the sloshing modes the sense of the trajectory indicates that the diagonal wave occurs in the clockwise direction further a gradual increase in β leads to the dominant response along the plane of excitation and so the parametric curves become approximately horizontal strips from fig 7 it can be inferred that the significant energy transfer between the sloshing modes i 0 and 0 j takes place around the resonant region due to auto parametric interaction further the images of different wave systems are exhibited in fig 8 fourier amplitudes absolute values of the fft of free surface response η1 are shown in fig 9 near resonance it is generally observed that the dominant peaks emerge at excitation frequency fe and its positive integral multiples however it happens that the higher harmonics of fe excite the natural frequencies of sloshing f i j in many cases where the multiple of fe become closer to the natural frequency of sloshing from fft analysis it has been found that for two dimensional planar wave along the plane of excitation the primary frequencies f i 0 contribute and for three dimensional wave systems the coupled frequencies f i j i 0 and j 0 influence the responses for β 0 7748 0 8135 0 8523 0 9297 0 9879 1 0653 1 1234 1 1622 1 2009 and 1 2396 the primary frequencies f i 0 and the multiples of fe emerge at β 0 7748 the sloshing natural frequencies f i 0 for i 1 2 3 5 7 11 have also been excited along with fe and 2fe further it is observed that 3fe is close to f 3 0 and causes the secondary resonance at β 0 9297 a beat phenomenon is noticed with the beat frequency 0 1114 hz which is very close to fe f 1 0 further for β 1 0653 it is noticed that the fourier amplitude emerges at fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 7 2 of fe in this case 1 2 fe is close to 1 2 f 1 0 and 7 2 fe is close to f 7 0 these modal relations cause the secondary resonances due to the sloshing modes 1 0 and 7 0 referring to fig 7 the parametric graphs for β 0 8910 and 1 0266 show that the three dimensional effects in responses fft analysis also confirms the three dimensional effects at β 0 8910 the frequencies f 0 2 f 3 2 f 6 2 f 10 1 f 14 3 emerge and indicate the existence of coupled wave system similarly for β 1 0266 the coupled frequencies f 4 3 f 8 2 f 13 2 emerge the numerical values of sloshing frequencies can be referred in the tables given in the appendix fourier amplitudes of free surface response η2 are shown in fig 10 on comparison of figs 9 and 10 it has been seen that the dominant frequencies of η1 and η2 are the same the reason is that the same free surface wave is being observed at two different locations p1 and p2 in fig 9 the dominant peak is noticed at fe for all β s however in fig 10 the peak at 2fe is predominant than the peak at fe for all cases except at β 1 0266 the reason is that the station p2 is located at mid point of tank side wall as seen in fig 4 hence for a planar travelling wave with a given time interval the number of crests observed at station p2 is twice the number of crests observed at p1 this can be clearly identified by comparing the time history subplots in figs 5 and 6 the location of measurement just causes the dominant frequency to be 2fe for η2 in case of β 1 0266 a diagonal wave system is observed therefore at p1 and p2 the same number of crests is being observed for a given time span 4 2 sloshing response for moderate excitation amplitude the time evolution of η1 and η2 are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively for h l 0 1718 with excitation amplitude a l 0 0687 in fig 11 for β 0 5036 the response shows super harmonic resonance because fe is close to 1 2 f 1 0 with a gradual increase in β distinct wave systems are induced in the sloshing tank in fig 12 it is seen that from β 0 5423 to 0 7167 the response magnitude is negligible the reason is that the free surface response is the travelling wave along the plane of excitation and so the magnitude of η2 is insignificant due to the poor auto parametric interaction comparison of the sub plots in figs 11 and 12 for β 0 9879 to β 1 1234 shows that the number of peaks observed at stations p1 and p2 is the same but for other cases of β the number of peaks measured at p2 is double the number of peaks at p1 the reason is that wave crest travelling back and forth between the walls along the plane of excitation meets once at p1 and twice at p2 for a cycle for β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 swirling wave is observed soon after this swirling region the response changes to an irregular wave motion along the plane of excitation hence for β 1 1622 to 1 3752 the magnitude of η2 reduces drastically than that of η1 a comparison of figs 11 and 12 for β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 ensures that the strong auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes 1 0 and 0 1 takes place around the resonance zone fig 13 shows the fourier amplitudes of free surface response η1 the multiples of fe and higher natural frequencies of sloshing emerge in the fft plots for relatively small β s 0 5036 0 5423 0 6004 0 6392 0 6779 0 7167 the natural frequencies of sloshing f i 0 and higher harmonics of fe participate and show that the responses are of two dimensional wave systems as the excitation frequency increases towards the primary resonance the coupled frequencies also contribute for the sloshing responses for β 0 5036 where 2fe very close to f 1 0 the dominant peak is observed at f 1 0 due to the super harmonic resonance at β 0 6004 the sloshing frequencies f 2 0 and f 3 0 are being excited as they become very close to 3fe and 4fe respectively for β 0 9879 fe is very close to f 1 0 and the multiples of fe excites the sloshing coupled modes 2 1 4 2 7 3 through the secondary resonance for β 1 0266 1 0653 1 1234 the coupled frequencies contribute for the sloshing responses and indicate the existence of strong three dimensional wave systems the corresponding parametric graphs will be discussed in fig 14 and indicate the swirling waves for β 1 1622 1 2009 and 1 2396 the fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 of fe also contribute in the sloshing responses which indicate both the sub harmonic and super harmonic resonances in sloshing tank with relatively low water depth the increase in excitation amplitude causes several nonlinear phenomena including sub harmonic resonances the small peak at 1 2fe might appear due to unsteady state travelling waves the contribution of fractional harmonics 1 2fe 3 2fe for the sloshing responses has also been reported by nasar et al 2008 and gurusamy et al 2020 at β 1 1622 the higher harmonics 2fe 5 2 fe 3fe 7 2 fe and 4fe are close to the frequencies f 3 0 f 3 3 f 6 0 f 8 2 and f 10 3 respectively for β 1 2977 1 3364 and 1 3752 fe is close to the lowest coupled frequency f 1 1 for these β s the higher sloshing frequencies are being excited with fluctuating fourier amplitudes it has been noticed that when the multiple of fe becomes close to the sloshing frequency the peak of fourier amplitude gets magnified from this discussion one can comprehend that the secondary resonance causes the fluctuating envelope of fourier amplitudes the parametric curves in η1 η2 plane are shown in fig 14 for a range of β s with h l 0 1718 and a l 0 0687 for β 0 5036 the super harmonic resonance develops and the response is a planar travelling wave with relatively large magnitude for β 0 5423 to 0 7167 the response curve is nearly a finite horizontal strip which represents a planar travelling wave with relatively large amplitude of η1 than η2 for relatively high β s different shapes of response curve emerge due to the effects of lateral waves from experimental videos for β 0 7748 and 0 8135 the sloshing response is observed to be the hydraulic jump with lateral wave effects it has been observed that a lumped liquid mass travels between the tank walls in fact the wave front starts from one end wall and travels towards the other end wall such a phenomenon of travelling lumped liquid mass is known as hydraulic jump and the image of a hydraulic jump can be seen in fig 17 d this phenomenon can also be referred in faltinsen and timokha 2009 and gurusamy et al 2020 for β 0 8523 the response shows the strong hydraulic jump with run up on the tank walls and very minimal lateral wave effects in fact a lumped like water mass travels back and forth between the tank walls along the plane of excitation for β 0 8910 and 0 9297 the hydraulic jump travels between the tank walls with breaking plunging type wave front and significant lateral wave effects a gradual increase in β induces different wave systems for β 0 9879 the response changes to a diagonal wave with breaking at corners in the resonant region β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 the parametric curves show the closed trajectories which represent the swirling waves due to the nonlinear coupling between the sloshing modes royon lebeaud et al 2007 the sense of the trajectories indicates that the swirling wave occurs in the clockwise direction for β 1 0266 the curve looks like a right angled triangle and it further evolves like a semi circle for β 1 0653 and 1 1234 the theoretical analysis faltinsen et al 2003 predicts the parametric curve to be ellipse or circle for swirling waves but the experimental response curves deviate from being the perfect ellipse or circle this may be due to the nonlinear effects and local phenomena of free surface further the nonlinear effects due to breaking are not accounted in the theory which is developed for relatively finite water depths beyond the resonance zone the response curves become almost a finite horizontal strip which can be seen for β 1 1622 to 1 2396 in fig 14 these finite strips represent the travelling wave with run up and mild breaking at walls for β 1 2977 1 3364 and 1 3752 the corresponding excitation frequencies fe 1 49209 hz 1 53659 and 1 5812 hz respectively are close to the coupled frequency f 1 1 1 56886 hz hence the sloshing coupled mode 1 1 induces the three dimensional effects in the responses 4 3 sloshing response for relatively large excitation amplitude in order to study the effects of large excitation amplitude on resonant sloshing a l is increased to 0 1718 and h l is kept as 0 1718 the parametric curves of sloshing response are plotted in fig 15 the sense of the trajectories indicates that the diagonal wave and swirling wave occur in the clockwise direction comparison of the curves in fig 15 with figs 7 and 14 shows the effects of excitation amplitude on effective frequency bound of swirling waves for relatively small excitation amplitude as shown in fig 7 the parametric curves do not show any closed loop trajectories of circular or semicircular shape around the resonant region in case of moderate excitation amplitude closed loop trajectories of triangular and semi circular shapes are noticed for a frequency ratio range of β 1 0266 to 1 1234 as shown in fig 14 for relatively large excitation amplitude as seen in fig 15 the closed loop trajectories of semi circular shape exist for β 0 9879 to 1 2396 further at β 1 0266 the diagonal wave response as in fig 7 evolves as a swirling wave as in fig 14 and it further develops as a stronger swirling motion as in fig 15 as a l increases it has been observed that the effective frequency bound of swirling waves widens and shifts towards the higher frequency range with increase in excitation amplitude this phenomenon reflects that swirling has a hard spring nonlinear behaviour royon lebeaud et al 2007 have also reported the hard spring behaviour of swirling waves in an upright cylindrical tank 4 4 frequency bounds of sloshing wave systems the frequency bounds of sloshing wave systems for h l 0 1718 and different a l are shown in fig 16 it can be viewed that different wave systems develop as a l increases it can also be identified that for a fixed β the free surface response evolves into different wave systems as a l varies further the frequency bounds of different wave systems also change with a l at very low values of a l 0 01718 and 0 03436 the swirling wave does not exist at all as a l increases swirling develops around the resonant zone for a l 0 0687 0 1031 0 1375 and 0 1718 the lower bound of swirling is found to be β 1 0266 however the upper bound generally increases with increase in a l which shows that the swirling has hard spring behaviour similarly the bounds of diagonal wave system also increase slowly as a l increases for a l 0 03436 0 0687 0 1031 0 1375 and 0 1718 the hydraulic jump occurs around the resonance zone the bound of hydraulic jump also increases with increase in a l and hydraulic jump behaves like a soft spring at high excitation amplitude the experimental images of dominant sloshing wave systems are also shown in fig 17 the images from a g in fig 17 show the snapshots of the steady state response for h l a l 0 1718 images h and i are the response snapshots for h l 0 1718 and a l 0 0687 based on the experimental results the dominant wave systems are classified as follows a planar standing wave without breaking for β 0 2461 b planar travelling wave without breaking for β 0 4718 c travelling wave with mild breaking at walls for β 0 6392 d hydraulic jump with plunging breaking front for β 0 7748 e diagonal wave with breaking front for β 0 9297 f swirling wave with breaking front for β 1 1234 g irregular motion with breaking and 3d effects for β 1 2977 h non planar travelling wave without breaking for β 0 7748 i travelling with run up and 3d effects for β 1 2009 4 5 effect of liquid depth on swirling wave systems liquid depth in containers plays a key role in sloshing behaviour due to high energy dissipation relatively shallow water is preferred for the effective design of tlds for structural vibration control anderson et al 2000 so the investigation of sloshing response under the influence of liquid depth is also essential in terms of its practical relevance hence the present study also examines the free surface response for different liquid depths satisfying deep and relatively shallow water conditions the effect of relatively low water depth on sloshing behaviour has been discussed already in this section the influence of intermediate and relatively deep water depths on swirling responses will be discussed fig 18 shows the parametric curves for different β s around the resonant region for h l 0 3092 and a l 0 1718 the parametric curve of swirling is observed for a range β 0 8324 to 1 2880 the shape of the area encompassed by the closed curves varies significantly this may be due to several phenomena such as run up on the walls the nature of breaking wave front and the liquid mass participation in the rotary motions now it is worth to mention that in the liquid tank the entire liquid column does not participate in the sloshing oscillations a part of liquid mass at the bottom moves in unison with the tank ibrahim 2005 the liquid mass which participates in the sloshing motions depends on both excitation frequency and excitation amplitude from the experiments it is visually observed that the liquid mass participation for swirling mode increases with increase in β and then decreases gradually up to the collapse frequency where the swirling mode switches to other wave system after swirling regime the irregular motion with breaking has been observed for a range of excitation frequencies β 1 3193 to 1 5393 the parametric graphs for deep water sloshing are shown in fig 19 for h l 0 5154 and a l 0 1718 at β 0 7777 a diagonal wave is observed and its parametric curve shows the pattern which is similar to the theoretical prediction faltinsen et al 2003 for β 0 8202 and 0 8484 the response switches between the diagonal wave and swirling a further increase in β results in developing the swirling mode for a wide range of frequency ratios β 0 8768 to 1 3576 the swirling waves are observed the lower bound is found to be β 0 8768 where swirling starts occurring and the upper bound is β 1 357 beyond the upper bound swirling disappears and the response transforms to irregular motion for relatively high frequency ratios β 1 3010 to 1 3576 the area enclosed by the closed curves become small this indicates that the swirling mode loses its strength gradually and becomes weaker as fe increases up to the collapse frequency of swirling the comparison of figs 15 18 and 19 shows the effects of liquid depth on swirling wave systems as the liquid depth increases the shape of parametric curves of swirling wave changes significantly at low liquid depth ratio h l 0 1718 the curves look like triangular or semi circular ones and they evolve as nearly circular ones for relatively high liquid depth ratio h l 0 5154 further it has been found that the increase in liquid depth increases the upper bound of swirling 4 6 theoretical comparison of wave regimes of deep water sloshing fig 20 shows the theoretical faltinsen et al 2005 a prediction of steady state wave regimes of sloshing response for relatively deep water case with h l 0 5 and a l 0 00817 fig 21 shows present experimental observation of steady state wave regimes for h l 0 5154 and a l 0 01718 the water depths considered in fig 20 and in fig 21 are almost the same relatively deep water hence it is expected that the excitation amplitude does not change the sloshing wave regimes significantly further the excitation amplitudes and water depths considered in figs 20 and 21 ensure that the applicability of linear theory therefore though the value of a l in fig 21 is twice that in fig 20 the wave regimes for both cases are compared further fig 20 has not been used to confirm the validity of fig 21 but it qualitatively compares the frequency bounds of wave systems not the numerical values associated with wave systems the experimental observation of planar wave regimes is in good agreement with theoretical prediction the range of swirling motion observed from experiments is slightly higher than the range predicted by the theory this may be due to the difference in excitation amplitude further for β 1 0323 it is noticed that the direction of swirling motion switches between clockwise and counter clockwise directions the exact mechanism of switch of direction of swirling waves is not clear in the literature however there are many possible reasons initial conditions of shake table faltinsen et al 2003 local phenomena such as breaking and run up processes faltinsen et al 2005a and the phase lag between the external force and sloshing force for β 0 945 theory faltinsen et al 2005 a predicts that the response to be a chaotic motion however the present experiment for β 0 9474 shows that the response switches between diagonal wave and swirling and the direction of motion also switches between clockwise and counter clockwise directions fig 22 a and b show the time histories of responses η1 and η2 for β 0 9474 for a better presentation short time histories are plotted here it is observed that the wave motion along the plane of excitation exists in the beginning then due to auto parametric interaction the wave motion along the lateral direction also gets activated after 7 5 s approximately this auto parametric interaction continues till 20 s and then weakens in the interval 20 s 32 5 s beyond 32 5 s the auto parametric interaction again gets activated and so η2 has comparable magnitude with that of η1 the auto parametric interaction induces different wave systems for β 0 9474 in order to identify the different wave systems the time histories of η1 and η2 are partitioned into appropriate segments which are used to plot the parametric curves fig 23 shows the parametric curves obtained from the different time segments of the pair η1 η2 the sequential occurrence of planar wave 0 s 7 s diagonal wave 7 5 s 10 s and swirling wave 10 25 s 15 s is shown in fig 23 a by using parametric curves which are superimposed on the same plane continuing from fig 23 a the parametric curves of diagonal wave 15 5 s 18 s and planar wave 18 75 s 21 25 s are shown in fig 23 b however the planar wave continues to occur for about 32 s approximately further in fig 23 c the response changes from planar wave to diagonal wave 33 s 35 s followed by swirling wave 35 05 s 37 5 s the corresponding parametric curves are superimposed on the same plane further it has been observed that the switching of wave systems continues even for sufficiently long time about 120 s the possible reason for the transition or switch of wave systems is the nonlinear auto parametric interaction nonlinear energy transfer between the primary sloshing modes i 0 and the orthogonal sloshing modes 0 j in fig 24 the experimental images of response for different time instances are shown initially the response is planar wave and then transforms to a diagonal wave the image of the same is shown at t 8 76 s the clockwise swirling is observed from t 10 3 s 10 96 s with local breaking in the vicinity of the wave crest transition from one wave system to other takes place as time marches the counter clockwise swirling is observed from t 46 6 s 47 26 s further counter clockwise swirling is followed by planar and diagonal waves the image of counter clockwise diagonal wave is shown at t 68 66 s the images labelled for t 10 3 s t 10 43 s t 10 5 s t 10 96 s show that the frequency of swirling is 1 5151 hz which is very close to fe 1 4920 hz further the images for t 46 6 s t 46 8sec t 46 9 s t 47 26 s show that the frequency of counter clockwise swirling is 1 5151 hz which is very close to fe 1 4920 hz 4 7 frequency bounds of swirling wave systems from earlier analysis it has been noticed that the swirling waves occurs for a band of excitation frequencies around the primary resonant zone fig 25 shows the frequency bounds of swirling for a range of a l and different h l the bounds emphasize the robustness of the swirling wave system for a given h l and relatively large a l once the swirling is developed it is being maintained up to large excitation frequencies the similar finding is reported by royon lebeaud et al 2007 for an upright cylindrical tank regardless of h l the effective frequency bound of swirling is very narrow for small excitation amplitudes and it widens as the excitation amplitude increases however for a given h l as a l increases the upper bound increases significantly than the lower bound for instance when h l 0 4123 and a l 0 1718 the upper bound increases to β 1 3485 about 34 larger than f 1 0 and the lower bound goes only up to β 0 9468 about 5 smaller than f 1 0 in general it can be seen that for a given a l the swirling bounds shrink as h l decreases this indicates that the auto parametric interaction is not effective for small values of h l ikeda et al 2013 have reported the similar observation on the influence of filling level on auto parametric interaction it has been observed that for very low water depth ratio h l 0 1718 swirling does not occur at low excitation amplitudes similarly swirling does not exist for the parameters h l 0 2061 and a l 0 00859 the reason would be the insufficient input energy which is not capable of producing nonlinear wave systems in fact for relatively high excitation amplitudes nonlinear surface waves emerge and they transfer angular momentum to the water column that undergoes rotary motion royon lebeaud et al 2007 it needs further detailed study with finer increment in excitation frequency to make sure the non existence of swirling for very small values of h l and a l regardless of a l for relatively shallow and deep water depths h l 0 1718 0 2061 0 4123 and 0 5154 the lower bound of swirling decreases towards β 1 as h l increases though the curves of lower bound correspond to intermediate water depths h l 0 2749 0 3092 and 0 3436 follow the similar trend but the curve corresponds to h l 0 3092 bends towards β 1 further for h l 0 1718 the lower bound does not change with a l but the upper bound increases also for h l 0 2061 it is seen that the lower bound remains constant for high excitation amplitude range in general it is noticed that at low excitation amplitude zone a l 0 00859 to 0 06872 the upper bounds decrease with increase in h l and the trend reverses for high excitation amplitude zone therefore it can be noted that increase in h l increases the frequency bounds of swirling for relatively large values of a l 4 8 frequency amplitude response curves of sloshing fig 26 shows the maximum free surface response amplitude normalized by water depth η1 max h and η2 max h for a range of excitation frequencies relatively shallow water h l 0 1718 intermediate water h l 0 3092 and relatively deep water h l 0 5154 are considered with excitation amplitudes a l 0 01718 0 06872 0 17182 the frequency amplitude response curves reveal several phenomena both water depth and excitation amplitude has a great influence on the frequency response of sloshing for different excitation amplitudes the subplots a b and c show the response curves of η1 max h and the subplots d e and f show the response curves of η2 max h respectively for small excitation amplitude a l 0 01718 the peak of the frequency response curve for h l 0 1718 occurs at β 1 as seen in fig 26 a this shows that the free surface behaves like a hard spring oscillator for h l 0 5154 the peak of the response curve occurs at β 1 implying that the free surface response exhibits the soft spring nonlinearity for small excitation amplitude as seen in fig 26 a and d far below from the primary resonance β 1 the response curves merge together regardless of water depth for a l 0 06872 as seen in fig 26 b and e all the response curves show the super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 as water depth ratio h l increases the magnitude of primary resonant peak decreases further as the excitation amplitude increases the frequency range for large amplitude response widens in fig 26 c and f all three response curves have secondary peaks beyond β 1 the existence of these peaks infers that the transition between different sloshing wave systems and so the response amplitude η1 max h varies with wave systems the super harmonic resonant peak corresponds to h l 0 5154 has less magnitude than that of other response curves as seen in fig 26 c in case of super harmonic resonance the response curve for h l 0 5154 as in fig 26 f has comparable magnitude with that of other curves for small excitation amplitude as seen in fig 26 a and d the super harmonic resonance is not clearly visible for any water depth this observation indicates that the excitation amplitude is the only parameter which activates the super harmonic resonance as seen in fig 26 b c e and f 5 conclusions the present experimental investigation is an attempt to understand the sloshing induced wave systems in a square base tank the frequency bounds of different wave systems are discussed from the present study the following conclusions are drawn 1 different sloshing wave systems emerge in the square tank namely planar standing wave planar travelling wave travelling wave with breaking travelling wave with run up and 3d effects non planar travelling wave hydraulic jump like response diagonal and counter clockwise diagonal swirling and counter clockwise swirling and irregular motion along the plane of excitation 2 planar wave occurs for very low excitation frequency ratio β 1 diagonal and swirling wave systems emerge around the resonant regime for relatively low h l 0 1718 0 2061 0 2749 hydraulic jumps occur around resonance zone but for β 1 a for a given liquid depth the frequency bound of swirling waves broadens as the excitation amplitude increases b for relatively high excitation amplitude the increase in liquid depth increases the frequency bound of swirling waves c for very low water depth ratio h l 0 1718 swirling wave does not exist for small excitation amplitudes a l 0 00859 0 01718 and 0 03436 it shows that the auto parametric resonance depends on both the water depth and excitation amplitude 4 for a given liquid depth the upper bound of swirling waves increases significantly than the lower bound as the excitation amplitude increases for h l 0 4123 and a l 0 1718 the upper bound of swirling increases about 34 from the linear sloshing frequency the lower bound decreases about 5 from the linear frequency this trend shows that the swirling has hard spring behaviour 5 as the liquid depth increases the shape of parametric curves corresponding to swirling waves changes significantly at low liquid depth ratio h l 0 1718 the curves look like triangular or semi circular ones and they evolve as nearly circular ones for relatively high liquid depth ratio h l 0 5154 6 frequency response curves show the existence of super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 for relatively large excitation amplitudes credit authorship contribution

21141,liquid sloshing in square or nearly square base tanks becomes more complex due to the emergence of three dimensional waves around resonance because of symmetrical base in a square tank two predominant sloshing modes along the plane of excitation and orthogonal to the excitation plane simultaneously emerge even if the tank is resonantly excited in one direction for relatively small liquid depth nonlinear effects shift the resonant sloshing frequency so the effectiveness of devices tuned liquid dampers designed based on the linear theory will be affected the present study investigates the existence of the sloshing wave systems and their frequency bounds with an extensive experimental data the tank is subjected to horizontal harmonic excitation for a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes sloshing induces different wave systems which depend on excitation frequency excitation amplitude and liquid depth the main focus is to determine the frequency bound of swirling waves for a range of excitation amplitudes and liquid depths it has been found that the frequency bound of swirling increases with excitation amplitude keywords sloshing square tank frequency bound swirling 1 introduction the effect of liquid free surface oscillation or sloshing can be seen in several engineering devices such as liquefied natural gas lng containers liquid ballast tanks of ship liquid metal cooled reactor vessels oil storage tanks and trucks carrying liquid extensive studies have been conducted by several researchers to analyze the two dimensional sloshing in rectangular tank however when the tank length and width become significantly close three dimensional waves can emerge around the resonant excitation in that case the respective natural frequencies of free surface oscillation along the tank length and width become closer and they induce complex resonance similarly nonlinear three dimensional wave motions and swirling also known as rotary sloshing can be observed in upright cylindrical and spherical tanks a comprehensive review on sloshing dynamics in various tank geometries can be referred in ibrahim 2005 and faltinsen et al 2009 due to complex behaviour of sloshing the studies on square tank became popular among several researchers most of the initial studies silber et al 1989 feng et al 1989 simonelli et al 1989 henderson et al 1990 crawford 1991 nagata 1991 miles 1994 perlin et al 2000 are focused on parametric sloshing or faraday waves appears in a vertically excited tank with a forcing frequency nearly equals to twice the natural frequency of free surface oscillation there are also few studies bridges 1986 1987 bryant et al 1994 1995 related to free sloshing in deep square basin later advanced investigations waterhouse 1994 ockendon et al 1996 yoshimatsu et al 2001 faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a 2005 b 2006 a 2006 b 2017 ikeda et al 2012 on resonant sloshing in horizontally excited square containers are reported the pioneer studies bridges 1987 simonelli et al 1989 yoshimatsu et al 2001 bryant 1993 have mainly focused on bifurcation and linear stability analyses the effects of degeneracy existence of two or more modes of free surface oscillation for the same frequency and commensurability natural frequencies of the sloshing modes are rationally related to each other on the free surface evolution bridges 1987 found from the theoretical analysis that the perturbation of double eigenvalues natural frequencies results in a secondary bifurcation of periodic solutions which lead to change in surface wave field however he has not reported the existence of swirling in his study the effects of geometric symmetry and degeneracy on the free surface mode interactions have been reported by simonelli et al 1989 further silber et al 1989 have qualitatively reproduced the results of simonelli et al 1989 using theoretical study having motivated by the work of gu et al 1987 feng et al 1989 have investigated the resonant surface waves in a nearly square container subjected to vertical oscillation and they verified the conclusions of simonelli et al 1989 bryant 1993 has presented the linear stability analysis and the nonlinear time evolution of surface waves ockendon and ockendon 2001 highlighted the effect of commensurability and degeneracy on resonant sloshing yoshimatsu et al 2001 examined resonant sloshing in case of infinite liquid depth they reported that the bifurcations of the stationary solutions for a square tank are a little more complicated than those for a circular cylinder la rocca et al 1997 2000 have developed the variational method to model 2d and 3d nonlinear sloshing wave systems multi modal theory has been extensively used to investigate the wave systems in square base tanks with finite liquid depth in fact faltinsen and co researchers have advanced the multimodal techniques to classify the effective frequency range of different sloshing wave systems they found that swirling is the sole common wave phenomenon in a square tank subjected to longitudinal and diagonal excitations using asymptotic modal system faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a it has been found that the effective frequency range of stable steady state motion as a function of liquid depth and forcing amplitude in order to improve the theoretical model faltinsen et al 2005 b proposed a modified modal system namely adaptive modal system which accounts for linear viscous damping in dominant modes faltinsen et al 2006 a have addressed a few limitations of earlier studies faltinsen et al 2003 2005 a by using the adaptive asymptotic nonlinear modal system and studied the effect of small perturbation of tank base ratio on the effective frequency range for different wave systems later on royon lebeaud et al 2007 experimentally verified that the frequency bounds of different wave regimes agree qualitatively with findings of faltinsen et al 2003 recently faltinsen et al 2017 used narimanov moiseev asymptotic modal model with linear viscous damping terms due to damping effects it has been found that the regime of square like standing wave fully disappears and being replaced by the regime of swirling though the multi modal theory predicts several phenomena it is limited for finite liquid depth and small excitation amplitude further the theory does not account the local phenomena such as run up breaking at walls overturning waves and roof impacts faltinsen et al 2003 theory is also limited in quantifying the effective frequency range of different wave systems for small excitation amplitude there are few studies available on shallow water sloshing in square tanks frandsen et al 2006 have experimentally studied the sloshing in a square tank with water depth to tank length ratios 0 2 0 3 and 0 6 and observed that the free surface behaves as a hard spring oscillator for shallow water depth ratio 0 2 ikeda et al 2013 have theoretically studied the nonlinear sloshing in square tanks subjected to horizontal random excitation for the water depth to tank length ratios 0 28 0 34 and 0 6 for water depth ratio 0 28 they found that the peak of mean square response shifts to the right of the centre frequency that shows the hard spring behaviour further they reported that the auto parametric interaction becomes less effective as the water depth decreases zhang et al 2018 numerically analyzed the secondary resonance in square base tanks subjected to the circular orbit motion for water depth to tank length ratios 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 during the secondary resonance they observed three typical wave systems swirling wave standing wave and double peak travelling wave they reported that the wave in shallower tank increases its amplitude more rapidly at secondary resonance chern et al 2012 shown that in shallow water containers of nearly square base with aspect ratio 1 1111 and square base with aspect ratio 1 the pattern of wave systems strongly depends on the tank aspect ratio they have limited their study for small non dimensional excitation amplitudes 0 001 and 0 01 even though the earlier studies chern et al 2012 ikeda et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 explore several nonlinear phenomena they are limited to small excitation amplitude the local phenomena have not been accounted in the theoretical models they fail to predict shallow water sloshing response for high excitation amplitude at which local phenomena dominate the rectangular tuned liquid dampers tlds have conventionally been used for structural vibration control hence most of the researchers bauer 1984 fujino et al 1992 anderson et al 2000 tait 2008 faltinsen et al 2011 turner et al 2013 gurusamy et al 2017 2019 focused on rectangular tanks however recently a few studies on auto parametric vibration absorbers using square tanks have been conducted ikeda 2010 has studied the response control of flexible structures based on the concept of internal resonance in a square tank he has showed that the square tld was more effective than the conventional rectangular tld in controlling the structural vibration ikeda et al 2017 a have improved the theoretical model ikeda 2010 by considering the sloshing coupled mode very recently ikeda et al 2017 b have reported a study on vibration control of two degrees of freedom structure using square and nearly square base tanks even though a lot of studies on sloshing tanks of different geometries available in the literature the research pertaining to square and nearly square tanks subjected to horizontal excitation are limited the existing theories in literature are valid for small excitation amplitude only the nonlinear characteristics of shallow water sloshing in square or nearly square tanks subjected to horizontal excitation are not explored in detail further according to author s best knowledge the effect of large excitation amplitude on shallow water sloshing in square tank is not explored much as proved by ikeda 2017 b that square tank shows better result as a tld in comparison to rectangular tanks so the study on square tank behaviour have importance in research also the possibility of being a non perfect square geometry due to practical constraints makes it more vulnerable in the sense of response behaviour therefore having identified the limitations of the theoretical models the present study is aimed to comprehend the nonlinear wave systems in a square tank through experiments the main objective of the present study is to quantify the frequency bounds of wave systems particularly swirling wave systems in a square base tank the highlights of the present study as follows to carry out an extensive experimental campaign for classification of different wave systems under the influence of excitation frequency and excitation amplitude to understand the sloshing responses around resonance zone for a wide range of excitation amplitudes to establish the frequency bounds of swirling wave as a function of excitation amplitude for a range of liquid depths 2 theoretical background on sloshing in a square base tank consider a square tank with l1 l2 l and liquid depth h as shown in fig 1 a based on the linear theory faltinsen and timokha 2009 the natural frequency of sloshing mode i j in a square basin can be derived as follows 1 f i j 1 2 π g λ i j tanh λ i j h for i j 0 2 where λ i j π i l 1 2 j l 2 2 for i j 0 the corresponding natural modes of sloshing are given as follows 3 φ i j x y z φ i x ϕ j y cosh z h λ i j cosh λ i j h where φ i x cos i π x l 1 2 l 1 and ϕ j y cos j π y l 2 2 l 2 in a square tank the natural frequencies of the sloshing modes 1 0 and 0 1 become equal and they satisfy the internal resonance condition though the external excitation directly excites only one mode both 1 0 and 0 1 modes emerge because they are degenerate modes and nonlinearly coupled with each other this phenomenon is known as auto parametric resonance ikeda et al 2017 a the wave profiles can be determined by the expressions φ i j x y z on z 0 4 φ i j x y 0 φ i x ϕ j y faltinsen et al 2003 have developed an asymptotic modal system to model sloshing in a square tank subjected to longitudinal harmonic excitation they have obtained the analytical expressions for three possible steady state waves the linear theory is valid for relatively deep water depths and small non dimensional excitation amplitudes ε 0 01 and further the non linear corrections can be referred in faltinsen and timokha 2009 5 1 planar wave φ x y t a φ 1 x cos σ t o ε 1 3 6 2 diagonal

the liquid square tank and its top view the points p1 and p2 denote the location at which the free surface elevation can be predicted fig 2 exhibits the theoretical prediction faltinsen et al 2003 of parametric curves for different wave systems as given in eqs 5 7 and the curves are not drawn with scale 3 experimental setup and procedure in order to conduct the sloshing experiments a unidirectional shake table is used to excite the liquid tank the shake table is capable of generating harmonic excitation at varying frequencies and amplitudes to ensure the accuracy of excitation amplitude and frequency of the shake table a linear variable differential transformer lvdt is also fixed at the edge of the shake table the shake table has limitation of providing maximum displacement up to 50 mm the displacement time history of lvdt is utilized to check the amplitude and frequency of the displacement of shake table fig 3 shows the experimental setup along with other essential equipments a square base tank of length l1 0 291 m width l2 0 288 m l1 l2 1 0104 and height h 0 375 m is prepared using acrylic material with 12 mm thickness to avoid the hydro elastic effects the container is closed on the top and filled with tap water with blue coloured ink to the required depth the global response of free surface has been recorded by video with 30 fps the recorded images are also useful to analyze the local phenomena near the tank walls as shown in fig 3 wave gauges are used to measure the free surface response the wave gauge consists of two 3 mm diameter stainless steel wires spaced 10 mm apart wave gauges have been calibrated at each test and they are positioned at 10 mm away from the tank wall from static calibrations and repeated experimental tests it has been found that the measurement of the wave gauges has less than 1 error wave gauges are connected to the data acquisition system oscilloscope through wave meter a single wave gauge is fixed on each side of the tank fig 4 shows the locations of two wave gauges which are orthogonally placed this arrangement of wave gauges are useful in identifying the three dimensional free surface response the sampling frequency of data acquisition system is kept at 100 hz to ensure that sharp fluctuation in free surface response is captured in total around 700 experimental tests have been conducted by varying excitation amplitude and frequency as the experimental test cases are large in number most of the tests have been performed thrice and few cases are repeated twice to confirm the wave systems either two or three dimensional waves for each excitation frequency the experimental test has been carried out for more than 120 s for non breaking sloshing motions the steady state was reached after about 60 s in case of breaking motions the response attains only its quasi steady state for the acquired data low pass filter of order 5 and cut off frequency 7 hz has been applied for post processing and the sloshing responses of all test cases are processed using matlab table 1 shows the experimental test cases with different parameters the water depth ratio h l covers relatively shallow intermediate and relatively deep water cases to understand the effect of excitation amplitude ratio a l on the free surface response the excitation amplitude a varies from very small to high value of 50 mm considered the limitation of shake table 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 sloshing response for small excitation amplitude let β fe f 1 0 denote the ratio of excitation frequency to the first modal sloshing frequency f 1 0 a l denotes the non dimensional excitation amplitude normalized with tank length and h l denotes dispersion parameter which is the ratio of water depth to tank length fig 5 shows the steady state sloshing response η1 measured at p1 for different excitation frequency ratios β for h l 0 1718 and a l 0 01718 as β increases gradually different wave systems are observed at relatively low excitation frequency ratios β 0 7748 and 0 8135 a standing wave along the plane of excitation is noticed at β 0 8523 the standing wave response changes to the small amplitude travelling waves at β 0 8910 three dimensional wave is observed 2fe is very close to both the sloshing frequencies f 2 0 and f 0 2 this causes the secondary resonance however for β 0 9297 the response changes to a planar travelling wave along the plane of excitation and the beat effect is also observed for β 0 9879 the beat effect disappears and the response remains as a planar travelling wave around the resonant excitation β 1 0266 a diagonal wave system is observed where fe is very close to both f 1 0 and f 0 1 for β 1 0653 the response changes to a planar travelling wave and the free surface reaches its maximum elevation moreover one can note that soon after the resonance the response magnitude reduces drastically for β 1 1234 further the increase in β shows that the response to be a planar travelling wave the time histories of sloshing response η2 measured at station p2 for the same experimental test as considered in fig 5 are shown in fig 6 from figs 5 and 6 it is observed that the magnitude of η2 is relatively smaller than that of η1 this is because of p2 which is located at the wall perpendicular to the plane of excitation at relatively low β s 0 7748 and 0 8135 the response magnitude is almost negligible a gradual increase in β towards the resonant zone develops different wave systems and amplifies the response at p2 the response η2 reaches its peak at β 1 0266 however for η1 the maximum elevation has been achieved at β 1 0653 the reason is that the frequency of free surface oscillation along the tank length f 1 0 1 1498 hz is slightly smaller than the frequency f 0 1 1 1608 hz of free surface oscillation along the tank width the parametric curves of sloshing response are plotted in the η1 η2 plane as shown in fig 7 for relatively low β s 0 7748 and 0 8135 the response curve is nearly a finite horizontal strip representing a planar wave along the plane of excitation in particular at these low frequency ratios β 1 the free surface motion along the plane of excitation is predominant as it is directly being excited however as β increases towards the primary resonance zone the free surface motion along tank width l2 also gets activated through auto parametric interaction hence the different shapes of parametric curves arise around the resonant region at β 0 8910 a small closed trajectory representing a three dimensional wave is noticed further the increase in β 0 9297 and 0 9879 transforms the three dimensional wave to the progressive waves along the plane of excitation at β 1 0266 the set of frequencies fe f 1 0 f 0 1 follow the ratio of 1 1 1 approximately and the diagonal wave is being induced due to the nonlinear coupling between the sloshing modes the sense of the trajectory indicates that the diagonal wave occurs in the clockwise direction further a gradual increase in β leads to the dominant response along the plane of excitation and so the parametric curves become approximately horizontal strips from fig 7 it can be inferred that the significant energy transfer between the sloshing modes i 0 and 0 j takes place around the resonant region due to auto parametric interaction further the images of different wave systems are exhibited in fig 8 fourier amplitudes absolute values of the fft of free surface response η1 are shown in fig 9 near resonance it is generally observed that the dominant peaks emerge at excitation frequency fe and its positive integral multiples however it happens that the higher harmonics of fe excite the natural frequencies of sloshing f i j in many cases where the multiple of fe become closer to the natural frequency of sloshing from fft analysis it has been found that for two dimensional planar wave along the plane of excitation the primary frequencies f i 0 contribute and for three dimensional wave systems the coupled frequencies f i j i 0 and j 0 influence the responses for β 0 7748 0 8135 0 8523 0 9297 0 9879 1 0653 1 1234 1 1622 1 2009 and 1 2396 the primary frequencies f i 0 and the multiples of fe emerge at β 0 7748 the sloshing natural frequencies f i 0 for i 1 2 3 5 7 11 have also been excited along with fe and 2fe further it is observed that 3fe is close to f 3 0 and causes the secondary resonance at β 0 9297 a beat phenomenon is noticed with the beat frequency 0 1114 hz which is very close to fe f 1 0 further for β 1 0653 it is noticed that the fourier amplitude emerges at fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 7 2 of fe in this case 1 2 fe is close to 1 2 f 1 0 and 7 2 fe is close to f 7 0 these modal relations cause the secondary resonances due to the sloshing modes 1 0 and 7 0 referring to fig 7 the parametric graphs for β 0 8910 and 1 0266 show that the three dimensional effects in responses fft analysis also confirms the three dimensional effects at β 0 8910 the frequencies f 0 2 f 3 2 f 6 2 f 10 1 f 14 3 emerge and indicate the existence of coupled wave system similarly for β 1 0266 the coupled frequencies f 4 3 f 8 2 f 13 2 emerge the numerical values of sloshing frequencies can be referred in the tables given in the appendix fourier amplitudes of free surface response η2 are shown in fig 10 on comparison of figs 9 and 10 it has been seen that the dominant frequencies of η1 and η2 are the same the reason is that the same free surface wave is being observed at two different locations p1 and p2 in fig 9 the dominant peak is noticed at fe for all β s however in fig 10 the peak at 2fe is predominant than the peak at fe for all cases except at β 1 0266 the reason is that the station p2 is located at mid point of tank side wall as seen in fig 4 hence for a planar travelling wave with a given time interval the number of crests observed at station p2 is twice the number of crests observed at p1 this can be clearly identified by comparing the time history subplots in figs 5 and 6 the location of measurement just causes the dominant frequency to be 2fe for η2 in case of β 1 0266 a diagonal wave system is observed therefore at p1 and p2 the same number of crests is being observed for a given time span 4 2 sloshing response for moderate excitation amplitude the time evolution of η1 and η2 are shown in figs 11 and 12 respectively for h l 0 1718 with excitation amplitude a l 0 0687 in fig 11 for β 0 5036 the response shows super harmonic resonance because fe is close to 1 2 f 1 0 with a gradual increase in β distinct wave systems are induced in the sloshing tank in fig 12 it is seen that from β 0 5423 to 0 7167 the response magnitude is negligible the reason is that the free surface response is the travelling wave along the plane of excitation and so the magnitude of η2 is insignificant due to the poor auto parametric interaction comparison of the sub plots in figs 11 and 12 for β 0 9879 to β 1 1234 shows that the number of peaks observed at stations p1 and p2 is the same but for other cases of β the number of peaks measured at p2 is double the number of peaks at p1 the reason is that wave crest travelling back and forth between the walls along the plane of excitation meets once at p1 and twice at p2 for a cycle for β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 swirling wave is observed soon after this swirling region the response changes to an irregular wave motion along the plane of excitation hence for β 1 1622 to 1 3752 the magnitude of η2 reduces drastically than that of η1 a comparison of figs 11 and 12 for β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 ensures that the strong auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes 1 0 and 0 1 takes place around the resonance zone fig 13 shows the fourier amplitudes of free surface response η1 the multiples of fe and higher natural frequencies of sloshing emerge in the fft plots for relatively small β s 0 5036 0 5423 0 6004 0 6392 0 6779 0 7167 the natural frequencies of sloshing f i 0 and higher harmonics of fe participate and show that the responses are of two dimensional wave systems as the excitation frequency increases towards the primary resonance the coupled frequencies also contribute for the sloshing responses for β 0 5036 where 2fe very close to f 1 0 the dominant peak is observed at f 1 0 due to the super harmonic resonance at β 0 6004 the sloshing frequencies f 2 0 and f 3 0 are being excited as they become very close to 3fe and 4fe respectively for β 0 9879 fe is very close to f 1 0 and the multiples of fe excites the sloshing coupled modes 2 1 4 2 7 3 through the secondary resonance for β 1 0266 1 0653 1 1234 the coupled frequencies contribute for the sloshing responses and indicate the existence of strong three dimensional wave systems the corresponding parametric graphs will be discussed in fig 14 and indicate the swirling waves for β 1 1622 1 2009 and 1 2396 the fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 of fe also contribute in the sloshing responses which indicate both the sub harmonic and super harmonic resonances in sloshing tank with relatively low water depth the increase in excitation amplitude causes several nonlinear phenomena including sub harmonic resonances the small peak at 1 2fe might appear due to unsteady state travelling waves the contribution of fractional harmonics 1 2fe 3 2fe for the sloshing responses has also been reported by nasar et al 2008 and gurusamy et al 2020 at β 1 1622 the higher harmonics 2fe 5 2 fe 3fe 7 2 fe and 4fe are close to the frequencies f 3 0 f 3 3 f 6 0 f 8 2 and f 10 3 respectively for β 1 2977 1 3364 and 1 3752 fe is close to the lowest coupled frequency f 1 1 for these β s the higher sloshing frequencies are being excited with fluctuating fourier amplitudes it has been noticed that when the multiple of fe becomes close to the sloshing frequency the peak of fourier amplitude gets magnified from this discussion one can comprehend that the secondary resonance causes the fluctuating envelope of fourier amplitudes the parametric curves in η1 η2 plane are shown in fig 14 for a range of β s with h l 0 1718 and a l 0 0687 for β 0 5036 the super harmonic resonance develops and the response is a planar travelling wave with relatively large magnitude for β 0 5423 to 0 7167 the response curve is nearly a finite horizontal strip which represents a planar travelling wave with relatively large amplitude of η1 than η2 for relatively high β s different shapes of response curve emerge due to the effects of lateral waves from experimental videos for β 0 7748 and 0 8135 the sloshing response is observed to be the hydraulic jump with lateral wave effects it has been observed that a lumped liquid mass travels between the tank walls in fact the wave front starts from one end wall and travels towards the other end wall such a phenomenon of travelling lumped liquid mass is known as hydraulic jump and the image of a hydraulic jump can be seen in fig 17 d this phenomenon can also be referred in faltinsen and timokha 2009 and gurusamy et al 2020 for β 0 8523 the response shows the strong hydraulic jump with run up on the tank walls and very minimal lateral wave effects in fact a lumped like water mass travels back and forth between the tank walls along the plane of excitation for β 0 8910 and 0 9297 the hydraulic jump travels between the tank walls with breaking plunging type wave front and significant lateral wave effects a gradual increase in β induces different wave systems for β 0 9879 the response changes to a diagonal wave with breaking at corners in the resonant region β 1 0266 1 0653 and 1 1234 the parametric curves show the closed trajectories which represent the swirling waves due to the nonlinear coupling between the sloshing modes royon lebeaud et al 2007 the sense of the trajectories indicates that the swirling wave occurs in the clockwise direction for β 1 0266 the curve looks like a right angled triangle and it further evolves like a semi circle for β 1 0653 and 1 1234 the theoretical analysis faltinsen et al 2003 predicts the parametric curve to be ellipse or circle for swirling waves but the experimental response curves deviate from being the perfect ellipse or circle this may be due to the nonlinear effects and local phenomena of free surface further the nonlinear effects due to breaking are not accounted in the theory which is developed for relatively finite water depths beyond the resonance zone the response curves become almost a finite horizontal strip which can be seen for β 1 1622 to 1 2396 in fig 14 these finite strips represent the travelling wave with run up and mild breaking at walls for β 1 2977 1 3364 and 1 3752 the corresponding excitation frequencies fe 1 49209 hz 1 53659 and 1 5812 hz respectively are close to the coupled frequency f 1 1 1 56886 hz hence the sloshing coupled mode 1 1 induces the three dimensional effects in the responses 4 3 sloshing response for relatively large excitation amplitude in order to study the effects of large excitation amplitude on resonant sloshing a l is increased to 0 1718 and h l is kept as 0 1718 the parametric curves of sloshing response are plotted in fig 15 the sense of the trajectories indicates that the diagonal wave and swirling wave occur in the clockwise direction comparison of the curves in fig 15 with figs 7 and 14 shows the effects of excitation amplitude on effective frequency bound of swirling waves for relatively small excitation amplitude as shown in fig 7 the parametric curves do not show any closed loop trajectories of circular or semicircular shape around the resonant region in case of moderate excitation amplitude closed loop trajectories of triangular and semi circular shapes are noticed for a frequency ratio range of β 1 0266 to 1 1234 as shown in fig 14 for relatively large excitation amplitude as seen in fig 15 the closed loop trajectories of semi circular shape exist for β 0 9879 to 1 2396 further at β 1 0266 the diagonal wave response as in fig 7 evolves as a swirling wave as in fig 14 and it further develops as a stronger swirling motion as in fig 15 as a l increases it has been observed that the effective frequency bound of swirling waves widens and shifts towards the higher frequency range with increase in excitation amplitude this phenomenon reflects that swirling has a hard spring nonlinear behaviour royon lebeaud et al 2007 have also reported the hard spring behaviour of swirling waves in an upright cylindrical tank 4 4 frequency bounds of sloshing wave systems the frequency bounds of sloshing wave systems for h l 0 1718 and different a l are shown in fig 16 it can be viewed that different wave systems develop as a l increases it can also be identified that for a fixed β the free surface response evolves into different wave systems as a l varies further the frequency bounds of different wave systems also change with a l at very low values of a l 0 01718 and 0 03436 the swirling wave does not exist at all as a l increases swirling develops around the resonant zone for a l 0 0687 0 1031 0 1375 and 0 1718 the lower bound of swirling is found to be β 1 0266 however the upper bound generally increases with increase in a l which shows that the swirling has hard spring behaviour similarly the bounds of diagonal wave system also increase slowly as a l increases for a l 0 03436 0 0687 0 1031 0 1375 and 0 1718 the hydraulic jump occurs around the resonance zone the bound of hydraulic jump also increases with increase in a l and hydraulic jump behaves like a soft spring at high excitation amplitude the experimental images of dominant sloshing wave systems are also shown in fig 17 the images from a g in fig 17 show the snapshots of the steady state response for h l a l 0 1718 images h and i are the response snapshots for h l 0 1718 and a l 0 0687 based on the experimental results the dominant wave systems are classified as follows a planar standing wave without breaking for β 0 2461 b planar travelling wave without breaking for β 0 4718 c travelling wave with mild breaking at walls for β 0 6392 d hydraulic jump with plunging breaking front for β 0 7748 e diagonal wave with breaking front for β 0 9297 f swirling wave with breaking front for β 1 1234 g irregular motion with breaking and 3d effects for β 1 2977 h non planar travelling wave without breaking for β 0 7748 i travelling with run up and 3d effects for β 1 2009 4 5 effect of liquid depth on swirling wave systems liquid depth in containers plays a key role in sloshing behaviour due to high energy dissipation relatively shallow water is preferred for the effective design of tlds for structural vibration control anderson et al 2000 so the investigation of sloshing response under the influence of liquid depth is also essential in terms of its practical relevance hence the present study also examines the free surface response for different liquid depths satisfying deep and relatively shallow water conditions the effect of relatively low water depth on sloshing behaviour has been discussed already in this section the influence of intermediate and relatively deep water depths on swirling responses will be discussed fig 18 shows the parametric curves for different β s around the resonant region for h l 0 3092 and a l 0 1718 the parametric curve of swirling is observed for a range β 0 8324 to 1 2880 the shape of the area encompassed by the closed curves varies significantly this may be due to several phenomena such as run up on the walls the nature of breaking wave front and the liquid mass participation in the rotary motions now it is worth to mention that in the liquid tank the entire liquid column does not participate in the sloshing oscillations a part of liquid mass at the bottom moves in unison with the tank ibrahim 2005 the liquid mass which participates in the sloshing motions depends on both excitation frequency and excitation amplitude from the experiments it is visually observed that the liquid mass participation for swirling mode increases with increase in β and then decreases gradually up to the collapse frequency where the swirling mode switches to other wave system after swirling regime the irregular motion with breaking has been observed for a range of excitation frequencies β 1 3193 to 1 5393 the parametric graphs for deep water sloshing are shown in fig 19 for h l 0 5154 and a l 0 1718 at β 0 7777 a diagonal wave is observed and its parametric curve shows the pattern which is similar to the theoretical prediction faltinsen et al 2003 for β 0 8202 and 0 8484 the response switches between the diagonal wave and swirling a further increase in β results in developing the swirling mode for a wide range of frequency ratios β 0 8768 to 1 3576 the swirling waves are observed the lower bound is found to be β 0 8768 where swirling starts occurring and the upper bound is β 1 357 beyond the upper bound swirling disappears and the response transforms to irregular motion for relatively high frequency ratios β 1 3010 to 1 3576 the area enclosed by the closed curves become small this indicates that the swirling mode loses its strength gradually and becomes weaker as fe increases up to the collapse frequency of swirling the comparison of figs 15 18 and 19 shows the effects of liquid depth on swirling wave systems as the liquid depth increases the shape of parametric curves of swirling wave changes significantly at low liquid depth ratio h l 0 1718 the curves look like triangular or semi circular ones and they evolve as nearly circular ones for relatively high liquid depth ratio h l 0 5154 further it has been found that the increase in liquid depth increases the upper bound of swirling 4 6 theoretical comparison of wave regimes of deep water sloshing fig 20 shows the theoretical faltinsen et al 2005 a prediction of steady state wave regimes of sloshing response for relatively deep water case with h l 0 5 and a l 0 00817 fig 21 shows present experimental observation of steady state wave regimes for h l 0 5154 and a l 0 01718 the water depths considered in fig 20 and in fig 21 are almost the same relatively deep water hence it is expected that the excitation amplitude does not change the sloshing wave regimes significantly further the excitation amplitudes and water depths considered in figs 20 and 21 ensure that the applicability of linear theory therefore though the value of a l in fig 21 is twice that in fig 20 the wave regimes for both cases are compared further fig 20 has not been used to confirm the validity of fig 21 but it qualitatively compares the frequency bounds of wave systems not the numerical values associated with wave systems the experimental observation of planar wave regimes is in good agreement with theoretical prediction the range of swirling motion observed from experiments is slightly higher than the range predicted by the theory this may be due to the difference in excitation amplitude further for β 1 0323 it is noticed that the direction of swirling motion switches between clockwise and counter clockwise directions the exact mechanism of switch of direction of swirling waves is not clear in the literature however there are many possible reasons initial conditions of shake table faltinsen et al 2003 local phenomena such as breaking and run up processes faltinsen et al 2005a and the phase lag between the external force and sloshing force for β 0 945 theory faltinsen et al 2005 a predicts that the response to be a chaotic motion however the present experiment for β 0 9474 shows that the response switches between diagonal wave and swirling and the direction of motion also switches between clockwise and counter clockwise directions fig 22 a and b show the time histories of responses η1 and η2 for β 0 9474 for a better presentation short time histories are plotted here it is observed that the wave motion along the plane of excitation exists in the beginning then due to auto parametric interaction the wave motion along the lateral direction also gets activated after 7 5 s approximately this auto parametric interaction continues till 20 s and then weakens in the interval 20 s 32 5 s beyond 32 5 s the auto parametric interaction again gets activated and so η2 has comparable magnitude with that of η1 the auto parametric interaction induces different wave systems for β 0 9474 in order to identify the different wave systems the time histories of η1 and η2 are partitioned into appropriate segments which are used to plot the parametric curves fig 23 shows the parametric curves obtained from the different time segments of the pair η1 η2 the sequential occurrence of planar wave 0 s 7 s diagonal wave 7 5 s 10 s and swirling wave 10 25 s 15 s is shown in fig 23 a by using parametric curves which are superimposed on the same plane continuing from fig 23 a the parametric curves of diagonal wave 15 5 s 18 s and planar wave 18 75 s 21 25 s are shown in fig 23 b however the planar wave continues to occur for about 32 s approximately further in fig 23 c the response changes from planar wave to diagonal wave 33 s 35 s followed by swirling wave 35 05 s 37 5 s the corresponding parametric curves are superimposed on the same plane further it has been observed that the switching of wave systems continues even for sufficiently long time about 120 s the possible reason for the transition or switch of wave systems is the nonlinear auto parametric interaction nonlinear energy transfer between the primary sloshing modes i 0 and the orthogonal sloshing modes 0 j in fig 24 the experimental images of response for different time instances are shown initially the response is planar wave and then transforms to a diagonal wave the image of the same is shown at t 8 76 s the clockwise swirling is observed from t 10 3 s 10 96 s with local breaking in the vicinity of the wave crest transition from one wave system to other takes place as time marches the counter clockwise swirling is observed from t 46 6 s 47 26 s further counter clockwise swirling is followed by planar and diagonal waves the image of counter clockwise diagonal wave is shown at t 68 66 s the images labelled for t 10 3 s t 10 43 s t 10 5 s t 10 96 s show that the frequency of swirling is 1 5151 hz which is very close to fe 1 4920 hz further the images for t 46 6 s t 46 8sec t 46 9 s t 47 26 s show that the frequency of counter clockwise swirling is 1 5151 hz which is very close to fe 1 4920 hz 4 7 frequency bounds of swirling wave systems from earlier analysis it has been noticed that the swirling waves occurs for a band of excitation frequencies around the primary resonant zone fig 25 shows the frequency bounds of swirling for a range of a l and different h l the bounds emphasize the robustness of the swirling wave system for a given h l and relatively large a l once the swirling is developed it is being maintained up to large excitation frequencies the similar finding is reported by royon lebeaud et al 2007 for an upright cylindrical tank regardless of h l the effective frequency bound of swirling is very narrow for small excitation amplitudes and it widens as the excitation amplitude increases however for a given h l as a l increases the upper bound increases significantly than the lower bound for instance when h l 0 4123 and a l 0 1718 the upper bound increases to β 1 3485 about 34 larger than f 1 0 and the lower bound goes only up to β 0 9468 about 5 smaller than f 1 0 in general it can be seen that for a given a l the swirling bounds shrink as h l decreases this indicates that the auto parametric interaction is not effective for small values of h l ikeda et al 2013 have reported the similar observation on the influence of filling level on auto parametric interaction it has been observed that for very low water depth ratio h l 0 1718 swirling does not occur at low excitation amplitudes similarly swirling does not exist for the parameters h l 0 2061 and a l 0 00859 the reason would be the insufficient input energy which is not capable of producing nonlinear wave systems in fact for relatively high excitation amplitudes nonlinear surface waves emerge and they transfer angular momentum to the water column that undergoes rotary motion royon lebeaud et al 2007 it needs further detailed study with finer increment in excitation frequency to make sure the non existence of swirling for very small values of h l and a l regardless of a l for relatively shallow and deep water depths h l 0 1718 0 2061 0 4123 and 0 5154 the lower bound of swirling decreases towards β 1 as h l increases though the curves of lower bound correspond to intermediate water depths h l 0 2749 0 3092 and 0 3436 follow the similar trend but the curve corresponds to h l 0 3092 bends towards β 1 further for h l 0 1718 the lower bound does not change with a l but the upper bound increases also for h l 0 2061 it is seen that the lower bound remains constant for high excitation amplitude range in general it is noticed that at low excitation amplitude zone a l 0 00859 to 0 06872 the upper bounds decrease with increase in h l and the trend reverses for high excitation amplitude zone therefore it can be noted that increase in h l increases the frequency bounds of swirling for relatively large values of a l 4 8 frequency amplitude response curves of sloshing fig 26 shows the maximum free surface response amplitude normalized by water depth η1 max h and η2 max h for a range of excitation frequencies relatively shallow water h l 0 1718 intermediate water h l 0 3092 and relatively deep water h l 0 5154 are considered with excitation amplitudes a l 0 01718 0 06872 0 17182 the frequency amplitude response curves reveal several phenomena both water depth and excitation amplitude has a great influence on the frequency response of sloshing for different excitation amplitudes the subplots a b and c show the response curves of η1 max h and the subplots d e and f show the response curves of η2 max h respectively for small excitation amplitude a l 0 01718 the peak of the frequency response curve for h l 0 1718 occurs at β 1 as seen in fig 26 a this shows that the free surface behaves like a hard spring oscillator for h l 0 5154 the peak of the response curve occurs at β 1 implying that the free surface response exhibits the soft spring nonlinearity for small excitation amplitude as seen in fig 26 a and d far below from the primary resonance β 1 the response curves merge together regardless of water depth for a l 0 06872 as seen in fig 26 b and e all the response curves show the super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 as water depth ratio h l increases the magnitude of primary resonant peak decreases further as the excitation amplitude increases the frequency range for large amplitude response widens in fig 26 c and f all three response curves have secondary peaks beyond β 1 the existence of these peaks infers that the transition between different sloshing wave systems and so the response amplitude η1 max h varies with wave systems the super harmonic resonant peak corresponds to h l 0 5154 has less magnitude than that of other response curves as seen in fig 26 c in case of super harmonic resonance the response curve for h l 0 5154 as in fig 26 f has comparable magnitude with that of other curves for small excitation amplitude as seen in fig 26 a and d the super harmonic resonance is not clearly visible for any water depth this observation indicates that the excitation amplitude is the only parameter which activates the super harmonic resonance as seen in fig 26 b c e and f 5 conclusions the present experimental investigation is an attempt to understand the sloshing induced wave systems in a square base tank the frequency bounds of different wave systems are discussed from the present study the following conclusions are drawn 1 different sloshing wave systems emerge in the square tank namely planar standing wave planar travelling wave travelling wave with breaking travelling wave with run up and 3d effects non planar travelling wave hydraulic jump like response diagonal and counter clockwise diagonal swirling and counter clockwise swirling and irregular motion along the plane of excitation 2 planar wave occurs for very low excitation frequency ratio β 1 diagonal and swirling wave systems emerge around the resonant regime for relatively low h l 0 1718 0 2061 0 2749 hydraulic jumps occur around resonance zone but for β 1 a for a given liquid depth the frequency bound of swirling waves broadens as the excitation amplitude increases b for relatively high excitation amplitude the increase in liquid depth increases the frequency bound of swirling waves c for very low water depth ratio h l 0 1718 swirling wave does not exist for small excitation amplitudes a l 0 00859 0 01718 and 0 03436 it shows that the auto parametric resonance depends on both the water depth and excitation amplitude 4 for a given liquid depth the upper bound of swirling waves increases significantly than the lower bound as the excitation amplitude increases for h l 0 4123 and a l 0 1718 the upper bound of swirling increases about 34 from the linear sloshing frequency the lower bound decreases about 5 from the linear frequency this trend shows that the swirling has hard spring behaviour 5 as the liquid depth increases the shape of parametric curves corresponding to swirling waves changes significantly at low liquid depth ratio h l 0 1718 the curves look like triangular or semi circular ones and they evolve as nearly circular ones for relatively high liquid depth ratio h l 0 5154 6 frequency response curves show the existence of super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 for relatively large excitation amplitudes credit authorship contribution

21142,to analyze the effect of skew on propeller cavitation performance single blade propellers with different amounts of skew are investigated simulations are preformed using the large eddy simulation les and the schnerr sauer cavitation model the computational domain is meshed by cutting cells the rotation of the propellers is simulated using moving reference frame mrf present study also examines the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex and re entrant jet with increasing skew the results suggest that the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation vary as the skew increases the circulation of the tip vortex cavitation fluctuates with diameter oscillations of the tip vortex the re entrant jet is observed at the suction side of the blade furthermore there is a strong radial velocity component in the fluid flow near the re entrant jet keywords skew cavitation tip vortex roll up re entrant jet abbreviations les large eddy simulation mrf moving reference frame rans reynolds averaged navier stokes 1 introduction cavitation on the propeller blade can result in various problems some of these include propeller efficiency loss increased noise levels denudation structural vibration and singing geometric characteristics play an important role in the cavitation performance of the propeller therefore propeller cavitation and the role of skew in its suppression need to be studied factors affecting propeller cavitation include blade area ratio pitch and skew a technique used to suppress propeller cavitation involves altering the amounts of propeller skew carlton 2012 specifically as skew increases the thrust and torque of the propeller vary over various advance coefficients krasilnikov et al 2009 zhu 2013 moreover thrust pulsation differs based on the skew liu et al 2012 for propellers installed in a wake flow increasing the skew caused a reduction in the thrust pulsation amplitude of the blades ghassemi 2009 studies have evaluated the propeller tip vortex by using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method they reported that an increase in skew inhibited the contraction process of the propeller tip vortex furthermore this increase caused the tip vortex spiral structure to reach a stable state in advance meanwhile deformation and instability of the propeller hub vortex were weaker wang et al 2018 attributed this to the weakening of the inter blade interference caused by increased skew these changes are eventually reflected by propeller cavitation zhu 2013 used the rans method to simulate various dtmb propellers under different skews numerical results showed that with increasing skew propeller hydrodynamic performance first increased and then decreased additionally the sheet cavitation at the back and tip of the blade gradually decreased increasing the skew transferred sheet cavitation at the back of the blade toward the leading edge a large skew is conducive to reducing overall propeller cavitation however this is limited to cases of high blade loading according to ji et al 2012 2014 increasing the skew can reduce propeller cavitation when the amount of the cavitation is low increasing the skew does not improve propeller cavitation performance zhu 2015 regarding propeller tip vortex cavitation the point with the highest cavitation intensity is at a given distance from the blade and as tip vortex cavitation develops the intensity of the cavitation gradually decreases zhu et al 2017 during the development of the tip vortex cavitation propeller tip vortex roll up occurs thereafter the re entrant jet appears at the back of the propeller blade bensow and liefvendahl 2008 observed significant cavitating tip vortex roll up during a cavitation test on a four blade e779a propeller tip vortex roll up causes the diameter of the tip vortex cavitation varies over time pennings et al 2015 the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex was also closely related to propeller singing maines and arndt 1997 which aggravates propeller noises pennings et al 2016 roll up occurs in the tip vortex of the propeller and the tip vortex cavitation of the 3 dimensional elliptical wing it typically appears when the cavitation number decreases gradually as the cavitation number decreases the tip vortex cavitation becomes unstable and roll up occurs if the cavitation number reduces any further surface cavitation of the 3 dimensional elliptical wing develops fully krasny 1987 arndt et al 1991 roll up also occurs in the hub vortex cavitation of the propellers kumar and mahesh 2017 at the back of the blade and the suction side where cavitation occurs bubbles non vertically intersect at the surface of the blade or hydrofoil dular et al 2007 when the intersection line between the cavity and hydrofoil is inclined the velocity component of fluid in the re entrant jet is along the direction of length lange and bruin 1997 brennen 2014 the re entrant jet can then affect the cavitation bubble cloud stability on the suction side of the hydrofoil stanley et al 2014 the height of the re entrant jet is related to the cavitation number furthermore it increases with their thickness on the suction side of the hydrofoil callenaere et al 2001 many researchers have conducted numerical simulations and experimental studies on propeller cavitation an important factor affecting the accuracy of these results is the mesh size in particular reliable results require a fine mesh for accurate results several researchers applied a local mesh refinement method at the tip vortex using numerical simulations a simple method is to separately extract and refine the area through which the tip vortex flows muscari et al 2012 2013 2017 divided the propeller wake region into a tip vortex region hub vortex region and lateral area in simulation of the propeller wake rudder interaction compared to the lateral area and the area between the blade tip and the hub the tip and hub vortex regions had a smaller radial mesh size the mesh size was identical for all propeller wake regions in the axial direction mascio di et al 2014 used a similar meshing method to simulate a propeller wake vortex and the interactions between it and the rudder in an oblique flow the results showed that this local mesh refinement method offered good accuracy and well reflected propeller wake vortex further research also achieved that this meshing method has good accuracy with different numerical models magionesi et al 2018 however this mesh size is still excessively large for a cavitating tip vortex one approach to further reduce the mesh size is to accurately capture the tip vortex region and refine the mesh only in the tip vortex region gao et al 2019 performed numerical simulations of the tip vortex cavitation under propeller installed winglets they used cylindrical control to achieve local mesh refinement on the leading edge and propeller blade tip nevertheless propeller cavitation occurs on the blade and the spiral area behind the blade tip if the position of the propeller tip vortex cavitation is known refinement can be performed near the tip vortex cavitation this method is also significantly accurate gaggero et al 2014 yilmaz et al 2018 local mesh refinement can effectively reduce the number of meshes while improving the accuracy of the numerical simulation however this refinement method relies on precisely locating the flow field area that needs to be refined adaptive mesh method can be used to address this issue yimaz et al 2019 selected fluid pressure as the characteristic parameter for calculating tip vortex cavitation they only refined the flow field meshing within a certain pressure range the results showed that this refinement method exhibited good accuracy it could refine the tip vortex cavitation region decrease refined volume and reduce the number of meshes based on the abovementioned information present study applies adaptive mesh refinement to numerically simulate the cavitation performance of a series of propellers with different skews the large eddy simulation les method is adopted to replicate turbulence and analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller the tip vortex roll up and the re entrant jet are investigated both circulations fluctuations and flow interweaving in the tip vortex roll up are also studied 2 mathematical model for the numerical simulation turbulence modelling is achieved using les incompressible fluid is used for the simulation the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 is used as the cavitation model the numerical simulation is based on the following equations for the conservation of the mass and momentum although incompressible fluid is considered in the numerical simulation density can be affected by cavitation equations for the conservation of the mass and momentum are provided by the star ccm user guide 2017 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u j u i x j p x i τ i j x j ρ m g i the mass transport equation is 3 ρ m α v t ρ m u j α v x j s e s c where x i is the component of the cartesian coordinates and u i is the cartesian component of the velocity ρ m is the

r a d u i p x i equation 3 is the navier stokes equation which governs fluid turbulence the rans equations transforms instantaneous variables into time average variables to reduce computational load contrarily the les model separates large scale vortices from small scale ones using filter functions large scale vortices are solved directly using instantaneous navier stokes equations the effects of the small scale vortices on large scale vortices are represented as subgrid scale stress the les method for simulation first requires using a filter function on the averaged large scale components ϕ and the small scale components ϕ notably the rans method applies time averaging to the variables the les model obtains average components ϕ via spatial averaging considering the navier stokes

subgrid scale stress τ ij can be obtained as follows τ i j ρ m u i u j ρ m u i u j the subgrid scale stress reflects the effect of the small scale vortices on the equations to be resolved in the numerical simulation the dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale model lilly 1992 was used this model has the same basic form as the smagorinsky subgrid scale model however instead of using a single user defined c s coefficient the model computes a local time varying coefficient by test filtering the flow area at a length scale greater than the grid length scale in the dynamic model τ ij can be obtained using the following equation 9 τ i j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 μ t u i ρ m k i where μ t is the viscosity of the turbulent flow at subgrid scale k is the subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy i is the

for the numerical simulation geometric parameters of the propeller are listed in table 1 and a sketch of the propeller is shown in fig 1 the numerical simulation is carried out under two advance coefficients j v a nd 0 71 and 0 77 the rotational speed of the propeller n 20 rps remains constant meanwhile the advance coefficient is changed a cylindrical domain with dimensions diameter length 4 d 12 d is used the front of the propeller has a length of 2d the propeller rear has a length of 10d the boundary in front of the propeller is set as the velocity inlet the boundary of the propeller rear is set as the pressure output the lateral surface is set to a symmetrical plane see fig 2 mascio di et al 2014 demonstrated that a time step corresponding to a 1 rotation is reliable for the e779a propeller when re 1 78 106 for the present simulation re 1 82 106 the time step is set to δt 6 25 10 5 the propeller rotates by 0 45 for each time step the mrf method is adopted to simulate the contact surface between the rotation and flow domains to avoid the effect of slipping wall on the wake vortex and hydrodynamic performance of the propeller the length and diameter of the rotation domain are set to 9 5d and 2 4d respectively the computational domain is meshed by cutting cells mesh quality plays an important role in the calculation of the turbulent boundary layer here the thickness of the first layer is determined as y 1 mascio di et al 2014 georgiadis et al 2010 the growth ratio of the prism layers is 1 2 the number of layers on the propeller is 20 the refinement area around the tip and tip vortex provide better results without dramatically increasing the cell number gao et al 2019 gaggero et al 2014 adaptive mesh refinement will further reduce the number of meshes yilmaz et al 2019a additionally yilmaz et al 2019b used q criterion to identify the cavitation in propeller rudder hull interaction and cavitating tip vortex trajectories obtained via numerical and experimental methods were compared the q criterion was found to be reliable for identifying the propeller cavitation adaptive mesh refinement allows refine a specific fluid region which is either defined by limited pressure q criterion or prescribed location adaptive mesh refinement is an iterative process first run of simulation is usually carried out to roughly estimate the cavitating tip vortex trajectory then a spiral tube containing the cavitating tip trajectory is located and refined and a second run of simulation is carried out for refined tip cavitation usually the tip vortex cavition becomes thinner and longer after another run of simulation if necessary a third run of simulation should be performed for finer vortex tube in present simulation the minimum size of the mesh in the finally refined region is 0 391 mm the present multi level mesh refinement approach is similar to those by villa et al 2020 therefore the cylindrical local and adaptive mesh refinement methods are applied near the propeller the limit of adaptive mesh refinement is q criterion when using q criterion as threshold of the selective mesh refinement it is useful to evaluate effect of different q criterion on the tip cavitation simulation in present simulation the minimum mesh size in the refined tube is kept unchanged thus smaller q criterion means thicker tube and more cells in fig 3 the results of q criterion 3000 s2 and q criterion 300 s2 are compared the latter needs about 1m more grids for the refinement from the comparison it is found that the tip cavitation is very similar under different q criterion if the minimum mesh size is kept constant to save computation resources q criterion 3000 s2 is used for present simulation based on the e779a propeller blade skew is adjusted while other parameters are kept constant the amounts of skew s are listed in table 2 and the propeller under different skews are shown in fig 4 to avoid the effect of rake induced by the increase in skew the skew is increased following the ittc convention however the rake is adjusted to be equal to its original value for convenience of description all numerical simulations are distinguished by the skew at 0 616d the variation in expanded area ratios a e with skew s 0 616 are listed in table 3 it is evident that the expanded area ratio remains almost constant as the blade skew increases hence in the subsequent discussions the variation in cavitation can be attributed to the increase in skew numerical simulation is performed with a fixed cavitation of σ 2 645 which is defined as 17 σ p p v 0 5 ρ 1 n d 2 where p refers to the ambient pressure p v is the saturation vapour pressure of water here p v 3170 34 pa n refers to the rotational speed of the propeller d is the diameter of the

compared with those obtained via simulation for 24 45 m cells converged k t 10k q and f v are equal to 0 1023 0 1768 and 6 13 10 6 m3 respectively for the original mesh with 7 73 m cells mesh 1 these values are 0 1027 0 1773 and 5 87 10 6 m3 the results with 24 45 m cells have been added to table 4 directly the cavity obtained using 24 45 m cells is compared with that obtained using 7 73 m cells fig 5 as the total number of cells increases to 24 45 m the shedding distance of the cavitating tip vortex increases however there is no significant difference in the cavity details and physical characteristics there is a slight improvement in the numerical results of the tip vortex cavitation with the increase in number of cells however a significant increase in the number of cells does not yield a proportional improvement in the simulation of tip vortex cavitation therefore 7 73 m cells are used in following sections four blade e779a propeller is used for a further verification with mesh 1 previous experimental results salvatore et al 2006 and numerical results yilmaz et al 2019a wang et al 2018 are used for the analysis wang et al 2018 used a cylindrical refinement area yilmaz et al 2019a adopted the adaptive mesh refinement method table 5 presents a comparison of the numerical and experimental results the trajectory of the cavitating tip vortex is also compared with the geometry of the adaptive mesh refinement area fig 6 shows that the refinement region integrally wraps the tip vortex cavitation numerical simulation results for the four blade model are compared with the numerical and experimental resultsobtained by yilmaz et al 2019a and salvatore et al 2009 fig 7 convergence analysis indicates that the cell size of mesh 1 and the time step of δt 6 25 10 5 yielded good simulation performance therefore the simulation on a single blade propeller is conducted using mesh 1 details of mesh 1 are depicted in fig 8 the distributions of the cournat number on the blade are investigated in fig 9 large courant number occurs at the leading edge and blade tip where the maximum courant number 172 occurs at the leading edge of 0 90r section for the other parts of the blade the courant number is generally smaller than 0 7 for the adaptive mesh refinement area the courant number is 0 4 4 propeller cavitation under different skews numerical simulations of the cavitation performance of the single blade propeller under varied skews are conducted the impact of skew and cavitation number on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is analyzed fig 10 presents the comparison results of hydrodynamic performance under different advance coefficients the horizontal axis represents the skew value of s 0 616 at 0 616d with increasing skew the thrust and torque coefficients of the single blade propeller improves initially and then declines this pattern occurs at both j 0 71 and j 0 77 based on the hydrodynamic performance sheet cavitation at the back of the blade is analyzed with respect to different skews numerical simulations are performed for two different advance coefficients fig 11 shows the cavitation distribution at the back of the propeller blade for varied skews under j 0 71 fig 11 shows that with increasing propeller skew the position of sheet cavitation along the rotation direction gradually approaches the leading edge in addition the jagged boundary of the blade sheet cavitation becomes more evident the chord wise length of the cavity decreases as skew increases a higher advance coefficient of j 0 77 is also investigated as shown in fig 12 a comparison with fig 10 shows that cavitation is considerably sensitive to the hydrodynamic load of the blade as the advance coefficient j increases cavitation on the propeller weakens results also indicate that an increasing skew leads to improved cavitation performances under both j 0 71 and j 0 77 for a higher advance coefficient a cavitation free zone occurs near the leading edge in the simulation under a skew of s 0 616 54 182 cavitation including discontinuous punctate cavitation only occurs at the center of the leading edge the iso surface obtained for a vapour volume fraction of 0 1 can reveal the characteristics of cavitation furthermore the results are consistent with previous experimental results ji et al 2012 yilmaz et al 2019a viitanen et al 2020 fig 13 shows that with increasing skew the cavitating tip vortex length of the propeller decreases in addition the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex is evident this twisted cavitating tip vortex can be described as the transition of the propeller tip vortex cavitation from a steady state to an unsteady state arndt et al 1991 as skew increases the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex of the propeller will strengthen this roll up is strong at s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 where the roll ups have a short period compared with fig 10 this is also the highest hydrodynamic performance the results under j 0 77 are also studied fig 14 a reduction in advance velocity for the same cavitation index reduces the strength of the cavitating tip vortex however the cavitating tip vortex in fig 14 c is longer than that in fig 14 b corresponding to the highest hydrodynamic performance appears in fig 10 to more accurately evaluate cavitation intensity cavitation in the flow field is integrated to obtain the cavitation volume the curves of the vapour volume under different skews are plotted in fig 15 for the simulations with j 0 71 and j 0 77 as skew increases the vapour volume increases initially and then decreases this tendency is consistent with that of the variation in hydrodynamic coefficient with the skew as presented in fig 10 however the peak of hydrodynamic coefficient and that of vapour volume are staggered compared to the hydrodynamic coefficient at s 0 616 0 302 original skew those for s 0 616 32 630 and s 0 616 43 406 are approximate while their vapour volume are smaller table 3 shows that the expanded area ratio remains almost constant with the increase in skew the promotion of cavitation performance is evident although the simulation under s 0 616 21 854 has smaller vapour volume than s 0 616 11 078 in fig 15 b the cavitaiting tip vortex of s 0 616 21 854 is larger than that of s 0 616 11 078 which can be seen in fig 14 the roll up in fig 13 are become strongest at s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 although the vapour volume peaks at s 0 616 11 078 this can be attributed to the fluid separation and three dimensional flow furthermore the leading edge vortex also results in the tip vortex under a higher skew fluid moves to blade tip and then strengthens the tip vortex circulation also impacts the vortex strength and cavitation intensity kumar and mahesh 2017 therefore the distribution of circulation on the blades under j 0 71 and σ 2 64 is analyzed with respect to different skews circulation г on the blade can be calculated as 25 γ r l r ρ v where l refers to the lift on the blade section at radius r ρ is the density of water and v is velocity which can be determined using 26 v v a 2 2 π n r 2 fig 16 presents various circulations at different blade radii as skew increases circulations near the blade root decrease whereas circulations near the blade tip increase the increase in skew exerts a heavier load on the blade tip for the position of 0 968r circulations under different skews are close the critical point at which circulation changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing one appears at 0 616r 5 flow field of tip vortex cavitation roll up of the cavitating tip vortex is a common phenomenon that occurs on the elliptical wing and tip vortex cavitation of a propeller fig 13 shows that the cavitating tip vortex under the skew of s 0 616 21 854 has a significant diameter oscillation under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 to analyze the roll up a cylindrical coordinate system is established in the flow field as shown in fig 17 a series of cutting planes parallel to the inlet direction are built in the flow field the angles of the cutting plane θ are set to 20 5 30 39 5 49 58 5 68 77 5 87 and 96 5 with an angle interval of 9 5 the settings of the cutting plane are also shown in fig 17 the cutting plane intersected the tip vortex cavitation to obtain a cutting plane the tip vortex cavitation is obtained by setting a vapour volume fraction of 0 1 figs 17 and 18 indicate that this roll up has a period of 19 in the circumferential direction this period is maintained over a certain propagation distance furthermore as the tip vortex cavitation gradually propagates backward the peak diameter of the tip vortex cavitation gradually declines in contrast the valley diameter suffers fluctuation however the overall tendency of valley diameter declines with the development of the cavitating tip vortex the streamline of the flow field for the skew in the numerical simulation s 0 616 21 854 is shown in fig 19 the flow near the tip vortex roll up is intertwined involving three orders of interweaving the first order of interweaving has the same period as the roll up the second order of interweaving occurs outside the first layer of interweaving its period is 3 4 times the movement of the first order as the cavitating tip vortex developing the interweaving of the first two layers is diluted at this instance only the third order of interweaving can be observed in the fluid motion this order of interweaving is similar to the trajectory of the propeller tip vortex these three orders of interweaving motions are denoted as 1 2 and 3 surface streamlines are also established on the cavity surface as shown in fig 20 if the cavitating tip vortex remains unfractured surface streamlines on the cavitating tip vortex are also continuous on the trajectory of the tip vortex cavitation the peak and valley values of the cross sectional area of the tip vortex cavitation appear alternately during the oscillation process the streamline on the tip vortex cavitation boundary presents as a hyperboloid of a one sheet structure this is consistent with the pattern of the flow field structure in fig 19 numerical simulation of the tip vortex cavitation roll up under skew s 0 616 32 630 is also evident which also exhibits roll up fig 21 the cutting lines in the figure are set at intervals of 9 5 which has the same period as that in fig 17 the tip vortex cavitation of the propeller manifested a strict periodicity for the skew s 0 616 32 630 however the roll up period for this skew is less than 19 it revealed that skew increasing results in a change in the period of the roll up to analyze the flow field inside and near the tip vortex cavitation cross sections are extracted at the diameter peak and diameter valley fig 22 the color bar denotes relative pressure the reference pressure is 101 325 pa in fig 22 positive values indicate an increase in pressure whereas negative values denote a reduction in pressure the black lines along the cross section represent the contour lines of the cavitating tip vortex under the vapour volume fraction of 0 1 there is a significant pressure drop inside the cavitating tip vortex however the pressure outside the cavitating tip vortex increases fig 23 presents the velocity distribution near the cavitating tip vortex the velocity in the inner radial area is higher than that at the outer radial area and the maximum velocity does not appear at the vortex core the velocity near the cavitating tip vortex is oscillatory along the propagation direction of the cavitating tip vortex fig 24 presents the vorticity distribution near the cavitating tip vortex the region outside the tip vortex has a vorticity of 0 for the largest diameter of the cavitating tip vortex a core with lower vorticity is observed at the center of the cavitating tip vortex this occurs simultaneously for skews of s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 during the early stages of tip vortex shedding e g 20 5 and 30 in figs 24 a and 18 5 and 28 in fig 24 b another vortex core structure emerges outside the tip vortex cavitation for both the skews simultaneously spiral arms can be observed in the two skews with the continuous development of the tip vortex cavitation this spiral arm structure rotates this indicates the rotating motion of fluid in the fluid vapour interface based on the results in figs 22 24 circulations in the cavitating tip vortex are analyzed at different positions the positions where circulations are computed are consistent with those in figs 22 24 circulation is calculated using the following equation sun et al 2019 20b γ v a v d l where a denotes the position of an angle as shown in figs 17 and 21 v denotes velocity l is the intersecting line of the cavitating tip vortex a comparison of the circulations of the cavitating tip vortex corresponding to skews of s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 is shown in fig 25 a pulsation occurs in the circulations of the tip vortex cavitation under the skew of s 0 616 21 854 contrarily the pulsation in results for the skew of s 0 616 32 630 is relatively inconspicuous 6 flow field near the propeller cavitation the relationship between skews and cavitation can also be studied in terms of the sheet cavitation at the back of the blade a comparison between the sheet cavity profiles at 0 616r is shown in fig 26 this comparison is carried out under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 the cavity is denoted by the iso line for the vapour volume fraction of 0 1 as the skew increases the boundary of a sheet bubble near the trailing edge shrinks from the trailing to the leading edge the closure line and re entrant jet are enlarged and the new results are shown in fig 26 b the length of the re entrant jet remains unchanged across different skews the length of the sheet cavitation bubble profiles in the direction of the blade chord length is measured the results are shown in fig 27 these results show that as skew increases the length of the blade sheet cavitation bubbles gradually reduces furthermore the reduction gradually decreases as the skew increases the re entrant jet caused the intersecting line of the sheet cavitation and blades to zigzag fig 28 presents the intersecting line of the sheet cavity and blade surface under conditions of j 0 71 and σ 2 645 it is evident that this intersecting line is smoother for skew s 0 616 0 302 in contrast for the numerical simulation of s 0 616 54 182 the boundary line appears rough furthermore for all skew values the intersecting line near the blade root is smoother however it is rougher when close to the blade tip the point at which the curve changes from smooth to rough gradually moves toward the blade root as skew increases the intersection point of the intersecting line and trailing edge also gradually moves toward the blade tip blue arrow in fig 28 moreover the intersecting line between the sheet cavity and blade surface advances towards the blade root red arrow in fig 28 eventually these two intersecting lines intersect with each other under skews of s 0 616 43 406 and s 0 616 54 182 green arrow in fig 28 in fig 28 e and f the sheet cavity is not completely developed along the blade surface fig 29 indicates the separation between bubbles and the surface of blade under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 the black line represents the intersecting line of the cavity and the blade surface the cavity sheds in two directions from the blade tip to the blade root and from the trailing edge to the leading edge moreover this two directional shedding is related to blade loading as the advance coefficient increases this type of separation occurs at a smaller radius figs 30 and 31 the flow field profiles are established in the radial direction for j 0 71 and σ 2 645 fig 32 in the figure the color gradient indicates the volume fraction of vapour the position of the profile corresponds to the cutting plane 0 in fig 17 streamlines are added to these profiles as skew increases the radial length of the sheet cavity decreases whereas the axial length increases in the flow field near the blade axial movement constitutes the main flow motion however a radial velocity component appears in the flow field near the suction side in the non cavitation area this radial motion component is attributed to the blade root whereas in the cavitation area this radial flow points to blade tip the point at which the direction changes is located at the boundary of the sheet cavity it moves upstream with the increase in axial length of cavity a vortex core is formed by this change in direction in conjunction with the flow outside the blade tip as this turning point moves upward the vortex core becomes stronger with the increase in skew the streamline constructed on the surface of the cavity exhibits an identical phenomenon streamlines on the sheet cavity are shown in fig 33 and fig 34 the streamlines of the upstream sheet cavitation are directed along the rotation direction of the propeller this circumferential movement has a velocity component in the radial direction which pertains to the blade root however when the streamline passes over the closure line the direction of radial flow turns outward this is in agreement with the results of lange and bruin 1997 the outward radial flow turns inward at the outer side border thereafter this radial flow moves around the cavitating tip vortex and interweaves at the fluid vapour interface hence the interweaving flow near the cavitating tip vortex can be traced back to the sheet cavity and re entrant jet 7 conclusion this study investigates the impact of skews on propeller cavitation using the les model and a single blade propeller the reliability of numerical simulations is verified using convergence analyses and numerical results are compared with the experimental results the results show that a larger skew leads to a smaller cavity as the skew increases the intensity of the cavity reduces gradually furthermore the roll up occurs in the cavitating tip vortex the roll up of the tip vortex leads to the interweaving of the flow near the tip vortex in three orders the circulation of the tip vortex also oscillates with the diameter oscillation in tip vortex with the increase in skew lengths of the sheet cavitation bubbles reduce in the chord wise direction additionally the width in the axial direction increases a re entrant jet is formed between the sheet cavitation bubbles and the suction side of the blade the inward radial flow turns outward at the closure line furthermore the radial flow in the re entrant jet is outward this radial flow further develops into the interweaving flow near the cavitating tip

21142,to analyze the effect of skew on propeller cavitation performance single blade propellers with different amounts of skew are investigated simulations are preformed using the large eddy simulation les and the schnerr sauer cavitation model the computational domain is meshed by cutting cells the rotation of the propellers is simulated using moving reference frame mrf present study also examines the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex and re entrant jet with increasing skew the results suggest that the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation vary as the skew increases the circulation of the tip vortex cavitation fluctuates with diameter oscillations of the tip vortex the re entrant jet is observed at the suction side of the blade furthermore there is a strong radial velocity component in the fluid flow near the re entrant jet keywords skew cavitation tip vortex roll up re entrant jet abbreviations les large eddy simulation mrf moving reference frame rans reynolds averaged navier stokes 1 introduction cavitation on the propeller blade can result in various problems some of these include propeller efficiency loss increased noise levels denudation structural vibration and singing geometric characteristics play an important role in the cavitation performance of the propeller therefore propeller cavitation and the role of skew in its suppression need to be studied factors affecting propeller cavitation include blade area ratio pitch and skew a technique used to suppress propeller cavitation involves altering the amounts of propeller skew carlton 2012 specifically as skew increases the thrust and torque of the propeller vary over various advance coefficients krasilnikov et al 2009 zhu 2013 moreover thrust pulsation differs based on the skew liu et al 2012 for propellers installed in a wake flow increasing the skew caused a reduction in the thrust pulsation amplitude of the blades ghassemi 2009 studies have evaluated the propeller tip vortex by using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans method they reported that an increase in skew inhibited the contraction process of the propeller tip vortex furthermore this increase caused the tip vortex spiral structure to reach a stable state in advance meanwhile deformation and instability of the propeller hub vortex were weaker wang et al 2018 attributed this to the weakening of the inter blade interference caused by increased skew these changes are eventually reflected by propeller cavitation zhu 2013 used the rans method to simulate various dtmb propellers under different skews numerical results showed that with increasing skew propeller hydrodynamic performance first increased and then decreased additionally the sheet cavitation at the back and tip of the blade gradually decreased increasing the skew transferred sheet cavitation at the back of the blade toward the leading edge a large skew is conducive to reducing overall propeller cavitation however this is limited to cases of high blade loading according to ji et al 2012 2014 increasing the skew can reduce propeller cavitation when the amount of the cavitation is low increasing the skew does not improve propeller cavitation performance zhu 2015 regarding propeller tip vortex cavitation the point with the highest cavitation intensity is at a given distance from the blade and as tip vortex cavitation develops the intensity of the cavitation gradually decreases zhu et al 2017 during the development of the tip vortex cavitation propeller tip vortex roll up occurs thereafter the re entrant jet appears at the back of the propeller blade bensow and liefvendahl 2008 observed significant cavitating tip vortex roll up during a cavitation test on a four blade e779a propeller tip vortex roll up causes the diameter of the tip vortex cavitation varies over time pennings et al 2015 the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex was also closely related to propeller singing maines and arndt 1997 which aggravates propeller noises pennings et al 2016 roll up occurs in the tip vortex of the propeller and the tip vortex cavitation of the 3 dimensional elliptical wing it typically appears when the cavitation number decreases gradually as the cavitation number decreases the tip vortex cavitation becomes unstable and roll up occurs if the cavitation number reduces any further surface cavitation of the 3 dimensional elliptical wing develops fully krasny 1987 arndt et al 1991 roll up also occurs in the hub vortex cavitation of the propellers kumar and mahesh 2017 at the back of the blade and the suction side where cavitation occurs bubbles non vertically intersect at the surface of the blade or hydrofoil dular et al 2007 when the intersection line between the cavity and hydrofoil is inclined the velocity component of fluid in the re entrant jet is along the direction of length lange and bruin 1997 brennen 2014 the re entrant jet can then affect the cavitation bubble cloud stability on the suction side of the hydrofoil stanley et al 2014 the height of the re entrant jet is related to the cavitation number furthermore it increases with their thickness on the suction side of the hydrofoil callenaere et al 2001 many researchers have conducted numerical simulations and experimental studies on propeller cavitation an important factor affecting the accuracy of these results is the mesh size in particular reliable results require a fine mesh for accurate results several researchers applied a local mesh refinement method at the tip vortex using numerical simulations a simple method is to separately extract and refine the area through which the tip vortex flows muscari et al 2012 2013 2017 divided the propeller wake region into a tip vortex region hub vortex region and lateral area in simulation of the propeller wake rudder interaction compared to the lateral area and the area between the blade tip and the hub the tip and hub vortex regions had a smaller radial mesh size the mesh size was identical for all propeller wake regions in the axial direction mascio di et al 2014 used a similar meshing method to simulate a propeller wake vortex and the interactions between it and the rudder in an oblique flow the results showed that this local mesh refinement method offered good accuracy and well reflected propeller wake vortex further research also achieved that this meshing method has good accuracy with different numerical models magionesi et al 2018 however this mesh size is still excessively large for a cavitating tip vortex one approach to further reduce the mesh size is to accurately capture the tip vortex region and refine the mesh only in the tip vortex region gao et al 2019 performed numerical simulations of the tip vortex cavitation under propeller installed winglets they used cylindrical control to achieve local mesh refinement on the leading edge and propeller blade tip nevertheless propeller cavitation occurs on the blade and the spiral area behind the blade tip if the position of the propeller tip vortex cavitation is known refinement can be performed near the tip vortex cavitation this method is also significantly accurate gaggero et al 2014 yilmaz et al 2018 local mesh refinement can effectively reduce the number of meshes while improving the accuracy of the numerical simulation however this refinement method relies on precisely locating the flow field area that needs to be refined adaptive mesh method can be used to address this issue yimaz et al 2019 selected fluid pressure as the characteristic parameter for calculating tip vortex cavitation they only refined the flow field meshing within a certain pressure range the results showed that this refinement method exhibited good accuracy it could refine the tip vortex cavitation region decrease refined volume and reduce the number of meshes based on the abovementioned information present study applies adaptive mesh refinement to numerically simulate the cavitation performance of a series of propellers with different skews the large eddy simulation les method is adopted to replicate turbulence and analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller the tip vortex roll up and the re entrant jet are investigated both circulations fluctuations and flow interweaving in the tip vortex roll up are also studied 2 mathematical model for the numerical simulation turbulence modelling is achieved using les incompressible fluid is used for the simulation the schnerr sauer model schnerr and sauer 2001 is used as the cavitation model the numerical simulation is based on the following equations for the conservation of the mass and momentum although incompressible fluid is considered in the numerical simulation density can be affected by cavitation equations for the conservation of the mass and momentum are provided by the star ccm user guide 2017 1 ρ m t ρ m u i x i 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u j u i x j p x i τ i j

contrarily the les model separates large scale vortices from small scale ones using filter functions large scale vortices are solved directly using instantaneous navier stokes equations the effects of the small scale vortices on large scale vortices are represented as subgrid scale stress the les method for simulation first requires using a filter function on the averaged large scale components ϕ and the small scale components ϕ notably the rans method applies time averaging to the variables the les model obtains average components ϕ via spatial averaging considering the navier stokes

subgrid scale stress τ ij can be obtained as follows τ i j ρ m u i u j ρ m u i u j the subgrid scale stress reflects the effect of the small scale vortices on the equations to be resolved in the numerical simulation the dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale model lilly 1992 was used this model has the same basic form as the smagorinsky subgrid scale model however instead of using a single user defined c s coefficient the model computes a local time varying coefficient by test filtering the flow area at a length scale greater than the grid length scale in the dynamic model τ ij can be obtained using the following equation 9 τ i j 2 μ t s i j 2 3 μ t u i ρ m k i where μ t is the viscosity of the turbulent flow at subgrid scale k is the subgrid scale turbulent kinetic energy i is the

for the numerical simulation geometric parameters of the propeller are listed in table 1 and a sketch of the propeller is shown in fig 1 the numerical simulation is carried out under two advance coefficients j v a nd 0 71 and 0 77 the rotational speed of the propeller n 20 rps remains constant meanwhile the advance coefficient is changed a cylindrical domain with dimensions diameter length 4 d 12 d is used the front of the propeller has a length of 2d the propeller rear has a length of 10d the boundary in front of the propeller is set as the velocity inlet the boundary of the propeller rear is set as the pressure output the lateral surface is set to a symmetrical plane see fig 2 mascio di et al 2014 demonstrated that a time step corresponding to a 1 rotation is reliable for the e779a propeller when re 1 78 106 for the present simulation re 1 82 106 the time step is set to δt 6 25 10 5 the propeller rotates by 0 45 for each time step the mrf method is adopted to simulate the contact surface between the rotation and flow domains to avoid the effect of slipping wall on the wake vortex and hydrodynamic performance of the propeller the length and diameter of the rotation domain are set to 9 5d and 2 4d respectively the computational domain is meshed by cutting cells mesh quality plays an important role in the calculation of the turbulent boundary layer here the thickness of the first layer is determined as y 1 mascio di et al 2014 georgiadis et al 2010 the growth ratio of the prism layers is 1 2 the number of layers on the propeller is 20 the refinement area around the tip and tip vortex provide better results without dramatically increasing the cell number gao et al 2019 gaggero et al 2014 adaptive mesh refinement will further reduce the number of meshes yilmaz et al 2019a additionally yilmaz et al 2019b used q criterion to identify the cavitation in propeller rudder hull interaction and cavitating tip vortex trajectories obtained via numerical and experimental methods were compared the q criterion was found to be reliable for identifying the propeller cavitation adaptive mesh refinement allows refine a specific fluid region which is either defined by limited pressure q criterion or prescribed location adaptive mesh refinement is an iterative process first run of simulation is usually carried out to roughly estimate the cavitating tip vortex trajectory then a spiral tube containing the cavitating tip trajectory is located and refined and a second run of simulation is carried out for refined tip cavitation usually the tip vortex cavition becomes thinner and longer after another run of simulation if necessary a third run of simulation should be performed for finer vortex tube in present simulation the minimum size of the mesh in the finally refined region is 0 391 mm the present multi level mesh refinement approach is similar to those by villa et al 2020 therefore the cylindrical local and adaptive mesh refinement methods are applied near the propeller the limit of adaptive mesh refinement is q criterion when using q criterion as threshold of the selective mesh refinement it is useful to evaluate effect of different q criterion on the tip cavitation simulation in present simulation the minimum mesh size in the refined tube is kept unchanged thus smaller q criterion means thicker tube and more cells in fig 3 the results of q criterion 3000 s2 and q criterion 300 s2 are compared the latter needs about 1m more grids for the refinement from the comparison it is found that the tip cavitation is very similar under different q criterion if the minimum mesh size is kept constant to save computation resources q criterion 3000 s2 is used for present simulation based on the e779a propeller blade skew is adjusted while other parameters are kept constant the amounts of skew s are listed in table 2 and the propeller under different skews are shown in fig 4 to avoid the effect of rake induced by the increase in skew the skew is increased following the ittc convention however the rake is adjusted to be equal to its original value for convenience of description all numerical simulations are distinguished by the skew at 0 616d the variation in expanded area ratios a e with skew s 0 616 are listed in table 3 it is evident that the expanded area ratio remains almost constant as the blade skew increases hence in the subsequent discussions the variation in cavitation can be attributed to the increase in skew numerical simulation is performed with a fixed cavitation of σ 2 645 which is defined as 17 σ p p v 0 5 ρ 1 n d 2 where p refers to the ambient pressure p v is the saturation vapour pressure of water here p v 3170 34 pa n refers to the rotational speed of the propeller d is the diameter of the

compared with those obtained via simulation for 24 45 m cells converged k t 10k q and f v are equal to 0 1023 0 1768 and 6 13 10 6 m3 respectively for the original mesh with 7 73 m cells mesh 1 these values are 0 1027 0 1773 and 5 87 10 6 m3 the results with 24 45 m cells have been added to table 4 directly the cavity obtained using 24 45 m cells is compared with that obtained using 7 73 m cells fig 5 as the total number of cells increases to 24 45 m the shedding distance of the cavitating tip vortex increases however there is no significant difference in the cavity details and physical characteristics there is a slight improvement in the numerical results of the tip vortex cavitation with the increase in number of cells however a significant increase in the number of cells does not yield a proportional improvement in the simulation of tip vortex cavitation therefore 7 73 m cells are used in following sections four blade e779a propeller is used for a further verification with mesh 1 previous experimental results salvatore et al 2006 and numerical results yilmaz et al 2019a wang et al 2018 are used for the analysis wang et al 2018 used a cylindrical refinement area yilmaz et al 2019a adopted the adaptive mesh refinement method table 5 presents a comparison of the numerical and experimental results the trajectory of the cavitating tip vortex is also compared with the geometry of the adaptive mesh refinement area fig 6 shows that the refinement region integrally wraps the tip vortex cavitation numerical simulation results for the four blade model are compared with the numerical and experimental resultsobtained by yilmaz et al 2019a and salvatore et al 2009 fig 7 convergence analysis indicates that the cell size of mesh 1 and the time step of δt 6 25 10 5 yielded good simulation performance therefore the simulation on a single blade propeller is conducted using mesh 1 details of mesh 1 are depicted in fig 8 the distributions of the cournat number on the blade are investigated in fig 9 large courant number occurs at the leading edge and blade tip where the maximum courant number 172 occurs at the leading edge of 0 90r section for the other parts of the blade the courant number is generally smaller than 0 7 for the adaptive mesh refinement area the courant number is 0 4 4 propeller cavitation under different skews numerical simulations of the cavitation performance of the single blade propeller under varied skews are conducted the impact of skew and cavitation number on the hydrodynamic performance of the propeller is analyzed fig 10 presents the comparison results of hydrodynamic performance under different advance coefficients the horizontal axis represents the skew value of s 0 616 at 0 616d with increasing skew the thrust and torque coefficients of the single blade propeller improves initially and then declines this pattern occurs at both j 0 71 and j 0 77 based on the hydrodynamic performance sheet cavitation at the back of the blade is analyzed with respect to different skews numerical simulations are performed for two different advance coefficients fig 11 shows the cavitation distribution at the back of the propeller blade for varied skews under j 0 71 fig 11 shows that with increasing propeller skew the position of sheet cavitation along the rotation direction gradually approaches the leading edge in addition the jagged boundary of the blade sheet cavitation becomes more evident the chord wise length of the cavity decreases as skew increases a higher advance coefficient of j 0 77 is also investigated as shown in fig 12 a comparison with fig 10 shows that cavitation is considerably sensitive to the hydrodynamic load of the blade as the advance coefficient j increases cavitation on the propeller weakens results also indicate that an increasing skew leads to improved cavitation performances under both j 0 71 and j 0 77 for a higher advance coefficient a cavitation free zone occurs near the leading edge in the simulation under a skew of s 0 616 54 182 cavitation including discontinuous punctate cavitation only occurs at the center of the leading edge the iso surface obtained for a vapour volume fraction of 0 1 can reveal the characteristics of cavitation furthermore the results are consistent with previous experimental results ji et al 2012 yilmaz et al 2019a viitanen et al 2020 fig 13 shows that with increasing skew the cavitating tip vortex length of the propeller decreases in addition the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex is evident this twisted cavitating tip vortex can be described as the transition of the propeller tip vortex cavitation from a steady state to an unsteady state arndt et al 1991 as skew increases the roll up of the cavitating tip vortex of the propeller will strengthen this roll up is strong at s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 where the roll ups have a short period compared with fig 10 this is also the highest hydrodynamic performance the results under j 0 77 are also studied fig 14 a reduction in advance velocity for the same cavitation index reduces the strength of the cavitating tip vortex however the cavitating tip vortex in fig 14 c is longer than that in fig 14 b corresponding to the highest hydrodynamic performance appears in fig 10 to more accurately evaluate cavitation intensity cavitation in the flow field is integrated to obtain the cavitation volume the curves of the vapour volume under different skews are plotted in fig 15 for the simulations with j 0 71 and j 0 77 as skew increases the vapour volume increases initially and then decreases this tendency is consistent with that of the variation in hydrodynamic coefficient with the skew as presented in fig 10 however the peak of hydrodynamic coefficient and that of vapour volume are staggered compared to the hydrodynamic coefficient at s 0 616 0 302 original skew those for s 0 616 32 630 and s 0 616 43 406 are approximate while their vapour volume are smaller table 3 shows that the expanded area ratio remains almost constant with the increase in skew the promotion of cavitation performance is evident although the simulation under s 0 616 21 854 has smaller vapour volume than s 0 616 11 078 in fig 15 b the cavitaiting tip vortex of s 0 616 21 854 is larger than that of s 0 616 11 078 which can be seen in fig 14 the roll up in fig 13 are become strongest at s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 although the vapour volume peaks at s 0 616 11 078 this can be attributed to the fluid separation and three dimensional flow furthermore the leading edge vortex also results in the tip vortex under a higher skew fluid moves to blade tip and then strengthens the tip vortex circulation also impacts the vortex strength and cavitation intensity kumar and mahesh 2017 therefore the distribution of circulation on the blades under j 0 71 and σ 2 64 is analyzed with respect to different skews circulation г on the blade can be calculated as 25 γ r l r ρ v where l refers to the lift on the blade section at radius r ρ is the density of water and v is velocity which can be determined using 26 v v a 2 2 π n r 2 fig 16 presents various circulations at different blade radii as skew increases circulations near the blade root decrease whereas circulations near the blade tip increase the increase in skew exerts a heavier load on the blade tip for the position of 0 968r circulations under different skews are close the critical point at which circulation changes from a decreasing trend to an increasing one appears at 0 616r 5 flow field of tip vortex cavitation roll up of the cavitating tip vortex is a common phenomenon that occurs on the elliptical wing and tip vortex cavitation of a propeller fig 13 shows that the cavitating tip vortex under the skew of s 0 616 21 854 has a significant diameter oscillation under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 to analyze the roll up a cylindrical coordinate system is established in the flow field as shown in fig 17 a series of cutting planes parallel to the inlet direction are built in the flow field the angles of the cutting plane θ are set to 20 5 30 39 5 49 58 5 68 77 5 87 and 96 5 with an angle interval of 9 5 the settings of the cutting plane are also shown in fig 17 the cutting plane intersected the tip vortex cavitation to obtain a cutting plane the tip vortex cavitation is obtained by setting a vapour volume fraction of 0 1 figs 17 and 18 indicate that this roll up has a period of 19 in the circumferential direction this period is maintained over a certain propagation distance furthermore as the tip vortex cavitation gradually propagates backward the peak diameter of the tip vortex cavitation gradually declines in contrast the valley diameter suffers fluctuation however the overall tendency of valley diameter declines with the development of the cavitating tip vortex the streamline of the flow field for the skew in the numerical simulation s 0 616 21 854 is shown in fig 19 the flow near the tip vortex roll up is intertwined involving three orders of interweaving the first order of interweaving has the same period as the roll up the second order of interweaving occurs outside the first layer of interweaving its period is 3 4 times the movement of the first order as the cavitating tip vortex developing the interweaving of the first two layers is diluted at this instance only the third order of interweaving can be observed in the fluid motion this order of interweaving is similar to the trajectory of the propeller tip vortex these three orders of interweaving motions are denoted as 1 2 and 3 surface streamlines are also established on the cavity surface as shown in fig 20 if the cavitating tip vortex remains unfractured surface streamlines on the cavitating tip vortex are also continuous on the trajectory of the tip vortex cavitation the peak and valley values of the cross sectional area of the tip vortex cavitation appear alternately during the oscillation process the streamline on the tip vortex cavitation boundary presents as a hyperboloid of a one sheet structure this is consistent with the pattern of the flow field structure in fig 19 numerical simulation of the tip vortex cavitation roll up under skew s 0 616 32 630 is also evident which also exhibits roll up fig 21 the cutting lines in the figure are set at intervals of 9 5 which has the same period as that in fig 17 the tip vortex cavitation of the propeller manifested a strict periodicity for the skew s 0 616 32 630 however the roll up period for this skew is less than 19 it revealed that skew increasing results in a change in the period of the roll up to analyze the flow field inside and near the tip vortex cavitation cross sections are extracted at the diameter peak and diameter valley fig 22 the color bar denotes relative pressure the reference pressure is 101 325 pa in fig 22 positive values indicate an increase in pressure whereas negative values denote a reduction in pressure the black lines along the cross section represent the contour lines of the cavitating tip vortex under the vapour volume fraction of 0 1 there is a significant pressure drop inside the cavitating tip vortex however the pressure outside the cavitating tip vortex increases fig 23 presents the velocity distribution near the cavitating tip vortex the velocity in the inner radial area is higher than that at the outer radial area and the maximum velocity does not appear at the vortex core the velocity near the cavitating tip vortex is oscillatory along the propagation direction of the cavitating tip vortex fig 24 presents the vorticity distribution near the cavitating tip vortex the region outside the tip vortex has a vorticity of 0 for the largest diameter of the cavitating tip vortex a core with lower vorticity is observed at the center of the cavitating tip vortex this occurs simultaneously for skews of s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 during the early stages of tip vortex shedding e g 20 5 and 30 in figs 24 a and 18 5 and 28 in fig 24 b another vortex core structure emerges outside the tip vortex cavitation for both the skews simultaneously spiral arms can be observed in the two skews with the continuous development of the tip vortex cavitation this spiral arm structure rotates this indicates the rotating motion of fluid in the fluid vapour interface based on the results in figs 22 24 circulations in the cavitating tip vortex are analyzed at different positions the positions where circulations are computed are consistent with those in figs 22 24 circulation is calculated using the following equation sun et al 2019 20b γ v a v d l where a denotes the position of an angle as shown in figs 17 and 21 v denotes velocity l is the intersecting line of the cavitating tip vortex a comparison of the circulations of the cavitating tip vortex corresponding to skews of s 0 616 21 854 and s 0 616 32 630 is shown in fig 25 a pulsation occurs in the circulations of the tip vortex cavitation under the skew of s 0 616 21 854 contrarily the pulsation in results for the skew of s 0 616 32 630 is relatively inconspicuous 6 flow field near the propeller cavitation the relationship between skews and cavitation can also be studied in terms of the sheet cavitation at the back of the blade a comparison between the sheet cavity profiles at 0 616r is shown in fig 26 this comparison is carried out under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 the cavity is denoted by the iso line for the vapour volume fraction of 0 1 as the skew increases the boundary of a sheet bubble near the trailing edge shrinks from the trailing to the leading edge the closure line and re entrant jet are enlarged and the new results are shown in fig 26 b the length of the re entrant jet remains unchanged across different skews the length of the sheet cavitation bubble profiles in the direction of the blade chord length is measured the results are shown in fig 27 these results show that as skew increases the length of the blade sheet cavitation bubbles gradually reduces furthermore the reduction gradually decreases as the skew increases the re entrant jet caused the intersecting line of the sheet cavitation and blades to zigzag fig 28 presents the intersecting line of the sheet cavity and blade surface under conditions of j 0 71 and σ 2 645 it is evident that this intersecting line is smoother for skew s 0 616 0 302 in contrast for the numerical simulation of s 0 616 54 182 the boundary line appears rough furthermore for all skew values the intersecting line near the blade root is smoother however it is rougher when close to the blade tip the point at which the curve changes from smooth to rough gradually moves toward the blade root as skew increases the intersection point of the intersecting line and trailing edge also gradually moves toward the blade tip blue arrow in fig 28 moreover the intersecting line between the sheet cavity and blade surface advances towards the blade root red arrow in fig 28 eventually these two intersecting lines intersect with each other under skews of s 0 616 43 406 and s 0 616 54 182 green arrow in fig 28 in fig 28 e and f the sheet cavity is not completely developed along the blade surface fig 29 indicates the separation between bubbles and the surface of blade under j 0 71 and σ 2 645 the black line represents the intersecting line of the cavity and the blade surface the cavity sheds in two directions from the blade tip to the blade root and from the trailing edge to the leading edge moreover this two directional shedding is related to blade loading as the advance coefficient increases this type of separation occurs at a smaller radius figs 30 and 31 the flow field profiles are established in the radial direction for j 0 71 and σ 2 645 fig 32 in the figure the color gradient indicates the volume fraction of vapour the position of the profile corresponds to the cutting plane 0 in fig 17 streamlines are added to these profiles as skew increases the radial length of the sheet cavity decreases whereas the axial length increases in the flow field near the blade axial movement constitutes the main flow motion however a radial velocity component appears in the flow field near the suction side in the non cavitation area this radial motion component is attributed to the blade root whereas in the cavitation area this radial flow points to blade tip the point at which the direction changes is located at the boundary of the sheet cavity it moves upstream with the increase in axial length of cavity a vortex core is formed by this change in direction in conjunction with the flow outside the blade tip as this turning point moves upward the vortex core becomes stronger with the increase in skew the streamline constructed on the surface of the cavity exhibits an identical phenomenon streamlines on the sheet cavity are shown in fig 33 and fig 34 the streamlines of the upstream sheet cavitation are directed along the rotation direction of the propeller this circumferential movement has a velocity component in the radial direction which pertains to the blade root however when the streamline passes over the closure line the direction of radial flow turns outward this is in agreement with the results of lange and bruin 1997 the outward radial flow turns inward at the outer side border thereafter this radial flow moves around the cavitating tip vortex and interweaves at the fluid vapour interface hence the interweaving flow near the cavitating tip vortex can be traced back to the sheet cavity and re entrant jet 7 conclusion this study investigates the impact of skews on propeller cavitation using the les model and a single blade propeller the reliability of numerical simulations is verified using convergence analyses and numerical results are compared with the experimental results the results show that a larger skew leads to a smaller cavity as the skew increases the intensity of the cavity reduces gradually furthermore the roll up occurs in the cavitating tip vortex the roll up of the tip vortex leads to the interweaving of the flow near the tip vortex in three orders the circulation of the tip vortex also oscillates with the diameter oscillation in tip vortex with the increase in skew lengths of the sheet cavitation bubbles reduce in the chord wise direction additionally the width in the axial direction increases a re entrant jet is formed between the sheet cavitation bubbles and the suction side of the blade the inward radial flow turns outward at the closure line furthermore the radial flow in the re entrant jet is outward this radial flow further develops into the interweaving flow near the cavitating tip

21143,refined estimation of bottom friction coefficient bfc is significantly important for coastal engineers to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates which can be realized by assimilating observations of sea surface elevation using the adjoint method in this study a new method named as feature point scheme fps is developed to further improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in fps bfcs at some feature points are assumed to be independent and bfcs at other temporal points are obtained by interpolating bfcs at feature points by assimilating artificial observations in twin experiments it is demonstrated that fps can improve the estimated temporally varying bfc especially with the nonuniformly distributed feature points and nonuniform spline interpolation nonuniform fps the m2 tide and four principal tidal constituents in the bohai sea are then simulated by assimilating real satellite retrieved observations with fps in all the experiments the performance of the tidal model with nonuniform fps outperforms those using other schemes the experimental results indicate that the temporally varying bfc is related to the tidal constituents moreover the temporal variation of estimated bfc has a significantly negative correlation with the current speed which is possibly related with the sediment transport keywords feature point scheme bottom friction coefficient adjoint method data assimilation temporal variation 1 introduction tidal information is required for the design of the coastal and estuarine engineering projects such as coastal structures and harbors as well as exploration of biological resources research in variation of coastal ecological environment and marine resources development chen et al 2007 lee and jeng 2002 bottom stress is responsible for about 75 dissipation of the global surface tidal energy munk and wunsch 1998 and plays an important role in tidal dynamics xu et al 2017 in addition bottom stress is a determining factor influencing the deposition and resuspension of fine sediment dyer 1988 traditionally bottom stress in tidal models is parameterized as a function of the bottom friction coefficient bfc and tidal currents based on the quadratic law mofjeld 1988 xu et al 2017 bfc is commonly used to formulate seafloor boundary conditions for numerical models of ocean tides and in various engineering applications related to lakes rivers and reservoirs lozovatsky et al 2008 consequently bfc is the main parameter for numerical simulation of ocean tides and the refined estimation of bfc is significantly important ullman and wilson 1998 therefore it is of wide interest to coastal engineers to have reliable estimation of bfc to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates arora and bhaskaran 2012 numerous measurements in various parts of the world ocean have testified that bfc varies spatially and temporally ludwick 1975 analyzed the measured velocity in the entrance to chesapeake bay where mean water depth was 12 m and found that bfc changed by four orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 100 as flow varied green and mccave 1995 found that bfc over a 2 month period at a site in the estern irish sea 26 m water depth was highly variable which was coherently explained by the boundary layer stratification caused by suspended sediment cheng et al 1999 estimated bfc by analyzing measurements of turbulent mean velocity over 43 days in south san francisco bay where the water depth was approximately 16 m they found that the daily mean bfc varied with the spring neap tidal cycle and was inversely proportional to the reference velocity when the mean velocity was larger than 25 30 cm s wang et al 2004 analyzed the tidal current speeds measured within the 2 m water column over the tidal flats of northern jiangsu china they pointed out that the estimated bfc varied temporally and was inversely proportional to the reference velocity when the current speeds exceeded 0 3 m s howarth and souza 2005 presented results from nine experiments at six sites in the north and irish seas and one site in the gulf of california and the sites ranged from very tidally energetic shallow 20 m deep to low tidal energy deeper 110 m they pointed out that bfc was dependent on the tidal current speed liu and wei 2007 analyzed 25 h turbulent data at a station with the water depth of 18 1 m in the yellow sea they concluded that bfc varied temporally and was decreased with the increasing mean velocity lozovatsky et al 2008 analyzed the measurements at two stations where the water depths were 38 m and 19 m in the east china sea near the northeastern coast of china they found that bfc was temporally varying and related to the flow safak 2016 investigated the variation of bed drag at a station with water depth of 5 m on a muddy shelf using field observations and found that bfc had a decreasing trend with increasing current speed xu et al 2017 estimated bfc at two stations with water depth of approximately 12 m in xiangshan bay china by analysing the observations they found that the temporally varying bfc during spring neap tide was larger than that during spring tide which was related to the change of tidal current speed fan et al 2019 analyzed in situ measurements of waves currents and turbulence at eight mooring stations where water depth changed from 6 3 m to 73 7 m in the east china shelf seas in their study the variations of current induced bfc showed no obvious relationship with water depth and decreased with the strengthening currents the above studies indicate that bfc varies spatially and temporally with the hydrodynamics sediments and topography etc however at present the constant bfc is still widely used in most of the two dimensional 2d tidal models and many three dimensional 3d ones kagan et al 2012 besides the parameter identification of bfc in tidal models by trial and error is tedious and impractical khatibi et al 1997 siripatana et al 2018 especially when multiple values of bfcs are required the data assimilation methods are developed on rigorous mathematical theories zhang and wang 2014 and have been widely implemented to estimate temporally varying bfc in tidal models ullman and wilson 1998 estimated the temporally and spatially varying bfc in hudson estuary by assimilating acoustic doppler current profiler data collected from a moving vessel with the adjoint method demissie and bacopoulos 2017 estimated the anisotropic manning s n coefficient by assimilating time and space varying velocity measurements in a macrotidal estuary with the nudging analysis slivinski et al 2017 estimated temporally varying manning s n coefficient of friction in a multiple inlet system by assimilating lagrangian data with ensemble kalman filter it indicates that the temporal variability of bfc has received increased attention which motivates the estimation of temporally varying bfc in tidal models with adjoint method in this work when the spatially or temporally varying model parameters are estimated the resulting inverse problem is often ill posed and beset by non uniqueness and instability yeh 1986 zhang and wang 2014 which can be solved by either increasing the well posedness using regularization approach alekseev and navon 2001 tikhonov 1962 or reducing the number of estimated parameters using independent point scheme zhang et al 2018 recently the independent point scheme has been improved by introducing spline interpolation method the one dimensional 1d spline interpolation method has been used in the independent point scheme to improve the estimation of the spatially varying open boundary conditions in a tidal model pan et al 2017 the spatially varying open boundary conditions in a 3d internal tidal model jiang et al 2018 and the temporally varying pollutant emission rate in an ocean pollutant diffusion model zong et al 2018 however in those independent point schemes the independent points are uniformly selected with little physical meaning and the corresponding 1d simplified spline interpolation method is used in this study the adjoint method which has been widely used to estimate the model parameters in oceanic and atmospheric models gejadze et al 2006 navon 1998 wang et al 2018b zou et al 1993 is used to estimate the temporally varying bfc in a 2d tidal model a new method named as feature point scheme fps is developed to improve the estimation results in fps based on the physical factors influencing bfc the feature points are selected nonuniformly in addition bfcs at feature points are assumed to be independent and used to obtain bfcs at all the temporal points with the nonuniform spline interpolation method the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the methodology is described the parameter estimation with fps is verified and discussed using twin experiments in section 3 the temporally varying bfc is estimated using the adjoint method with fps and the estimation results are analyzed in section 4 the discussions and conclusions occupy sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 methodology 2 1 2d tidal model following lu and zhang 2006 and zhang and wang 2014 the governing equations of the 2d tidal model are as follows 1 ζ t 1 a h ζ u λ 1 a h ζ v cos φ φ 0 2 u t u a u λ v r u φ u v tan φ r f v k u u 2 v 2 h ζ a δ u g a ζ ζ λ 0 3 v t u a v λ v r v φ u 2 tan φ r f u k v u 2 v 2 h ζ a δ v g r ζ ζ φ 0 where t is time λ and φ are east longitude and north

to the adjoint method a cost function j is defined to describe the difference between the simulated and observed sea surface elevation lu and zhang 2006 zhang and wang 2014 4 j 1 2 k ζ σ ζ ζ ˆ 2 d σ

elements in k ζ are 1 where observations are available and 0 otherwise based on the lagrange multiplier method thacker and long 1988 the lagrangian function is defined as 5 l j σ τ left side of eq 1 right side of eq 1 μ left side of eq 2 right side of eq 2 ν left side of eq 3 right side of eq 3 d σ where τ μ and ν are the adjoint variables of ζ u and v respectively according to the theory of lagrange multiplier method thacker and long 1988 the first order derivate of the lagrangian function with respect to the variables and parameters should be zero to minimize the cost function 6 l ζ 0 l u 0 l v 0 7 l τ 0 l μ 0 l ν 0 8 l k 0 from eq 6 the adjoint model which governs the evolution of the adjoint variables τ μ and ν can be obtained the detailed formulae and numerical scheme of the adjoint model can be found in lu and zhang 2006 2 3 estimation of temporally varying bfc using the adjoint method with fps 2 3 1 fps in fps all the temporal points are assumed to be uniformly distributed and labelled as general points with index of gp m m 1 2 m as shown in fig 1 some temporal points are selected as feature points with index of fp n n 1 2 n fig 1 the detailed selection strategy of feature points will be given in the next section it is assumed that bfcs at feature points are independent and bfcs at general points are obtained by interpolating those at feature points as the distribution of feature points is usually nonuniform the nonuniform spline interpolation is used which is as follows 9 k gp m n 1 n w m n k fp n where k gp m is bfc at general point gp m k fp n is bfc at feature point fp n and w m n is the weighting coefficient in nonuniform spline interpolation and the element in weight matrix w for the whole time domain the relationship between bfcs at general points and bfcs at feature points can be expressed in matrix form as 10 k gp w k fp where 11 k gp k gp 1 k gp 2 k gp m t k 1 k 2 k m t 12 k fp k fp 1 k fp 2 k fp n t k 1 k 2 k n t when the condition of continuous second derivative and the natural boundary condition are considered the weight matrix w can be deduced see appendix a as follows 13 w c d a 1 b where 14 c m n gp m t n fp n 1 t

n 1 and fp n and δt is the time interval between any two adjacent general points as shown in eq 18 t n is equal to fp n 1 fp n times δt if the feature points are uniformly distributed fps is degenerated into the traditional independent point scheme used in previous studies e g pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and zong et al 2018 which will be called uniform fps in this study correspondingly fps with nonuniformly distributed feature points will be called nonuniform fps 2 3 2 selection of feature points as the real temporal variability of bfc in one area is not known in advance the feature points in fps cannot be selected based on the distribution of bfc as indicated in soulsby 1983 ullman and wilson 1998 and wang et al 2014 bfc is related to the water depth in addition the current also affects bfc as shown in lozovatsky et al 2008 xu et al 2017 and fan et al 2019 therefore when bfc is assumed to be temporally varying both the temporal variations of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed may have an impact on bfc in general the extreme points are the feature points in one time series so the extreme points and two endpoints of the time series of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed are selected as feature points in fps when estimating temporally varying bfc using the adjoint method with fps in a practical context the feature points can be selected as follows step1 before the temporally varying bfc is estimated the 2d tidal model is run with a constant bfc i e the initial guess value of bfc in the adjoint method that is usually used in the traditional simulation step2 the current speed is calculated with the simulated meridional and zonal velocity then the simulated sea surface elevation and current speed in the whole simulation area in step1 are spatially averaged yielding their temporal distributions step3 find the extreme points of the two time series by comparing the values at one point with those at its adjacent points a point with its values not less or not larger than the values at both left and right points is identified as an extreme point step4 all the extreme points and two endpoints in those two time series are taken as feature points fig 2 showed an example of the temporal variability of the spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed and the distributions of the selected feature points in the bohai sea 2 3 3 estimation of temporally varying bfc with fps from eq 8 the gradient of the cost function with respect to bfc is obtained which is as follows 19 j k μ u u 2 v 2 h ζ ν v u 2 v 2 h ζ when fps is used bfcs at feature points are estimated and bfcs at general points are obtained by interpolating those at feature points the gradients

t as indicated by elbern et al 2007 the independent observations which are not assimilated should be used to test the validity of the data assimilation following wang et al 2018b the independent observations are labelled as checking observations cos and the observation assimilated into the 2d tidal model are labelled as assimilating observations aos the processes of estimating bfc using the adjoint method with fps are shown in fig 3 the details are not shown here for brevity 2 4 model settings the model area is the bohai sea as shown in fig 4 with horizontal resolution of 10 10 the time series of sea surface elevation at the open boundaries are obtained from oregon state university tidal inversion software egbert and erofeeva 2002 following wang et al 2014 the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient is set as a constant with a value of 1000 m2 s and the default value of bfc is 0 0015 the time step and simulation period will be described in the specific numerical experiments the tidal harmonic constants including amplitude and phase lag utc the same below retrieved from topex poseidon t p altimeter data are taken as aos the tidal harmonic constants at coastal tidal gauge stations in the bohai sea are taken as cos for independent verification the spatial positions of the t p satellite tracks and tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 4b the stop criterion of the adjoint method in fig 3 is that the difference of cost function values normalized by the value at the first step between the last two steps is less than 5 0 10 5 with a maximum value of 100 for iteration steps in addition as background values the estimated bfc is set to be not smaller than 1 0 10 5 times default bfc the open boundary conditions are fixed and only the temporally varying bfc is estimated in this study 3 twin experiments 3 1 experimental design in fact the true values of bfc are not known in the practical applications to evaluate the effectiveness of fps several twin experiments were designed in which the true values of bfc were assumed to be known and prescribed based on the estimated bfc in the practical experiment without using fps for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te1 the prescribed bfc was obtained as follows firstly a pre experiment in which only the m2 tide was simulated in one typical m2 tidal period with a time step of 62 103 s was carried out to estimate bfc by assimilating the real t p altimeter data without fps then the estimated bfcs at the extreme points and two endpoints were interpolated using the nonuniform spline interpolation method finally the interpolated bfcs fig 5 a were taken as the prescribed bfc in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 and te3 the prescribed bfcs were the same and were also given by interpolating the estimated bfc in a pre experiment in the pre experiment four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simulated for 30 days the initial 15 days were for spinning up from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s by assimilating real t p altimeter data the estimated bfcs at the extreme points and two endpoints during the final 15 days were interpolated using the nonuniform spline interpolation method to obtain the prescribed bfc as shown in fig 5b the artificial observations in the twin experiments were obtained by running the 2d tidal model with the corresponding prescribed temporally varying bfc fig 5 and the other default model settings in addition the simulated results at the positions of the t p altimeter data were taken as artificial aos while those at the positions of tidal gauge stations were taken as artificial cos for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te1 the 2d tidal model was run to simulate only m2 tide in one typical m2 tidal period with a time step of 62 103 s for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 te3 the 2d tidal model was run to simulate only m2 tide four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 for 30 days from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s and the initial 15 days using the averaged value of the prescribed temporally varying bfc were for spinning up the detailed experimental settings of the twin experiments are listed in table 1 in te1 1 the temporally varying bfc was estimated by assimilating the artificial aos using nonuniform fps and the initial guess value of bfc was set to the averaged value of the prescribed bfc in addition the nonuniformly distributed feature points were selected using the algorithm described in section 2 3 2 and are shown in fig 2 considering that the last extreme point of the spatially averaged current speed was near to the endpoint it was not used and the number of nonuniformly distributed feature points was 7 in te1 1 in te1 2 the temporally varying bfc was estimated without fps the temporally varying bfc was estimated using uniform fps in te1 3 in which the number of feature points were changed from 6 to 46 fig 6 a in te1 4 the temporally varying bfc was estimated using fps with simple linear interpolation linear fps the linear interpolation in zhang and wang 2014 was used in te1 4 i e the weight matrix w in eq 10 in this study was replaced by that in zhang and wang 2014 in addition the distribution of feature points was the same as that in te1 1 in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 and te3 the nonuniform fps uniform fps and linear fps were used in the experiments numbered with postfix 1 3 and 4 respectively while postfix 2 meant that the temporally varying bfc was estimated without fps in those experiments following fang et al 2004 besides the mean absolute errors maes between the observed and simulated tidal amplitude and phase lag the model performance was also evaluated using vectorial error between the observed and simulated tidal harmonic constants which is as follows 23 v e h o b s cos g o b s h s i m cos g s i m 2 h o b s sin g o b s h s i m sin g s i m 2 1 2 where ve is the vectorial error h obs and g obs are the observed tidal amplitude and phase lag of one tidal constituent respectively h sim and g sim are the corresponding simulated tidal amplitude and phase lag respectively 3 2 results when the artificial aos were assimilated the vectorial errors between the artificial cos and the corresponding simulated results were decreased significantly in te1 1 te1 2 te1 3 and te1 4 table 2 indicating the effectiveness of parameter estimation using adjoint data assimilation as listed in table 2 the vectorial error between the artificial cos and the corresponding simulated results in te1 1 reduced to 5 09 10 1 cm from an initial value of 7 05 cm indicating that the model performance was improved with an error reduction of 92 78 as shown in fig 6a when the uniform fps was used in te1 3 the vectorial errors for cos changed with the number of feature points when the number of uniformly distributed feature points was larger than 41 the vectorial errors were larger than that in te1 2 where fps was not used indicating that choice of a reasonable number of feature points in uniform fps was important when the number of uniformly distributed feature points was between 11 and 41 the vectorial errors were less than that in te1 2 and larger than that in te1 4 in addition the minimum in te1 3 was achieved when the number was 7 and was less than those in te1 2 and te1 4 but it was still larger than that in te1 1 indicating that the best model performance after data assimilation was obtained when the nonuniform fps was used as shown in fig 7 a the estimated bfcs in te1 2 and te1 4 were obviously far from the prescribed bfc near the maxima or minima although the estimated bfc in te1 1 was not exactly equal to the prescribed bfc it had the same variation pattern with the prescribed bfc r 0 98 and was much closer to the prescribed values than those in te1 2 te1 3 with 7 feature points and te1 4 in details maes between the prescribed bfc and the estimated values in te1 1 was 1 59 10 4 table 2 while those in te1 2 te1 3 and te1 4 were 2 84 10 4 1 76 10 4 and 2 96 10 4 respectively showing that the estimated bfc using nonuniform fps was the most accurate when the assimilation period was changed to 15 days in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 the mean vectorial errors for aos and cos were also significantly decreased after data assimilation as listed in table 2 when the uniform fps was used the optimal number of the uniformly distributed feature points was 201 fig 6b and the mean vectorial error for cos was 8 03 10 1 cm in te2 3 which was less than those in te2 2 and te2 4 and slightly larger than that in te2 1 table 2 in addition mae between the prescribed and estimated bfc was 3 44 10 4 in te2 1 which was nearly equal to that in te2 3 and less than those in te2 2 and te2 4 table 2 overall the results in te2 1 were slightly better than those in te2 2 te2 3 and te2 4 the prescribed bfc in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 was based on the pre experiments in which four principal tidal constituents were simulated but the estimated bfcs using four different schemes in te2 1 te2 4 had the similarly regular temporal variations and did not capture the prime pattern in the prescribed bfc fig 7b showing that the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc may be influenced by the simulated tidal constituents when the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simulated by assimilating artificial aos in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te3 the patterns of the estimated temporally varying bfcs were much close to the prescribed bfc fig 7c in addition maes between the prescribed and estimated bfcs were much less than those in the corresponding twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 table 2 showing that the number of the simulated tidal constituents could influence the estimation of bfc both the mean vectorial error for cos and the mae between the prescribed and estimated bfc in te3 1 were less than those in te3 2 te3 3 and te3 4 table 2 indicating that both the simulated results and the estimated bfc using nonuniform fps were much more accurate than those using other methods overall in all the three groups of the twin experiments both the vectorial error for cos and the mae between the estimated and prescribed bfc in experiments with suffix 1 where the nonuniform fps was used were less than those in other experiments with the other methods indicating the effectiveness of nonuniform fps in improving the estimation of bfc besides the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc was related to the number of the simulated tidal constituents 4 practical experiments 4 1 experimental design in practical experiments the tidal harmonic constants retrieved from t p altimeter data were taken as aos in addition the tidal harmonic constants at tidal gauge stations were taken as cos to test the efficiency of fps developed in this study in practical applications several numerical experiments were carried out as listed in table 3 in group1 the experiments were indexed with prefix exp1 in which only the m2 tide was simulated the 2d tidal model was run for 20 days from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s the initial 15 days were for spinning up and only the results in final 5 days were analyzed in addition the adjoint model was run for 5 days backward in time from january 21 2015 with the time step of 180 s in exp1 1 the initial guess value of bfc was set to the default value 0 0015 and the temporally varying bfc was estimated using the adjoint method with nonuniform fps the nonuniformly distributed feature points were selected following the processes in section 2 3 2 in exp1 2 the temporally varying bfc was estimated using the adjoint method without fps and the other experimental settings were the same as those in exp1 1 in exp1 3 fps was also used however unlike that in exp1 1 the distribution of feature points in exp1 3 was uniform and the number of feature points was changed from 49 to 121 in exp1 4 linear fps was used and the other model settings were the same as those in exp1 1 to test the influence of assimilation period several experiments indexed with prefix exp2 were set up in group2 in these experiments only the m2 tide was simulated but the 2d tidal model was run for 30 days from january 1 2015 and only the results in the final 15 days were analyzed in addition the adjoint model was run for 15 days backward in time from january 31 2015 the other model settings were the same as those in group1 to test the influence of simulated tidal constituents four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simultaneously simulated in group3 and the other model settings were the same as those in group2 similar to those in group1 the nonuniform fps uniform fps with diffident number of feature points and linear fps were used to improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in exp2 1 exp3 1 exp2 3 exp3 3 and exp2 4 exp3 4 in group2 group3 respectively in addition the temporally varying bfc was estimated without using fps in exp2 2 and exp3 2 4 2 results when aos were assimilated and the temporally varying bfc was estimated with nonuniform fps in exp1 1 maes of m2 tidal harmonic constants amplitude and phase lag and vectorial error for aos after data assimilation were decreased table 4 showing that the aos were adequately assimilated in addition both maes of m2 tidal harmonic constants and vectorial error for cos were largely reduced and tended to be stable fig 8 as the observational information of cos was not used to optimize the simulation results during data assimilation maes of m2 amplitude in exp1 1 were unexpectedly increased in the first several steps fig 8a however with the adjustment of the 2d tidal model during estimation of temporally varying bfc maes were then decreased and less than the value before data assimilation fig 8a in detail maes of m2 tidal amplitude and phase lag for cos were reduced to 5 26 cm and 2 69 from the initial values of 5 92 cm and 7 53 in exp1 1 as listed in table 5 in addition the vectorial error for cos in exp1 1 was reduced to 6 34 cm after data assimilation from an initial value of 10 49 cm indicating that the model performance was improved with a reduction of 39 56 in overall simulation error as shown in fig 9 a when the uniform fps was used the best model performance was obtained when the number of feature points was 61 which was taken as the result of exp1 3 although the maes and vectorial errors for cos in exp1 2 exp1 3 and exp1 4 were also reduced table 5 the results after data assimilation were larger than those in exp1 1 table 5 and fig 9a showing that the nonuniform fps could effectively improve the effect of adjoint data assimilation when the assimilation period was increased to 15 days in the experiments numbered with prefix exp2 maes of m2 tidal harmonic parameters and vectorial error for both aos and cos were approximatively equal to those in the experiments numbered with prefix exp1 tables 4 and 5 in addition the variation patterns of maes of m2 tidal harmonic parameters and vectorial error for cos in exp2 1 were nearly the same as those in exp1 1 fig 8 as the assimilation period was changed the optimal number of feature points in exp2 3 was different from that in exp1 3 and the minimum vectorial error for cos was larger than that in exp2 1 as shown in fig 9b although the vectorial errors for cos in exp2 2 and exp2 4 were slightly less than those in exp1 2 and exp1 4 respectively they were also larger than that in exp2 1 fig 9b the results showed that when the assimilation period was increased to 15 days the model performance after data assimilation using the nonuniform fps was still better than those using other methods when the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simultaneously simulated in the experiments numbered with prefix exp3 maes and vectorial error between the harmonic constants of four tidal constituents and the corresponding simulated results were calculated except for the k1 phase lag maes of tidal harmonic constants and vectorial error of other tidal constituents for cos in exp3 1 were less than those before data assimilation as shown in fig 8 although maes and vectorial error of m2 tide after data assimilation for cos in exp3 1 were larger than those in exp1 1 and exp2 1 fig 8a c the mean values of four tidal constituents were significantly decreased and tended to be stable as shown in fig 8m o when the uniform fps was used in exp3 3 the optimal number of feature points was 151 fig 9c which was different from that in exp2 3 in addition the corresponding mean vectorial error for cos was slightly larger than that in exp3 1 fig 9c the averaged maes of harmonic constants for four tidal constituents and the mean vectorial error for cos after data assimilation in exp3 2 and exp3 4 were significantly decreased but all of them were larger than those in exp3 1 as listed in table 5 the results indicated that the nonuniform fps had better performance than the other methods overall the experimental results demonstrated that fps with nonuniformly distributed feature points which were selected based on physical background was an effective method to improve the simulation results after data assimilation whether only m2 tide or four principal tidal constituents were simulated 4 3 temporal variation of the estimated bfc the estimated temporally varying bfc in all the practical experiments are shown in fig 10 although different methods were used in the experiments numbered with prefix exp1 the patterns of the estimated temporally varying bfcs in these experiments were similar to each other confirmed by that the correlation coefficients between the estimated bfc in exp1 1 and those in the other three experiments were not smaller than 0 95 the similar conclusion could be obtained in the experiments numbered with prefix exp2 when the four principal tidal constituents were simulated in the experiments numbered with prefix exp3 the estimated temporally varying bfcs were much irregular in addition the correlation coefficient between the estimated bfc in exp3 1 and those in other three experiments were obviously smaller than those when only the m2 tide was simulated however the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc in exp3 1 was significantly positively r 0 78 correlated with those in other three experiments to further compare the estimated bfcs in different groups of the practical experiments the estimated temporally varying bfcs in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 were phase averaged using the method in voulgaris and meyers 2004 and murphy and voulgaris 2006 and the results are shown in fig 11 a it was shown that the phase averaged bfc in exp1 1 was nearly equal to that in exp2 1 indicating that the estimation of bfc was not affected by the assimilation period the averaged bfc is exp3 1 was largely far from those in exp1 1 and exp2 1 which was attributed to the different simulated tidal constituents the aforementioned results demonstrated that the estimated temporally varying bfc was related to the simulated tidal constituents and not affected by the other model settings which meant that the temporal variation of bfc was relatively robust and of great physical meaning more importantly the estimated bfcs in the practical experiments varied periodically as shown in fig 12 a the significant spectral peaks in the power spectral densities of the estimated temporally varying bfcs in both exp1 1 and exp2 1 appeared in the quarter diurnal frequency band showing the quarter diurnal variation in estimated bfc when only the m2 tide was simulated the variation of the estimated bfc in exp3 1 was dominated by the signals in the d3 and d4 frequency bands fig 12a which was different from those in exp1 1 and exp1 2 and was related to the different simulated tidal constituents as shown in fig 12b the power spectral densities of the spatially averaged current speed in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 had the similar pattern to those of the estimated bfc in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 respectively in addition the correlation coefficients between the power spectral densities of current speed and bfc in these three experiments were larger than 0 95 indicating that the temporal variations of the estimated bfc may relate to the current speed the spatially averaged current speeds in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 were also phase averaged using the method in voulgaris and meyers 2004 and murphy and voulgaris 2006 and the results are shown in fig 11b c and d respectively the correlation coefficients between the phase averaged current speed and bfc in exp1 1 and exp2 1 were 0 86 the phase averaged current speed and bfc were not smooth in exp3 1 but the correlation coefficient was 0 62 the results demonstrated the significantly negative correlation between the current speed and bfc whether only m2 tide or four principal tidal constituents were simulated 5 discussions 5 1 possible mechanisms for temporal variation of bfc as mentioned in previous studies bfc is commonly used in various engineering applications related to coastal ocean estuarine areas lakes rivers and reservoirs lozovatsky et al 2008 consequently reliable estimation of bfc is significantly important for relevant engineers to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates arora and bhaskaran 2012 there are many possible factors affecting the variation of bfc water depth soulsby 1983 ullman and wilson 1998 wang et al 2014 waves christoffersen and jonsson 1985 drost et al 2018 boundary layer stratification caused by suspended sediment green and mccave 1995 vertical stratification ullman and wilson 1998 current speed cheng et al 1999 fan et al 2019 lozovatsky et al 2008 ludwick 1975 safak 2016 wang et al 2004 xu et al 2017 sea floor types or bottom roughness cheng et al 1999 howarth and souza 2005 mofjeld 1988 soulsby 1983 1997 phase of tide howarth and souza 2005 soulsby 1983 and form drag warner and maccready 2009 although the averaged bfc over the whole bohai sea may include additional sources of drag such as form drag warner and maccready 2009 the temporally varying bfc estimated in this study has significantly negative correlation with the current speed which is the same as that obtained from field observations in previous studies cheng et al 1999 fan et al 2019 lozovatsky et al 2008 wang et al 2004 xu et al 2017 we speculate that the negative correlation between bfc and current speed may be related to the suspended sediment transport in the bohai sea there are patchy distribution of the sea floor mud in the bohai sea qiao et al 2017 which is the results of transport of river input sediments by the ocean current bian et al 2013 showing that the suspended sediment transport is a common and important phenomenon in the bohai sea in a period of accelerating current the sediments at seabed surface is entrained into the bottom boundary layer wang et al 2004 resulting in that the bedforms become more rounded or are washed out gradually cheng et al 1999 van rijn 1993 and the suspended sediment concentrations in bottom boundary layer increase therefore the decreasing effective bed roughness and changing boundary layer stratification will reduce bfc of course the speculation should be further confirmed by the field observations in future work although several formulae of bfc have been proposed and used in the numerical models they are problem dependent and not universal for all types of applications as pointed by fringer et al 2019 more research in theoretic study and in situ observing is needed to further improve the parameterization of bfc by considering bottom roughness bedforms vegetation and corals 5 2 superiority of the developed fps when the feature points are selected uniformly the developed fps in this study is degenerated into the traditional independent point scheme with uniformly distributed feature points and uniform spline interpolation method in previous studies e g pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and zong et al 2018 as shown in figs 6 and 9 when the uniform fps was used the vectorial errors between cos and the corresponding simulated results changed with the number of feature points when the assimilation period was changed in practical experiments the optimal number of uniformly distributed feature points in exp2 3 was greatly different from that in exp1 3 fig 9 in addition when the simulated tidal constituents were changed the optimal number was also changed from 181 in exp2 3 to 151 in exp3 3 therefore it is necessary to seek out the most reasonable number by testing all the possible numbers for each experiment which is tedious and time consuming conversely when the nonuniform fps is used the number and distribution of feature points can be determined directly by analysing the temporal distribution of the spatially averaged sea level elevation and current speed as shown in section 2 3 2 which is rapid and convenient it is known that the variables should vary in a smooth way over time so the simple linear interpolation is not suitable for fps the linear fps impairs the model performance and yields less accurate estimated bfc than the nonuniform fps even worse the model performances in the practical experiments when the linear fps is used are worse than those without using fps fig 9 consequently it is important to select a suitable interpolation method for fps to sum up the nonuniform fps developed in this paper is more superior to the uniform fps i e traditional independent point scheme and linear fps except for bfc the uncertainty of topography can also affect the simulation results but it is much more difficult to be corrected than bfc in coastal environment the wave bottom shear stress is also fundamental for morphological changes the estimation of wave bottom shear stress and bottom friction has also been widely investigated fan et al 2019 smith et al 2011 zijlema et al 2012 even so bfc is the most important tuned factor in the tidal models the idea and methodology in this paper may find wide use in the other types of numerical models including ocean engineering models oceanic models atmospheric models water quality models and underground water models 6 conclusions bfc is a main parameter for the numerical simulation of ocean tides and refined estimation of bfc is fundamental to the calibration of tidal models bfc has been verified to be spatially and temporally varying in this study bfc is assumed to be temporally varying to further improve the estimation results a new method named fps is developed in fps the extreme points and endpoints of the time series of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed are selected as feature points fig 2 which are nonuniformly distributed in addition bfcs at other temporal points are obtained by interpolating bfcs at feature points using nonuniform spline interpolation method in twin experiments the temporally varying bfc was assumed to be known and prescribed based on the estimated bfc in the practical application as shown in fig 5 the artificial observations were generated by running the 2d tidal model with the prescribed temporally varying bfc by assimilating the artificial aos the temporally varying bfc was estimated both the simulation results and the estimated bfc using uniform fps were better than those without using fps and those using linear fps but they were worse than those using nonuniform fps table 2 in addition the number of simulated tidal constituents would affect the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc fig 7 when the real observations of sea surface elevation retrieved from t p altimeter data in the bohai sea were assimilated in practical experiments using the adjoint method with nonuniform fps the vectorial error between cos and the simulated results was significantly decreased and less than those with other methods table 5 further indicating the reliability of fps when the assimilation period was changed the temporal variation of the estimated bfc was not changed fig 11a however the estimated temporally varying bfc was changed when the simulated tidal constituents were changed from only m2 tide to four principal tidal constituents fig 11a further showing that the temporally varying bfc was related to the simulated tidal constituents moreover the temporal variation of bfc was negatively correlated with the current speed fig 11 which was possibly related with the suspended sediment transport the results indicated that the developed fps in this study was effective to further improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in addition the estimated temporally varying bfc can be suggestive for the setting of bfc in tidal models credit authorship contribution statement daosheng wang investigation methodology writing original draft jicai zhang conceptualization methodology writing review

21143,refined estimation of bottom friction coefficient bfc is significantly important for coastal engineers to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates which can be realized by assimilating observations of sea surface elevation using the adjoint method in this study a new method named as feature point scheme fps is developed to further improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in fps bfcs at some feature points are assumed to be independent and bfcs at other temporal points are obtained by interpolating bfcs at feature points by assimilating artificial observations in twin experiments it is demonstrated that fps can improve the estimated temporally varying bfc especially with the nonuniformly distributed feature points and nonuniform spline interpolation nonuniform fps the m2 tide and four principal tidal constituents in the bohai sea are then simulated by assimilating real satellite retrieved observations with fps in all the experiments the performance of the tidal model with nonuniform fps outperforms those using other schemes the experimental results indicate that the temporally varying bfc is related to the tidal constituents moreover the temporal variation of estimated bfc has a significantly negative correlation with the current speed which is possibly related with the sediment transport keywords feature point scheme bottom friction coefficient adjoint method data assimilation temporal variation 1 introduction tidal information is required for the design of the coastal and estuarine engineering projects such as coastal structures and harbors as well as exploration of biological resources research in variation of coastal ecological environment and marine resources development chen et al 2007 lee and jeng 2002 bottom stress is responsible for about 75 dissipation of the global surface tidal energy munk and wunsch 1998 and plays an important role in tidal dynamics xu et al 2017 in addition bottom stress is a determining factor influencing the deposition and resuspension of fine sediment dyer 1988 traditionally bottom stress in tidal models is parameterized as a function of the bottom friction coefficient bfc and tidal currents based on the quadratic law mofjeld 1988 xu et al 2017 bfc is commonly used to formulate seafloor boundary conditions for numerical models of ocean tides and in various engineering applications related to lakes rivers and reservoirs lozovatsky et al 2008 consequently bfc is the main parameter for numerical simulation of ocean tides and the refined estimation of bfc is significantly important ullman and wilson 1998 therefore it is of wide interest to coastal engineers to have reliable estimation of bfc to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates arora and bhaskaran 2012 numerous measurements in various parts of the world ocean have testified that bfc varies spatially and temporally ludwick 1975 analyzed the measured velocity in the entrance to chesapeake bay where mean water depth was 12 m and found that bfc changed by four orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 100 as flow varied green and mccave 1995 found that bfc over a 2 month period at a site in the estern irish sea 26 m water depth was highly variable which was coherently explained by the boundary layer stratification caused by suspended sediment cheng et al 1999 estimated bfc by analyzing measurements of turbulent mean velocity over 43 days in south san francisco bay where the water depth was approximately 16 m they found that the daily mean bfc varied with the spring neap tidal cycle and was inversely proportional to the reference velocity when the mean velocity was larger than 25 30 cm s wang et al 2004 analyzed the tidal current speeds measured within the 2 m water column over the tidal flats of northern jiangsu china they pointed out that the estimated bfc varied temporally and was inversely proportional to the reference velocity when the current speeds exceeded 0 3 m s howarth and souza 2005 presented results from nine experiments at six sites in the north and irish seas and one site in the gulf of california and the sites ranged from very tidally energetic shallow 20 m deep to low tidal energy deeper 110 m they pointed out that bfc was dependent on the tidal current speed liu and wei 2007 analyzed 25 h turbulent data at a station with the water depth of 18 1 m in the yellow sea they concluded that bfc varied temporally and was decreased with the increasing mean velocity lozovatsky et al 2008 analyzed the measurements at two stations where the water depths were 38 m and 19 m in the east china sea near the northeastern coast of china they found that bfc was temporally varying and related to the flow safak 2016 investigated the variation of bed drag at a station with water depth of 5 m on a muddy shelf using field observations and found that bfc had a decreasing trend with increasing current speed xu et al 2017 estimated bfc at two stations with water depth of approximately 12 m in xiangshan bay china by analysing the observations they found that the temporally varying bfc during spring neap tide was larger than that during spring tide which was related to the change of tidal current speed fan et al 2019 analyzed in situ measurements of waves currents and turbulence at eight mooring stations where water depth changed from 6 3 m to 73 7 m in the east china shelf seas in their study the variations of current induced bfc showed no obvious relationship with water depth and decreased with the strengthening currents the above studies indicate that bfc varies spatially and temporally with the hydrodynamics sediments and topography etc however at present the constant bfc is still widely used in most of the two dimensional 2d tidal models and many three dimensional 3d ones kagan et al 2012 besides the parameter identification of bfc in tidal models by trial and error is tedious and impractical khatibi et al 1997 siripatana et al 2018 especially when multiple values of bfcs are required the data assimilation methods are developed on rigorous mathematical theories zhang and wang 2014 and have been widely implemented to estimate temporally varying bfc in tidal models ullman and wilson 1998 estimated the temporally and spatially varying bfc in hudson estuary by assimilating acoustic doppler current profiler data collected from a moving vessel with the adjoint method demissie and bacopoulos 2017 estimated the anisotropic manning s n coefficient by assimilating time and space varying velocity measurements in a macrotidal estuary with the nudging analysis slivinski et al 2017 estimated temporally varying manning s n coefficient of friction in a multiple inlet system by assimilating lagrangian data with ensemble kalman filter it indicates that the temporal variability of bfc has received increased attention which motivates the estimation of temporally varying bfc in tidal models with adjoint method in this work when the spatially or temporally varying model parameters are estimated the resulting inverse problem is often ill posed and beset by non uniqueness and instability yeh 1986 zhang and wang 2014 which can be solved by either increasing the well posedness using regularization approach alekseev and navon 2001 tikhonov 1962 or reducing the number of estimated parameters using independent point scheme zhang et al 2018 recently the independent point scheme has been improved by introducing spline interpolation method the one dimensional 1d spline interpolation method has been used in the independent point scheme to improve the estimation of the spatially varying open boundary conditions in a tidal model pan et al 2017 the spatially varying open boundary conditions in a 3d internal tidal model jiang et al 2018 and the temporally varying pollutant emission rate in an ocean pollutant diffusion model zong et al 2018 however in those independent point schemes the independent points are uniformly selected with little physical meaning and the corresponding 1d simplified spline interpolation method is used in this study the adjoint method which has been widely used to estimate the model parameters in oceanic and atmospheric models gejadze et al 2006 navon 1998 wang et al 2018b zou et al 1993 is used to estimate the temporally varying bfc in a 2d tidal model a new method named as feature point scheme fps is developed to improve the estimation results in fps based on the physical factors influencing bfc the feature points are selected nonuniformly in addition bfcs at feature points are assumed to be independent and used to obtain bfcs at all the temporal points with the nonuniform spline interpolation method the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the methodology is described the parameter estimation with fps is verified and discussed using twin experiments in section 3 the temporally varying bfc is estimated using the adjoint method with fps and the estimation results are analyzed in section 4 the discussions and conclusions occupy sections 5 and 6 respectively 2 methodology 2 1 2d tidal model following lu and zhang 2006 and zhang and wang 2014 the governing equations of the 2d tidal model are as follows 1 ζ t 1 a h ζ u λ 1 a h ζ v cos φ φ 0 2 u t u a u λ v r u φ u v tan φ r f v k u u 2 v 2 h ζ a δ u g a ζ ζ λ 0 3 v t u a v λ v r v φ u 2 tan φ r f u k v u 2 v 2 h ζ a δ v g r ζ ζ φ 0 where t is time λ and φ are east longitude and north

to the adjoint method a cost function j is defined to describe the difference between the simulated and observed sea surface elevation lu and zhang 2006 zhang and wang 2014 4 j 1 2 k ζ σ ζ ζ ˆ 2 d σ where ζ ˆ is the observed sea surface elevation that is assimilated into the 2d tidal model σ is the set of the observation locations k ζ is the weighting matrix and theoretically should be the inverse of the observation error covariance matrix which can be simplified by assuming that the errors of data are uncorrelated and equally weighted yu and o brien 1992 similar to wang et al 2018a the elements in k ζ are 1 where observations are available and 0 otherwise based on the lagrange multiplier method thacker and long 1988 the lagrangian function is defined as 5 l j σ τ left side of eq 1 right side of eq 1 μ left side of eq 2 right side of eq 2 ν left side of eq 3 right side of eq 3 d σ where τ μ and ν are the adjoint variables of ζ u and v respectively according to the theory of lagrange multiplier method thacker and long 1988 the first order derivate of the lagrangian function with respect to the variables and parameters should be zero to minimize the cost function 6 l ζ 0 l u 0 l v 0 7 l τ 0 l μ 0 l ν 0 8 l k 0 from eq 6 the adjoint model which governs the evolution of the adjoint variables τ μ and ν can be obtained the detailed formulae and numerical scheme of the adjoint model can be found in lu and zhang 2006 2 3 estimation of temporally varying bfc using the adjoint method with fps 2 3 1 fps in fps all the temporal points are assumed to be uniformly distributed and labelled as general points with index of gp m m 1 2 m as shown in fig 1 some temporal points are selected as feature points with index of fp n n 1 2 n fig 1 the detailed selection strategy of feature points will be given in the next section it is assumed that bfcs at feature points are independent and bfcs at general points are obtained by interpolating those at feature points as the distribution of feature points is usually nonuniform the nonuniform spline interpolation is used which is as follows 9 k gp m n 1 n w m n k fp n where k gp m is bfc at general point gp m k fp n is bfc at feature point fp n and w m n is the weighting coefficient in nonuniform spline interpolation and the element in weight matrix w for the whole time domain the relationship between bfcs at general points and bfcs at feature points can be expressed in matrix form as 10 k gp w k fp where 11 k gp k gp 1 k gp 2 k gp m t k 1 k 2 k m t 12 k fp k fp 1 k fp 2 k fp n t k 1 k 2 k n t when the condition of continuous second derivative and the natural boundary condition are considered the weight matrix w can be deduced see appendix a as follows 13 w c d a 1 b where 14 c m n gp m t n fp n 1 t

n 1 and fp n and δt is the time interval between any two adjacent general points as shown in eq 18 t n is equal to fp n 1 fp n times δt if the feature points are uniformly distributed fps is degenerated into the traditional independent point scheme used in previous studies e g pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and zong et al 2018 which will be called uniform fps in this study correspondingly fps with nonuniformly distributed feature points will be called nonuniform fps 2 3 2 selection of feature points as the real temporal variability of bfc in one area is not known in advance the feature points in fps cannot be selected based on the distribution of bfc as indicated in soulsby 1983 ullman and wilson 1998 and wang et al 2014 bfc is related to the water depth in addition the current also affects bfc as shown in lozovatsky et al 2008 xu et al 2017 and fan et al 2019 therefore when bfc is assumed to be temporally varying both the temporal variations of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed may have an impact on bfc in general the extreme points are the feature points in one time series so the extreme points and two endpoints of the time series of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed are selected as feature points in fps when estimating temporally varying bfc using the adjoint method with fps in a practical context the feature points can be selected as follows step1 before the temporally varying bfc is estimated the 2d tidal model is run with a constant bfc i e the initial guess value of bfc in the adjoint method that is usually used in the traditional simulation step2 the current speed is calculated with the simulated meridional and zonal velocity then the simulated sea surface elevation and current speed in the whole simulation area in step1 are spatially averaged yielding their temporal distributions step3 find the extreme points of the two time series by comparing the values at one point with those at its adjacent points a point with its values not less or not larger than the values at both left and right points is identified as an extreme point step4 all the extreme points and two endpoints in those two time series are taken as feature points fig 2 showed an example of the temporal variability of the spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed and the distributions of the selected feature points in the bohai sea 2 3 3 estimation of temporally varying bfc with fps from eq 8 the gradient of the cost function with respect to bfc is obtained which is as follows 19 j k μ u u 2 v 2 h ζ ν v u 2 v 2 h ζ when fps is used bfcs at feature points are estimated and bfcs at general points are obtained by interpolating those at feature points the gradients of the cost function with respect to bfc at feature points are obtained by the nonuniform interpolation of the gradients at general points which is as follows 20 j k fp n m 1 m w m n j k gp m when the gradients are calculated the temporally varying bfcs at feature points are estimated using the steepest descent method which is as follows 21 k fp l 1 k fp l γ g fp l where γ is the step size l is the lth iteration step of parameter estimation g fp is the gradient vector of cost function with respect to bfc at feature points which is as follows 22 g fp j k fp 1 j k fp 2 j k fp n j k fp n 1 j k fp n t as indicated by elbern et al 2007 the independent observations which are not assimilated should be used to test the validity of the data assimilation following wang et al 2018b the independent observations are labelled as checking observations cos and the observation assimilated into the 2d tidal model are labelled as assimilating observations aos the processes of estimating bfc using the adjoint method with fps are shown in fig 3 the details are not shown here for brevity 2 4 model settings the model area is the bohai sea as shown in fig 4 with horizontal resolution of 10 10 the time series of sea surface elevation at the open boundaries are obtained from oregon state university tidal inversion software egbert and erofeeva 2002 following wang et al 2014 the horizontal eddy viscosity coefficient is set as a constant with a value of 1000 m2 s and the default value of bfc is 0 0015 the time step and simulation period will be described in the specific numerical experiments the tidal harmonic constants including amplitude and phase lag utc the same below retrieved from topex poseidon t p altimeter data are taken as aos the tidal harmonic constants at coastal tidal gauge stations in the bohai sea are taken as cos for independent verification the spatial positions of the t p satellite tracks and tidal gauge stations are shown in fig 4b the stop criterion of the adjoint method in fig 3 is that the difference of cost function values normalized by the value at the first step between the last two steps is less than 5 0 10 5 with a maximum value of 100 for iteration steps in addition as background values the estimated bfc is set to be not smaller than 1 0 10 5 times default bfc the open boundary conditions are fixed and only the temporally varying bfc is estimated in this study 3 twin experiments 3 1 experimental design in fact the true values of bfc are not known in the practical applications to evaluate the effectiveness of fps several twin experiments were designed in which the true values of bfc were assumed to be known and prescribed based on the estimated bfc in the practical experiment without using fps for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te1 the prescribed bfc was obtained as follows firstly a pre experiment in which only the m2 tide was simulated in one typical m2 tidal period with a time step of 62 103 s was carried out to estimate bfc by assimilating the real t p altimeter data without fps then the estimated bfcs at the extreme points and two endpoints were interpolated using the nonuniform spline interpolation method finally the interpolated bfcs fig 5 a were taken as the prescribed bfc in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 and te3 the prescribed bfcs were the same and were also given by interpolating the estimated bfc in a pre experiment in the pre experiment four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simulated for 30 days the initial 15 days were for spinning up from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s by assimilating real t p altimeter data the estimated bfcs at the extreme points and two endpoints during the final 15 days were interpolated using the nonuniform spline interpolation method to obtain the prescribed bfc as shown in fig 5b the artificial observations in the twin experiments were obtained by running the 2d tidal model with the corresponding prescribed temporally varying bfc fig 5 and the other default model settings in addition the simulated results at the positions of the t p altimeter data were taken as artificial aos while those at the positions of tidal gauge stations were taken as artificial cos for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te1 the 2d tidal model was run to simulate only m2 tide in one typical m2 tidal period with a time step of 62 103 s for the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 te3 the 2d tidal model was run to simulate only m2 tide four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 for 30 days from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s and the initial 15 days using the averaged value of the prescribed temporally varying bfc were for spinning up the detailed experimental settings of the twin experiments are listed in table 1 in te1 1 the temporally varying bfc was estimated by assimilating the artificial aos using nonuniform fps and the initial guess value of bfc was set to the averaged value of the prescribed bfc in addition the nonuniformly distributed feature points were selected using the algorithm described in section 2 3 2 and are shown in fig 2 considering that the last extreme point of the spatially averaged current speed was near to the endpoint it was not used and the number of nonuniformly distributed feature points was 7 in te1 1 in te1 2 the temporally varying bfc was estimated without fps the temporally varying bfc was estimated using uniform fps in te1 3 in which the number of feature points were changed from 6 to 46 fig 6 a in te1 4 the temporally varying bfc was estimated using fps with simple linear interpolation linear fps the linear interpolation in zhang and wang 2014 was used in te1 4 i e the weight matrix w in eq 10 in this study was replaced by that in zhang and wang 2014 in addition the distribution of feature points was the same as that in te1 1 in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 and te3 the nonuniform fps uniform fps and linear fps were used in the experiments numbered with postfix 1 3 and 4 respectively while postfix 2 meant that the temporally varying bfc was estimated without fps in those experiments following fang et al 2004 besides the mean absolute errors maes between the observed and simulated tidal amplitude and phase lag the model performance was also evaluated using vectorial error between the observed and simulated tidal harmonic constants which is as follows 23 v e h o b s cos g o b s h s i m cos g s i m 2 h o b s sin g o b s h s i m sin g s i m 2 1 2 where ve is the vectorial error h obs and g obs are the observed tidal amplitude and phase lag of one tidal constituent respectively h sim and g sim are the corresponding simulated tidal amplitude and phase lag respectively 3 2 results when the artificial aos were assimilated the vectorial errors between the artificial cos and the corresponding simulated results were decreased significantly in te1 1 te1 2 te1 3 and te1 4 table 2 indicating the effectiveness of parameter estimation using adjoint data assimilation as listed in table 2 the vectorial error between the artificial cos and the corresponding simulated results in te1 1 reduced to 5 09 10 1 cm from an initial value of 7 05 cm indicating that the model performance was improved with an error reduction of 92 78 as shown in fig 6a when the uniform fps was used in te1 3 the vectorial errors for cos changed with the number of feature points when the number of uniformly distributed feature points was larger than 41 the vectorial errors were larger than that in te1 2 where fps was not used indicating that choice of a reasonable number of feature points in uniform fps was important when the number of uniformly distributed feature points was between 11 and 41 the vectorial errors were less than that in te1 2 and larger than that in te1 4 in addition the minimum in te1 3 was achieved when the number was 7 and was less than those in te1 2 and te1 4 but it was still larger than that in te1 1 indicating that the best model performance after data assimilation was obtained when the nonuniform fps was used as shown in fig 7 a the estimated bfcs in te1 2 and te1 4 were obviously far from the prescribed bfc near the maxima or minima although the estimated bfc in te1 1 was not exactly equal to the prescribed bfc it had the same variation pattern with the prescribed bfc r 0 98 and was much closer to the prescribed values than those in te1 2 te1 3 with 7 feature points and te1 4 in details maes between the prescribed bfc and the estimated values in te1 1 was 1 59 10 4 table 2 while those in te1 2 te1 3 and te1 4 were 2 84 10 4 1 76 10 4 and 2 96 10 4 respectively showing that the estimated bfc using nonuniform fps was the most accurate when the assimilation period was changed to 15 days in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 the mean vectorial errors for aos and cos were also significantly decreased after data assimilation as listed in table 2 when the uniform fps was used the optimal number of the uniformly distributed feature points was 201 fig 6b and the mean vectorial error for cos was 8 03 10 1 cm in te2 3 which was less than those in te2 2 and te2 4 and slightly larger than that in te2 1 table 2 in addition mae between the prescribed and estimated bfc was 3 44 10 4 in te2 1 which was nearly equal to that in te2 3 and less than those in te2 2 and te2 4 table 2 overall the results in te2 1 were slightly better than those in te2 2 te2 3 and te2 4 the prescribed bfc in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 was based on the pre experiments in which four principal tidal constituents were simulated but the estimated bfcs using four different schemes in te2 1 te2 4 had the similarly regular temporal variations and did not capture the prime pattern in the prescribed bfc fig 7b showing that the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc may be influenced by the simulated tidal constituents when the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simulated by assimilating artificial aos in the twin experiments numbered with prefix te3 the patterns of the estimated temporally varying bfcs were much close to the prescribed bfc fig 7c in addition maes between the prescribed and estimated bfcs were much less than those in the corresponding twin experiments numbered with prefix te2 table 2 showing that the number of the simulated tidal constituents could influence the estimation of bfc both the mean vectorial error for cos and the mae between the prescribed and estimated bfc in te3 1 were less than those in te3 2 te3 3 and te3 4 table 2 indicating that both the simulated results and the estimated bfc using nonuniform fps were much more accurate than those using other methods overall in all the three groups of the twin experiments both the vectorial error for cos and the mae between the estimated and prescribed bfc in experiments with suffix 1 where the nonuniform fps was used were less than those in other experiments with the other methods indicating the effectiveness of nonuniform fps in improving the estimation of bfc besides the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc was related to the number of the simulated tidal constituents 4 practical experiments 4 1 experimental design in practical experiments the tidal harmonic constants retrieved from t p altimeter data were taken as aos in addition the tidal harmonic constants at tidal gauge stations were taken as cos to test the efficiency of fps developed in this study in practical applications several numerical experiments were carried out as listed in table 3 in group1 the experiments were indexed with prefix exp1 in which only the m2 tide was simulated the 2d tidal model was run for 20 days from january 1 2015 with the time step of 180 s the initial 15 days were for spinning up and only the results in final 5 days were analyzed in addition the adjoint model was run for 5 days backward in time from january 21 2015 with the time step of 180 s in exp1 1 the initial guess value of bfc was set to the default value 0 0015 and the temporally varying bfc was estimated using the adjoint method with nonuniform fps the nonuniformly distributed feature points were selected following the processes in section 2 3 2 in exp1 2 the temporally varying bfc was estimated using the adjoint method without fps and the other experimental settings were the same as those in exp1 1 in exp1 3 fps was also used however unlike that in exp1 1 the distribution of feature points in exp1 3 was uniform and the number of feature points was changed from 49 to 121 in exp1 4 linear fps was used and the other model settings were the same as those in exp1 1 to test the influence of assimilation period several experiments indexed with prefix exp2 were set up in group2 in these experiments only the m2 tide was simulated but the 2d tidal model was run for 30 days from january 1 2015 and only the results in the final 15 days were analyzed in addition the adjoint model was run for 15 days backward in time from january 31 2015 the other model settings were the same as those in group1 to test the influence of simulated tidal constituents four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simultaneously simulated in group3 and the other model settings were the same as those in group2 similar to those in group1 the nonuniform fps uniform fps with diffident number of feature points and linear fps were used to improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in exp2 1 exp3 1 exp2 3 exp3 3 and exp2 4 exp3 4 in group2 group3 respectively in addition the temporally varying bfc was estimated without using fps in exp2 2 and exp3 2 4 2 results when aos were assimilated and the temporally varying bfc was estimated with nonuniform fps in exp1 1 maes of m2 tidal harmonic constants amplitude and phase lag and vectorial error for aos after data assimilation were decreased table 4 showing that the aos were adequately assimilated in addition both maes of m2 tidal harmonic constants and vectorial error for cos were largely reduced and tended to be stable fig 8 as the observational information of cos was not used to optimize the simulation results during data assimilation maes of m2 amplitude in exp1 1 were unexpectedly increased in the first several steps fig 8a however with the adjustment of the 2d tidal model during estimation of temporally varying bfc maes were then decreased and less than the value before data assimilation fig 8a in detail maes of m2 tidal amplitude and phase lag for cos were reduced to 5 26 cm and 2 69 from the initial values of 5 92 cm and 7 53 in exp1 1 as listed in table 5 in addition the vectorial error for cos in exp1 1 was reduced to 6 34 cm after data assimilation from an initial value of 10 49 cm indicating that the model performance was improved with a reduction of 39 56 in overall simulation error as shown in fig 9 a when the uniform fps was used the best model performance was obtained when the number of feature points was 61 which was taken as the result of exp1 3 although the maes and vectorial errors for cos in exp1 2 exp1 3 and exp1 4 were also reduced table 5 the results after data assimilation were larger than those in exp1 1 table 5 and fig 9a showing that the nonuniform fps could effectively improve the effect of adjoint data assimilation when the assimilation period was increased to 15 days in the experiments numbered with prefix exp2 maes of m2 tidal harmonic parameters and vectorial error for both aos and cos were approximatively equal to those in the experiments numbered with prefix exp1 tables 4 and 5 in addition the variation patterns of maes of m2 tidal harmonic parameters and vectorial error for cos in exp2 1 were nearly the same as those in exp1 1 fig 8 as the assimilation period was changed the optimal number of feature points in exp2 3 was different from that in exp1 3 and the minimum vectorial error for cos was larger than that in exp2 1 as shown in fig 9b although the vectorial errors for cos in exp2 2 and exp2 4 were slightly less than those in exp1 2 and exp1 4 respectively they were also larger than that in exp2 1 fig 9b the results showed that when the assimilation period was increased to 15 days the model performance after data assimilation using the nonuniform fps was still better than those using other methods when the four principal tidal constituents m2 s2 k1 and o1 were simultaneously simulated in the experiments numbered with prefix exp3 maes and vectorial error between the harmonic constants of four tidal constituents and the corresponding simulated results were calculated except for the k1 phase lag maes of tidal harmonic constants and vectorial error of other tidal constituents for cos in exp3 1 were less than those before data assimilation as shown in fig 8 although maes and vectorial error of m2 tide after data assimilation for cos in exp3 1 were larger than those in exp1 1 and exp2 1 fig 8a c the mean values of four tidal constituents were significantly decreased and tended to be stable as shown in fig 8m o when the uniform fps was used in exp3 3 the optimal number of feature points was 151 fig 9c which was different from that in exp2 3 in addition the corresponding mean vectorial error for cos was slightly larger than that in exp3 1 fig 9c the averaged maes of harmonic constants for four tidal constituents and the mean vectorial error for cos after data assimilation in exp3 2 and exp3 4 were significantly decreased but all of them were larger than those in exp3 1 as listed in table 5 the results indicated that the nonuniform fps had better performance than the other methods overall the experimental results demonstrated that fps with nonuniformly distributed feature points which were selected based on physical background was an effective method to improve the simulation results after data assimilation whether only m2 tide or four principal tidal constituents were simulated 4 3 temporal variation of the estimated bfc the estimated temporally varying bfc in all the practical experiments are shown in fig 10 although different methods were used in the experiments numbered with prefix exp1 the patterns of the estimated temporally varying bfcs in these experiments were similar to each other confirmed by that the correlation coefficients between the estimated bfc in exp1 1 and those in the other three experiments were not smaller than 0 95 the similar conclusion could be obtained in the experiments numbered with prefix exp2 when the four principal tidal constituents were simulated in the experiments numbered with prefix exp3 the estimated temporally varying bfcs were much irregular in addition the correlation coefficient between the estimated bfc in exp3 1 and those in other three experiments were obviously smaller than those when only the m2 tide was simulated however the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc in exp3 1 was significantly positively r 0 78 correlated with those in other three experiments to further compare the estimated bfcs in different groups of the practical experiments the estimated temporally varying bfcs in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 were phase averaged using the method in voulgaris and meyers 2004 and murphy and voulgaris 2006 and the results are shown in fig 11 a it was shown that the phase averaged bfc in exp1 1 was nearly equal to that in exp2 1 indicating that the estimation of bfc was not affected by the assimilation period the averaged bfc is exp3 1 was largely far from those in exp1 1 and exp2 1 which was attributed to the different simulated tidal constituents the aforementioned results demonstrated that the estimated temporally varying bfc was related to the simulated tidal constituents and not affected by the other model settings which meant that the temporal variation of bfc was relatively robust and of great physical meaning more importantly the estimated bfcs in the practical experiments varied periodically as shown in fig 12 a the significant spectral peaks in the power spectral densities of the estimated temporally varying bfcs in both exp1 1 and exp2 1 appeared in the quarter diurnal frequency band showing the quarter diurnal variation in estimated bfc when only the m2 tide was simulated the variation of the estimated bfc in exp3 1 was dominated by the signals in the d3 and d4 frequency bands fig 12a which was different from those in exp1 1 and exp1 2 and was related to the different simulated tidal constituents as shown in fig 12b the power spectral densities of the spatially averaged current speed in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 had the similar pattern to those of the estimated bfc in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 respectively in addition the correlation coefficients between the power spectral densities of current speed and bfc in these three experiments were larger than 0 95 indicating that the temporal variations of the estimated bfc may relate to the current speed the spatially averaged current speeds in exp1 1 exp2 1 and exp3 1 were also phase averaged using the method in voulgaris and meyers 2004 and murphy and voulgaris 2006 and the results are shown in fig 11b c and d respectively the correlation coefficients between the phase averaged current speed and bfc in exp1 1 and exp2 1 were 0 86 the phase averaged current speed and bfc were not smooth in exp3 1 but the correlation coefficient was 0 62 the results demonstrated the significantly negative correlation between the current speed and bfc whether only m2 tide or four principal tidal constituents were simulated 5 discussions 5 1 possible mechanisms for temporal variation of bfc as mentioned in previous studies bfc is commonly used in various engineering applications related to coastal ocean estuarine areas lakes rivers and reservoirs lozovatsky et al 2008 consequently reliable estimation of bfc is significantly important for relevant engineers to determine precisely the hydrodynamic conditions and sediment transport rates arora and bhaskaran 2012 there are many possible factors affecting the variation of bfc water depth soulsby 1983 ullman and wilson 1998 wang et al 2014 waves christoffersen and jonsson 1985 drost et al 2018 boundary layer stratification caused by suspended sediment green and mccave 1995 vertical stratification ullman and wilson 1998 current speed cheng et al 1999 fan et al 2019 lozovatsky et al 2008 ludwick 1975 safak 2016 wang et al 2004 xu et al 2017 sea floor types or bottom roughness cheng et al 1999 howarth and souza 2005 mofjeld 1988 soulsby 1983 1997 phase of tide howarth and souza 2005 soulsby 1983 and form drag warner and maccready 2009 although the averaged bfc over the whole bohai sea may include additional sources of drag such as form drag warner and maccready 2009 the temporally varying bfc estimated in this study has significantly negative correlation with the current speed which is the same as that obtained from field observations in previous studies cheng et al 1999 fan et al 2019 lozovatsky et al 2008 wang et al 2004 xu et al 2017 we speculate that the negative correlation between bfc and current speed may be related to the suspended sediment transport in the bohai sea there are patchy distribution of the sea floor mud in the bohai sea qiao et al 2017 which is the results of transport of river input sediments by the ocean current bian et al 2013 showing that the suspended sediment transport is a common and important phenomenon in the bohai sea in a period of accelerating current the sediments at seabed surface is entrained into the bottom boundary layer wang et al 2004 resulting in that the bedforms become more rounded or are washed out gradually cheng et al 1999 van rijn 1993 and the suspended sediment concentrations in bottom boundary layer increase therefore the decreasing effective bed roughness and changing boundary layer stratification will reduce bfc of course the speculation should be further confirmed by the field observations in future work although several formulae of bfc have been proposed and used in the numerical models they are problem dependent and not universal for all types of applications as pointed by fringer et al 2019 more research in theoretic study and in situ observing is needed to further improve the parameterization of bfc by considering bottom roughness bedforms vegetation and corals 5 2 superiority of the developed fps when the feature points are selected uniformly the developed fps in this study is degenerated into the traditional independent point scheme with uniformly distributed feature points and uniform spline interpolation method in previous studies e g pan et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 and zong et al 2018 as shown in figs 6 and 9 when the uniform fps was used the vectorial errors between cos and the corresponding simulated results changed with the number of feature points when the assimilation period was changed in practical experiments the optimal number of uniformly distributed feature points in exp2 3 was greatly different from that in exp1 3 fig 9 in addition when the simulated tidal constituents were changed the optimal number was also changed from 181 in exp2 3 to 151 in exp3 3 therefore it is necessary to seek out the most reasonable number by testing all the possible numbers for each experiment which is tedious and time consuming conversely when the nonuniform fps is used the number and distribution of feature points can be determined directly by analysing the temporal distribution of the spatially averaged sea level elevation and current speed as shown in section 2 3 2 which is rapid and convenient it is known that the variables should vary in a smooth way over time so the simple linear interpolation is not suitable for fps the linear fps impairs the model performance and yields less accurate estimated bfc than the nonuniform fps even worse the model performances in the practical experiments when the linear fps is used are worse than those without using fps fig 9 consequently it is important to select a suitable interpolation method for fps to sum up the nonuniform fps developed in this paper is more superior to the uniform fps i e traditional independent point scheme and linear fps except for bfc the uncertainty of topography can also affect the simulation results but it is much more difficult to be corrected than bfc in coastal environment the wave bottom shear stress is also fundamental for morphological changes the estimation of wave bottom shear stress and bottom friction has also been widely investigated fan et al 2019 smith et al 2011 zijlema et al 2012 even so bfc is the most important tuned factor in the tidal models the idea and methodology in this paper may find wide use in the other types of numerical models including ocean engineering models oceanic models atmospheric models water quality models and underground water models 6 conclusions bfc is a main parameter for the numerical simulation of ocean tides and refined estimation of bfc is fundamental to the calibration of tidal models bfc has been verified to be spatially and temporally varying in this study bfc is assumed to be temporally varying to further improve the estimation results a new method named fps is developed in fps the extreme points and endpoints of the time series of spatially averaged sea surface elevation and current speed are selected as feature points fig 2 which are nonuniformly distributed in addition bfcs at other temporal points are obtained by interpolating bfcs at feature points using nonuniform spline interpolation method in twin experiments the temporally varying bfc was assumed to be known and prescribed based on the estimated bfc in the practical application as shown in fig 5 the artificial observations were generated by running the 2d tidal model with the prescribed temporally varying bfc by assimilating the artificial aos the temporally varying bfc was estimated both the simulation results and the estimated bfc using uniform fps were better than those without using fps and those using linear fps but they were worse than those using nonuniform fps table 2 in addition the number of simulated tidal constituents would affect the pattern of the estimated temporally varying bfc fig 7 when the real observations of sea surface elevation retrieved from t p altimeter data in the bohai sea were assimilated in practical experiments using the adjoint method with nonuniform fps the vectorial error between cos and the simulated results was significantly decreased and less than those with other methods table 5 further indicating the reliability of fps when the assimilation period was changed the temporal variation of the estimated bfc was not changed fig 11a however the estimated temporally varying bfc was changed when the simulated tidal constituents were changed from only m2 tide to four principal tidal constituents fig 11a further showing that the temporally varying bfc was related to the simulated tidal constituents moreover the temporal variation of bfc was negatively correlated with the current speed fig 11 which was possibly related with the suspended sediment transport the results indicated that the developed fps in this study was effective to further improve the estimation of temporally varying bfc in addition the estimated temporally varying bfc can be suggestive for the setting of bfc in tidal models credit authorship contribution statement daosheng wang investigation methodology writing original draft jicai zhang conceptualization methodology writing review

petroleum kuwait university kuwait corresponding author experimental investigations were carried out to assess the wave induced pressures on slotted vertical barriers thirty six different wave barrier configurations 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 porosities and 1 to 6 numbers of slotted walls were tested in random wave fields of jonswap spectra for different combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods it is found that on the dynamic pressure on vertical slotted wave barrier reduces progressively from the seaside to the rear side in general the dynamic pressure coefficient ps ρghis 2 reduces with an increase in relative water depth d lp where ps is the significant dynamic pressure ρg is the weight density of water his is the significant incident wave height d is the water depth and lp is the wave length corresponds to peak wave period it is also found that the highest value of measured ps ρghis 2 is about 1 5 the barrier with 3 walls and 10 porosity and for d lp of 0 3 the seaside wall panel experience dynamic pressure coefficient of 1 44 the first rear wall with 0 82 and the lee side porous wall with 0 58 the results can be used for the optimal design of the panels of multiple

construction material for breakwaters of ports harbors marina detached breakwater groins and seawalls hudson 1959 van der meer 1987 and van der meer and daemen 1994 for stability rubble mound breakwaters are designed with needed factor of safety on the armor units roughness density of the rocks and slopes van der meer 1988 there is no control on density roughness and even the size of rocks when it is quarried from a borrow pit or hill and hence the engineers select appropriate slope of the breakwater to achieve needed stability for example for a location with mean water depth of 3 0 m and less tidal variation slopes of 1 2 and freeboard and crest width of 3 m a typical offshore rubble mound breakwater needs about 90 m3 of rocks m run to protect erosion for a coast of 200 m long one needs about 18 000 to 20 000 m3 of rocks this shows that wave damping applications with rubble mound offshore breakwater is a high volume solution with either tombola or spit formation at the rear side of the breakwater nicholson et al 1997 construction of offshore rubble mound breakwater is also an expensive operation since it needs floating barges and cranes and many weeks or months of good weather window for dumping of stones and periodic verification of the underwater profile by divers the other environmental issue is that if the rubble mound needs to be removed in future due to any negative environmental impact it becomes much more or equally expensive than construction itself and time consuming emerged offshore rubble mound breakwaters with impervious core restrict free exchange of seawater between seaside and rear side this lead to water quality problems issues on the coastal waters since rubbles are heavy and if the bearing capacity of the seabed is poor like soft cohesive sediments then strength improvement of foundation becomes another expensive part of the field construction activities quarrying stones from mountains and underground sources has become a sensitive environmental issue recently with all these sensitive issues it is essential to innovate cost competitive easy to build and environmentally benign wave damping structures porous structures like series of slotted vertical walls are one such solution neelamani and al anjari 2018 a typical vertical slotted barrier configuration used in the present study is shown in fig 1 the walls are arranged in zigzag manner in this study to create longer flow path to increase the wave energy dissipation for a successful design of such slotted wave barriers a detailed knowledge on wave scattering wave transmission reflection and dissipation wave loads on the structure wave induced pressures on the slotted walls total inline force and the wave induced moment due to the total inline force are needed a detailed scientific investigation is carried out on such porous structure by neelamani and al anjari 2018 the results on wave scattering are presented by neelamani and al anjari 2020a in this manuscript the number of porous walls and the porosity required to achieve a certain desired wave transmission coefficients are revealed it is found that to achieve the same level of wave transmission the volume of material required for suitable slotted vertical wave barrier is much less than 10 of the volume of rocks required for detached breakwater for assessing the stability against sliding and overtopping the knowledge on total wave force and wave induced moments are required and are presented by neelamani and al anjari 2020 however for the structural design of the plates of the porous walls a thorough knowledge on wave induced pressures for a wide range of incident wave conditions are needed the effect of porosity and number of porous wall on the dynamic pressure is also needed hence a detailed experimental investigation is carried out to measure the wave induced pressures on the panels the data are analyzed and the results are presented in this paper this type of wave barrier is specifically required for most of the gulf cooperation council gcc countries such as kuwait qatar bahrain saudi arabia uae and oman where good quality rocks are not available and are imported from other countries at high costs the technology for prefabrication of panels is well advanced over the last few decades fernández ordóñez hernández d 2018 the porous array of wave barriers can be prefabricated or molded using high strength polyethylene and polypropylene noodles which are available locally as a byproduct of crude oil refining assembled in a land based factory and can be installed quickly during good weather window for countries with narrow weather window even with availability of plenty of rocks at nearby locations slotted wave barriers can be a good option from construction management point of view the other merits of slotted wave barrier include easy fish passage sediment movement across the barrier and low construction cost mani and jayakumar 1995 and koutandos 2009 2 literature review slotted breakwaters were used at few harbors around the world some promising are baie comeau harbor and chandler harbor in canada roscoff harbor in france half moon bay marina in new zealand and plymouth harbor in the united states mei et al 1974 hutchinson and raudkivi 1984 gardner et al 1986 there is no literature to reveal whether these breakwaters are optimally designed for the prevailing design environmental conditions optimally designed wave barrier should have a minimum number of slotted walls with maximum porosity so that the material used for the construction is minimum many literatures are published on wave transmission and wave energy dissipation of vertical slotted perforated breakwaters some of them are terret et al 1968 hayashi et al

experimentally measured the wave induced pressures on single vertical porous wall monochromatic non breaking and slightly breaking waves on such structures are examined and results are compared with goda formula for impermeable vertical walls and a modified goda method was developed for permeable walls by introducing structure porosity to account for the nonlinear processes at permeable walls sahoo et al 2000 has studied on the phenomena of wave trapping by a single vertical porous barrier of four different configurations and wave generation by vertical porous wave makers of three different configurations in front of the end wall of a semi infinitely long channel it is reported that the average pressure distributions on a porous wave maker and on the channel end wall decrease as the porous effect parameter increases koraim 2011 has carried out studies using eigenfunction expansion method and lab measurements with a single vertical slotted barrier and reported that the proposed theoretical model can be used for predicting the performance of slotted breakwaters and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on these structures using the friction coefficient f 1 5 huang et al 2011 carried out a detailed review on the hydraulic performance and the wave loading on perforated slotted coastal structures for slotted barriers with more than two to three rows limited research work has been done so far hagiwara 1984 ji and suh 2010 ji and suh 2010 proved that two and three row slotted barrier performed better than single slotted barrier studies related to wave structure interaction on other types of special breakwaters are plenty some of them are by neelamani and rajendran 2001 neelamani and vedagiri 2001 teh et al 2012 and rahman and aktar 2014 neelamani and gayathri experimentally investigated the wave pressures on twin plate wave barriers and recommended that the twin plate barrier needs to be designed for highest 98 pressure ratio value of 2 0 which is equal to the static pressure induced by the design incident wave height al khalidi et al 2015a and b carried out studies on wave forces and dynamic pressures on porous breakwater with a rear side nonporous wall and up to two porous walls for harbor applications the experimental results indicate that the porosity affects the dynamic pressures significantly especially near the free surface but less so closer to the seabed taqi et al 2013 and neelamani et al 2016 studied wave reflection characteristics on a similar structure with more number of slotted walls and for a wide range of porosities there are many investigations based on analytical and numerical methods on the slotted vertical barriers svbs noticeable are chen et al 2006 al salem et al 2014 molin and remy 2015 elbisy et al 2016 valizadeh and rudman 2017 liu and li 2017 alsaydalani et al 2017 neelamani et al 2017 neelamani et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2018 vijay et al 2019 hussein and ibrahim 2019 ibrahim 2019 george and cho 2020 poguluri and cho 2020 vijay et al 2020 and mackay and johanning 2020 elbisy et al 2016 studied the wave interaction with double row and triple row porous walls using eigenfunction expansion method it is found that double row slotted breakwaters may exhibit a good wave absorbing performance for kd 0 5 where by the horizontal wave force may be smaller than that of a single wall it was also found that the difference between double row and triple row vertical slotted breakwaters is marginal from the hydrodynamic scattering and wave force point of view alsaydalani et al 2017 have examined the hydrodynamic performance of three row vertical slotted wall barriers using eigenfunction expansion method and a least squares technique the front and middle walls are permeable and partially immersed in a flume water and the third wall is impermeable comparisons of the theoretical results of wave scattering and wave forces with experimental measurements show that the mathematical model adequately reproduce most of the important features neelamani et al 2017 experimentally investigated the wave reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of vertical porous walls 1 6 walls and porosity from 10 to 50 with an impermeable rear wall under random wave conditions of jonswap spectrum it is proved that by increasing the number of porous walls from one to six it is possible to reduce the value of the reflection coefficient from 0 9 to 0 3 especially for a d l p greater than 0 2 neelamani et al 2018 further extended this study and proved that vertical perforated wave barriers are also better than sloped rubble mound breakwaters especially for long wave conditions for relatively long waves reflection coefficient of 0 27 can be achieved with six units of slotted walls with 40 porosity when compared to 0 57 for conventional slopped rubble mound breakwaters the material required for the construction of this slotted wave barrier is only about 14 when compared to the conventional rubble barrier vijay et al 2019 developed a numerical model based on the direct iterative boundary element method and is validated with the measured wave reflection by neelamani et al 2018 in numerical modeling a quadratic pressure drop is considered for the slotted walls for wave past the porous barriers to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation satisfactory comparison between numerical model and the measured reflection values are reported for a wide range of wave period number of porous walls and porosity hussein and ibrahim 2019 investigated on the wave transmission and reflection on two types of wave barriers with an economic feasibility in mind the first type consists of two vertical perforated walls the first wall is permeable in the lower part with 50 porosity and the upper part is impermeable and the second wall is 50 permeable in the upper part and the lower part is impermeable a horizontal slotted wall is also provided in between these two walls the second type is similar to the first type but without horizontal slotted wall flow3d is used for assessing the hydrodynamic performance it was found that first type is better than the second type by 10 15 because of the presence of the horizontal slotted wall the wave force on the first model is higher than the second model in the range of 10 15 ibrahim 2019 has assessed the wave transmission and wave forces on vertical walls with circular and square slots using numerical models and found that square slot is better for wave transmission by 5 15 with pair of walls with circular slots it is found that the relative wave force increases from 10 to 30 if porosity is reduced from 0 5 to 0 25 george and cho 2020 have studied the wave interaction problem with a vertical slotted breakwater consisting of impermeable upper lower parts and a permeable middle part the far field solution of the wave scattering involving nonlinear porous boundary condition was obtained using eigenfunction expansion method the empirical formula for drag coefficient in the near field representing energy dissipation across the slotted barrier was assessed by curve fitting of the numerical solutions of 2 d channel flow using cfd code starccm the theoretical model was validated with laboratory experiments for various configurations of a slotted barrier and the comparisons are found to be good poguluri and cho 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a partially submerged vertical slotted barrier based on an analytical and numerical approach in regular waves the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem was used to solve the boundary value problem including the porous boundary condition the drag coefficient representing the energy dissipation was estimated by the best possible fitting curve to cfd results for a 2d simplified channel model a 3d implicit unsteady turbulent model based on incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was adopted to assess the analytical meem solutions the analytical and numerical solutions show relatively good agreement with the experimental results of hydrodynamic performance and horizontal forces on the vertical slotted barrier vijay et al 2020 theoretically investigated the gravity wave interaction with a wave attenuating system consisting of a series of surface piercing thin vertical porous plates fixed on a fully submerged rigid pontoon is analyzed a quadratic pressure drop is considered to account for the energy dissipation due to changes in wave steepness a numerical model based on iterative multi domain boundary element method is developed for small amplitude water wave theory the scattering coefficients reflection and transmission and wave force coefficients horizontal vertical and moments are computed for different input parameters such as the number of plates relative plate width the relative depth of submergence plate porosities and relative wave steepness the results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce wave transmission and wave forces by 60 70 by selecting porosity and number of walls suitably mackay and johanning 2020 studied the wave interaction problem on the vertical porous barriers and used two different methods for taking the depth average of the pressure drop across the porous barrier both solutions assume that the evanescent modes in the wave field can be neglected it is found that the effect of neglecting the evanescent modes has only a small effect on the depth averaged velocity through porous wall and the analytical models derived using depth averaged assumptions are shown to give good agreement with the bem model for the reflection coefficient horizontal force and overturning moment on the porous barrier it is clear from the available literature that detailed experimental investigations on wave induced dynamic pressures on multiple vertical porous barriers one to six walls and for a wide range of porosity 10 60 and interacting with random waves of wide range of input wave conditions are not available the present research work is focused on such important problem the experimental results presented in this paper will be useful not only for design of the panels of the slotted vertical barriers but also for the numerical modelers working in this area for validating their models 3 experimental investigation the model fabrication details instrumentation data acquisition and analysis and the dimensional analysis are provided in this section 3 1 model details and instrumentation the physical model of the slotted barrier is fabricated using acrylic sheets of 10 mm thickness and 100 mm height as shown in fig 2 a and b the vertical spacing between the vertical plates was adjustable to provide the needed porosity stainless steel angles bolts nuts and spring washers were used to fix the plates in place to get the slotted barrier arrangement as shown in fig 2b the slotted barriers were rigidly fixed in the flume using clamps slotted barriers with 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 walls were used and the porosity of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 were used for each slotted barrier type porosity is defined as the ratio between the areas of slot between the plates to the area of plate for example in fig 2a if the gap between the plates is 10 mm and the plate height is 100 mm then the porosity is 10 the net horizontal distance between the porous walls was 200 mm i e c c distance between the vertical slotted barriers is 201 cm and the water depth used was 700 mm hence when six walls were used the total width of the structure was 1200 mm six units of underwater pressure transducers of 0 5 bar were used the pressure transmitter rtc28r0 5bv1 is from kistler switzerland and measures the relative pressure it is 0 5 bar capacity with overload factor of 3 bar the full scale output is 10 v 0 5 with zero output corresponds to 0v 0 05 3 wire connection technique is used and a power supply of 16 30 vdc is required the sensor is suitable for temperature range of 20 to 80 c with load resistance of greater than 500 kῳ the linearity hysteresis and repeatability at 25 c is less than or equal to 0 25 the cable length is 10 m and is ip67 type and hence can be used for under water measurements for calibration all the pressure sensors were kept in the flume bed and the water level was raised from 0 0 cm to 0 90 m the change in voltages from each pressure sensors was recorded for every change in water depth plots were prepared with voltage output on the x axis and water pressure in terms of centimeters of water on the y axis the slope of best line fit indicates the calibration constant in centimeters of water pressure volt fig 3 is a typical calibration chart for pressure sensor 1 the calibration constant is 51 492 cm v the coefficient of regression r2 is 1 0 which indicates the perfect correlation between x and y points the calibration is repeated many number of times during the investigations the pressure sensors are with inbuilt amplifiers hence the offset values cannot be nullified electronically the offset values were removed during the experimental investigation by subtracting the measured dynamic pressure signals with the initial offset values of the pressure sensors the initial offset values were noted from each pressure sensor on each day before starting the experimental work the wave history is measured using conductivity type wave probes which is 60 cm long and measurement uncertainties in the range of 0 5 0 75 incident waves are measured in the absence of the structure and are used as incident wave for analysis 3 2 details of experimental setup the wave induced dynamic pressures on slotted barriers with one two three four five and six rows and with porosity of 10 20 30 40 o 50 and 60 were studied in a glass wave flume at kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait a glass flume which was 54 5 m long 0 6 m wide and 1 2 m high is used the experimental section is located midway of this length the experiment can be watched from the elevated control room or from the ground through the transparent glass walls the wave synthesizer software supplied by the dhi denmark has the facility to select random waves of many different theoretical spectra for different combinations of significant wave height and peak period the signal for wave paddle displacement is generated by the computer and is transmitted to the paddle through fiber optic cables a typical line sketch showing the experimental setup locations of wave probes and pressure sensors for a single slotted wall arrangement is shown in fig 4 the slotted wave barrier model is placed on a horizontal rocky seabed with 15 cm rock and the water depth on the prepared rocky bed is 55 cm the water depth at a distance of one wave length is 70 cm normally in the field it is required to prepare a horizontal sea bed using rocks to make sure the complete vertical slotted barrier structures rests on it to transfer the horizontal wave load on structure to the sea bed by friction to overcome the sliding of the structure the rocky bed is prepared for this purpose the results revealed in this study automatically takes care of such needed seabed condition in addition such gap is needed for fixing a six component force sensor the wave energy dissipater fixed at the end of the wave flume is porous parabolic plate filled with wire mesh for effective dissipation of wave energy the experimental works were controlled from a control room located adjacent to the wave flume the control room has wave amplifiers signal frequency filters and the laptop with wave generator control systems a total of 36 different wave barrier configurations were used for in this study 1 6 walls and six different porosities 3 3 pressure sensor fixing arrangements the experimental work involved single two three four five and six slotted walls a total of six pressure sensors were used for the study it was necessary to measure the dynamic pressures on all of the slotted walls to understand the wave pressures which were needed for the structural design of each wall hence an optimized fixing arrangement of the pressure sensors was proposed table 1 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters on the single porous barrier are provided in table 2 for different porosities the value of z is negative downward from the swl the positive value of z indicates that the pressure sensor was above swl and negative value indicates that the pressure sensor was submerged in water pressure sensor p1 was always above the swl when porosity was increased pressure sensor p2 was exposed to air for the porosities of 30 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for two porous wall experiments are provided in table 3 for different porosities in two porous wall cases p1 p2 and p3 were fixed on the front wall and p4 p5 and p6 were fixed on the rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for three porous wall experiments are provided in table 4 for different porosities in three porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 and p4 were fixed on the first rear wall and p5 and p6 were fixed on the second rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for four porous wall experiments are provided in table 5 for different porosities in four porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 and p4 were fixed on the first rear wall p5 was fixed on the second rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall in this setup all of the pressure sensors were submerged for all porosity cases the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for five porous wall experiments are provided in table 6 for different porosities in five porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 was fixed on the first rear wall p4 was fixed on the second rear wall p5 was fixed on the third rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall in this setup also all of the pressure sensors were submerged for all porosity cases finally the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for six porous wall experiments are provided in table 7 for different porosities in six porous wall cases p1 was fixed on the front wall p2 was fixed on the first rear wall p3 was fixed on the second rear wall p4 was fixed on the third rear wall p5 was fixed on the fourth rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 it is necessary to know the elevation details of the pressure sensors since the elevation of pressure sensor is one of the main parameters of the measured dynamic pressure on the porous wall in general the dynamic pressure reduces with more depth of submergence it also reduces with more exposure to air 3 4 hydrodynamic inputs laboratory investigations were carried out for all the model configurations specified in table 1 for each configuration 15 different random wave time series 5 different peak periods and 3 different significant wave heights as shown in table 8 were used jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum is a well known spectrum and used very widely for random wave generation and the physical model experiments in many coastal engineering laboratories around the world hence jonswap spectrum is selected for the present experimental investigations the gamma value of 3 3 is used for the jonswap spectrum for all the combinations of significant wave height and peak period a total number of 540 runs and 15 runs without models for measuring incident wave conditions were conducted complete investigations were carried out with a water depth d of 70 cm the data for random wave tests were collected for 420 s the data sampling speed was 40 hz the investigation covered a wide range of dimensionless input conditions as shown in table 8 where his incident significant wave height tp peak wave period d water depth kp is the wave number kp 2π lp lp incident wave length lp 1 56 tp 2 tanh 2πd lp the dimensionless input parameters of the present study were his d relative significant wave height his lp incident wave steepness ur ur his lp 2 d3 ursell parameter d lp or kpd relative water depth since the distance between the porous walls b is 0 2 m and the water depth d is 0 7 m the value of relative water depth d lp is equal to 3 5 b lp it can be seen from table 8 that the relative significant wave height his d ranged from 0 071 to 0 214 the range of incident wave steepness his lp was from 0 007 to 0 107 which covers the practical wave steepness range observed in the field the d lp ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 indicating that the study covered a wide range of intermediate water depth conditions the ursell parameter ur ranged from 0 29 to 21 43 meaning the wave interaction covered the linear to nonlinear range 3 5 data analysis for dynamic pressure on slotted barrier the spectral analysis is carried out and the zeroth moment for the incident wave is assessed for all the runs carried out without the presence of the wave barrier model the value of the significant incident wave height is estimated by multiplying the square root of the zeroth moment by 4 the measured dynamic pressure data from pressure sensors p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were used for frequency domain analysis the area under each dynamic pressure spectrum or the zeroth moment of each dynamic pressure spectrum moip was estimated and the significant dynamic pressure was estimated using the formula pis 2 moip 1 2 where i 1 to 6 3 6 dimensional analysis for discussion of results and its direct application to the field conditions dimensional analysis is required the wave barrier is slotted walls surface piercing extends up to the prepared sea bed and is subjected to an uni directional random waves acting normal to the barrier the significant wave pressure pis on the barrier depend on a number of variables such as the significant incident wave height his peak period tp water depth d distance between the barrier b the number of barriers n porosity of the barrier p elevation of pressure measurement z acceleration due to gravity g fluid density ρ viscosity μ and the thickness of the wave barrier t 1 pis f his tp d b n p z g ρ μ t since the wave length lp is linked to the wave period and water depth and wave length increases with wave period tp can be replaced by lp in the experimental investigation t 10 mm and is kept constant similarly d 700 mm and b 200 mm hence d b 3 5 his tp n and p are varied widely and hence it is essential to focus on the effect of these parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics acceleration due to gravity g fluid density ρ and viscosity μ of the water is constant since the experimental investigations were carried out in a wave flume under controlled temperature using dimensional analysis the normalized wave pressure pis 0 5 ρ g his can be expressed in the form 2 pis 0 5 ρ g his f1 d lp or b lp his d or his lp n p z d since for every d lp there exist a constant b lp value we can either use d lp or b lp value from field application point of view it is more useful if d lp is used since the user tries to select the suitable slotted barrier for a specific water depth also since the results can be used widely for coastal engineering applications using his d is more appropriate this finally results in 3 pis 0 5 ρ g his f1 d lp his d n p z d since the value of z changes when the porosity is changed it is good if the effect of elevation is also accounted in the left hand side of the above equation the dynamic pressure variation from still water level to the sea bed is cos hyperbolic equation 3 can further be reduced as 4 pis 0 5 ρ g his cosh k d z cosh kd f1 d lp his d n p these non dimensional values on the right hand side of the above equation are used while describing their effects on wave pressures 4 results and discussions an exhaustive knowledge of wave induced dynamic pressures on the structural elements of the svbs in random waves is vital for the optimal structural design of the panels sample dynamic pressure plots are provided to understand the variations of the magnitude and fluctuations of dynamic pressure when the input conditions are varied then the effects of varying the significant wave height peak period and elevation of pressure sensors on the measured dynamic pressures are discussed the effects of varying the porosities and number of slotted walls on the dynamic pressures are analyzed and discussed 4 1 time series of dynamic pressures acting on the panels of wave barrier the data on typical incident wave and the measured dynamic pressures at six elevations on a single svb for p 10 his 10 cm and tp 1 624 s are provided in fig 5 a g though the measurements were carried out for 420 s the plots are provided for only 60 s for more clarity pressure transducer p1 is located 5 cm above the swl table 2 pressure sensors p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 are immersed at a depth of 6 cm 17 cm 28 cm 39 cm and 50 cm respectively from the swl the time series at p1 shows only positive values fig 5b since it is the pressure sensed during the interaction of wave crest on the panel when p1 is exposed to air there is discontinuity in the data with zero value which corresponds to the exposure of pressure sensors to air pressure sensor p2 is immersed in water however it is also exposed to air for a small time interval when wave trough is acting on the slotted wall fig 5c all other sensors are completely immersed during the wave action and hence the pressure time series are continuous without any pause unlike p1 and p2 the magnitude of the dynamic pressure reduces as the depth of immersion is increased following the coshyperbolic reduction principles of wave pressures from free surface to sea bed the measured data of typical dynamic pressure on six svbs for p 10 his 10 cm and tp 1 624 s are provided in fig 6 a f for the pressures measured at front first second third fourth and last rear walls respectively the elevations of the pressure sensors are provided in table 7 pressure sensors p1 p3 and p5 are placed at z d 0 17 and p2 p4 and p6 are located at z d 0 24 it is found that the magnitude of dynamic pressure progressively reduced from the front wall to the rear wall which clearly indicates the wave damping effect of each perforated wall 4 2 effect of significant wave height on dynamic pressures a typical plot of normalized dynamic pressure on a single svb for p 10 and his d 0 071 is shown in fig 7 the x axis is d lp and hence it takes care of the effect of the peak period for this case pressure transducer p1 was located 5 cm above the swl table 2 pressure sensors p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were immersed at a depth of 6 cm 17 cm 28 cm 39 cm and 50 cm respectively from the swl since the wave was mild it interacted rarely with p1 and hence the y axis value was closer to zero for d lp 0 1 long wave the normalized pressure values were around 1 2 for d lp 0 5 short wave the normalized pressure values were high around 1 08 near the water surface p2 and reduced significantly toward the seabed to 0 21 at p6 to visualize the effect of the increase in significant wave height on dynamic pressure figs 8 and 9 are provided for the same model condition used for fig 7 but for his d 0 142 and 0 214 respectively the trend is similar to the previous plot for his d 0 142 the value of positive normalized pressure near the swl reached 1 3 for d lp 0 1 due to significant wave run up on the svb increasing his d to 0 214 did not increase the normalized positive pressure for a clear understanding of the effect of significant wave height on dynamic pressure on the svb fig 10 is provided this figure is for n 2 p 10 and pressure sensor p1 p1 is located at z 12 cm table 3 and hence z d 0 171 the normalized dynamic pressure did not change significantly with a change in his d it means that whether the svb is designed for a mild wave climate like kuwait bay or a strong wave climate arabian sea during monsoon the normalized pressure values remain almost the same but they strongly varied with a change in d lp 4 3 effect of porosity and location of pressure measurement on dynamic pressure to present the effect of porosity and location of pressure measurement on the dynamic pressures on the svb it is necessary to fix parameters such as n and his d hence n 3 and his d 0 142 was selected in this setup p1 and p2 are on the front wall p3 and p4 are on the first rear wall and p5 and p6 are on the second rear wall when the porosity is increased from 10 to 60 the values of z change as shown in table 4 hence it is necessary to remove the effect of z as discussed earlier it is known that the dynamic pressure reduces following the cos hyperbolic law hence the normalized dynamic pressure pis ρghis 2 is divided by cosh k d z cosh kd to remove the effect of z fig 11 shows such normalized dynamic pressure for n 3 his d 0 142 and p 10 similar plots are provided for p 20 30 40 50 and 60 in figs 12 16 respectively a cross comparison of these figures reveals the effect of porosity on dynamic pressures in general it is found that changing the porosity has a noticeable effect on the dynamic pressure values on the svb from fig 11 it can be seen that the dynamic pressure on the front wall is higher and the second rear wall is lower this indicates that the front wall must be designed stronger than the rear walls almost similar trend is observed in figs 12 16 for a clear understanding of the effect of porosity on dynamic pressures on the svb fig 17 is provided this figure is for n 2 his d 0 142 and pressure sensor location p3 p3 is located on the front wall at z 34 cm 32 cm 30 cm 28 cm 26 cm and 24 cm for p 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 respectively table 3 the effect of z was removed as discussed in the previous figures it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure reduces with an increase in porosity and the effect is considerable for higher values of d lp 4 4 effect of the number of svbs on dynamic pressures to study the effect of n on dynamic pressure on the svb it is necessary to fix other parameters such as porosity and his d pressure sensor p6 is always on the rear wall whether n 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 hence it is beneficial to study how the dynamic pressure varies at p6 for a particular porosity p 10 and incident wave condition when n is increased from 1 to 6 table 9 can be referred to know the elevation of p6 for different n and for different porosities even for a fixed porosity the value of z is different for different n and it is necessary to remove the effect of z hence a plot with y axis with a normalized dynamic pressure of pis ρghis 2 cosh k d z cosh kd is used fig 18 shows such normalized dynamic pressure on p6 for p 10 and his d 0 142 it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure values reduce consistently when the number of slotted walls n is changed from 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 hence while designing an svb configuration the effect of n should be considered for the economic design of panels the strongest panel must be at the seaward side which will get direct impact by the incident waves and the thickness or strength of the walls can be reduced progressively toward the rear wall since the dynamic pressure reduces toward the rear wall 4 5 spectral density of dynamic pressures on the panels of the slotted vertical wall a typical comparison of the spectral density of measured dynamic pressures for six slotted wall case for porosity of 10 and for the incident significant wave height of 15 cm and peak period of 1 251 s is provided in fig 19 the wave elevation is measured with cm as unit and the dynamic pressure values are also measured in cm of water column the elevations of pressure sensors on all six walls is given in table 7 for 10 porosity p1 p3 and p5 are at 12 cm elevation from still water level and p2 p4 and p6 are at 17 cm from still water level where p1 p2 p3 p4 p4 and p6 are the pressure sensors at first porous wall seaside wall rear wall 1 rear wall 2 rear wall 3 rear wall 4 and rear wall 5 lee side porous wall it is found that the magnitude of spectral density of dynamic pressure for the first wall and the spectral density of incident waves are close by indicating that the magnitude of the impact of wave on the sea side wall is equivalent to the incident wave amplitudes after the wave energy dissipation by the seaside porous wall the effect on the second wall has reduced almost 70 i e the peak value of dynamic pressure on the first rear wall has reduced from to 15 2 cm2 hz when compared to the peak value at the seaside wall which is 76 5 cm2 hz similarly the dissipation of wave energy by the first rear wall helped to reduce the wave energy action on second rear wall and so on the spectral peak of the dynamic pressure on the 5th rear wall lee side wall has reduced to 1 34 cm2 hz this clearly indicates that the panels of the slotted walls can be designed according to the pressure intensity and will help for optimizing the structural design 5 application of the present study for field conditions the results of this study can be used for the optimized design of the panels of the svbs against wave induced dynamic pressures one concern for field application is what will happen to the dynamic pressure due to marine growth in the present study the gap between the vertical plates is varied from 1 cm to 6 cm to achieve 10 60 porosity for open sea applications the suitable scale model is 1 10 to 1 20 hence the gap in the field condition for 1 10 scale is 10 cm 60 cm since the wave activities in the gap is jetting of water as response to wave actions it is difficult for marine life to stick and stay in the gap especially when the gap is becoming larger in spite of these assessments if marine growth happens it will reduce the porosity to some extent say from 40 to 30 porosity or 20 when marine growth is significant since the results are presented for porosities from 10 to 60 one can easily interpret the effect of reduced porosity for example the present results for porosity of 40 will turn to results with 30 porosity or 20 porosity due to marine growth hence instead of using the results for 40 porosity it is suggested to use the results of 20 porosity for significant reduction of porosity due to marine growths 6 conclusions the important conclusions from the study on wave induced dynamic pressures on slotted vertical barriers are as follows the dynamic pressure is always higher on the seaward side of the vertical slotted wave barrier and reduces progressively toward to rear side of the barrier in general the dynamic pressure reduces with an increase in relative water depth d lp the highest dynamic pressure coefficient ps ρghis 2 can reach to an extent of about 1 5 the dynamic pressure results provided in this report can be used for the design of the panels of svbs varying the relative wave height his d from 0 07 to 0 214 has insignificant effect on varying the dynamic pressure coefficients to design a slotted wave barrier with 3 walls and 10 porosity and for d lp of 0 3 it is required to design the seaside wall panel to dynamic pressure coefficient of 1 44 the second wall for 0 82 and the rear side porous wall for 0 58 the spectral density of wave pressure can be reduced by an extent of 70 on the first rear wall for 10 porosity case in six porous wall configuration suggestions for future studies the following are the suggestions for future studies effect of varying the space between the slotted walls on wave induced dynamic pressures on the panels effect of varying the porosity of each wall on the wave induced dynamic pressures especially the effect of

configurations 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 porosities and 1 to 6 numbers of slotted walls were tested in random wave fields of jonswap spectra for different combinations of significant wave heights and peak periods it is found that on the dynamic pressure on vertical slotted wave barrier reduces progressively from the seaside to the rear side in general the dynamic pressure coefficient ps ρghis 2 reduces with an increase in relative water depth d lp where ps is the significant dynamic pressure ρg is the weight density of water his is the significant incident wave height d is the water depth and lp is the wave length corresponds to peak wave period it is also found that the highest value of measured ps ρghis 2 is about 1 5 the barrier with 3 walls and 10 porosity and for d lp of 0 3 the seaside wall panel experience dynamic pressure coefficient of 1 44 the first rear wall with 0 82 and the lee side porous wall with 0 58 the results can be used for the optimal design of the panels of multiple slotted vertical wave barriers keywords wave induced dynamic pressures experimental investigation wave flume slotted vertical barriers random waves 1 introduction rocks have been widely used as construction material for breakwaters of ports harbors marina detached breakwater groins and seawalls hudson 1959 van der meer 1987 and van der meer and daemen 1994 for stability rubble mound breakwaters are designed with needed factor of safety on the armor units roughness density of the rocks and slopes van der meer 1988 there is no control on density roughness and even the size of rocks when it is quarried from a borrow pit or hill and hence the engineers select appropriate slope of the breakwater to achieve needed stability for example for a location with mean water depth of 3 0 m and less tidal variation slopes of 1 2 and freeboard and crest width of 3 m a typical offshore rubble mound breakwater needs about 90 m3 of rocks m run to protect erosion for a coast of 200 m long one needs about 18 000 to 20 000 m3 of rocks this shows that wave damping applications with rubble mound offshore breakwater is a high volume solution with either tombola or spit formation at the rear side of the breakwater nicholson et al 1997 construction of offshore rubble mound breakwater is also an expensive operation since it needs floating barges and cranes and many weeks or months of good weather window for dumping of stones and periodic verification of the underwater profile by divers the other environmental issue is that if the rubble mound needs to be removed in future due to any negative environmental impact it becomes much more or equally expensive than construction itself and time consuming emerged offshore rubble mound breakwaters with impervious core restrict free exchange of seawater between seaside and rear side this lead to water quality problems issues on the coastal waters since rubbles are heavy and if the bearing capacity of the seabed is poor like soft cohesive sediments then strength improvement of foundation becomes another expensive part of the field construction activities quarrying stones from mountains and underground sources has become a sensitive environmental issue recently with all these sensitive issues it is essential to innovate cost competitive easy to build and environmentally benign wave damping structures porous structures like series of slotted vertical walls are one such solution neelamani and al anjari 2018 a typical vertical slotted barrier configuration used in the present study is shown in fig 1 the walls are arranged in zigzag manner in this study to create longer flow path to increase the wave energy dissipation for a successful design of such slotted wave barriers a detailed knowledge on wave scattering wave transmission reflection and dissipation wave loads on the structure wave induced pressures on the slotted walls total inline force and the wave induced moment due to the total inline force are needed a detailed scientific investigation is carried out on such porous structure by neelamani and al anjari 2018 the results on wave scattering are presented by neelamani and al anjari 2020a in this manuscript the number of porous walls and the porosity required to achieve a certain desired wave transmission coefficients are revealed it is found that to achieve the same level of wave transmission the volume of material required for suitable slotted vertical wave barrier is much less than 10 of the volume of rocks required for detached breakwater for assessing the stability against sliding and overtopping the knowledge on total wave force and wave induced moments are required and are presented by neelamani and al anjari 2020 however for the structural design of the plates of the porous walls a thorough knowledge on wave induced pressures for a wide range of incident wave conditions are needed the effect of porosity and number of porous wall on the dynamic pressure is also needed hence a detailed experimental investigation is carried out to measure the wave induced pressures on the panels the data are analyzed and the results are presented in this paper this type of wave barrier is specifically required for most of the gulf cooperation council gcc countries such as kuwait qatar bahrain saudi arabia uae and oman where good quality rocks are not available and are imported from other countries at high costs the technology for prefabrication of panels is well advanced over the last few decades fernández ordóñez hernández d 2018 the porous array of wave barriers can be prefabricated or molded using high strength polyethylene and polypropylene noodles which are available locally as a byproduct of crude oil refining assembled in a land based factory and can be installed quickly during good weather window for countries with narrow weather window even with availability of plenty of rocks at nearby locations slotted wave barriers can be a good option from construction management point of view the other merits of slotted wave barrier include easy fish passage sediment movement across the barrier and low construction cost mani and jayakumar 1995 and koutandos 2009 2 literature review slotted breakwaters were used at few harbors around the world some promising are baie comeau harbor and chandler harbor in canada roscoff harbor in france half moon bay marina in new zealand and plymouth harbor in the united states mei et al 1974 hutchinson and raudkivi 1984 gardner et al 1986 there is no literature to reveal whether these breakwaters are optimally designed for the prevailing design environmental conditions optimally designed wave barrier should have a minimum number of slotted walls with maximum porosity so that the material used for the construction is minimum many literatures are published on wave transmission and wave energy dissipation of vertical slotted perforated breakwaters some of them are terret et al 1968 hayashi et al 1968 grune and kohlhase 1974 kakuno 1983 urashima et al 1986 kriebel 1992 isaacson et al 1998 bergman and oumeraci 1998 isaacson et al 1999 and sahoo et al 2000 bergmann and oumeraci 1998 experimentally measured the wave induced pressures on single vertical porous wall monochromatic non breaking and slightly breaking waves on such structures are examined and results are compared with goda formula for impermeable vertical walls and a modified goda method was developed for permeable walls by introducing structure porosity to account for the nonlinear processes at permeable walls sahoo et al 2000 has studied on the phenomena of wave trapping by a single vertical porous barrier of four different configurations and wave generation by vertical porous wave makers of three different configurations in front of the end wall of a semi infinitely long channel it is reported that the average pressure distributions on a porous wave maker and on the channel end wall decrease as the porous effect parameter increases koraim 2011 has carried out studies using eigenfunction expansion method and lab measurements with a single vertical slotted barrier and reported that the proposed theoretical model can be used for predicting the performance of slotted breakwaters and the hydrodynamic forces exerted on these structures using the friction coefficient f 1 5 huang et al 2011 carried out a detailed review on the hydraulic performance and the wave loading on perforated slotted coastal structures for slotted barriers with more than two to three rows limited research work has been done so far hagiwara 1984 ji and suh 2010 ji and suh 2010 proved that two and three row slotted barrier performed better than single slotted barrier studies related to wave structure interaction on other types of special breakwaters are plenty some of them are by neelamani and rajendran 2001 neelamani and vedagiri 2001 teh et al 2012 and rahman and aktar 2014 neelamani and gayathri experimentally investigated the wave pressures on twin plate wave barriers and recommended that the twin plate barrier needs to be designed for highest 98 pressure ratio value of 2 0 which is equal to the static pressure induced by the design incident wave height al khalidi et al 2015a and b carried out studies on wave forces and dynamic pressures on porous breakwater with a rear side nonporous wall and up to two porous walls for harbor applications the experimental results indicate that the porosity affects the dynamic pressures significantly especially near the free surface but less so closer to the seabed taqi et al 2013 and neelamani et al 2016 studied wave reflection characteristics on a similar structure with more number of slotted walls and for a wide range of porosities there are many investigations based on analytical and numerical methods on the slotted vertical barriers svbs noticeable are chen et al 2006 al salem et al 2014 molin and remy 2015 elbisy et al 2016 valizadeh and rudman 2017 liu and li 2017 alsaydalani et al 2017 neelamani et al 2017 neelamani et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 valizadeh et al 2018 vijay et al 2019 hussein and ibrahim 2019 ibrahim 2019 george and cho 2020 poguluri and cho 2020 vijay et al 2020 and mackay and johanning 2020 elbisy et al 2016 studied the wave interaction with double row and triple row porous walls using eigenfunction expansion method it is found that double row slotted breakwaters may exhibit a good wave absorbing performance for kd 0 5 where by the horizontal wave force may be smaller than that of a single wall it was also found that the difference between double row and triple row vertical slotted breakwaters is marginal from the hydrodynamic scattering and wave force point of view alsaydalani et al 2017 have examined the hydrodynamic performance of three row vertical slotted wall barriers using eigenfunction expansion method and a least squares technique the front and middle walls are permeable and partially immersed in a flume water and the third wall is impermeable comparisons of the theoretical results of wave scattering and wave forces with experimental measurements show that the mathematical model adequately reproduce most of the important features neelamani et al 2017 experimentally investigated the wave reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of vertical porous walls 1 6 walls and porosity from 10 to 50 with an impermeable rear wall under random wave conditions of jonswap spectrum it is proved that by increasing the number of porous walls from one to six it is possible to reduce the value of the reflection coefficient from 0 9 to 0 3 especially for a d l p greater than 0 2 neelamani et al 2018 further extended this study and proved that vertical perforated wave barriers are also better than sloped rubble mound breakwaters especially for long wave conditions for relatively long waves reflection coefficient of 0 27 can be achieved with six units of slotted walls with 40 porosity when compared to 0 57 for conventional slopped rubble mound breakwaters the material required for the construction of this slotted wave barrier is only about 14 when compared to the conventional rubble barrier vijay et al 2019 developed a numerical model based on the direct iterative boundary element method and is validated with the measured wave reflection by neelamani et al 2018 in numerical modeling a quadratic pressure drop is considered for the slotted walls for wave past the porous barriers to account for the effect of wave height on energy dissipation satisfactory comparison between numerical model and the measured reflection values are reported for a wide range of wave period number of porous walls and porosity hussein and ibrahim 2019 investigated on the wave transmission and reflection on two types of wave barriers with an economic feasibility in mind the first type consists of two vertical perforated walls the first wall is permeable in the lower part with 50 porosity and the upper part is impermeable and the second wall is 50 permeable in the upper part and the lower part is impermeable a horizontal slotted wall is also provided in between these two walls the second type is similar to the first type but without horizontal slotted wall flow3d is used for assessing the hydrodynamic performance it was found that first type is better than the second type by 10 15 because of the presence of the horizontal slotted wall the wave force on the first model is higher than the second model in the range of 10 15 ibrahim 2019 has assessed the wave transmission and wave forces on vertical walls with circular and square slots using numerical models and found that square slot is better for wave transmission by 5 15 with pair of walls with circular slots it is found that the relative wave force increases from 10 to 30 if porosity is reduced from 0 5 to 0 25 george and cho 2020 have studied the wave interaction problem with a vertical slotted breakwater consisting of impermeable upper lower parts and a permeable middle part the far field solution of the wave scattering involving nonlinear porous boundary condition was obtained using eigenfunction expansion method the empirical formula for drag coefficient in the near field representing energy dissipation across the slotted barrier was assessed by curve fitting of the numerical solutions of 2 d channel flow using cfd code starccm the theoretical model was validated with laboratory experiments for various configurations of a slotted barrier and the comparisons are found to be good poguluri and cho 2020 investigated the hydrodynamic performance of a partially submerged vertical slotted barrier based on an analytical and numerical approach in regular waves the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem was used to solve the boundary value problem including the porous boundary condition the drag coefficient representing the energy dissipation was estimated by the best possible fitting curve to cfd results for a 2d simplified channel model a 3d implicit unsteady turbulent model based on incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations was adopted to assess the analytical meem solutions the analytical and numerical solutions show relatively good agreement with the experimental results of hydrodynamic performance and horizontal forces on the vertical slotted barrier vijay et al 2020 theoretically investigated the gravity wave interaction with a wave attenuating system consisting of a series of surface piercing thin vertical porous plates fixed on a fully submerged rigid pontoon is analyzed a quadratic pressure drop is considered to account for the energy dissipation due to changes in wave steepness a numerical model based on iterative multi domain boundary element method is developed for small amplitude water wave theory the scattering coefficients reflection and transmission and wave force coefficients horizontal vertical and moments are computed for different input parameters such as the number of plates relative plate width the relative depth of submergence plate porosities and relative wave steepness the results demonstrate that it is possible to reduce wave transmission and wave forces by 60 70 by selecting porosity and number of walls suitably mackay and johanning 2020 studied the wave interaction problem on the vertical porous barriers and used two different methods for taking the depth average of the pressure drop across the porous barrier both solutions assume that the evanescent modes in the wave field can be neglected it is found that the effect of neglecting the evanescent modes has only a small effect on the depth averaged velocity through porous wall and the analytical models derived using depth averaged assumptions are shown to give good agreement with the bem model for the reflection coefficient horizontal force and overturning moment on the porous barrier it is clear from the available literature that detailed experimental investigations on wave induced dynamic pressures on multiple vertical porous barriers one to six walls and for a wide range of porosity 10 60 and interacting with random waves of wide range of input wave conditions are not available the present research work is focused on such important problem the experimental results presented in this paper will be useful not only for design of the panels of the slotted vertical barriers but also for the numerical modelers working in this area for validating their models 3 experimental investigation the model fabrication details instrumentation data acquisition and analysis and the dimensional analysis are provided in this section 3 1 model details and instrumentation the physical model of the slotted barrier is fabricated using acrylic sheets of 10 mm thickness and 100 mm height as shown in fig 2 a and b the vertical spacing between the vertical plates was adjustable to provide the needed porosity stainless steel angles bolts nuts and spring washers were used to fix the plates in place to get the slotted barrier arrangement as shown in fig 2b the slotted barriers were rigidly fixed in the flume using clamps slotted barriers with 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 walls were used and the porosity of 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 were used for each slotted barrier type porosity is defined as the ratio between the areas of slot between the plates to the area of plate for example in fig 2a if the gap between the plates is 10 mm and the plate height is 100 mm then the porosity is 10 the net horizontal distance between the porous walls was 200 mm i e c c distance between the vertical slotted barriers is 201 cm and the water depth used was 700 mm hence when six walls were used the total width of the structure was 1200 mm six units of underwater pressure transducers of 0 5 bar were used the pressure transmitter rtc28r0 5bv1 is from kistler switzerland and measures the relative pressure it is 0 5 bar capacity with overload factor of 3 bar the full scale output is 10 v 0 5 with zero output corresponds to 0v 0 05 3 wire connection technique is used and a power supply of 16 30 vdc is required the sensor is suitable for temperature range of 20 to 80 c with load resistance of greater than 500 kῳ the linearity hysteresis and repeatability at 25 c is less than or equal to 0 25 the cable length is 10 m and is ip67 type and hence can be used for under water measurements for calibration all the pressure sensors were kept in the flume bed and the water level was raised from 0 0 cm to 0 90 m the change in voltages from each pressure sensors was recorded for every change in water depth plots were prepared with voltage output on the x axis and water pressure in terms of centimeters of water on the y axis the slope of best line fit indicates the calibration constant in centimeters of water pressure volt fig 3 is a typical calibration chart for pressure sensor 1 the calibration constant is 51 492 cm v the coefficient of regression r2 is 1 0 which indicates the perfect correlation between x and y points the calibration is repeated many number of times during the investigations the pressure sensors are with inbuilt amplifiers hence the offset values cannot be nullified electronically the offset values were removed during the experimental investigation by subtracting the measured dynamic pressure signals with the initial offset values of the pressure sensors the initial offset values were noted from each pressure sensor on each day before starting the experimental work the wave history is measured using conductivity type wave probes which is 60 cm long and measurement uncertainties in the range of 0 5 0 75 incident waves are measured in the absence of the structure and are used as incident wave for analysis 3 2 details of experimental setup the wave induced dynamic pressures on slotted barriers with one two three four five and six rows and with porosity of 10 20 30 40 o 50 and 60 were studied in a glass wave flume at kuwait institute for scientific research kuwait a glass flume which was 54 5 m long 0 6 m wide and 1 2 m high is used the experimental section is located midway of this length the experiment can be watched from the elevated control room or from the ground through the transparent glass walls the wave synthesizer software supplied by the dhi denmark has the facility to select random waves of many different theoretical spectra for different combinations of significant wave height and peak period the signal for wave paddle displacement is generated by the computer and is transmitted to the paddle through fiber optic cables a typical line sketch showing the experimental setup locations of wave probes and pressure sensors for a single slotted wall arrangement is shown in fig 4 the slotted wave barrier model is placed on a horizontal rocky seabed with 15 cm rock and the water depth on the prepared rocky bed is 55 cm the water depth at a distance of one wave length is 70 cm normally in the field it is required to prepare a horizontal sea bed using rocks to make sure the complete vertical slotted barrier structures rests on it to transfer the horizontal wave load on structure to the sea bed by friction to overcome the sliding of the structure the rocky bed is prepared for this purpose the results revealed in this study automatically takes care of such needed seabed condition in addition such gap is needed for fixing a six component force sensor the wave energy dissipater fixed at the end of the wave flume is porous parabolic plate filled with wire mesh for effective dissipation of wave energy the experimental works were controlled from a control room located adjacent to the wave flume the control room has wave amplifiers signal frequency filters and the laptop with wave generator control systems a total of 36 different wave barrier configurations were used for in this study 1 6 walls and six different porosities 3 3 pressure sensor fixing arrangements the experimental work involved single two three four five and six slotted walls a total of six pressure sensors were used for the study it was necessary to measure the dynamic pressures on all of the slotted walls to understand the wave pressures which were needed for the structural design of each wall hence an optimized fixing arrangement of the pressure sensors was proposed table 1 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters on the single porous barrier are provided in table 2 for different porosities the value of z is negative downward from the swl the positive value of z indicates that the pressure sensor was above swl and negative value indicates that the pressure sensor was submerged in water pressure sensor p1 was always above the swl when porosity was increased pressure sensor p2 was exposed to air for the porosities of 30 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for two porous wall experiments are provided in table 3 for different porosities in two porous wall cases p1 p2 and p3 were fixed on the front wall and p4 p5 and p6 were fixed on the rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for three porous wall experiments are provided in table 4 for different porosities in three porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 and p4 were fixed on the first rear wall and p5 and p6 were fixed on the second rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for four porous wall experiments are provided in table 5 for different porosities in four porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 and p4 were fixed on the first rear wall p5 was fixed on the second rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall in this setup all of the pressure sensors were submerged for all porosity cases the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for five porous wall experiments are provided in table 6 for different porosities in five porous wall cases p1 and p2 were fixed on the front wall p3 was fixed on the first rear wall p4 was fixed on the second rear wall p5 was fixed on the third rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall in this setup also all of the pressure sensors were submerged for all porosity cases finally the pressure sensor elevations z in centimeters for six porous wall experiments are provided in table 7 for different porosities in six porous wall cases p1 was fixed on the front wall p2 was fixed on the first rear wall p3 was fixed on the second rear wall p4 was fixed on the third rear wall p5 was fixed on the fourth rear wall and p6 was fixed on the last rear wall p1 was exposed to air when the porosity was 40 50 and 60 it is necessary to know the elevation details of the pressure sensors since the elevation of pressure sensor is one of the main parameters of the measured dynamic pressure on the porous wall in general the dynamic pressure reduces with more depth of submergence it also reduces with more exposure to air 3 4 hydrodynamic inputs laboratory investigations were carried out for all the model configurations specified in table 1 for each configuration 15 different random wave time series 5 different peak periods and 3 different significant wave heights as shown in table 8 were used jonswap joint north sea wave project spectrum is a well known spectrum and used very widely for random wave generation and the physical model experiments in many coastal engineering laboratories around the world hence jonswap spectrum is selected for the present experimental investigations the gamma value of 3 3 is used for the jonswap spectrum for all the combinations of significant wave height and peak period a total number of 540 runs and 15 runs without models for measuring incident wave conditions were conducted complete investigations were carried out with a water depth d of 70 cm the data for random wave tests were collected for 420 s the data sampling speed was 40 hz the investigation covered a wide range of dimensionless input conditions as shown in table 8 where his incident significant wave height tp peak wave period d water depth kp is the wave number kp 2π lp lp incident wave length lp 1 56 tp 2 tanh 2πd lp the dimensionless input parameters of the present study were his d relative significant wave height his lp incident wave steepness ur ur his lp 2 d3 ursell parameter d lp or kpd relative water depth since the distance between the porous walls b is 0 2 m and the water depth d is 0 7 m the value of relative water depth d lp is equal to 3 5 b lp it can be seen from table 8 that the relative significant wave height his d ranged from 0 071 to 0 214 the range of incident wave steepness his lp was from 0 007 to 0 107 which covers the practical wave steepness range observed in the field the d lp ranged from 0 1 to 0 5 indicating that the study covered a wide range of intermediate water depth conditions the ursell parameter ur ranged from 0 29 to 21 43 meaning the wave interaction covered the linear to nonlinear range 3 5 data analysis for dynamic pressure on slotted barrier the spectral analysis is carried out and the zeroth moment for the incident wave is assessed for all the runs carried out without the presence of the wave barrier model the value of the significant incident wave height is estimated by multiplying the square root of the zeroth moment by 4 the measured dynamic pressure data from pressure sensors p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were used for frequency domain analysis the area under each dynamic pressure spectrum or the zeroth moment of each dynamic pressure spectrum moip was estimated and the significant dynamic pressure was estimated using the formula pis 2 moip 1 2 where i 1 to 6 3 6 dimensional analysis for discussion of results and its direct application to the field conditions dimensional analysis is required the wave barrier is slotted walls surface piercing extends up to the prepared sea bed and is subjected to an uni directional random waves acting normal to the barrier the significant wave pressure pis on the barrier depend on a number of variables such as the significant incident wave height his peak period tp water depth d distance between the barrier b the number of barriers n porosity of the barrier p elevation of pressure measurement z acceleration due to gravity g fluid density ρ viscosity μ and the thickness of the wave barrier t 1 pis f his tp d b n p z g ρ μ t since the wave length lp is linked to the wave period and water depth and wave length increases with wave period tp can be replaced by lp in the experimental investigation t 10 mm and is kept constant similarly d 700 mm and b 200 mm hence d b 3 5 his tp n and p are varied widely and hence it is essential to focus on the effect of these parameters on the hydrodynamic characteristics acceleration due to gravity g fluid density ρ and viscosity μ of the water is constant since the experimental investigations were carried out in a wave flume under controlled temperature using dimensional analysis the normalized wave pressure pis 0 5 ρ g his can be expressed in the form 2 pis 0 5 ρ g his f1 d lp or b lp his d or his lp n p z d since for every d lp there exist a constant b lp value we can either use d lp or b lp value from field application point of view it is more useful if d lp is used since the user tries to select the suitable slotted barrier for a specific water depth also since the results can be used widely for coastal engineering applications using his d is more appropriate this finally results in 3 pis 0 5 ρ g his f1 d lp his d n p z d since the value of z changes when the porosity is changed it is good if the effect of elevation is also accounted in the left hand side of the above equation the dynamic pressure variation from still water level to the sea bed is cos hyperbolic equation 3 can further be reduced as 4 pis 0 5 ρ g his cosh k d z cosh kd f1 d lp his d n p these non dimensional values on the right hand side of the above equation are used while describing their effects on wave pressures 4 results and discussions an exhaustive knowledge of wave induced dynamic pressures on the structural elements of the svbs in random waves is vital for the optimal structural design of the panels sample dynamic pressure plots are provided to understand the variations of the magnitude and fluctuations of dynamic pressure when the input conditions are varied then the effects of varying the significant wave height peak period and elevation of pressure sensors on the measured dynamic pressures are discussed the effects of varying the porosities and number of slotted walls on the dynamic pressures are analyzed and discussed 4 1 time series of dynamic pressures acting on the panels of wave barrier the data on typical incident wave and the measured dynamic pressures at six elevations on a single svb for p 10 his 10 cm and tp 1 624 s are provided in fig 5 a g though the measurements were carried out for 420 s the plots are provided for only 60 s for more clarity pressure transducer p1 is located 5 cm above the swl table 2 pressure sensors p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 are immersed at a depth of 6 cm 17 cm 28 cm 39 cm and 50 cm respectively from the swl the time series at p1 shows only positive values fig 5b since it is the pressure sensed during the interaction of wave crest on the panel when p1 is exposed to air there is discontinuity in the data with zero value which corresponds to the exposure of pressure sensors to air pressure sensor p2 is immersed in water however it is also exposed to air for a small time interval when wave trough is acting on the slotted wall fig 5c all other sensors are completely immersed during the wave action and hence the pressure time series are continuous without any pause unlike p1 and p2 the magnitude of the dynamic pressure reduces as the depth of immersion is increased following the coshyperbolic reduction principles of wave pressures from free surface to sea bed the measured data of typical dynamic pressure on six svbs for p 10 his 10 cm and tp 1 624 s are provided in fig 6 a f for the pressures measured at front first second third fourth and last rear walls respectively the elevations of the pressure sensors are provided in table 7 pressure sensors p1 p3 and p5 are placed at z d 0 17 and p2 p4 and p6 are located at z d 0 24 it is found that the magnitude of dynamic pressure progressively reduced from the front wall to the rear wall which clearly indicates the wave damping effect of each perforated wall 4 2 effect of significant wave height on dynamic pressures a typical plot of normalized dynamic pressure on a single svb for p 10 and his d 0 071 is shown in fig 7 the x axis is d lp and hence it takes care of the effect of the peak period for this case pressure transducer p1 was located 5 cm above the swl table 2 pressure sensors p2 p3 p4 p5 and p6 were immersed at a depth of 6 cm 17 cm 28 cm 39 cm and 50 cm respectively from the swl since the wave was mild it interacted rarely with p1 and hence the y axis value was closer to zero for d lp 0 1 long wave the normalized pressure values were around 1 2 for d lp 0 5 short wave the normalized pressure values were high around 1 08 near the water surface p2 and reduced significantly toward the seabed to 0 21 at p6 to visualize the effect of the increase in significant wave height on dynamic pressure figs 8 and 9 are provided for the same model condition used for fig 7 but for his d 0 142 and 0 214 respectively the trend is similar to the previous plot for his d 0 142 the value of positive normalized pressure near the swl reached 1 3 for d lp 0 1 due to significant wave run up on the svb increasing his d to 0 214 did not increase the normalized positive pressure for a clear understanding of the effect of significant wave height on dynamic pressure on the svb fig 10 is provided this figure is for n 2 p 10 and pressure sensor p1 p1 is located at z 12 cm table 3 and hence z d 0 171 the normalized dynamic pressure did not change significantly with a change in his d it means that whether the svb is designed for a mild wave climate like kuwait bay or a strong wave climate arabian sea during monsoon the normalized pressure values remain almost the same but they strongly varied with a change in d lp 4 3 effect of porosity and location of pressure measurement on dynamic pressure to present the effect of porosity and location of pressure measurement on the dynamic pressures on the svb it is necessary to fix parameters such as n and his d hence n 3 and his d 0 142 was selected in this setup p1 and p2 are on the front wall p3 and p4 are on the first rear wall and p5 and p6 are on the second rear wall when the porosity is increased from 10 to 60 the values of z change as shown in table 4 hence it is necessary to remove the effect of z as discussed earlier it is known that the dynamic pressure reduces following the cos hyperbolic law hence the normalized dynamic pressure pis ρghis 2 is divided by cosh k d z cosh kd to remove the effect of z fig 11 shows such normalized dynamic pressure for n 3 his d 0 142 and p 10 similar plots are provided for p 20 30 40 50 and 60 in figs 12 16 respectively a cross comparison of these figures reveals the effect of porosity on dynamic pressures in general it is found that changing the porosity has a noticeable effect on the dynamic pressure values on the svb from fig 11 it can be seen that the dynamic pressure on the front wall is higher and the second rear wall is lower this indicates that the front wall must be designed stronger than the rear walls almost similar trend is observed in figs 12 16 for a clear understanding of the effect of porosity on dynamic pressures on the svb fig 17 is provided this figure is for n 2 his d 0 142 and pressure sensor location p3 p3 is located on the front wall at z 34 cm 32 cm 30 cm 28 cm 26 cm and 24 cm for p 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 respectively table 3 the effect of z was removed as discussed in the previous figures it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure reduces with an increase in porosity and the effect is considerable for higher values of d lp 4 4 effect of the number of svbs on dynamic pressures to study the effect of n on dynamic pressure on the svb it is necessary to fix other parameters such as porosity and his d pressure sensor p6 is always on the rear wall whether n 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 hence it is beneficial to study how the dynamic pressure varies at p6 for a particular porosity p 10 and incident wave condition when n is increased from 1 to 6 table 9 can be referred to know the elevation of p6 for different n and for different porosities even for a fixed porosity the value of z is different for different n and it is necessary to remove the effect of z hence a plot with y axis with a normalized dynamic pressure of pis ρghis 2 cosh k d z cosh kd is used fig 18 shows such normalized dynamic pressure on p6 for p 10 and his d 0 142 it is found that the normalized dynamic pressure values reduce consistently when the number of slotted walls n is changed from 1 to 2 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 and 5 to 6 hence while designing an svb configuration the effect of n should be considered for the economic design of panels the strongest panel must be at the seaward side which will get direct impact by the incident waves and the thickness or strength of the walls can be reduced progressively toward the rear wall since the dynamic pressure reduces toward the rear wall 4 5 spectral density of dynamic pressures on the panels of the slotted vertical wall a typical comparison of the spectral density of measured dynamic pressures for six slotted wall case for porosity of 10 and for the incident significant wave height of 15 cm and peak period of 1 251 s is provided in fig 19 the wave elevation is measured with cm as unit and the dynamic pressure values are also measured in cm of water column the elevations of pressure sensors on all six walls is given in table 7 for 10 porosity p1 p3 and p5 are at 12 cm elevation from still water level and p2 p4 and p6 are at 17 cm from still water level where p1 p2 p3 p4 p4 and p6 are the pressure sensors at first porous wall seaside wall rear wall 1 rear wall 2 rear wall 3 rear wall 4 and rear wall 5 lee side porous wall it is found that the magnitude of spectral density of dynamic pressure for the first wall and the spectral density of incident waves are close by indicating that the magnitude of the impact of wave on the sea side wall is equivalent to the incident wave amplitudes after the wave energy dissipation by the seaside porous wall the effect on the second wall has reduced almost 70 i e the peak value of dynamic pressure on the first rear wall has reduced from to 15 2 cm2 hz when compared to the peak value at the seaside wall which is 76 5 cm2 hz similarly the dissipation of wave energy by the first rear wall helped to reduce the wave energy action on second rear wall and so on the spectral peak of the dynamic pressure on the 5th rear wall lee side wall has reduced to 1 34 cm2 hz this clearly indicates that the panels of the slotted walls can be designed according to the pressure intensity and will help for optimizing the structural design 5 application of the present study for field conditions the results of this study can be used for the optimized design of the panels of the svbs against wave induced dynamic pressures one concern for field application is what will happen to the dynamic pressure due to marine growth in the present study the gap between the vertical plates is varied from 1 cm to 6 cm to achieve 10 60 porosity for open sea applications the suitable scale model is 1 10 to 1 20 hence the gap in the field condition for 1 10 scale is 10 cm 60 cm since the wave activities in the gap is jetting of water as response to wave actions it is difficult for marine life to stick and stay in the gap especially when the gap is becoming larger in spite of these assessments if marine growth happens it will reduce the porosity to some extent say from 40 to 30 porosity or 20 when marine growth is significant since the results are presented for porosities from 10 to 60 one can easily interpret the effect of reduced porosity for example the present results for porosity of 40 will turn to results with 30 porosity or 20 porosity due to marine growth hence instead of using the results for 40 porosity it is suggested to use the results of 20 porosity for significant reduction of porosity due to marine growths 6 conclusions the important conclusions from the study on wave induced dynamic pressures on slotted vertical barriers are as follows the dynamic pressure is always higher on the seaward side of the vertical slotted wave barrier and reduces progressively toward to rear side of the barrier in general the dynamic pressure reduces with an increase in relative water depth d lp the highest dynamic pressure coefficient ps ρghis 2 can reach to an extent of about 1 5 the dynamic pressure results provided in this report can be used for the design of the panels of svbs varying the relative wave height his d from 0 07 to 0 214 has insignificant effect on varying the dynamic pressure coefficients to design a slotted wave barrier with 3 walls and 10 porosity and for d lp of 0 3 it is required to design the seaside wall panel to dynamic pressure coefficient of 1 44 the second wall for 0 82 and the rear side porous wall for 0 58 the spectral density of wave pressure can be reduced by an extent of 70 on the first rear wall for 10 porosity case in six porous wall configuration suggestions for future studies the following are the suggestions for future studies effect of varying the space between the slotted walls on wave induced dynamic pressures on the panels effect of varying the porosity of each wall on the wave induced dynamic pressures especially the effect of
