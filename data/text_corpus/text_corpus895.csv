4475,this study aims at understanding effects of sub core scale petrophysical heterogeneity on co2 brine multiphase flow properties during co2 injection in samples of the minnelusa formation in wyoming representing differing lithofacies unsteady state co2 brine drainage tests were performed on a core sample from a dune deposit with laminated bedding and poorly sorted grain distribution to highlight the role of low porosity and low permeability bedding layers llbl on co2 migration during co2 injection a contrasting coreflooding experiment was conducted on a sample of well sorted sandstone collected from an interdune deposit assisted history matching was used to estimate the corresponding core scale relative permeability curves a procedure that reveals heterogeneity dependent behavior the simulated brine production from the optimal history matching case suggests that the main variation in multiphase flow properties could be attributed to internal permeability structures i e sub core scale llbl leading in turn to capillary pressure heterogeneity co2 sweep efficiency and distribution in heterogeneous eolian sandstone are hard to estimate based solely on the limited number of coreflooding experiments due to llbl properties variability consequently sensitivity analyses for the properties of sub core scale llbl on core scale brine production were conducted using the developed model analyses indicate that the residual brine saturation and thickness of llbl have a more significant effect on bulk brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability of llbl on bulk brine production is negligible in addition comparison results show that ignoring the sub core scale heterogeneity e g sub core scale relative permeability during co2 injection can create significant uncertainties in storage and fluid flow displacement in simulated results due to important flow effects and thereby physically insightful responses overall this study provides us with a deeper understanding of core scale co2 brine multiphase flow properties for co2 geological storage in heterogeneous sandstones and gained us insights into co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling in heterogeneous geological models our approach needs to be incorporated in upscaling procedures to avoid smearing key small scale features relevant to multiphase flow behaviour keywords co2 geological storage sub core scale heterogeneity drainage residual brine saturation numerical simulation 1 introduction geological storage of carbon dioxide gsc into deep saline aquifers van der meer 1995 trevisan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021b oil gas reservoirs shaw and bachu 2002 gong and gu 2015 yu et al 2020 and unminable coal seams gale and freund 2001 stauffer et al 2011 has emerged as a potentially effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere among these gsc candidates deep saline aquifers have wide geographical spread and large storage capacity lackner 2003 wang et al 2021b the co2 transport processes in a deep saline aquifer can be summarized as follows 1 mass transfer between co2 and brine occurs at the super critical co2 scco2 plume front when scco2 contacts brine 2 behind this front scco2 and brine immiscible displacements occur as mutual solubility is important only at the scco2 plume front before phases eventually mutually saturate to reach local equilibrium 3 due to density differences the co2 plume migrates upwardly in reservoirs leading to the occurrence of secondary imbibition at the trailing edge of the co2 plume hesse et al 2008 4 brine re imbibition traps co2 as a residual discontinuous phase in the pore space through capillary trapping mechanisms these multi phase transport processes vary significantly with reservoir conditions geological and petrophysical properties and are highly impacted by multi scale heterogeneities which commonly exist in the geological media to investigate the underlying processes involved in multi phase flow during co2 injection into saline aquifers laboratory experiments are commonly used lenormand et al 1988 performed seminal work on two phase dynamics using 2d micromodel experiments and numerical simulations under a broad range of viscosity ratios and capillary numbers they generated a phase diagram that reflected saturation patterns corresponding to loci on the viscosity ratio capillary number diagram such as viscous fingering capillary fingering stable displacements and where transitions occur krevor et al 2012 conducted steady state drainage and imbibition experiments on several sandstones representing a range of reservoir rocks at different reservoir conditions akbarabadi and piri 2013 conducted a series experiments to demonstrate the role of hysteresis on capillary trapping and relative permeability of co2 brine systems at reservoir conditions in their studies a wide range of flow rates for both scco2 brine and gaseous co2 brine fluid systems were used to establish the initial brine saturation under unsteady state conditions more recently bakhshian et al 2020 studied the effect of anisotropy on the co2 brine flow properties by performing drainage and imbibition tests on two core samples the co2 saturation profiles observed in their study indicate that the phase distribution in the pore space closely related to sub core heterogeneity as expressed by porosity permeability distributions that result in capillary pressure heterogeneity the investigation of the effect of heterogeneity of rock physical and petrophysical properties on fluid distribution in porous media at the sub core scale contributes to a fundamental understanding of rock relative permeability as well as to the development of data based upscaling technologies for field scale multiphase flow simulation therefore understanding the influence of sub core heterogeneity on co2 flow properties is significant in the context of co2 geological storage hesse and woods 2010 and green and ennis king 2010 concluded that heterogeneity plays an important role in evaluating the residual trapping capacity of target formations and the volume of the reservoir contacting co2 by means of experiments and simulations in this context krevor et al 2011 showed the effect of capillary heterogeneity on co2 trapping on a composite core sample which included two regions with distinct permeability and heterogeneity based on their study one can state that the co2 plume can be trapped as a continuous phase behind the interfaces between two regions due to the existence of capillary barriers similarly by conducting co2 water displacement experiments at reservoir conditions pini et al 2012 provided a timesaving method to measure the drainage capillary pressure curves both at core and sub core scales they illustrated that sub core scale capillary heterogeneity is a key saturation controlling mechanism on the other hand shi et al 2011 mapped the heterogeneous co2 distribution in tako sandstones by ct scanning and verified that a single capillary pressure curve in the core sample is insufficient to fully characterize the co2 brine displacement process therefore to obtain porosity and permeability dependent capillary pressure wei et al 2014 adopted the leverett j function to scale the average capillary pressure of the core plugs oh et al 2019 applied the van genuchten model to describe capillary pressure of sand and silt regions in a heterogeneous core sample in addition reynolds et al 2018 provided a relationship between the average capillary pressure function and the location specific function to account for capillary heterogeneity based on this they further investigated the effect of three different heterogeneities on the multiphase flow characteristics of core plugs from co2 storage reservoirs however most of the aforementioned studies focused solely on the effect of one single type of heterogeneity of the target layer on the co2 flow properties in fact heterogeneity can be observed in almost all rock samples and these heterogeneities generally are not fully representative of the spread of characteristics not even in a single target layer perrin and benson 2010 as a result one can expect the variability in co2 sweep efficiency and distribution at different locations of deep saline aquifers during co2 injection in this study the effects of sub core scale heterogeneity on the co2 brine multiphase flow behaviors were investigated using core flooding experiments and numerical simulation the coreflooding experiment was performed on the core sample exhibiting heterogeneity consisting of poorly sorted sand with laminated bedding which were tilted with respect to the axis the sample was collected from a higher permeability region of the core in order to confirm the heterogeneity dependent brine production during co2 injection another coreflooding experiment was performed on a different lithofacies this sample was not laminated and was well sorted considerable heterogeneity traits were observed in the second sample and its multiscale petrophysical characterization can be found in our earlier related reference wang et al 2021c in addition a model that represents the core sample with llbl was developed to determine the relative permeability and investigate the role of sub core scale llbl on co2 migration during co2 injection by applying numerical simulation software cmg gem based on that the effect of llbl properties such as the dip angle and the petrophysical property contrast between two sub core scale sections on the brine production were studied using the proposed model specifically because performing numerous coreflooding experiments is time consuming and impractical it is useful to reliably predict the spatial co2 brine multiphase properties variations of common sandstone lithofacies for instance at different vertical locations and from near well region to far well region the results in this study lay the foundation for evaluating the position dependent co2 sweep efficiency and distribution in heterogeneous eolian sandstones 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials table 1 shows the synthetic formation brines composition prepared from pre determined salt fractions prior to nmr measurements and coreflooding tests the in situ reservoir pressures and temperatures of the core samples used in this study were drawn from mdt logging as shown in table 2 in this study two core plugs samples a and b from the minnelusa formation sandstones min ss an eolian sandstone located in northeast wyoming shown in fig 1 a and e were collected sample a from the laminated dune deposit have inclined bedded structure and poorly sorted grain distributions therefore two zones can be observed in sample a authigenic mineral zone and detrital mineral zone with respect to mineralogy of sample a the authigenic mineral zone is typically associated with zones of increased concentrations of authigenic minerals mostly dolomite but also anhydrite calcite clay and oxides the detrital mineral zone is generally the zone with minimal authigenic minerals with mineralogy comprised mostly of detrital grains such as quartz with minor feldspar and other accessory minerals in addition the authigenic mineral zone typically has smaller grains compared to that of the detrital mineral zone in this study for the convenience of description the authigenic mineral and the detrital mineral zones refer to dark llbl and light sections respectively as shown in fig 1 a c specifically for ease of simulation afterwards fig 1 d shows the top view and cross section view of sample a conceptual model that was developed based on petrographical and visual analyses despite its simplicity the model still captures the main petrophysical heterogeneities moreover considering the uncertainty regarding the internal locations of the dark and light sections we also studied the effects of physical properties of dark section e g dip angle and thickness on multiphase flow properties via sensitive analyses as for sample b collected from the interdune deposit it exhibits a so called massive sand characteristic wherein the grains are well sorted in fact the features of two core samples represent two typical types of heterogeneities found in min ss furthermore to study the sub core scale heterogeneities in pore size distribution three mini plugs samples c d and e were cut into dimensions of 0 8 cm 1 0 cm d l for nmr t2 measurements samples c and d were representative of the dark and light sections of sample a respectively sample e was representative of sample b see fig 1 b c and f the core samples were cleaned in soxhlet extractors using toluene and methanol for two weeks subsequently the core samples were dried in an oven at 100 c for 24 hrs nitrogen porosity and permeability were measured at a net confining pressure of 1000 psi 6 9 mpa using a coreval700 poro permeameter vinci technologies france table 3 provides the properties of the two core samples 2 2 core sample characterizations nuclear magnetic resonance nmr is a fast and non destructive tool for core characterization the t2 distribution obtained from the spin spin relaxation time is often used to study the pore size distribution in porous media in this study two sets of nmr measurements were conducted the first one corresponds to core scale measurements on the two brine saturated core samples samples a and b by using the lf110 bruker nmr spectrometer with a frequency of 6 mhz see fig 1 a and e nmr measurements on the sub core scale brine saturated samples samples c d and e were conducted using a bruker mq20 minipsec spectrometer with a frequency of 19 65 mhz see fig 1 b c and f the carr purcell meiboom grill cpmg pulse sequences were applied during the nmr measurements capillary pressure plays an important role in determining co2 residual trapping capacity of core samples wang and tokunaga 2015 al menhali and krevor 2016 therefore in this study the representative capillary pressures of the samples were determined by means of mercury intrusion capillary pressure micp again two samples 0 5 cm3 from identical depth intervals as sample a were cut from the untreated sandstones each represents the light section and dark section of sample a e g fig 1 b and c respectively then the samples were dried up in an oven at 100 c for 24 hrs subsequently the fluid saturation and corresponding capillary pressure for the mercury air system were obtained during mercury injection into the samples the capillary pressure data for mercury air system were further converted into the capillary pressure for the co2 brine system based on the following equation 1 p c c o 2 p c h g σ c o 2 cos θ c o 2 σ hg cos θ hg where p is the capillary pressure pa σ is the interfacial tension between wetting phase and non wetting phase mn m θ is the contact angle measured in wetting phase o subscript co2 represents the co2 brine system and subscript hg refers to the mercury air system in addition σco2 and θco2 were measured using data physics sca oca 20 high pressure high temperature pendant drop instrument σhg was set to 485 mn m and θhg was set to 140 krevor et al 2012 oh et al 2019 2 3 core flooding experiments following the core samples characterization scco2 flooding tests on the two core samples were performed fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the core flooding system prior to each experiment water saturated co2 was prepared by the following process 1 co2 was firstly injected into a 500 ml floating piston accumulator which had been filled with water 2 then the accumulator was brought to the in situ temperature and pressure and shaken to accelerate the equilibrium 3 finally the high temperature and pressure co2 accumulator was kept in the oven for one day this process was intended to avoid mass transfer between phases during the non wetting phase injection and within the core space in addition to the water saturated scco2 dead de gassed brine was also stored in a floating piston accumulator and both were connected to an injection pump teledyne isco 260d the core sample was wrapped in a viton sleeve and then mounted inside a hydrostatic core holder vinci technologies confining pressure was maintained by using the other teledyne isco 260d syringe pump throughout tests a back pressure regulator bpr controlled by a high precision syringe pump teledyne isco 100d was utilized to set the outlet pressure of core samples at the respective reservoir pressure experimental temperature was controlled by an oven furthermore the system effluent was collected by a glass graduated cylinder and the gas meter the whole system including flow lines and core sample a was firstly vacuumed for five hours then the sample was brought to the target temperature and pressure and kept under these conditions for a week to restore wettability prior to absolute brine permeability measurements 10 brine pore volumes pvs were injected into core sample to remove possible precipitated salts inside the pore space following that the absolute brine permeability of the core sample was determined based on the line slope resulting from the correlation between three water injection rates q 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min and the corresponding pressure drop between inlet and outlet of core samples for the drainage process water saturated scco2 was injected into the core sample to displace the in situ brine and the real time volume of the produced brine was recorded the injection of co2 was controlled by operating the inlet syringe pump at constant injection rate of 0 2 ml min and outlet syringe pump at constant outlet pressure reservoir pressure a pressure transducer as shown in fig 2 recorded the inlet pressure and pressure drop between inlet and outlet of core holder when the brine production ceased the injection of scco2 was stopped the brine produced was considered equal in volume to the co2 injected the residual brine saturation was calculated based on the material balance method co2 end point permeability was measured at the end of drainage pure co2 production then it was normalized by the absolute brine permeability to determine co2 end point relative permeability finally the experimental procedure was repeated for sample b 2 4 numerical simulation in addition to the core flooding experiments numerical simulation a complementary cost effective method zhang et al 2018 kou and wang 2020 wang et al 2021a was used to investigate multiphase flow properties in porous media therefore to determine the relative permeability curves required for the field scale simulation and study the role of sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl in controlling the displacement of brine by co2 numerical simulation was used in this study the cmg software suite a widely used commercial numerical reservoir simulator served as the simulation platform here 2 4 1 static and dynamic model setup a three dimensional 3d model with the same dimensions as the core samples was constructed using a cartesian grid system fifty grid blocks in the flow direction x direction were adopted to attain numerical accuracy and the total number of grid blocks was 8600 each with the size of 1 38 mm 2 7 mm 2 7 mm as shown in fig 3 to mimic the bedding structure heterogeneity in sample a higher and lower porosity permeability layers were assigned to grid blocks in the model to represent the light and dark sections respectively all the grid blocks at the left end boundary were perforated and treated as a constant injection boundary to simulate the experimental injection as for the right end grid blocks a constant pressure reservoir pressure was assigned to the boundary equivalent to the experimental outlet condition of the core sample due to the high confining pressure at the lateral surface of the respective core sample in experiments the no flow condition at the lateral surface of the cylindrical core models was applied the temperature for samples a and b was set at 365 k and 366 k through the simulations respectively for the models developed for numerical simulations gaussian geostatistical simulation was used to obtain porosity distribution the process can be summarized as follows 1 for sample a with evident bedding structure the average porosity mean of distribution μ of each section was estimated from the image analysis of the thin sections respectively this was done because it was difficult to determine the porosity of the light and dark sections in the rock accurately 2 by means of adjustment to the variance σ 2 of each section a reasonable porosity distribution for the bulk core sample was obtained by comparing simulated total porosity with the real total porosity see table 4 following that the initial permeability distribution was evaluated by the empirical exponential expression resulting from the cross plot between porosity and permeability for core samples from min ss shi et al 2011 see fig 4 subsequently the prefactor in the empirical expression was determined by matching the results from the absolute permeability measurements as shown in table 4 in addition the experimental capillary pressure data were normalized in the form of a leverett j function to account for the petrophysical properties dependent capillary pressure as follows eq 2 2 j s w p c σ cos θ k ϕ where s w is the wetting fluid saturation fraction k is the absolute permeability md and ϕ is the porosity fraction in contrast to sample a the average porosity and brine permeability of sample b 8 1 and 1 06 md were directly applied to produce the porosity and permeability distributions again sample b model accounted for petrophysical properties dependent capillary pressure by employing the leverett j function table 4 shows the errors of porosity and permeability between the model and the experimental measurement for samples a and b the porosity distributions of the established models are shown in fig 3 additionally the initial co2 brine relative permeability curves were generated based on the corey s model brooks and corey 1964 for which the corey exponents the residual brine saturation and the fluid end point relative permeability determined by the laboratory tests were utilized 2 4 2 history matching the developed static models were used to carry out scco2 flooding numerical simulations with the same conditions as those in experiments then brine production obtained from each simulation was compared with the experimental brine production history to evaluate how well the simulations predict the recorded production to be more specific the simulator core sample which has the same volume as the experimental core sample was assigned in the model to simulate 3 d flow to mimic what laboratory results since the capillary pressure data were experimentally obtained from two sections of sample a respectively the volumetric average of the two sets of capillary pressure data gives the effective capillary pressure of the bulk sample a saad et al 1995 the volumetric percentage of each section was estimated based on the area ratio of two sections on the inlet face of sample a following that the effect of changing the relative permeability curves on brine production was addressed for that two corey exponents resulting from the analytical solution for relative permeability curves were tuned to approach the most suitable match between the simulated brine production and experimental brine production history wang and alvarado 2016 wang et al 2020 this process was implemented by assisted history matching in cmg cmost computer modelling group software tool for sensitivity analysis history matching optimization and uncertainty analysis wang and alvarado 2016 and the history match quality can be evaluated by the global history match error ghme which is defined in eqs 3 and 4 finally the optimal brine production case was determined when the ghme reaches a small enough value that is 3 and the core scale relative permeability could be accordingly obtained from the optimal case 3 ghme ω i lhme i ω i where ω i is the weight of lhmei and lhmei is the value of local history match error lhme i which can be expressed as eq 4 4 lhme ω i t i ω i where t i is the value of term i and ω i is its weight computer modeling group 2019 in addition this study focuses on the role of sub core scale heterogeneity llbl on the co2 brine multiphase flow properties therefore the relative permeability curves for the dark llbl and light sections of sample a were also determined respectively saad et al 1995 and bashtani and kantzas 2020 proposed a method to upscale the relative permeability curves of small scale grid block in this study the relative permeability curves of the bulk sample a including the experimentally obtained parameters such as residual brine saturation and co2 endpoint relative permeability correspond to the relative permeability curves in large scale from saad et al 1995 and bashtani and kantzas 2020 therefore an inverse process was applied to obtain the relative permeability curves of the two sections in sample a the process goes as follows 1 calculate the effective co2 and brine phase permeabilities of the bulk sample a at each saturation 2 adopt a volumetric average to constrain the determination of the residual brine saturation for each section 3 calculate the normalized saturation for each section using the following equation 5 s n s w s wr 1 s wr where s n is the normalized saturation fraction s wr is the residual brine saturation fraction 4 for each normalized saturation of each section generate the corresponding initial co2 and brine phase permeabilities using the following constraint 6 k f 1 n i 1 n k i ω 1 ω where k f is the phase permeability md n refers to the total number of small scale grid blocks in the large scale grid block saad et al 1995 therefore n equals to 2 light section and dark section in the bulk core sample in this study eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 k f k fl ω 2 k fd ω 2 1 ω where subscripts l and d mean the light section and dark section respectively and ω is an exponent parameter which can be determined by eq 8 8 k k l ω 2 k d ω 2 1 ω where k is the absolute permeability of bulk sample a md k l and k d are the average absolute permeabilities of light and dark sections respectively md 5 5 for each section convert the respective co2 and brine phase permeabilities into the relative permeabilities by utilizing k rg k g k a and k rw k w k a where k g and k w are the phase permeabilities md and k a is the average absolute permeabilities for each section e g k a k l or k d md 6 calculate the corresponding brine saturation for each section 7 use a trial and error procedure in cmg cmost to obtain the optimal relative permeability curves of the two sections 2 4 3 sensitivity analyses characteristics of the petrophysical properties in the eolian sandstones are complex due to the dynamic depositional environment dramatic lithofacies changes and highly variable diagenetic effects for example the minnelusa sandstones are commonly composed of a series of stacked dunes interdunes and sand sheets leading to drastic variations of sedimentary lithofacies within short vertical and lateral distances in addition the very fine sand deposited within the same lithofacies such as stacked dunes also introduces heterogeneities in porosity and permeability for instance the dip angles of the laminated dune and sand sheets deposits representing the angle of repose which are commonly delineated by finer grained grains and mineralogical variance are different and might vary vertically and horizontally within a short distance therefore the physical and petrophysical properties as well as the distributions of laminated structure can introduce large uncertainties which tend to influence co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity understanding the effects of the parameters such as dip angle thickness ratio of lower high permeable zones and porosity permeability contrast on the co2 injectivity trapping capacity sweep efficiency and flow regime is of great significance in this study after the investigations on the role of sub core scale llbl for co2 brine multiphase flow properties in section 2 4 2 the sensitivity analyses regarding the aforementioned parameters were conducted to study their impacts on the co2 flooding process using cmg gem compositional unconventional simulator based on the developed models based on that the co2 sweep efficiency and distribution at different positions under the varied petrophysical properties complexities in this type of heterogeneous sandstone reservoir can be estimated 3 results and discussion in this section the results for experiments and numerical simulations are provided and discussed the sem and thin section results can be found in another study in which the multiscale petrophysical characterization of the similar sandstone was investigated wang et al 2021c 3 1 nmr measurements t2 distributions determined from nmr measurements were used to investigate the sub core scale heterogeneity of two samples fig 5 a shows the t2 distributions of the brine saturated samples a and b core scale plugs and fig 5 b demonstrates the t2 distributions of brine saturated samples c d and e sub core scale plugs sample a exhibits a quadrimodal distribution ranging from 5 ms to 300 ms where the dominant peak center around 250 ms in contrast with sample a the t2 distribution of sample b contains a narrow trimodal distribution where the dominant peak is located at roughly 150 ms and the leftmost peak is located around 10 ms the wider quadrimodal t2 distribution of sample a suggests its stronger heterogeneity in pore size and the existence of less permeable bedding layers can be verified by the leftmost peak in the t2 distribution of sample a which are inexistent in the t2 distribution of sample b on the other hand the t2 distributions of sub core scale plugs are different from that of core scale plugs to some degree while both are from the identical depth interval see fig 5 a and 5 b this is due to the heterogeneity effect caused by the sample size difference wang et al 2018 to be more specific from fig 5 b the t2 distribution of sample c exhibits unimodal distribution centered at roughly 7 ms denoting that it contains a single rock type with small pore diameter it can be confirmed that sample c corresponds to the dark section of sample a since the t2 value of the peak for sample c is close to the t2 value of the leftmost peak for sample a as for sample d the trimodal distribution can be observed with a predominant peak located roughly at 25 ms and the rightmost peak centered around 80 ms which are representative of the light section of sample a particularly it is hard to cut the pure light section mini plug from sample a due to the widespread distribution of dark section therefore sample d contains a small portion of dark section see the leftmost peak of t2 distribution of sample d in addition it can be concluded that the heterogeneity of sample d is stronger compared to that of sample c from fig 5 b the t2 distribution of sample e exhibits a trimodal distribution and the t2 values of all the peaks for sample e are relatively similar to the one for sample b this suggests that sample e cut from identical depth interval as sample b can be representative of sample b 3 2 micp measurements fig 6 shows the capillary pressure p c curves as functions of brine saturation for samples c and d the p c of sample c is greater than the one of sample d the distinction mainly contributes to the smaller size of pore throats in sample c which controls the drainage entry pressure of the non wetting phase e g co2 furthermore the capillary pressure curve for sample d is broader than that for sample c this reflects the higher degree heterogeneity in pore throat size of sample d bakhshian et al 2020 which has been shown in the presented t2 distributions of samples c and d in fig 5 b the stronger heterogeneity in pore size of sample a is confirmed by the two sets of nmr measurements utilizing different scale plugs as well as the sub core scale micp measurements 3 3 coreflooding experiments the experimental results for the immiscible displacement of brine by scco2 for samples a and b are shown in fig 7 a b and table 5 zhu et al 2013 indicated that for a relatively short time core flooding experiment insignificant reaction between co2 brine and minerals in sandstone can be observed therefore the chemical reaction between co2 brine mixtures and the minerals in either sample was ignored in this study from fig 7 a and b the gas front breakthrough occurred at the 0 153 pv co2 injection into sample a whereas the gas front breakthrough was observed after the 0 355 pv co2 injection into sample b from the core samples characterizations in sections 3 1 and 3 2 one can confirm the strong pore size heterogeneity of sample a and the extremely small pore size of sample c llbl as a result the phenomenon observed in core flooding experiments is mainly associated to the co2 front within sample a advanced through the high permeable paths between less permeable bedding layers and bypassed the low permeability regions which possess a larger entry capillary pressure as for co2 brine co production stage the two phase flow period of sample a lasted a shorter time than the one of sample b due to the complex heterogeneity of sample a in other words the co2 front was more stable and homogeneous and the brine residing in wider area was more efficiently displaced by co2 within sample b thus resulting in a longer displacement time before attaining the smaller residual brine saturation see table 5 3 4 history matching next based on the obtained results for core flooding experiments the core scale relative permeability curves were determined by applying history matching fig 7 a and 7 b illustrate the assisted history matching results the blue curve is the optimal case for cumulative brine production table 6 shows the history match quality in which the ghme both were less than 3 suggesting the satisfactory matching results accordingly the spatial temporal co2 saturation distributions for the middle plane of samples a and b and the relative permeability curves of bulk samples a and b can be determined from the respective optimal case see figs 8 and 9 a it is worth mentioning that because the size of the core samples used in this study was relatively small and the length of tubing on either end of core samples to pressure transducer is quite long there may be compressibility issues for the fluid in the fluid lines which affect experimental pressure collection therefore differential pressure was not history matched in this study the spatial temporal co2 saturation distribution of samples a and b from simulation results are shown in fig 8 a c and fig 8 e g which confirm the explanations in section 3 3 for sample a the co2 front breakthrough was observed at 0 07pv whereas the co2 saturation is still zero for sample b at the same injection time for the later injection period 1 4pvs the significant co2 saturation contrast between two sections of sample a was presented however the co2 saturation distribution of sample b was relatively homogeneous in addition the comparison between the co2 saturation distribution at 1 4pvs and the permeability distribution of sample a fig 8 c and d suggests that higher co2 saturation did not correspond to the larger permeability porosity grid blocks this is because there exists a slanted less permeable bedding layer originating from the top of inlet surface see fig 3 a which results in higher capillary entry pressure and seepage resistance for fluid flow therefore the co2 front tended to advance through the high permeable layers below the less permeable inclined bedding layer when it came to contact with brine at the inlet of sample a nevertheless the co2 saturation distribution exhibits a close relationship with the porosity permeability distribution of sample b as shown in fig 8 g and h consequently it is not difficult to conclude that the total volume of brine displaced by co2 for sample a was less compared to the one for sample b due to the role of llbl as capillary barrier and fluid flow guide in sample a in addition to the spatial temporal co2 saturation distribution of samples a and b the relative permeability curves during drainage process for samples a and b were also obtained from the respective optimal case in history matching as shown in fig 9 a both samples yielded similarly shaped relative permeability curves with a slow decrease in k rg and a sharp increase in k rw with increasing s w the cross over points when k rg k rw for both curves are located at s w 0 5 indicating that both the two sandstones are water wet under in situ reservoir conditions reynolds et al 2018 this is consistent with the contact angle measurements in addition the residual brine saturation obtained in sample a is much higher than that achieved in relatively homogeneous berea sandstone chen and david 2016 due to the strong sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl on the other hand despite of the higher permeability of samples a than that of sample b see table 3 the volume of displaced brine in sample a is less than that in sample b residual brine saturation for sample a is higher than the one of sample b see table 5 this is due to the evident occurrence of the co2 front propagation within high permeability layers following which co2 flowed through the less permeable bedding layers and the fluid bypassing low permeability sublayers both in light and dark sections of sample a during co2 injection however as for sample b the fluid flow exhibits homogeneous like since no such a sharp permeability contrast can be expected within sample b even though the absolute permeability of sample b is lower to further highlight the contrast two sub core scale relative permeability curves for light and dark sections of sample a were provided and analyzed fig 9 b shows the relative permeability curves for light and dark sections of sample a as can be clearly seen in fig 9 b both the residual brine saturation and co2 end point relative permeability for light section were significantly greater than the one for dark section this confirms that the brine residing within the llbl cannot be displaced by co2 efficiently and a significant amount of brine remained within llbl during co2 injection on the other hand the co2 relative permeability for the dark section is quite low this is due to the extremely small pore size of dark section zhao and yu 2017 which has been shown in the t2 distribution of sample c in fig 5 b as well as the occupied mineral surface by brine wetting phase during co2 injection the conducted drainage experiments associated with the numerical simulations illustrate that sub core scale heterogeneity drastically affected co2 migration brine residing in light section tends to be readily swept by co2 whereas the brine in less permeable bedding layers cannot be displaced efficiently to sum up owing to the lower capillary pressure and percolation resistance the light section of sample a is able to provide the preferential seepage channels for co2 migration in addition there are two dimensionless quantities that need to be considered during the core flooding experiments the first one is the gravity number g kδρg vμ g where δρ and μ g are the density differences between brine and co2 and co2 viscosity under in situ conditions respectively g is the gravitational constant and v is the fluid velocity perrin and benson 2010 the equivalent velocities for samples a and b the cross sectional area of samples a and b both are 11 28 cm2 can be calculated by the volumetric rate of 0 2 cm3 min which both are 2 96 10 6 m s 93 2 m year accordingly the gravity number of samples a and b which reflects the relative strength between the buoyancy and viscous forces were found to be approximately 0 27 and 0 05 these relatively low values suggest that buoyancy is much weaker than viscous forces under the in situ reservoir conditions in addition both the core samples were placed in a horizontal core holder during coreflooding the possible distance for co2 vertical migration diameter of core sample is relatively smaller than that from experiment using vertical core holder length of core sample therefore gravity effects can be ignored during the experiments conducted in this study the second one is the capillary number n c vμ g σ krevor et al 2011 which represents the relative strength between capillary and viscous forces because n c of the samples a and b was estimated to be approximately 0 528 10 8 and 0 53 10 8 respectively capillary force dominated over viscous force for the fluid flow within samples a and b it is worth noticing that the noticeable difference between the two numbers was induced by the distinct forces considered for example gravity number used kδρg whereas σ was included in the capillary number overall with combination of these two numbers it can be confirmed that the relative permeability curves for samples a and b were measured under capillary dominated conditions therefore the co2 brine multiphase flow behavior was significantly affected by the capillary heterogeneity of the samples e g strong porosity contrast in sample a thus leading to the heterogeneous fluid distribution within the samples and the relative permeability curves as shown in the presented results 3 5 sensitivity analyses after investigations on the role of sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl in this study for co2 migration during co2 injection the effects of properties complexities of llbl on the displacement of brine by co2 need to be studied this is because the properties complexities of llbl in the eolian sandstones are dependent on various geological characteristics such as dynamic depositional environment dramatic lithofacies changes and variable diagenetic environments also the impacts of the various property complexities of llbl on co2 brine multiphase flow properties cannot be fully captured by the limited number of core flooding experiments therefore in this study based on the developed numerical models in section 3 4 the effects of some key parameters such as the dip angle of llbl and the petrophysical property contrast between dark and light sections in sample a on the displacement of brine by co2 were investigated to evaluate the importance of these parameters on brine production and further gain a better understanding for the parameter variations during co2 injection it is worth mentioning that since the residual brine saturation is closely related to negative correlation the residual co2 saturation at the end of imbibition krevor et al 2012 akbarabadi and piri 2013 the brine production in this study was considered as the objective function in the sensitivity analyses additionally the sub core scale relative permeability curves from the two sections of core sample a determined in fig 9 b were applied in this section 3 5 1 permeability contrast fig 10 a through 10 c show the cumulative brine production cbp for different permeability contrast the y axis in fig 10 is the scaled brine production defined as the ratio of produced brine volume to the corresponding pore volume as can be seen in fig 10 a the volume of produced brine and the co2 breakthrough time both increase with increasing r 1 to be more specific as the average permeability of dark sections increases co2 can flow through the dark section with less seepage resistance and displace more brine on the other hand for the low permeability dark section cases when r 1 0 001 and 0 01 the brine production from dark sections is insignificant see fig 10 b this is because for these core samples with relatively low permeability dark sections capillary entry pressure is extremely high such that most co2 cannot enter the dark sections easily therefore the co2 front advances through the high permeability layers with less capillary pressure for fluid flow it is worth noting that since average porosity of the two sections are constant in the comparison the change of permeability can be assumed to be caused by the enhanced pore space connectivity 3 5 2 porosity contrast fig 11 a through 11 c demonstrate the cbp for three different average porosity contrasts according to fig 11 a the scaled brine volume increases as r 2 increases average porosity of dark section increases while the effects of different average porosity contrast on bulk brine production is not apparent for the constant permeability case this is because as the average porosity of dark section increases one can expect the larger pore size with lower capillary pressure within the dark section therefore brine is able to enter the dark section with less effort on the other hand from fig 11 b and 11 c compared to the brine production from light sections the different average porosity contrast mainly affects the brine production from dark sections in addition the platform of the brine production at later co2 injection time see fig 11 b is due to the low co2 initial saturation and high capillary entry pressure of dark sections 3 5 3 dip angle the effects of different dip angle of bedding layers on cbp can be observed from fig 12 a through 12 c from fig 12 a as dip angle increases on the one hand the cbp and the co2 breakthrough time increase suggesting that the displacement of brine by co2 becomes more efficient as dip angle increases this is because for the horizontal one co2 bypass most llbl and co2 front advances through the high permeability layers thus a fairly amount of brine still resides inside the llbl after co2 injection however as dip angle increases it becomes harder for co2 to bypass the less permeable layers which prevents co2 from moving forward therefore some co2 is forced to flow through the llbl and displace the brine residing in the less permeable layers on the other hand for the vertical bedding layers case the cbp is less than that of the horizontal and inclined cases this is because if there is no light sublayer connecting inlet to outlet of samples e g vertical cases the vertical dark layers work as capillary barriers which results in insufficient brine production from the light section behind them in addition from fig 12 b and 12 c it can be observed that the dip angle difference mainly affects the brine production from light sections where its influence on dark section is negligible the inclined bedding layers in this study acts as both the roles of guiding fluid flow and capillary barrier like the horizontal and vertical bedding layers from relevant studies wei et al 2014 oh et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 xu et al 2020 3 5 4 thickness contrast fig 13 a through 13 c illustrate the cbp for different thickness contrasts between two sections of sample a from fig 13 a the cbp and the co2 breakthrough time both increase with decreasing r 3 average thickness of dark section decreases in contrast with the effect of porosity contrast larger thickness of llbl represents that a larger area possesses high entry capillary pressure therefore more brine residing in dark section cannot be swept readily on the other hand as the average thickness of dark section increases the smaller co2 breakthrough time can be expected since most co2 flow within the narrower high permeability layers additionally from fig 13 b and 13 c larger thickness of dark sections results in higher brine production from dark sections and lower brine production from light sections 3 5 5 residual brine saturation fig 14 a through 14 c show the cbp for different residual brine saturation s rw of dark sections from fig 14 a and 14 b s rw significantly affects the brine production for example the bulk brine production and the brine production from dark sections both drastically increase with decreasing s rw this is because the decreasing s rw corresponds to the higher initial co2 saturation of dark sections which denotes that more brine tends to be displaced by co2 within dark sections during co2 injection in contrast with this effect see fig 14 c varied s rw leads to negligible brine production difference from light sections additionally the comparison of the sensitive analyses results among three cases inclined bedding layers sub core scale relative permeability ibl scrp horizontal bedding layers sub core scale relative permeability hbl scrp and inclined bedding layers core scale relative permeability ibl crp are provided in appendix a this aims at comprehensively investigating the impacts of physical properties of bedding layers e g dip angle and different scale relative permeability on the displacement of brine by co2 based on appendix a one can expect that the ignoring the sub core scale relative permeability heterogeneity may lose some important multiphase flow behaviors during co2 injection 3 5 6 co2 end point relative permeability in addition to the residual brine saturation the influences of co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections were also studied fig 15 a through 15 c demonstrate the cbp for different co2 end point relative permeability of darks sections k rg based on fig 15 a through 15 c it is evident that the effects of different k rg on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections all are negligible that is to say the displacement of brine by co2 is insensitive to the variation of co2 end point relative permeability of darks sections 3 5 7 sensitivity coefficient up to this point we studied the effects of several parameters on brine production and co2 breakthrough time to further illustrate the relative importance of these model parameters on bulk brine production the sensitive degree sensitivity coefficient of these parameters is calculated as can be seen in fig 16 it is noteworthy that all the parameters provided in fig 16 are from the dark sections of core sample a and the dip angle is absent in fig 16 due to its non monotonic effect on brine production in addition the permeability contrast and porosity contrast cover the most range of permeability and porosity in the cross plot of sandstones from min ss see fig 4 since the investigations on the effects of dark section thickness on brine production are rare in relevant studies a relatively wide range of thickness contrast from 0 5 to 1 was utilized in this work the range of brine residual saturation and co2 end point relative permeability of dark section were considered from 0 95 and 0 1 base case respectively to the corresponding values of light section from fig 16 it is evident that higher permeability and porosity of dark sections result in more brine production whereas larger residual brine saturation thickness and co2 end point relative permeability led to a smaller brine production on the other hand the sensitive degree of those parameters on brine production shows that residual brine saturation and thickness exhibit significant effects on brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability on brine production is insignificant krevor et al 2011 experimentally proved that co2 can build up at the upstream of the capillary barrier llbl in this study and once in place the co2 at the upstream of capillary barrier cannot be fully displaced by brine during imbibition thus resulting in a substantial amount of co2 trapped within pore space in addition it is widely accepted that the initial co2 saturation at the end of drainage is positively correlated to the residual co2 saturation at the end of imbibition krevor et al 2012 akbarabadi and piri 2013 accordingly the results obtained in this section is of great significance to evaluate the co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity under complex geological characteristics in heterogeneous eolian sandstones during co2 geological storage for example the co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity differences between two positions in a reservoir which have distinct dip angles of llbl can be estimated based on the analyses carried out it is worth noting that the sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the single parameter variation while the rest parameters remained unchanged thus leading to uncertainty in the prediction to some degree however the purpose of this section aims at giving the qualitative understanding for the effects of these parameters on the brine displacement by co2 which is beneficial for engineers to have an initial evaluation regarding co2 brine multiphase flow properties for specific eolian sandstone sample 4 conclusions the experimental and modeling approaches followed here allowed us to draw the following conclusions 1 td nmr and micp measurements consistently show that the expected heterogeneity of sample a inferred from petrographical and visual analyses which includes inclined bedding structure is potentially more impactful on co2 brine multiphase flow transport in contrast with the so called massive sandstone sample b due to the apparent contrast in petrophysical properties 2 in agreement with our first conclusion the coreflooding experimental and simulation results reveal that the sub core scale laminated structures llbl are dominant in determining the co2 brine multiphase flow properties in core sample a the llbl acts as a capillary entry barrier and guides fluid flow at co2 brine front in contrast and in agreement with summarized findings the co2 brine multiphase flow exhibits homogeneous like state in massive sandstone b as a result the resulting relative permeability curves of the two core samples present obvious heterogeneity dependent behavior 3 the sub core scale heterogeneity present in sample and the connected more complex multiphase flow response introduce a complexity on co2 the effects derive from the observed co2 sweep efficiency in sample a in which the absolute permeability baffles barriers is smaller than those in sample b the consequence of the observed contrast leads to poor brine displacement by co2 in the sub core scale llbl of sample a thereby lowering the overall co2 final saturation in the sample 4 therefore evaluating the co2 injectivity based solely on the petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability could result in inadequately predicting the co2 migration behaviors in saline aquifers after determining the role of sub core scale llbl on co2 brine multiphase flow the effects of properties complexities of llbl on brine production and co2 front breakthrough were studied by sensitivity analyses which showed that the residual brine saturation and thickness of llbl exhibit significant effects on bulk brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability of llbl on bulk brine production is negligible finally based on the comparisons between two models considering sub core scale relative permeability and core scale relative permeability respectively we can categorically state that sub core scale heterogeneity during co2 injection cannot be ignored in this portion of these sediments because it will create large uncertainties in storage and fluid flow overall the two core scale experimental and simulation studies yielded a quantitative analysis for the effects of two types of sub core scale heterogeneities in min ss on relative permeability curves revealing the variety of co2 brine multiphase flow behaviors in the same formation and the associated risks that can arise from poor formation characterization at these needed scales furthermore this study supports a better understanding of the co2 brine multiphase flow properties in heterogeneous sandstones and enables the evaluation of position dependent co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity during co2 injection in heterogeneous eolian sandstone reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement zuhao kou conceptualization data curation formal

constructive comments and suggestions from the editors and reviewers appendix a fig a1 a through a1 i show the cbp for different average permeability contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with increasing average permeability of dark sections see fig a1 a a1 d and a1 g the impact of average permeability of dark sections on brine production is less significant in hbl scrp than that of another two cases this is because for the case hbl scrp most co2 flow through the horizontal high permeability sub layers most produced brine originate from the light sections therefore the interactions between co2 and dark sections are not obvious in hbl scrp see fig a1 f fig a2 a through a2 i show the cbp for different average porosity contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with increasing average porosity of dark sections see fig a2 a a2 d and a2 g the effect of average porosity of dark sections on brine production is more obvious for ibl crp than that of another two cases this is mainly because for the case ibl crp dark sections have lower residual brine saturation higher initial co2 saturation compared to another two cases as the porosity of dark sections increases which means the larger pore volume can be expected more brine can be displaced by co2 than that of another two cases see fig a2 g fig a3 a through a3 f show the cbp for different dip angle of bedding layers of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and ibl crp from fig a3 a and a3 d it is evident that considering core scale relative permeability leads to higher brine production for vertical bedding layers than the one of ibl scrp this is caused by the identical relative permeability for two sections dark and light sections in ibl crp which denotes that the residual brine saturation of dark sections in ibl crp is higher than the one of ibl scrp this can also be confirmed by the results from fig a3 b and a3 e fig a4 a through a4 i show the cbp for different average thickness contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with decreasing average thickness of dark sections see fig a4 a a4 d and a4 g additionally the effects of average thickness contrast on brine production in hbl scrp is more significant than that of another two cases denoting that the brine production is relatively sensitive to the thickness variation of dark sections in hbl scrp fig a5 a through a5 f show the cbp for different residual brine saturation of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and hbl scrp from fig a5 it can be observed that the effect of different s rw on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections in ibl scrp is similar to the one in hbl scrp larger s rw of dark sections results in lower bulk brine production on the other hand for a specific s rw the ibl scrp leads to higher brine production than the one of hbl scrp due to the stronger interactions between co2 and dark sections in ibl scrp more co2 flow through dark sections fig a6 a through a6 f show the cbp for different co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and hbl scrp based on fig a6 it is not hard to conclude that the effects of different k rg on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections all are negligible for the three cases accordingly the brine production is not sensitive to the variation of co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections 
4475,this study aims at understanding effects of sub core scale petrophysical heterogeneity on co2 brine multiphase flow properties during co2 injection in samples of the minnelusa formation in wyoming representing differing lithofacies unsteady state co2 brine drainage tests were performed on a core sample from a dune deposit with laminated bedding and poorly sorted grain distribution to highlight the role of low porosity and low permeability bedding layers llbl on co2 migration during co2 injection a contrasting coreflooding experiment was conducted on a sample of well sorted sandstone collected from an interdune deposit assisted history matching was used to estimate the corresponding core scale relative permeability curves a procedure that reveals heterogeneity dependent behavior the simulated brine production from the optimal history matching case suggests that the main variation in multiphase flow properties could be attributed to internal permeability structures i e sub core scale llbl leading in turn to capillary pressure heterogeneity co2 sweep efficiency and distribution in heterogeneous eolian sandstone are hard to estimate based solely on the limited number of coreflooding experiments due to llbl properties variability consequently sensitivity analyses for the properties of sub core scale llbl on core scale brine production were conducted using the developed model analyses indicate that the residual brine saturation and thickness of llbl have a more significant effect on bulk brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability of llbl on bulk brine production is negligible in addition comparison results show that ignoring the sub core scale heterogeneity e g sub core scale relative permeability during co2 injection can create significant uncertainties in storage and fluid flow displacement in simulated results due to important flow effects and thereby physically insightful responses overall this study provides us with a deeper understanding of core scale co2 brine multiphase flow properties for co2 geological storage in heterogeneous sandstones and gained us insights into co2 brine multiphase flow upscaling in heterogeneous geological models our approach needs to be incorporated in upscaling procedures to avoid smearing key small scale features relevant to multiphase flow behaviour keywords co2 geological storage sub core scale heterogeneity drainage residual brine saturation numerical simulation 1 introduction geological storage of carbon dioxide gsc into deep saline aquifers van der meer 1995 trevisan et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2021b oil gas reservoirs shaw and bachu 2002 gong and gu 2015 yu et al 2020 and unminable coal seams gale and freund 2001 stauffer et al 2011 has emerged as a potentially effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere among these gsc candidates deep saline aquifers have wide geographical spread and large storage capacity lackner 2003 wang et al 2021b the co2 transport processes in a deep saline aquifer can be summarized as follows 1 mass transfer between co2 and brine occurs at the super critical co2 scco2 plume front when scco2 contacts brine 2 behind this front scco2 and brine immiscible displacements occur as mutual solubility is important only at the scco2 plume front before phases eventually mutually saturate to reach local equilibrium 3 due to density differences the co2 plume migrates upwardly in reservoirs leading to the occurrence of secondary imbibition at the trailing edge of the co2 plume hesse et al 2008 4 brine re imbibition traps co2 as a residual discontinuous phase in the pore space through capillary trapping mechanisms these multi phase transport processes vary significantly with reservoir conditions geological and petrophysical properties and are highly impacted by multi scale heterogeneities which commonly exist in the geological media to investigate the underlying processes involved in multi phase flow during co2 injection into saline aquifers laboratory experiments are commonly used lenormand et al 1988 performed seminal work on two phase dynamics using 2d micromodel experiments and numerical simulations under a broad range of viscosity ratios and capillary numbers they generated a phase diagram that reflected saturation patterns corresponding to loci on the viscosity ratio capillary number diagram such as viscous fingering capillary fingering stable displacements and where transitions occur krevor et al 2012 conducted steady state drainage and imbibition experiments on several sandstones representing a range of reservoir rocks at different reservoir conditions akbarabadi and piri 2013 conducted a series experiments to demonstrate the role of hysteresis on capillary trapping and relative permeability of co2 brine systems at reservoir conditions in their studies a wide range of flow rates for both scco2 brine and gaseous co2 brine fluid systems were used to establish the initial brine saturation under unsteady state conditions more recently bakhshian et al 2020 studied the effect of anisotropy on the co2 brine flow properties by performing drainage and imbibition tests on two core samples the co2 saturation profiles observed in their study indicate that the phase distribution in the pore space closely related to sub core heterogeneity as expressed by porosity permeability distributions that result in capillary pressure heterogeneity the investigation of the effect of heterogeneity of rock physical and petrophysical properties on fluid distribution in porous media at the sub core scale contributes to a fundamental understanding of rock relative permeability as well as to the development of data based upscaling technologies for field scale multiphase flow simulation therefore understanding the influence of sub core heterogeneity on co2 flow properties is significant in the context of co2 geological storage hesse and woods 2010 and green and ennis king 2010 concluded that heterogeneity plays an important role in evaluating the residual trapping capacity of target formations and the volume of the reservoir contacting co2 by means of experiments and simulations in this context krevor et al 2011 showed the effect of capillary heterogeneity on co2 trapping on a composite core sample which included two regions with distinct permeability and heterogeneity based on their study one can state that the co2 plume can be trapped as a continuous phase behind the interfaces between two regions due to the existence of capillary barriers similarly by conducting co2 water displacement experiments at reservoir conditions pini et al 2012 provided a timesaving method to measure the drainage capillary pressure curves both at core and sub core scales they illustrated that sub core scale capillary heterogeneity is a key saturation controlling mechanism on the other hand shi et al 2011 mapped the heterogeneous co2 distribution in tako sandstones by ct scanning and verified that a single capillary pressure curve in the core sample is insufficient to fully characterize the co2 brine displacement process therefore to obtain porosity and permeability dependent capillary pressure wei et al 2014 adopted the leverett j function to scale the average capillary pressure of the core plugs oh et al 2019 applied the van genuchten model to describe capillary pressure of sand and silt regions in a heterogeneous core sample in addition reynolds et al 2018 provided a relationship between the average capillary pressure function and the location specific function to account for capillary heterogeneity based on this they further investigated the effect of three different heterogeneities on the multiphase flow characteristics of core plugs from co2 storage reservoirs however most of the aforementioned studies focused solely on the effect of one single type of heterogeneity of the target layer on the co2 flow properties in fact heterogeneity can be observed in almost all rock samples and these heterogeneities generally are not fully representative of the spread of characteristics not even in a single target layer perrin and benson 2010 as a result one can expect the variability in co2 sweep efficiency and distribution at different locations of deep saline aquifers during co2 injection in this study the effects of sub core scale heterogeneity on the co2 brine multiphase flow behaviors were investigated using core flooding experiments and numerical simulation the coreflooding experiment was performed on the core sample exhibiting heterogeneity consisting of poorly sorted sand with laminated bedding which were tilted with respect to the axis the sample was collected from a higher permeability region of the core in order to confirm the heterogeneity dependent brine production during co2 injection another coreflooding experiment was performed on a different lithofacies this sample was not laminated and was well sorted considerable heterogeneity traits were observed in the second sample and its multiscale petrophysical characterization can be found in our earlier related reference wang et al 2021c in addition a model that represents the core sample with llbl was developed to determine the relative permeability and investigate the role of sub core scale llbl on co2 migration during co2 injection by applying numerical simulation software cmg gem based on that the effect of llbl properties such as the dip angle and the petrophysical property contrast between two sub core scale sections on the brine production were studied using the proposed model specifically because performing numerous coreflooding experiments is time consuming and impractical it is useful to reliably predict the spatial co2 brine multiphase properties variations of common sandstone lithofacies for instance at different vertical locations and from near well region to far well region the results in this study lay the foundation for evaluating the position dependent co2 sweep efficiency and distribution in heterogeneous eolian sandstones 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials table 1 shows the synthetic formation brines composition prepared from pre determined salt fractions prior to nmr measurements and coreflooding tests the in situ reservoir pressures and temperatures of the core samples used in this study were drawn from mdt logging as shown in table 2 in this study two core plugs samples a and b from the minnelusa formation sandstones min ss an eolian sandstone located in northeast wyoming shown in fig 1 a and e were collected sample a from the laminated dune deposit have inclined bedded structure and poorly sorted grain distributions therefore two zones can be observed in sample a authigenic mineral zone and detrital mineral zone with respect to mineralogy of sample a the authigenic mineral zone is typically associated with zones of increased concentrations of authigenic minerals mostly dolomite but also anhydrite calcite clay and oxides the detrital mineral zone is generally the zone with minimal authigenic minerals with mineralogy comprised mostly of detrital grains such as quartz with minor feldspar and other accessory minerals in addition the authigenic mineral zone typically has smaller grains compared to that of the detrital mineral zone in this study for the convenience of description the authigenic mineral and the detrital mineral zones refer to dark llbl and light sections respectively as shown in fig 1 a c specifically for ease of simulation afterwards fig 1 d shows the top view and cross section view of sample a conceptual model that was developed based on petrographical and visual analyses despite its simplicity the model still captures the main petrophysical heterogeneities moreover considering the uncertainty regarding the internal locations of the dark and light sections we also studied the effects of physical properties of dark section e g dip angle and thickness on multiphase flow properties via sensitive analyses as for sample b collected from the interdune deposit it exhibits a so called massive sand characteristic wherein the grains are well sorted in fact the features of two core samples represent two typical types of heterogeneities found in min ss furthermore to study the sub core scale heterogeneities in pore size distribution three mini plugs samples c d and e were cut into dimensions of 0 8 cm 1 0 cm d l for nmr t2 measurements samples c and d were representative of the dark and light sections of sample a respectively sample e was representative of sample b see fig 1 b c and f the core samples were cleaned in soxhlet extractors using toluene and methanol for two weeks subsequently the core samples were dried in an oven at 100 c for 24 hrs nitrogen porosity and permeability were measured at a net confining pressure of 1000 psi 6 9 mpa using a coreval700 poro permeameter vinci technologies france table 3 provides the properties of the two core samples 2 2 core sample characterizations nuclear magnetic resonance nmr is a fast and non destructive tool for core characterization the t2 distribution obtained from the spin spin relaxation time is often used to study the pore size distribution in porous media in this study two sets of nmr measurements were conducted the first one corresponds to core scale measurements on the two brine saturated core samples samples a and b by using the lf110 bruker nmr spectrometer with a frequency of 6 mhz see fig 1 a and e nmr measurements on the sub core scale brine saturated samples samples c d and e were conducted using a bruker mq20 minipsec spectrometer with a frequency of 19 65 mhz see fig 1 b c and f the carr purcell meiboom grill cpmg pulse sequences were applied during the nmr measurements capillary pressure plays an important role in determining co2 residual trapping capacity of core samples wang and tokunaga 2015 al menhali and krevor 2016 therefore in this study the representative capillary pressures of the samples were determined by means of mercury intrusion capillary pressure micp again two samples 0 5 cm3 from identical depth intervals as sample a were cut from the untreated sandstones each represents the light section and dark section of sample a e g fig 1 b and c respectively then the samples were dried up in an oven at 100 c for 24 hrs subsequently the fluid saturation and corresponding capillary pressure for the mercury air system were obtained during mercury injection into the samples the capillary pressure data for mercury air system were further converted into the capillary pressure for the co2 brine system based on the following equation 1 p c c o 2 p c h g σ c o 2 cos θ c o 2 σ hg cos θ hg where p is the capillary pressure pa σ is the interfacial tension between wetting phase and non wetting phase mn m θ is the contact angle measured in wetting phase o subscript co2 represents the co2 brine system and subscript hg refers to the mercury air system in addition σco2 and θco2 were measured using data physics sca oca 20 high pressure high temperature pendant drop instrument σhg was set to 485 mn m and θhg was set to 140 krevor et al 2012 oh et al 2019 2 3 core flooding experiments following the core samples characterization scco2 flooding tests on the two core samples were performed fig 2 shows the schematic diagram of the core flooding system prior to each experiment water saturated co2 was prepared by the following process 1 co2 was firstly injected into a 500 ml floating piston accumulator which had been filled with water 2 then the accumulator was brought to the in situ temperature and pressure and shaken to accelerate the equilibrium 3 finally the high temperature and pressure co2 accumulator was kept in the oven for one day this process was intended to avoid mass transfer between phases during the non wetting phase injection and within the core space in addition to the water saturated scco2 dead de gassed brine was also stored in a floating piston accumulator and both were connected to an injection pump teledyne isco 260d the core sample was wrapped in a viton sleeve and then mounted inside a hydrostatic core holder vinci technologies confining pressure was maintained by using the other teledyne isco 260d syringe pump throughout tests a back pressure regulator bpr controlled by a high precision syringe pump teledyne isco 100d was utilized to set the outlet pressure of core samples at the respective reservoir pressure experimental temperature was controlled by an oven furthermore the system effluent was collected by a glass graduated cylinder and the gas meter the whole system including flow lines and core sample a was firstly vacuumed for five hours then the sample was brought to the target temperature and pressure and kept under these conditions for a week to restore wettability prior to absolute brine permeability measurements 10 brine pore volumes pvs were injected into core sample to remove possible precipitated salts inside the pore space following that the absolute brine permeability of the core sample was determined based on the line slope resulting from the correlation between three water injection rates q 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 ml min and the corresponding pressure drop between inlet and outlet of core samples for the drainage process water saturated scco2 was injected into the core sample to displace the in situ brine and the real time volume of the produced brine was recorded the injection of co2 was controlled by operating the inlet syringe pump at constant injection rate of 0 2 ml min and outlet syringe pump at constant outlet pressure reservoir pressure a pressure transducer as shown in fig 2 recorded the inlet pressure and pressure drop between inlet and outlet of core holder when the brine production ceased the injection of scco2 was stopped the brine produced was considered equal in volume to the co2 injected the residual brine saturation was calculated based on the material balance method co2 end point permeability was measured at the end of drainage pure co2 production then it was normalized by the absolute brine permeability to determine co2 end point relative permeability finally the experimental procedure was repeated for sample b 2 4 numerical simulation in addition to the core flooding experiments numerical simulation a complementary cost effective method zhang et al 2018 kou and wang 2020 wang et al 2021a was used to investigate multiphase flow properties in porous media therefore to determine the relative permeability curves required for the field scale simulation and study the role of sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl in controlling the displacement of brine by co2 numerical simulation was used in this study the cmg software suite a widely used commercial numerical reservoir simulator served as the simulation platform here 2 4 1 static and dynamic model setup a three dimensional 3d model with the same dimensions as the core samples was constructed using a cartesian grid system fifty grid blocks in the flow direction x direction were adopted to attain numerical accuracy and the total number of grid blocks was 8600 each with the size of 1 38 mm 2 7 mm 2 7 mm as shown in fig 3 to mimic the bedding structure heterogeneity in sample a higher and lower porosity permeability layers were assigned to grid blocks in the model to represent the light and dark sections respectively all the grid blocks at the left end boundary were perforated and treated as a constant injection boundary to simulate the experimental injection as for the right end grid blocks a constant pressure reservoir pressure was assigned to the boundary equivalent to the experimental outlet condition of the core sample due to the high confining pressure at the lateral surface of the respective core sample in experiments the no flow condition at the lateral surface of the cylindrical core models was applied the temperature for samples a and b was set at 365 k and 366 k through the simulations respectively for the models developed for numerical simulations gaussian geostatistical simulation was used to obtain porosity distribution the process can be summarized as follows 1 for sample a with evident bedding structure the average porosity mean of distribution μ of each section was estimated from the image analysis of the thin sections respectively this was done because it was difficult to determine the porosity of the light and dark sections in the rock accurately 2 by means of adjustment to the variance σ 2 of each section a reasonable porosity distribution for the bulk core sample was obtained by comparing simulated total porosity with the real total porosity see table 4 following that the initial permeability distribution was evaluated by the empirical exponential expression resulting from the cross plot between porosity and permeability for core samples from min ss shi et al 2011 see fig 4 subsequently the prefactor in the empirical expression was determined by matching the results from the absolute permeability measurements as shown in table 4 in addition the experimental capillary pressure data were normalized in the form of a leverett j function to account for the petrophysical properties dependent capillary pressure as follows eq 2 2 j s w p c σ cos θ k ϕ where s w is the wetting fluid saturation fraction k is the absolute permeability md and ϕ is the porosity fraction in contrast to sample a the average porosity and brine permeability of sample b 8 1 and 1 06 md were directly applied to produce the porosity and permeability distributions again sample b model accounted for petrophysical properties dependent capillary pressure by employing the leverett j function table 4 shows the errors of porosity and permeability between the model and the experimental measurement for samples a and b the porosity distributions of the established models are shown in fig 3 additionally the initial co2 brine relative permeability curves were generated based on the corey s model brooks and corey 1964 for which the corey exponents the residual brine saturation and the fluid end point relative permeability determined by the laboratory tests were utilized 2 4 2 history matching the developed static models were used to carry out scco2 flooding numerical simulations with the same conditions as those in experiments then brine production obtained from each simulation was compared with the experimental brine production history to evaluate how well the simulations predict the recorded production to be more specific the simulator core sample which has the same volume as the experimental core sample was assigned in the model to simulate 3 d flow to mimic what laboratory results since the capillary pressure data were experimentally obtained from two sections of sample a respectively the volumetric average of the two sets of capillary pressure data gives the effective capillary pressure of the bulk sample a saad et al 1995 the volumetric percentage of each section was estimated based on the area ratio of two sections on the inlet face of sample a following that the effect of changing the relative permeability curves on brine production was addressed for that two corey exponents resulting from the analytical solution for relative permeability curves were tuned to approach the most suitable match between the simulated brine production and experimental brine production history wang and alvarado 2016 wang et al 2020 this process was implemented by assisted history matching in cmg cmost computer modelling group software tool for sensitivity analysis history matching optimization and uncertainty analysis wang and alvarado 2016 and the history match quality can be evaluated by the global history match error ghme which is defined in eqs 3 and 4 finally the optimal brine production case was determined when the ghme reaches a small enough value that is 3 and the core scale relative permeability could be accordingly obtained from the optimal case 3 ghme ω i lhme i ω i where ω i is the weight of lhmei and lhmei is the value of local history match error lhme i which can be expressed as eq 4 4 lhme ω i t i ω i where t i is the value of term i and ω i is its weight computer modeling group 2019 in addition this study focuses on the role of sub core scale heterogeneity llbl on the co2 brine multiphase flow properties therefore the relative permeability curves for the dark llbl and light sections of sample a were also determined respectively saad et al 1995 and bashtani and kantzas 2020 proposed a method to upscale the relative permeability curves of small scale grid block in this study the relative permeability curves of the bulk sample a including the experimentally obtained parameters such as residual brine saturation and co2 endpoint relative permeability correspond to the relative permeability curves in large scale from saad et al 1995 and bashtani and kantzas 2020 therefore an inverse process was applied to obtain the relative permeability curves of the two sections in sample a the process goes as follows 1 calculate the effective co2 and brine phase permeabilities of the bulk sample a at each saturation 2 adopt a volumetric average to constrain the determination of the residual brine saturation for each section 3 calculate the normalized saturation for each section using the following equation 5 s n s w s wr 1 s wr where s n is the normalized saturation fraction s wr is the residual brine saturation fraction 4 for each normalized saturation of each section generate the corresponding initial co2 and brine phase permeabilities using the following constraint 6 k f 1 n i 1 n k i ω 1 ω where k f is the phase permeability md n refers to the total number of small scale grid blocks in the large scale grid block saad et al 1995 therefore n equals to 2 light section and dark section in the bulk core sample in this study eq 6 can be rewritten as 7 k f k fl ω 2 k fd ω 2 1 ω where subscripts l and d mean the light section and dark section respectively and ω is an exponent parameter which can be determined by eq 8 8 k k l ω 2 k d ω 2 1 ω where k is the absolute permeability of bulk sample a md k l and k d are the average absolute permeabilities of light and dark sections respectively md 5 5 for each section convert the respective co2 and brine phase permeabilities into the relative permeabilities by utilizing k rg k g k a and k rw k w k a where k g and k w are the phase permeabilities md and k a is the average absolute permeabilities for each section e g k a k l or k d md 6 calculate the corresponding brine saturation for each section 7 use a trial and error procedure in cmg cmost to obtain the optimal relative permeability curves of the two sections 2 4 3 sensitivity analyses characteristics of the petrophysical properties in the eolian sandstones are complex due to the dynamic depositional environment dramatic lithofacies changes and highly variable diagenetic effects for example the minnelusa sandstones are commonly composed of a series of stacked dunes interdunes and sand sheets leading to drastic variations of sedimentary lithofacies within short vertical and lateral distances in addition the very fine sand deposited within the same lithofacies such as stacked dunes also introduces heterogeneities in porosity and permeability for instance the dip angles of the laminated dune and sand sheets deposits representing the angle of repose which are commonly delineated by finer grained grains and mineralogical variance are different and might vary vertically and horizontally within a short distance therefore the physical and petrophysical properties as well as the distributions of laminated structure can introduce large uncertainties which tend to influence co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity understanding the effects of the parameters such as dip angle thickness ratio of lower high permeable zones and porosity permeability contrast on the co2 injectivity trapping capacity sweep efficiency and flow regime is of great significance in this study after the investigations on the role of sub core scale llbl for co2 brine multiphase flow properties in section 2 4 2 the sensitivity analyses regarding the aforementioned parameters were conducted to study their impacts on the co2 flooding process using cmg gem compositional unconventional simulator based on the developed models based on that the co2 sweep efficiency and distribution at different positions under the varied petrophysical properties complexities in this type of heterogeneous sandstone reservoir can be estimated 3 results and discussion in this section the results for experiments and numerical simulations are provided and discussed the sem and thin section results can be found in another study in which the multiscale petrophysical characterization of the similar sandstone was investigated wang et al 2021c 3 1 nmr measurements t2 distributions determined from nmr measurements were used to investigate the sub core scale heterogeneity of two samples fig 5 a shows the t2 distributions of the brine saturated samples a and b core scale plugs and fig 5 b demonstrates the t2 distributions of brine saturated samples c d and e sub core scale plugs sample a exhibits a quadrimodal distribution ranging from 5 ms to 300 ms where the dominant peak center around 250 ms in contrast with sample a the t2 distribution of sample b contains a narrow trimodal distribution where the dominant peak is located at roughly 150 ms and the leftmost peak is located around 10 ms the wider quadrimodal t2 distribution of sample a suggests its stronger heterogeneity in pore size and the existence of less permeable bedding layers can be verified by the leftmost peak in the t2 distribution of sample a which are inexistent in the t2 distribution of sample b on the other hand the t2 distributions of sub core scale plugs are different from that of core scale plugs to some degree while both are from the identical depth interval see fig 5 a and 5 b this is due to the heterogeneity effect caused by the sample size difference wang et al 2018 to be more specific from fig 5 b the t2 distribution of sample c exhibits unimodal distribution centered at roughly 7 ms denoting that it contains a single rock type with small pore diameter it can be confirmed that sample c corresponds to the dark section of sample a since the t2 value of the peak for sample c is close to the t2 value of the leftmost peak for sample a as for sample d the trimodal distribution can be observed with a predominant peak located roughly at 25 ms and the rightmost peak centered around 80 ms which are representative of the light section of sample a particularly it is hard to cut the pure light section mini plug from sample a due to the widespread distribution of dark section therefore sample d contains a small portion of dark section see the leftmost peak of t2 distribution of sample d in addition it can be concluded that the heterogeneity of sample d is stronger compared to that of sample c from fig 5 b the t2 distribution of sample e exhibits a trimodal distribution and the t2 values of all the peaks for sample e are relatively similar to the one for sample b this suggests that sample e cut from identical depth interval as sample b can be representative of sample b 3 2 micp measurements fig 6 shows the capillary pressure p c curves as functions of brine saturation for samples c and d the p c of sample c is greater than the one of sample d the distinction mainly contributes to the smaller size of pore throats in sample c which controls the drainage entry pressure of the non wetting phase e g co2 furthermore the capillary pressure curve for sample d is broader than that for sample c this reflects the higher degree heterogeneity in pore throat size of sample d bakhshian et al 2020 which has been shown in the presented t2 distributions of samples c and d in fig 5 b the stronger heterogeneity in pore size of sample a is confirmed by the two sets of nmr measurements utilizing different scale plugs as well as the sub core scale micp measurements 3 3 coreflooding experiments the experimental results for the immiscible displacement of brine by scco2 for samples a and b are shown in fig 7 a b and table 5 zhu et al 2013 indicated that for a relatively short time core flooding experiment insignificant reaction between co2 brine and minerals in sandstone can be observed therefore the chemical reaction between co2 brine mixtures and the minerals in either sample was ignored in this study from fig 7 a and b the gas front breakthrough occurred at the 0 153 pv co2 injection into sample a whereas the gas front breakthrough was observed after the 0 355 pv co2 injection into sample b from the core samples characterizations in sections 3 1 and 3 2 one can confirm the strong pore size heterogeneity of sample a and the extremely small pore size of sample c llbl as a result the phenomenon observed in core flooding experiments is mainly associated to the co2 front within sample a advanced through the high permeable paths between less permeable bedding layers and bypassed the low permeability regions which possess a larger entry capillary pressure as for co2 brine co production stage the two phase flow period of sample a lasted a shorter time than the one of sample b due to the complex heterogeneity of sample a in other words the co2 front was more stable and homogeneous and the brine residing in wider area was more efficiently displaced by co2 within sample b thus resulting in a longer displacement time before attaining the smaller residual brine saturation see table 5 3 4 history matching next based on the obtained results for core flooding experiments the core scale relative permeability curves were determined by applying history matching fig 7 a and 7 b illustrate the assisted history matching results the blue curve is the optimal case for cumulative brine production table 6 shows the history match quality in which the ghme both were less than 3 suggesting the satisfactory matching results accordingly the spatial temporal co2 saturation distributions for the middle plane of samples a and b and the relative permeability curves of bulk samples a and b can be determined from the respective optimal case see figs 8 and 9 a it is worth mentioning that because the size of the core samples used in this study was relatively small and the length of tubing on either end of core samples to pressure transducer is quite long there may be compressibility issues for the fluid in the fluid lines which affect experimental pressure collection therefore differential pressure was not history matched in this study the spatial temporal co2 saturation distribution of samples a and b from simulation results are shown in fig 8 a c and fig 8 e g which confirm the explanations in section 3 3 for sample a the co2 front breakthrough was observed at 0 07pv whereas the co2 saturation is still zero for sample b at the same injection time for the later injection period 1 4pvs the significant co2 saturation contrast between two sections of sample a was presented however the co2 saturation distribution of sample b was relatively homogeneous in addition the comparison between the co2 saturation distribution at 1 4pvs and the permeability distribution of sample a fig 8 c and d suggests that higher co2 saturation did not correspond to the larger permeability porosity grid blocks this is because there exists a slanted less permeable bedding layer originating from the top of inlet surface see fig 3 a which results in higher capillary entry pressure and seepage resistance for fluid flow therefore the co2 front tended to advance through the high permeable layers below the less permeable inclined bedding layer when it came to contact with brine at the inlet of sample a nevertheless the co2 saturation distribution exhibits a close relationship with the porosity permeability distribution of sample b as shown in fig 8 g and h consequently it is not difficult to conclude that the total volume of brine displaced by co2 for sample a was less compared to the one for sample b due to the role of llbl as capillary barrier and fluid flow guide in sample a in addition to the spatial temporal co2 saturation distribution of samples a and b the relative permeability curves during drainage process for samples a and b were also obtained from the respective optimal case in history matching as shown in fig 9 a both samples yielded similarly shaped relative permeability curves with a slow decrease in k rg and a sharp increase in k rw with increasing s w the cross over points when k rg k rw for both curves are located at s w 0 5 indicating that both the two sandstones are water wet under in situ reservoir conditions reynolds et al 2018 this is consistent with the contact angle measurements in addition the residual brine saturation obtained in sample a is much higher than that achieved in relatively homogeneous berea sandstone chen and david 2016 due to the strong sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl on the other hand despite of the higher permeability of samples a than that of sample b see table 3 the volume of displaced brine in sample a is less than that in sample b residual brine saturation for sample a is higher than the one of sample b see table 5 this is due to the evident occurrence of the co2 front propagation within high permeability layers following which co2 flowed through the less permeable bedding layers and the fluid bypassing low permeability sublayers both in light and dark sections of sample a during co2 injection however as for sample b the fluid flow exhibits homogeneous like since no such a sharp permeability contrast can be expected within sample b even though the absolute permeability of sample b is lower to further highlight the contrast two sub core scale relative permeability curves for light and dark sections of sample a were provided and analyzed fig 9 b shows the relative permeability curves for light and dark sections of sample a as can be clearly seen in fig 9 b both the residual brine saturation and co2 end point relative permeability for light section were significantly greater than the one for dark section this confirms that the brine residing within the llbl cannot be displaced by co2 efficiently and a significant amount of brine remained within llbl during co2 injection on the other hand the co2 relative permeability for the dark section is quite low this is due to the extremely small pore size of dark section zhao and yu 2017 which has been shown in the t2 distribution of sample c in fig 5 b as well as the occupied mineral surface by brine wetting phase during co2 injection the conducted drainage experiments associated with the numerical simulations illustrate that sub core scale heterogeneity drastically affected co2 migration brine residing in light section tends to be readily swept by co2 whereas the brine in less permeable bedding layers cannot be displaced efficiently to sum up owing to the lower capillary pressure and percolation resistance the light section of sample a is able to provide the preferential seepage channels for co2 migration in addition there are two dimensionless quantities that need to be considered during the core flooding experiments the first one is the gravity number g kδρg vμ g where δρ and μ g are the density differences between brine and co2 and co2 viscosity under in situ conditions respectively g is the gravitational constant and v is the fluid velocity perrin and benson 2010 the equivalent velocities for samples a and b the cross sectional area of samples a and b both are 11 28 cm2 can be calculated by the volumetric rate of 0 2 cm3 min which both are 2 96 10 6 m s 93 2 m year accordingly the gravity number of samples a and b which reflects the relative strength between the buoyancy and viscous forces were found to be approximately 0 27 and 0 05 these relatively low values suggest that buoyancy is much weaker than viscous forces under the in situ reservoir conditions in addition both the core samples were placed in a horizontal core holder during coreflooding the possible distance for co2 vertical migration diameter of core sample is relatively smaller than that from experiment using vertical core holder length of core sample therefore gravity effects can be ignored during the experiments conducted in this study the second one is the capillary number n c vμ g σ krevor et al 2011 which represents the relative strength between capillary and viscous forces because n c of the samples a and b was estimated to be approximately 0 528 10 8 and 0 53 10 8 respectively capillary force dominated over viscous force for the fluid flow within samples a and b it is worth noticing that the noticeable difference between the two numbers was induced by the distinct forces considered for example gravity number used kδρg whereas σ was included in the capillary number overall with combination of these two numbers it can be confirmed that the relative permeability curves for samples a and b were measured under capillary dominated conditions therefore the co2 brine multiphase flow behavior was significantly affected by the capillary heterogeneity of the samples e g strong porosity contrast in sample a thus leading to the heterogeneous fluid distribution within the samples and the relative permeability curves as shown in the presented results 3 5 sensitivity analyses after investigations on the role of sub core scale heterogeneity e g llbl in this study for co2 migration during co2 injection the effects of properties complexities of llbl on the displacement of brine by co2 need to be studied this is because the properties complexities of llbl in the eolian sandstones are dependent on various geological characteristics such as dynamic depositional environment dramatic lithofacies changes and variable diagenetic environments also the impacts of the various property complexities of llbl on co2 brine multiphase flow properties cannot be fully captured by the limited number of core flooding experiments therefore in this study based on the developed numerical models in section 3 4 the effects of some key parameters such as the dip angle of llbl and the petrophysical property contrast between dark and light sections in sample a on the displacement of brine by co2 were investigated to evaluate the importance of these parameters on brine production and further gain a better understanding for the parameter variations during co2 injection it is worth mentioning that since the residual brine saturation is closely related to negative correlation the residual co2 saturation at the end of imbibition krevor et al 2012 akbarabadi and piri 2013 the brine production in this study was considered as the objective function in the sensitivity analyses additionally the sub core scale relative permeability curves from the two sections of core sample a determined in fig 9 b were applied in this section 3 5 1 permeability contrast fig 10 a through 10 c show the cumulative brine production cbp for different permeability contrast the y axis in fig 10 is the scaled brine production defined as the ratio of produced brine volume to the corresponding pore volume as can be seen in fig 10 a the volume of produced brine and the co2 breakthrough time both increase with increasing r 1 to be more specific as the average permeability of dark sections increases co2 can flow through the dark section with less seepage resistance and displace more brine on the other hand for the low permeability dark section cases when r 1 0 001 and 0 01 the brine production from dark sections is insignificant see fig 10 b this is because for these core samples with relatively low permeability dark sections capillary entry pressure is extremely high such that most co2 cannot enter the dark sections easily therefore the co2 front advances through the high permeability layers with less capillary pressure for fluid flow it is worth noting that since average porosity of the two sections are constant in the comparison the change of permeability can be assumed to be caused by the enhanced pore space connectivity 3 5 2 porosity contrast fig 11 a through 11 c demonstrate the cbp for three different average porosity contrasts according to fig 11 a the scaled brine volume increases as r 2 increases average porosity of dark section increases while the effects of different average porosity contrast on bulk brine production is not apparent for the constant permeability case this is because as the average porosity of dark section increases one can expect the larger pore size with lower capillary pressure within the dark section therefore brine is able to enter the dark section with less effort on the other hand from fig 11 b and 11 c compared to the brine production from light sections the different average porosity contrast mainly affects the brine production from dark sections in addition the platform of the brine production at later co2 injection time see fig 11 b is due to the low co2 initial saturation and high capillary entry pressure of dark sections 3 5 3 dip angle the effects of different dip angle of bedding layers on cbp can be observed from fig 12 a through 12 c from fig 12 a as dip angle increases on the one hand the cbp and the co2 breakthrough time increase suggesting that the displacement of brine by co2 becomes more efficient as dip angle increases this is because for the horizontal one co2 bypass most llbl and co2 front advances through the high permeability layers thus a fairly amount of brine still resides inside the llbl after co2 injection however as dip angle increases it becomes harder for co2 to bypass the less permeable layers which prevents co2 from moving forward therefore some co2 is forced to flow through the llbl and displace the brine residing in the less permeable layers on the other hand for the vertical bedding layers case the cbp is less than that of the horizontal and inclined cases this is because if there is no light sublayer connecting inlet to outlet of samples e g vertical cases the vertical dark layers work as capillary barriers which results in insufficient brine production from the light section behind them in addition from fig 12 b and 12 c it can be observed that the dip angle difference mainly affects the brine production from light sections where its influence on dark section is negligible the inclined bedding layers in this study acts as both the roles of guiding fluid flow and capillary barrier like the horizontal and vertical bedding layers from relevant studies wei et al 2014 oh et al 2019 bakhshian et al 2020 xu et al 2020 3 5 4 thickness contrast fig 13 a through 13 c illustrate the cbp for different thickness contrasts between two sections of sample a from fig 13 a the cbp and the co2 breakthrough time both increase with decreasing r 3 average thickness of dark section decreases in contrast with the effect of porosity contrast larger thickness of llbl represents that a larger area possesses high entry capillary pressure therefore more brine residing in dark section cannot be swept readily on the other hand as the average thickness of dark section increases the smaller co2 breakthrough time can be expected since most co2 flow within the narrower high permeability layers additionally from fig 13 b and 13 c larger thickness of dark sections results in higher brine production from dark sections and lower brine production from light sections 3 5 5 residual brine saturation fig 14 a through 14 c show the cbp for different residual brine saturation s rw of dark sections from fig 14 a and 14 b s rw significantly affects the brine production for example the bulk brine production and the brine production from dark sections both drastically increase with decreasing s rw this is because the decreasing s rw corresponds to the higher initial co2 saturation of dark sections which denotes that more brine tends to be displaced by co2 within dark sections during co2 injection in contrast with this effect see fig 14 c varied s rw leads to negligible brine production difference from light sections additionally the comparison of the sensitive analyses results among three cases inclined bedding layers sub core scale relative permeability ibl scrp horizontal bedding layers sub core scale relative permeability hbl scrp and inclined bedding layers core scale relative permeability ibl crp are provided in appendix a this aims at comprehensively investigating the impacts of physical properties of bedding layers e g dip angle and different scale relative permeability on the displacement of brine by co2 based on appendix a one can expect that the ignoring the sub core scale relative permeability heterogeneity may lose some important multiphase flow behaviors during co2 injection 3 5 6 co2 end point relative permeability in addition to the residual brine saturation the influences of co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections were also studied fig 15 a through 15 c demonstrate the cbp for different co2 end point relative permeability of darks sections k rg based on fig 15 a through 15 c it is evident that the effects of different k rg on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections all are negligible that is to say the displacement of brine by co2 is insensitive to the variation of co2 end point relative permeability of darks sections 3 5 7 sensitivity coefficient up to this point we studied the effects of several parameters on brine production and co2 breakthrough time to further illustrate the relative importance of these model parameters on bulk brine production the sensitive degree sensitivity coefficient of these parameters is calculated as can be seen in fig 16 it is noteworthy that all the parameters provided in fig 16 are from the dark sections of core sample a and the dip angle is absent in fig 16 due to its non monotonic effect on brine production in addition the permeability contrast and porosity contrast cover the most range of permeability and porosity in the cross plot of sandstones from min ss see fig 4 since the investigations on the effects of dark section thickness on brine production are rare in relevant studies a relatively wide range of thickness contrast from 0 5 to 1 was utilized in this work the range of brine residual saturation and co2 end point relative permeability of dark section were considered from 0 95 and 0 1 base case respectively to the corresponding values of light section from fig 16 it is evident that higher permeability and porosity of dark sections result in more brine production whereas larger residual brine saturation thickness and co2 end point relative permeability led to a smaller brine production on the other hand the sensitive degree of those parameters on brine production shows that residual brine saturation and thickness exhibit significant effects on brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability on brine production is insignificant krevor et al 2011 experimentally proved that co2 can build up at the upstream of the capillary barrier llbl in this study and once in place the co2 at the upstream of capillary barrier cannot be fully displaced by brine during imbibition thus resulting in a substantial amount of co2 trapped within pore space in addition it is widely accepted that the initial co2 saturation at the end of drainage is positively correlated to the residual co2 saturation at the end of imbibition krevor et al 2012 akbarabadi and piri 2013 accordingly the results obtained in this section is of great significance to evaluate the co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity under complex geological characteristics in heterogeneous eolian sandstones during co2 geological storage for example the co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity differences between two positions in a reservoir which have distinct dip angles of llbl can be estimated based on the analyses carried out it is worth noting that the sensitivity analyses were conducted based on the single parameter variation while the rest parameters remained unchanged thus leading to uncertainty in the prediction to some degree however the purpose of this section aims at giving the qualitative understanding for the effects of these parameters on the brine displacement by co2 which is beneficial for engineers to have an initial evaluation regarding co2 brine multiphase flow properties for specific eolian sandstone sample 4 conclusions the experimental and modeling approaches followed here allowed us to draw the following conclusions 1 td nmr and micp measurements consistently show that the expected heterogeneity of sample a inferred from petrographical and visual analyses which includes inclined bedding structure is potentially more impactful on co2 brine multiphase flow transport in contrast with the so called massive sandstone sample b due to the apparent contrast in petrophysical properties 2 in agreement with our first conclusion the coreflooding experimental and simulation results reveal that the sub core scale laminated structures llbl are dominant in determining the co2 brine multiphase flow properties in core sample a the llbl acts as a capillary entry barrier and guides fluid flow at co2 brine front in contrast and in agreement with summarized findings the co2 brine multiphase flow exhibits homogeneous like state in massive sandstone b as a result the resulting relative permeability curves of the two core samples present obvious heterogeneity dependent behavior 3 the sub core scale heterogeneity present in sample and the connected more complex multiphase flow response introduce a complexity on co2 the effects derive from the observed co2 sweep efficiency in sample a in which the absolute permeability baffles barriers is smaller than those in sample b the consequence of the observed contrast leads to poor brine displacement by co2 in the sub core scale llbl of sample a thereby lowering the overall co2 final saturation in the sample 4 therefore evaluating the co2 injectivity based solely on the petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability could result in inadequately predicting the co2 migration behaviors in saline aquifers after determining the role of sub core scale llbl on co2 brine multiphase flow the effects of properties complexities of llbl on brine production and co2 front breakthrough were studied by sensitivity analyses which showed that the residual brine saturation and thickness of llbl exhibit significant effects on bulk brine production whereas the impact of co2 end point relative permeability of llbl on bulk brine production is negligible finally based on the comparisons between two models considering sub core scale relative permeability and core scale relative permeability respectively we can categorically state that sub core scale heterogeneity during co2 injection cannot be ignored in this portion of these sediments because it will create large uncertainties in storage and fluid flow overall the two core scale experimental and simulation studies yielded a quantitative analysis for the effects of two types of sub core scale heterogeneities in min ss on relative permeability curves revealing the variety of co2 brine multiphase flow behaviors in the same formation and the associated risks that can arise from poor formation characterization at these needed scales furthermore this study supports a better understanding of the co2 brine multiphase flow properties in heterogeneous sandstones and enables the evaluation of position dependent co2 sweep efficiency and trapping capacity during co2 injection in heterogeneous eolian sandstone reservoirs credit authorship contribution statement zuhao kou conceptualization data curation formal

constructive comments and suggestions from the editors and reviewers appendix a fig a1 a through a1 i show the cbp for different average permeability contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with increasing average permeability of dark sections see fig a1 a a1 d and a1 g the impact of average permeability of dark sections on brine production is less significant in hbl scrp than that of another two cases this is because for the case hbl scrp most co2 flow through the horizontal high permeability sub layers most produced brine originate from the light sections therefore the interactions between co2 and dark sections are not obvious in hbl scrp see fig a1 f fig a2 a through a2 i show the cbp for different average porosity contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with increasing average porosity of dark sections see fig a2 a a2 d and a2 g the effect of average porosity of dark sections on brine production is more obvious for ibl crp than that of another two cases this is mainly because for the case ibl crp dark sections have lower residual brine saturation higher initial co2 saturation compared to another two cases as the porosity of dark sections increases which means the larger pore volume can be expected more brine can be displaced by co2 than that of another two cases see fig a2 g fig a3 a through a3 f show the cbp for different dip angle of bedding layers of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and ibl crp from fig a3 a and a3 d it is evident that considering core scale relative permeability leads to higher brine production for vertical bedding layers than the one of ibl scrp this is caused by the identical relative permeability for two sections dark and light sections in ibl crp which denotes that the residual brine saturation of dark sections in ibl crp is higher than the one of ibl scrp this can also be confirmed by the results from fig a3 b and a3 e fig a4 a through a4 i show the cbp for different average thickness contrast considering three cases ibl scrp hbl scrp and ibl crp the cbp increases with decreasing average thickness of dark sections see fig a4 a a4 d and a4 g additionally the effects of average thickness contrast on brine production in hbl scrp is more significant than that of another two cases denoting that the brine production is relatively sensitive to the thickness variation of dark sections in hbl scrp fig a5 a through a5 f show the cbp for different residual brine saturation of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and hbl scrp from fig a5 it can be observed that the effect of different s rw on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections in ibl scrp is similar to the one in hbl scrp larger s rw of dark sections results in lower bulk brine production on the other hand for a specific s rw the ibl scrp leads to higher brine production than the one of hbl scrp due to the stronger interactions between co2 and dark sections in ibl scrp more co2 flow through dark sections fig a6 a through a6 f show the cbp for different co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections considering two cases ibl scrp and hbl scrp based on fig a6 it is not hard to conclude that the effects of different k rg on the bulk brine production brine production from dark sections and brine production from light sections all are negligible for the three cases accordingly the brine production is not sensitive to the variation of co2 end point relative permeability of dark sections 
4476,this paper describes the joint development of two different methods for temporal riveŕs runoff assessment this is performed through a hybrid approach by means of multivariate general linear

mainly aimed to empower the analysis of temporal hydrological records behaviour h cmlm has been successfully applied to three different spanish basins adaja mijares and porma which were chosen due to their disparate features results were divided in quantitative and qualitative numerical results show a very high level of equivalence between the average value of temporal dependence provided by mlm module and the continuous behaviour of temporal dependence computed by cr module and visualized through dependence mitigation graph dmg this high coherent outcome from both modules makes the analysis much more robust from a stochastic hydrology point of view values for average temporal dependence are very useful for the optimal dimensioning of hydraulic infrastructures like reservoirs furthermore given the annual scale of the analysis water planning and management of several water uses such as domestic water supply agriculture industrial demands among others can be highly assisted by this new h c mlm method keywords h cmlm method causal reasoning multivariate linear modelling runoff temporal dependence 1 introduction multivariate statistical methods have grown increasingly and have become popular in the last decade molina et al 2020 it is common to study the effect of changes in one or more variables on a measured response powerful multivariate statistical methods such as the traditional factorial analysis of variance fav analysis of covariance ancova multivariate analysis of variance manova or multivariate analysis of covariance mancova have been traditionally applied for decades hotelling 1931 wilks 1932 pillai and mijares 1959 huitema 2011 these techniques have evolved into hierarchical hybrid and multilevel models also general linear models have developed towards generalized linear models able to work with data heterogeneity van straaten et al 2019 in this context data tables from design of the experimental studies with multiple response variables are becoming more common in hydrology water resources hydrogeochemical groundwater studies among others busico et al 2020 carrasco et al 2019 tahroudi et al 2020 in hydrological terms variations in precipitation and runoff huang et al 2017 as well as water quality analysis gyimah et al 2020 carrasco et al 2019 are also some of the relevant research topics where these techniques have attracted attentions on the other side it should be noted that the inherent uncertainty of hydrological processes molina and zazo 2017 contribute to variability in the forecast berthet et al 2020 in this sense and according to verkade et al 2020 forecasting may reduce but cannot eliminate this uncertainty in addition hydrology inherently comprises many problems of prediction verkade et al 2020 which are due to the complex interactions between variables and processes molina et al 2016 such as annual changes seasonal and high or low runoff and associated uncertainty in sub basins of a river basin among others molina and zazo 2018 in this sense statistical methods contribute to a great extent to reduce uncertainty george et al 2016 it should be note that quantifying the uncertainty of predictions in hydrological forecasting is essential for decision making wani 2018 to address the challenge of river flow forecasting different approaches have been describes in the scientific literature salerno and tartari 2009 yilmaz and muttil 2014 according to yaseen et al 2015 yaseen et al 2020 there are mainly four basic approaches to accomplish runoff forecasting a the conceptual as hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms b stochastic such as autoregressive and autoregressive moving average ar and arma models c the physical based models as the deterministic swat soil and water assessment tool model and d data driven techniques under an artificial intelligence ai approaches the latter are more suitable for river flow forecasting than process based models in river basins with lack of enough hydrological data for validating and calibrating phases besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2015 2020 also belonging to data driven models multi linear regression mlr method has been traditionally applied to perform long term forecasts poul et al 2019 in this context the choice of a suitable model will depend on both the availability of data and the aims to be achieved salerno and tartari 2009 within the previous context time series modelling and the subsequent dynamic hydrological modelling become essential pillars in the field of stochastic hydrology gárfias soliz et al 2010 blöschl et al 2019 this research is carried out within the context of stochastic and ai data driven modelling in this sense stochastic hydrological models have been traditionally classified in parametric and nonparametric molina et al 2016 the parametric ones have been very well accepted burlando et al 1993 karthikeyan and kumar 2013 mohammadi et al 2006 salas 1993 of those the ar models are arguably the most widely used hipel and mcleod 1994 whilst the parsimonious moving average ma models are mainly used to account for very short run autocorrelation umunna and olanrewaju 2020 both ar and ma models can be coupled to form a general and useful type of time series models named arma models molina et al 2016 this approach may be applied successfully in the case of stationary data nourani et al 2011 molina et al 2016 salas et al 1980 however most natural series are non stationary hipel and mcleod 1994 in order to overcome this weakness arma models can be extended to non stationary series by means of differencing of data series in this case the model is named autoregressive integrated moving average arima models box and jenkins 1976 this is a forecasting method for univariate time series data in this respect arima models which are considered as a generalization of an arma models valipour et al 2013 add a part i that involving the first derivative of the time series in addition arima models have relevant advantages such as its forecasting capability its richer information on time related changes khan et al 2020 finally there are two relevant extensions of arima models these are the seasonal arima also known as sarima models and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima models sarima models explicitly models the seasonal element in univariate data for its part arfima models are appropriate for modeling long term dependence and has been widely applied in stochastic hydrology for several purposes including hydrological forecasting adhikari and agrawal 2013 regarding nonparametric models that no assumptions on the distribution of the variables to be forecasted are needed mcroberts 2012 k nearest neighbours knn method poul et al 2019 deserves special attention this is an easy simple model that can be applied for both single variable and multi variable predictions poul et al 2019 it is based on weighted average of the k nearest neighbours which applies the inverse of their distance mcroberts 2012 conceptually different from the previous models ai data driven models emerge it must be noted that classic stochastic modelling approaches do not always success on representing the dynamic nonlinearity for processes in hydrology nayak et al 2004 in contrast ai methodologies can model complex and highly nonlinear phenomena adequately poul et al 2019 under this distinctive characteristic some popular approaches based on machine learning ml methods are artificial neural networks ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines svm and causal reasoning cr among others to a complete review of ai techniques for stream flow forecasting the reader is referred to yaseen et al 2015 and molina et al 2020 in the last decades ml approach as data driven model yilmaz and muttil 2014 have also shown great attention in modeling and prediction of the hydrological processes yaseen et al 2019 this is mainly due to several factors such as 1 ml algorithms are able to detect the underlying interrelationships that govern interaction mechanisms 2 it is not necessary to know the interaction mechanisms in depth 3 lower data requirements than physics based models and 4 missing data management solution wang and yao 2013 wu and chau 2011 yaseen et al 2019 some relevant examples are shown in the exhaustive review in yaseen et al 2015 ann and anfis approaches have also been widely applied as ml methods in rainfall and runoffs forecasting research works ebrahimi and shourian 2020 el shafie et al 2007 firat and turan 2010 ghorbani et al 2016 2020 ramírez et al 2005 riad et al 2004 shu and ouarda 2008 it is well known that anns inspired by the performance of brain and nervous system are a robust tool of computing poul et al 2019 whilst anfis combines successfully the advantages of neural network and fuzzy inference in this sense anfis models is able to cope imprecision on inflow database by means of a set of linear functions which are obtained through a splitting of the input space into fuzzy subspaces yaseen et al 2015 recently in yaseen et al 2020 a new version of the ann model called extreme learning machine elm is shown as a robust predictive model indeed the application of elm to hydrology has opened a new research framework due to the river flow modelling process is enhanced yaseen et al 2019 also it is worth emphasising an alternative to neural networks algorithm which is as multivariate adaptive regression splines mars this is a flexibility nonparametric approach molina et al 2020 whose objective is to approximate the relationship between a set of input variables and dependent response and to mathematically interpret the relationship between the various parameters among the ai techniques it is worth mentioning causal reasoning cr methods with methodological approaches such as bayesian networks bns dynamic bayesian networks dbns and or object oriented bayesian networks oobns molina et al 2010 2013 2019 zazo et al 2020 furthermore these techniques belong to probabilistic graphical model are based on bayes theorem pearl 1988 2009 and display as significative characteristic their ability to express uncertainty in predictions in the last two decades bayesian approaches has been extensively used in hydrology bns can become decision support systems molina et al 2013 which are composed of three components which represent the hydrological variables hydrological links represent the relationships between the nodes and are represented with arrows that originate from the cause and end up with the effect and conditional probability tables cpts cain 2001 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 sperotto et al 2017 molina and zazo 2017 2018 macian sorribes et al 2020 causal inference with bayes rule allows quantifying the influence of time for each time step in run off series molina and zazo 2018 zazo et al 2020 dbn are an extension bn dean and kanazawa 1989 which extends the basic structure of the bayesian net to model dynamic processes considering the concept of time molina et al 2013 recently molina and zazo 2018 proposed a new method that represents an important advance over classic ones because of the discovery of conditioned runoff fractions this study describes the joint development of two different methods for temporal riveŕs runoff assessment this is performed through a hybrid approach by means of multivariate general linear models mglm inspired by mlr as a statistical method and causal reasoning cr as non linear ones this innovative methodological approach named hybrid causal multivariate linear modelling h cmlm is mainly aimed to empower the analysis of temporal hydrological records behaviour h cmlm has been successfully applied to three different spanish basins adaja mijares and porma which were chosen due to their disparate features this paper is organized as follows after this introductory section there is a description of applied methods in section 2 then section 3 describes case studies and section 4 is completely devoted to the description of applied methodologies section 5 presents the main experimental results drawn from the research lastly in section 6 the results are discussed in detail and the general conclusions from the study are addressed 2 methods 2 1 linear statistical modelling statistical methods are frequently used in hydrology to describe data as well as relationships between them the aim of empirical statistical modeling consists in finding the parsimonious description of the observable stochastic environments for that a mathematical equation is used to represent the hydrologic processes such as surface runoff patterns evaporation infiltration precipitation overland flow groundwater dynamics as well as the interaction between them these methods incorporate the systematic and the random behaviour of observed data these models have objectives such as estimating an equation for predicting the value of the response variable for a given set of the explanatory variables also they may be due to get to know the effect of changes in a set of variables whose cause is external to the model predictors x1 x2 xi on one or more dependent variable y in this sense the family of linear models offers a wide variety of models to answer these questions they use for that experimental datasets that can take different forms and can come from different sources this comprises different statistical methods according to the problem of interest once the model is determined it is then fitted to a group of data collected in keeping with a given experimental design finally the fitted model is employed to answer the interest queries in this setting the linear model family is truly the foremost used model as a result of its straightforward implementation and suppleness and its ability to include a mess of effects 2 1 1 general linear model the classical general linear model has been the most research settings cohen 1968 presented multiple linear regression mlr as the univariate general linear model this comprises just two variables and it is modelled as a linear relationship with an error term briefly general linear models glm analysis can be represented mathematically as y x β e where the dependent variable y can be described as a linear combination of independent variables xβ and errors e and both y and errors are normally distributed e n 0 σ2 and x is fixed and constant variance σ2 the glm comprises a highly flexible statistical procedure allowing to combine categorical and continuous variables which can be used for testing multiple hypotheses those represent a broad class of different statistical models that include linear regression anova for one dependent variable by one or more factors and or variables ancova with fixed effects only in these cases the glm may predict one response variable from one or more other predictors variables multivariate general linear models mglm are natural extension of univariate general linear models uglm of regressing statistical analysis model with p 1 response variables if p 1 the model is reduced to an univariate model this describes predictive relationships of multiple responses related on a set of regressors such as analysis of variance anova analysis of covariance ancova multivariate analysis of variance manova analysis of repeated measurements factor analysis models they have been widely used in engineering as it is shown in rovira et al 2012 and recently in li et al 2020 and park et al 2020 linear models can also be used to predict the change in more than one values in what is known as multivariate regression or manova this method is based on the general linear model and it deals with more than one dependent variable y1 y2 yi and one or more independent variables in which factors and covariates are assumed to have linear relationships to the dependent variables the multivariate linear model mlm is defined as y x b u this procedure assumes that all the model factors are fixed and provides regression analysis and analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables by one or more factor variables or covariates it involves analyses such as the manova and mancova which are the extended forms of the anova and the ancova and regression models for regression analysis the non dependent predictors are characterized as covariates all these procedures have many features in common with the one proposed by graham 2008 they assume that the distribution of the residuals follows a conditionally normal distribution consequently the reliability and applicability of these models is restricted for this reason and the mean and variance are independent of one another therefore the glm procedure statistical has five key assumptions linearity normality of the residuals equality of residual variances and fixed independent variables measured without error the generalized linear model gzlm is a generalization of the glm to non normal responses here the distribution of the residuals largely depends on the type and distribution of the outcome variable it allows to use a large variety of other distributions from the exponential family for the residuals such as poisson regression log linear models etc this method was introduced in the early 70 s nelder and wedderburn 1972 mccullagh and nelder 1989 and it has become one of the main methods for statistical analysis in multiple areas a generalized linear model is made up of a linear predictor y i β 0 β 1 x i β p e i where yi is the quantitative dependent response variable xi are independent variables β1 β2 βp are coefficients β0 is the intercept and ei is the error term gzlm can be also expressed as g y x i β e where g comprises a link function explaining the way the average depends on the linear predictor also comprises a variance function showing how the variance var yi depends on the mean therefore a glm specifies a non linear link function and variance function to allow while maintaining the simple interpretation of linear model gzlm procedure has been strongly developed for prediction in hydrology due to different advantages such as ease on computation of precipitation series at a daily scale george et al 2016 as well as on rainfall data modelling and simulation in general tosunoğlu and regional 2017 2 1 2 multiple linear regression mrl mlr is a statistical method that has been widely used in the field of hydrology mlr is a part of glm that is useful for determining whether one variable can be predicted from a combination of other variables this method only uses one dependent variable at a time when two or more explanatory variables have a linear relationship with the dependent variable the regression is called a multiple linear regression brook and arnold 2018 mlr has the general form y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β i x i e i where yi is the quantitative dependent response variable x1 x2 xi are independent variables β1 β2 βi are coefficients β0 is the intercept and ei is the error term the assumptions are the same as those for other methods in the glm the residuals should normally be distributed with homogeneity of variance and independent of one another in some hydrologic studies these assumptions are often violated because the residual errors of the transformed variables are probably not independent and normally distributed which can sometimes be redressed using data transformation or the durbin and watson statistic can be used to test for autocorrelation watson and durbin 1951 2 1 3 analysis of variance and analysis of covariance anova vs ancova anova is a statistical technique that has three or more levels for mean differences based on a continuous dependent variable it studies differences among various group means on a quantitative dependent variable one way anova compares levels of a single factor based on single continuous response variable while a two way anova compares levels of two or more factors for mean differences on a single continuous response variable ancova is an extension of anova it compares the adjusted mean scores of two or more independent groups anova and ancova analysis have been used in numerous hydrological studies to quantify the sources of uncertainty in an ensemble of hydrological climate impact projections aryal et al 2019 sensitivity analysis for water resource and environmental models wang et al 2020 to test for changes in the rainfall soil moisture relationship in the treated catchment page et al 2015 2 1 4 multivariate analysis of variance multivariate analysis of covariance manova vs mancova the manova in multivariate glm extends the ideas and methods of univariate by considering multiple continuous dependent variables the procedure groups these variables into a weighted linear combination a manova is a statistical technique for the simultaneous analysis of several response variables measured on individual members of several groups of subjects it is an extension of the anova that is an anova with two or more continuous response variables which tests for the difference in two or more vectors of means hair et al 1987 the main objective in using manova is to analyse if the dependent variables are altered by multiple levels of independent variables if multiple anova s were conducted independently might occur type i errors so it is more advantageous to use manova and this may reveal differences not found by anova tests mancova is an extension of analysis of covariance ancova cohen 2013 while a manova can include only factors mancova controls a variable called the covariate and one or more covariates are added to the mix the objective of mancova is to investigate whether the combination of dependent variables varies with respect to the independent variable the matrix of total variances and covariances are compared via multivariate f tests in order to determine any significant differences regarding all variables mancova and manova models have been used in several publications in the field of hydrology mcmanamay et al 2012 shukla and gedam 2019 vystavna et al 2020 and environmental sciences zheng et al 2018 2 2 causal reasoning cr comprises a stochastic method based on bayes theorem propagation along a bayesian network bn which is a direct acyclic graph molina et al 2016 zazo et al 2020 in this sense bns belong to probabilistic graphic models pearl 1988 2009 molina et al 2013 and they are extremely useful to define logical relationships among variables into complex system like natural one by means of the marginal probability assessment through causality molina and zazo 2018 on the other side cr based on bns presents several advantages into the framework in what this research is performed firstly relations and connections of complex models can be automatically identified and characterized molina et al 2010 this allows to quantify the variables relationship strength molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 which according to castilletti and soncini 2007 is formally expressed as p b a p a b p b p a where p b a is the conditional probability of b for a given state of variable a p b a the other way round conditional probability p b the probability of b and p a the probability of a secondly they enable a compact representation of the joint probability distribution over sets of random variables castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 said 2006 thirdly they compute inference omni directionally molina and zazo 2017 this property of bns is particularly suitable because if any observation is known from any of the nodes that compose network it is possible compute the posterior probabilities of all other nodes in the network regardless of arc direction through observational inference cain 2001 finally the inherent ability of bns to explicitly model uncertainty makes them suitable for temporal hydrological series analysis molina et al 2020 3 case studies this research has been applied to three different basins porma adaja and mijares which were chosen because of their temporal exemplary features all these case studies are defined by gauging stations which are located upstream of the first regulating reservoirs and therefore they comprise unregulated rivers stretches these gauging stations are 1 camposillo code number 2078 porma 2 adaja code number 2046 adaja and 3 el terde code number 8030 respectively fig 1 gauging runoff series were collected from the official database of duero and jucar spanish river managers miteco 2021 chj 2021 in all cases there are not missing data in the time series case studies porma and adaja belong to duero river basin the largest basin in the spain porma sub basin is located in the north and adaja sub basin in the south both cases are characterized by a cold mediterranean climate highly continental with moderately warm summers and severe winters in which the altitude conditions the temperature molina and zazo 2018 in contrast mijares case study situated in eastern spain belongs to jucar river basin the second largest basin on the mediterranean side of spain this area traditionally known as dry spain is characterized by regularly suffers noteworthy drought conditions molina et al 2019 4 methodology the general methodology of this research comprises four consecutive phases that are described as follows and it is shown in fig 2 data series from the three basins were primarily analyzed to prepare the dataset for the next phases each phase requires their own requirements that are explained in its corresponding section see fig 3 4 1 data analysis three separate data sources were used belonging to the annual runoff of porma adaja and mijares sub basins all temporal periods were long enough to be consistent and representative for the analysis in addition all of them are unrelated to each other therefore there are different time periods of analysis porma sub basin 1974 75 to 2010 11 adaja sub basins 1942 43 to 2011 12 and 1945 46 to 2013 14 in the case of mijares sub basin please note runoff time series in spain are referred according to water year where the first month is october and the last is september of following year furthermore given that this research implies a step forward over previous ones see molina and zazo 2018 molina et al 2019 table 1 summarize the main statistical parameters of the considered runoff time series 4 2 causal reasoning cr development there is a recent prosperous development of innovative methods based on ai molina et al 2016 this is opening new approaches to discover analyze and quantify the inherent temporal dependence behaviour of temporal records in hydrology also it contributes to reducing the fundamental uncertainty of hydrological processes kong et al 2017 causality addressed here from the perspective of cr is one of these new approaches this research comprises the utility of applying causality for analysing riverś runoff dynamics this has addressed through a hybrid approach between traditional and novel methodologies by means of an arma model a stochastic hydrological parametric model and bayesian causal modelling a powerful ai technique based on a probabilistic graphical model zazo 2017 molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 this novel approach was supported by software hugin researcher version 8 9 hugin 2021 the development of this causal model is articulated in four sequential steps first 200 series equiprobable to the historical runoff time series are generated by means of a parsimonious and unconditioned arma 1 1 model after that step 2 synthetic series are generated to feed cr through conditioned probabilistic analysis latter step is crucial for discovering analysing and quantifying the temporal dependence organization of these series this is done through the propagation of bayeś theorem throughout the network developing consecutive year by year temporal dependence evolution over the time throughout the network the indicator selected for measuring this process is called relative percentage of runoff change that delivers a dependence mitigation mathematical function for each water year in step 3 all mitigation curves are encompassed by means of a wraparound of dependence mitigation 0 w max and 0 w min w max and w min were subsequently adjusted to mathematical functions to conclude step 4 comprises the dependence dynamics showed in a graph which is named dependence mitigation graph dmg furthermore dmg symmetry asymmetric study becomes a continuous qualitative approach for evaluating the dynamics of time series dependence to a complete and detailed review of the mathematical principles and scientific background that support the methodological framework applied the reader is referred to molina et al 2016 molina and zazo 2017 molina and zazo 2018 molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 and macian sorribes et al 2020 4 3 multivariate general linear modelling mglm development mglm was written in matrix terms and the form was defined as y i x β 0 e where y is a n m matrix of dependent variables of n observations by p response variables β0 is a standardized regression coefficient x are the observed values of the predictor variable independent variable and e n m is a matrix of randomly distributed error terms the criterion of least squares is employed to select the estimates of the unknown values of β0 the least squares estimate for β0 is b x x 1 xý the response variables in y and the estimated errors of these multivariate models are assumed to be random variables with underlying multivariate probability distributions while the values of x and the coefficients in β are assumed to be fixed constants four multivariate test statistic were employed in this mglm analysis pillai s trace wilks the lawley hotelling trace t and roy s criteria θ 1957 to a complete discussion of these multivariate statistical tests it refers the reader to pillai 1955 wilks 1932 lawley 1938 and hotelling 1931 for comparing temporal dependence propagation for the period 1945 46 to 2013 2014 multivariate general linear models were conducted in which each period was covaried all period 1945 46 to 2013 2014 were used as dependent variables for each covariate assessment approach for covariates for each time period were adjusted sixty seventh models were run to look at the overall relationship between the outcome and the covariate assumptions of normality linearity outliers homogeneity of variance covariance matrices and multicollinearity were tested and no serious violations were observed pillai s trace statistic is presented as a comparison since it tends to be more conservative pillai and mijares 1959 all analyses for multivariate linear model development were carried out using the ibm spss statistics software version 25 0 0 ibm corporation armonk ny statistical significance was used by p 0 05 two tailed 4 4 h c mlm method development the new method is called hybrid causal multivariate linear modelling h c mlm this method comprises the integration and hybridization of two modules cr and mlm modelling for this variables considered for both developments are equivalent but they are treated from a different approach in this sense cr considers each variable as a probabilistic distribution while mlm comprises a pure deterministic management of them both modules are integrated in a final interface fig 4 that combines temporal dependence from both sides and compares the deviation that for the studies in hand it is very low the value of dependence obtained from mlm can be considered as an average of the continuous analysis made through cr 5 results main results are shown in fig 4 results are divided in two groups quantitative and qualitative regarding quantitative it is worthy to highlight that the numerical outcome from mlm analysis represent an average value of the temporal behaviour for all basins this value is represented as a vertical red dash line fig 4 in this sense for porma basin the average value of runoff temporal dependence basin memory delivered by mlm is 2 0 years for adaja basin is 0 8 years and for mijares basin is 3 5 years those values indicate a very high degree of equivalence with the average behavior for runoff temporal behaviour of these 3 basins developed by the cr side this cr development maybe seen as a continuous and stochastic analysis providing a particular dmg for each basin regarding qualitative geometrical analysis first a symmetry analysis was carried out on the dmgs fig 4 this was applied to according to three cases that present disparate temporal behavior in this sense mijares basin presents the highest dependence then porma basin present a medium dependency and adaja is the most hydrologically independent with the lowest value of dependence furthermore for all dmgs the r2 coefficients for wrap around max w max and wrap around min w min equations show very high values between 0 97 porma w max and 0 99 the asymmetry for dmg mijares is obvious showing a very low w min this demonstrates the clear and strong dependent behaviour however the total dependence temporal horizon tdth hardly reaches 7 years dmg for porma presents weak symmetrical behaviour where there is a clearly dominant w max and very low w min consequently there is a clear strong dependence propagation regarding the dmg slope behaviour two zones can be clearly characterized one zone between the temporal elapse time period 0 5 with a quick lowering major slope and the other area within elapse time period 5 13 with a much slower mitigation on the other hand dmg for adaja has a very high symmetry where w max and w min behaviours are opposite defining a seven years tdth two areas can be clearly identified as well first where a strongest slope takes place elapse time period 0 1 and second where the slowest dynamic dominates for the elapse time period 1 7 6 discussion and conclusions this research comprises the combination of cr and mlm techniques the final numerical outcome with such high level of similarity from both approaches makes the analysis much more robust from a stochastic hydrology point of view the value of dependence obtained from mlm is understood here as an average of the continuous analysis made through cr consequently the result provided by the h c mlm method is a combination of continuous and average behaviour of temporal runoff records for rivers that gives much more power to the computation as well as enrich the result because it is coming from different approaches regarding qualitative analysis for all basins it is important to highlight that the more dmg asymmetry occurs the more dependent behaviour is in contrast symmetry between w max and w min functions shows a non dependent behaviour these results especially the average temporal dependence value are very useful for the optimal dimensioning of hydraulic infrastructures like reservoirs furthermore given the temporal scale of the analysis 1 year water planning and management of several water uses such as domestic water supply agriculture and industrial demands etc can be highly assisted by this new h c mlm method furthermore this method can be embedded as a tool module for a wider decision support system aimed to reach a sustainable and efficient integrated management of water systems credit authorship contribution statement jose luis molina conceptualization formal

more common in hydrology water resources hydrogeochemical groundwater studies among others busico et al 2020 carrasco et al 2019 tahroudi et al 2020 in hydrological terms variations in precipitation and runoff huang et al 2017 as well as water quality analysis gyimah et al 2020 carrasco et al 2019 are also some of the relevant research topics where these techniques have attracted attentions on the other side it should be noted that the inherent uncertainty of hydrological processes molina and zazo 2017 contribute to variability in the forecast berthet et al 2020 in this sense and according to verkade et al 2020 forecasting may reduce but cannot eliminate this uncertainty in addition hydrology inherently comprises many problems of prediction verkade et al 2020 which are due to the complex interactions between variables and processes molina et al 2016 such as annual changes seasonal and high or low runoff and associated uncertainty in sub basins of a river basin among others molina and zazo 2018 in this sense statistical methods contribute to a great extent to reduce uncertainty george et al 2016 it should be note that quantifying the uncertainty of predictions in hydrological forecasting is essential for decision making wani 2018 to address the challenge of river flow forecasting different approaches have been describes in the scientific literature salerno and tartari 2009 yilmaz and muttil 2014 according to yaseen et al 2015 yaseen et al 2020 there are mainly four basic approaches to accomplish runoff forecasting a the conceptual as hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms b stochastic such as autoregressive and autoregressive moving average ar and arma models c the physical based models as the deterministic swat soil and water assessment tool model and d data driven techniques under an artificial intelligence ai approaches the latter are more suitable for river flow forecasting than process based models in river basins with lack of enough hydrological data for validating and calibrating phases besaw et al 2010 yaseen et al 2015 2020 also belonging to data driven models multi linear regression mlr method has been traditionally applied to perform long term forecasts poul et al 2019 in this context the choice of a suitable model will depend on both the availability of data and the aims to be achieved salerno and tartari 2009 within the previous context time series modelling and the subsequent dynamic hydrological modelling become essential pillars in the field of stochastic hydrology gárfias soliz et al 2010 blöschl et al 2019 this research is carried out within the context of stochastic and ai data driven modelling in this sense stochastic hydrological models have been traditionally classified in parametric and nonparametric molina et al 2016 the parametric ones have been very well accepted burlando et al 1993 karthikeyan and kumar 2013 mohammadi et al 2006 salas 1993 of those the ar models are arguably the most widely used hipel and mcleod 1994 whilst the parsimonious moving average ma models are mainly used to account for very short run autocorrelation umunna and olanrewaju 2020 both ar and ma models can be coupled to form a general and useful type of time series models named arma models molina et al 2016 this approach may be applied successfully in the case of stationary data nourani et al 2011 molina et al 2016 salas et al 1980 however most natural series are non stationary hipel and mcleod 1994 in order to overcome this weakness arma models can be extended to non stationary series by means of differencing of data series in this case the model is named autoregressive integrated moving average arima models box and jenkins 1976 this is a forecasting method for univariate time series data in this respect arima models which are considered as a generalization of an arma models valipour et al 2013 add a part i that involving the first derivative of the time series in addition arima models have relevant advantages such as its forecasting capability its richer information on time related changes khan et al 2020 finally there are two relevant extensions of arima models these are the seasonal arima also known as sarima models and autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average arfima models sarima models explicitly models the seasonal element in univariate data for its part arfima models are appropriate for modeling long term dependence and has been widely applied in stochastic hydrology for several purposes including hydrological forecasting adhikari and agrawal 2013 regarding nonparametric models that no assumptions on the distribution of the variables to be forecasted are needed mcroberts 2012 k nearest neighbours knn method poul et al 2019 deserves special attention this is an easy simple model that can be applied for both single variable and multi variable predictions poul et al 2019 it is based on weighted average of the k nearest neighbours which applies the inverse of their distance mcroberts 2012 conceptually different from the previous models ai data driven models emerge it must be noted that classic stochastic modelling approaches do not always success on representing the dynamic nonlinearity for processes in hydrology nayak et al 2004 in contrast ai methodologies can model complex and highly nonlinear phenomena adequately poul et al 2019 under this distinctive characteristic some popular approaches based on machine learning ml methods are artificial neural networks ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines svm and causal reasoning cr among others to a complete review of ai techniques for stream flow forecasting the reader is referred to yaseen et al 2015 and molina et al 2020 in the last decades ml approach as data driven model yilmaz and muttil 2014 have also shown great attention in modeling and prediction of the hydrological processes yaseen et al 2019 this is mainly due to several factors such as 1 ml algorithms are able to detect the underlying interrelationships that govern interaction mechanisms 2 it is not necessary to know the interaction mechanisms in depth 3 lower data requirements than physics based models and 4 missing data management solution wang and yao 2013 wu and chau 2011 yaseen et al 2019 some relevant examples are shown in the exhaustive review in yaseen et al 2015 ann and anfis approaches have also been widely applied as ml methods in rainfall and runoffs forecasting research works ebrahimi and shourian 2020 el shafie et al 2007 firat and turan 2010 ghorbani et al 2016 2020 ramírez et al 2005 riad et al 2004 shu and ouarda 2008 it is well known that anns inspired by the performance of brain and nervous system are a robust tool of computing poul et al 2019 whilst anfis combines successfully the advantages of neural network and fuzzy inference in this sense anfis models is able to cope imprecision on inflow database by means of a set of linear functions which are obtained through a splitting of the input space into fuzzy subspaces yaseen et al 2015 recently in yaseen et al 2020 a new version of the ann model called extreme learning machine elm is shown as a robust predictive model indeed the application of elm to hydrology has opened a new research framework due to the river flow modelling process is enhanced yaseen et al 2019 also it is worth emphasising an alternative to neural networks algorithm which is as multivariate adaptive regression splines mars this is a flexibility nonparametric approach molina et al 2020 whose objective is to approximate the relationship between a set of input variables and dependent response and to mathematically interpret the relationship between the various parameters among the ai techniques it is worth mentioning causal reasoning cr methods with methodological approaches such as bayesian networks bns dynamic bayesian networks dbns and or object oriented bayesian networks oobns molina et al 2010 2013 2019 zazo et al 2020 furthermore these techniques belong to probabilistic graphical model are based on bayes theorem pearl 1988 2009 and display as significative characteristic their ability to express uncertainty in predictions in the last two decades bayesian approaches has been extensively used in hydrology bns can become decision support systems molina et al 2013 which are composed of three components which represent the hydrological variables hydrological links represent the relationships between the nodes and are represented with arrows that originate from the cause and end up with the effect and conditional probability tables cpts cain 2001 castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 sperotto et al 2017 molina and zazo 2017 2018 macian sorribes et al 2020 causal inference with bayes rule allows quantifying the influence of time for each time step in run off series molina and zazo 2018 zazo et al 2020 dbn are an extension bn dean and kanazawa 1989 which extends the basic structure of the bayesian net to model dynamic processes considering the concept of time molina et al 2013 recently molina and zazo 2018 proposed a new method that represents an important advance over classic ones because of the discovery of conditioned runoff fractions this study describes the joint development of two different methods for temporal riveŕs runoff assessment this is performed through a hybrid approach by means of multivariate general linear models mglm inspired by mlr as a statistical method and causal reasoning cr as non linear ones this innovative methodological approach named hybrid causal multivariate linear modelling h cmlm is mainly aimed to empower the analysis of temporal hydrological records behaviour h cmlm has been successfully applied to three different spanish basins adaja mijares and porma which were chosen due to their disparate features this paper is organized as follows after this introductory section there is a description of applied methods in section 2 then section 3 describes case studies and section 4 is completely devoted to the description of applied methodologies section 5 presents the main experimental results drawn from the research lastly in section 6 the results are discussed in detail and the general conclusions from the study are addressed 2 methods 2 1 linear statistical modelling statistical methods are frequently used in hydrology to describe data as well as relationships between them the aim of empirical statistical modeling consists in finding the parsimonious description of the observable stochastic environments for that a mathematical equation is used to represent the hydrologic processes such as surface runoff patterns evaporation infiltration precipitation overland flow groundwater dynamics as well as the interaction between them these methods incorporate the systematic and the random behaviour of observed data these models have objectives such as estimating an equation for predicting the value of the response variable for a given set of the explanatory variables also they may be due to get to know the effect of changes in a set of variables whose cause is external to the model predictors x1 x2 xi on one or more dependent variable y in this sense the family of linear models offers a wide variety of models to answer these questions they use for that experimental datasets that can take different forms and can come from different sources this comprises different statistical methods according to the problem of interest once the model is determined it is then fitted to a group of data collected in keeping with a given experimental design finally the fitted model is employed to answer the interest queries in this setting the linear model family is truly the foremost used model as a result of its straightforward implementation and suppleness and its ability to include a mess of effects 2 1 1 general linear model the classical general linear model has been the most research settings cohen 1968 presented multiple linear regression mlr as the univariate general linear model this comprises just two variables and it is modelled as a linear relationship with an error term briefly general linear models glm analysis can be represented mathematically as y x β e where the dependent variable y can be described as a linear combination of independent variables xβ and errors e and both y and errors are normally distributed e n 0 σ2 and x is fixed and constant variance σ2 the glm comprises a highly flexible statistical procedure allowing to combine categorical and continuous variables which can be used for testing multiple hypotheses those represent a broad class of different statistical models that include linear regression anova for one dependent variable by one or more factors and or variables ancova with fixed effects only in these cases the glm may predict one response variable from one or more other predictors variables multivariate general linear models mglm are natural extension of univariate general linear models uglm of regressing statistical analysis model with p 1 response variables if p 1 the model is reduced to an univariate model this describes predictive relationships of multiple responses related on a set of regressors such as analysis of variance anova analysis of covariance ancova multivariate analysis of variance manova analysis of repeated measurements factor analysis models they have been widely used in engineering as it is shown in rovira et al 2012 and recently in li et al 2020 and park et al 2020 linear models can also be used to predict the change in more than one values in what is known as multivariate regression or manova this method is based on the general linear model and it deals with more than one dependent variable y1 y2 yi and one or more independent variables in which factors and covariates are assumed to have linear relationships to the dependent variables the multivariate linear model mlm is defined as y x b u this procedure assumes that all the model factors are fixed and provides regression analysis and analysis of variance for multiple dependent variables by one or more factor variables or covariates it involves analyses such as the manova and mancova which are the extended forms of the anova and the ancova and regression models for regression analysis the non dependent predictors are characterized as covariates all these procedures have many features in common with the one proposed by graham 2008 they assume that the distribution of the residuals follows a conditionally normal distribution consequently the reliability and applicability of these models is restricted for this reason and the mean and variance are independent of one another therefore the glm procedure statistical has five key assumptions linearity normality of the residuals equality of residual variances and fixed independent variables measured without error the generalized linear model gzlm is a generalization of the glm to non normal responses here the distribution of the residuals largely depends on the type and distribution of the outcome variable it allows to use a large variety of other distributions from the exponential family for the residuals such as poisson regression log linear models etc this method was introduced in the early 70 s nelder and wedderburn 1972 mccullagh and nelder 1989 and it has become one of the main methods for statistical analysis in multiple areas a generalized linear model is made up of a linear predictor y i β 0 β 1 x i β p e i where yi is the quantitative dependent response variable xi are independent variables β1 β2 βp are coefficients β0 is the intercept and ei is the error term gzlm can be also expressed as g y x i β e where g comprises a link function explaining the way the average depends on the linear predictor also comprises a variance function showing how the variance var yi depends on the mean therefore a glm specifies a non linear link function and variance function to allow while maintaining the simple interpretation of linear model gzlm procedure has been strongly developed for prediction in hydrology due to different advantages such as ease on computation of precipitation series at a daily scale george et al 2016 as well as on rainfall data modelling and simulation in general tosunoğlu and regional 2017 2 1 2 multiple linear regression mrl mlr is a statistical method that has been widely used in the field of hydrology mlr is a part of glm that is useful for determining whether one variable can be predicted from a combination of other variables this method only uses one dependent variable at a time when two or more explanatory variables have a linear relationship with the dependent variable the regression is called a multiple linear regression brook and arnold 2018 mlr has the general form y i β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β i x i e i where yi is the quantitative dependent response variable x1 x2 xi are independent variables β1 β2 βi are coefficients β0 is the intercept and ei is the error term the assumptions are the same as those for other methods in the glm the residuals should normally be distributed with homogeneity of variance and independent of one another in some hydrologic studies these assumptions are often violated because the residual errors of the transformed variables are probably not independent and normally distributed which can sometimes be redressed using data transformation or the durbin and watson statistic can be used to test for autocorrelation watson and durbin 1951 2 1 3 analysis of variance and analysis of covariance anova vs ancova anova is a statistical technique that has three or more levels for mean differences based on a continuous dependent variable it studies differences among various group means on a quantitative dependent variable one way anova compares levels of a single factor based on single continuous response variable while a two way anova compares levels of two or more factors for mean differences on a single continuous response variable ancova is an extension of anova it compares the adjusted mean scores of two or more independent groups anova and ancova analysis have been used in numerous hydrological studies to quantify the sources of uncertainty in an ensemble of hydrological climate impact projections aryal et al 2019 sensitivity analysis for water resource and environmental models wang et al 2020 to test for changes in the rainfall soil moisture relationship in the treated catchment page et al 2015 2 1 4 multivariate analysis of variance multivariate analysis of covariance manova vs mancova the manova in multivariate glm extends the ideas and methods of univariate by considering multiple continuous dependent variables the procedure groups these variables into a weighted linear combination a manova is a statistical technique for the simultaneous analysis of several response variables measured on individual members of several groups of subjects it is an extension of the anova that is an anova with two or more continuous response variables which tests for the difference in two or more vectors of means hair et al 1987 the main objective in using manova is to analyse if the dependent variables are altered by multiple levels of independent variables if multiple anova s were conducted independently might occur type i errors so it is more advantageous to use manova and this may reveal differences not found by anova tests mancova is an extension of analysis of covariance ancova cohen 2013 while a manova can include only factors mancova controls a variable called the covariate and one or more covariates are added to the mix the objective of mancova is to investigate whether the combination of dependent variables varies with respect to the independent variable the matrix of total variances and covariances are compared via multivariate f tests in order to determine any significant differences regarding all variables mancova and manova models have been used in several publications in the field of hydrology mcmanamay et al 2012 shukla and gedam 2019 vystavna et al 2020 and environmental sciences zheng et al 2018 2 2 causal reasoning cr comprises a stochastic method based on bayes theorem propagation along a bayesian network bn which is a direct acyclic graph molina et al 2016 zazo et al 2020 in this sense bns belong to probabilistic graphic models pearl 1988 2009 molina et al 2013 and they are extremely useful to define logical relationships among variables into complex system like natural one by means of the marginal probability assessment through causality molina and zazo 2018 on the other side cr based on bns presents several advantages into the framework in what this research is performed firstly relations and connections of complex models can be automatically identified and characterized molina et al 2010 this allows to quantify the variables relationship strength molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 which according to castilletti and soncini 2007 is formally expressed as p b a p a b p b p a where p b a is the conditional probability of b for a given state of variable a p b a the other way round conditional probability p b the probability of b and p a the probability of a secondly they enable a compact representation of the joint probability distribution over sets of random variables castelletti and soncini sessa 2007 said 2006 thirdly they compute inference omni directionally molina and zazo 2017 this property of bns is particularly suitable because if any observation is known from any of the nodes that compose network it is possible compute the posterior probabilities of all other nodes in the network regardless of arc direction through observational inference cain 2001 finally the inherent ability of bns to explicitly model uncertainty makes them suitable for temporal hydrological series analysis molina et al 2020 3 case studies this research has been applied to three different basins porma adaja and mijares which were chosen because of their temporal exemplary features all these case studies are defined by gauging stations which are located upstream of the first regulating reservoirs and therefore they comprise unregulated rivers stretches these gauging stations are 1 camposillo code number 2078 porma 2 adaja code number 2046 adaja and 3 el terde code number 8030 respectively fig 1 gauging runoff series were collected from the official database of duero and jucar spanish river managers miteco 2021 chj 2021 in all cases there are not missing data in the time series case studies porma and adaja belong to duero river basin the largest basin in the spain porma sub basin is located in the north and adaja sub basin in the south both cases are characterized by a cold mediterranean climate highly continental with moderately warm summers and severe winters in which the altitude conditions the temperature molina and zazo 2018 in contrast mijares case study situated in eastern spain belongs to jucar river basin the second largest basin on the mediterranean side of spain this area traditionally known as dry spain is characterized by regularly suffers noteworthy drought conditions molina et al 2019 4 methodology the general methodology of this research comprises four consecutive phases that are described as follows and it is shown in fig 2 data series from the three basins were primarily analyzed to prepare the dataset for the next phases each phase requires their own requirements that are explained in its corresponding section see fig 3 4 1 data analysis three separate data sources were used belonging to the annual runoff of porma adaja and mijares sub basins all temporal periods were long enough to be consistent and representative for the analysis in addition all of them are unrelated to each other therefore there are different time periods of analysis porma sub basin 1974 75 to 2010 11 adaja sub basins 1942 43 to 2011 12 and 1945 46 to 2013 14 in the case of mijares sub basin please note runoff time series in spain are referred according to water year where the first month is october and the last is september of following year furthermore given that this research implies a step forward over previous ones see molina and zazo 2018 molina et al 2019 table 1 summarize the main statistical parameters of the considered runoff time series 4 2 causal reasoning cr development there is a recent prosperous development of innovative methods based on ai molina et al 2016 this is opening new approaches to discover analyze and quantify the inherent temporal dependence behaviour of temporal records in hydrology also it contributes to reducing the fundamental uncertainty of hydrological processes kong et al 2017 causality addressed here from the perspective of cr is one of these new approaches this research comprises the utility of applying causality for analysing riverś runoff dynamics this has addressed through a hybrid approach between traditional and novel methodologies by means of an arma model a stochastic hydrological parametric model and bayesian causal modelling a powerful ai technique based on a probabilistic graphical model zazo 2017 molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 this novel approach was supported by software hugin researcher version 8 9 hugin 2021 the development of this causal model is articulated in four sequential steps first 200 series equiprobable to the historical runoff time series are generated by means of a parsimonious and unconditioned arma 1 1 model after that step 2 synthetic series are generated to feed cr through conditioned probabilistic analysis latter step is crucial for discovering analysing and quantifying the temporal dependence organization of these series this is done through the propagation of bayeś theorem throughout the network developing consecutive year by year temporal dependence evolution over the time throughout the network the indicator selected for measuring this process is called relative percentage of runoff change that delivers a dependence mitigation mathematical function for each water year in step 3 all mitigation curves are encompassed by means of a wraparound of dependence mitigation 0 w max and 0 w min w max and w min were subsequently adjusted to mathematical functions to conclude step 4 comprises the dependence dynamics showed in a graph which is named dependence mitigation graph dmg furthermore dmg symmetry asymmetric study becomes a continuous qualitative approach for evaluating the dynamics of time series dependence to a complete and detailed review of the mathematical principles and scientific background that support the methodological framework applied the reader is referred to molina et al 2016 molina and zazo 2017 molina and zazo 2018 molina et al 2019 zazo et al 2020 and macian sorribes et al 2020 4 3 multivariate general linear modelling mglm development mglm was written in matrix terms and the form was defined as y i x β 0 e where y is a n m matrix of dependent variables of n observations by p response variables β0 is a standardized regression coefficient x are the observed values of the predictor variable independent variable and e n m is a matrix of randomly distributed error terms the criterion of least squares is employed to select the estimates of the unknown values of β0 the least squares estimate for β0 is b x x 1 xý the response variables in y and the estimated errors of these multivariate models are assumed to be random variables with underlying multivariate probability distributions while the values of x and the coefficients in β are assumed to be fixed constants four multivariate test statistic were employed in this mglm analysis pillai s trace wilks the lawley hotelling trace t and roy s criteria θ 1957 to a complete discussion of these multivariate statistical tests it refers the reader to pillai 1955 wilks 1932 lawley 1938 and hotelling 1931 for comparing temporal dependence propagation for the period 1945 46 to 2013 2014 multivariate general linear models were conducted in which each period was covaried all period 1945 46 to 2013 2014 were used as dependent variables for each covariate assessment approach for covariates for each time period were adjusted sixty seventh models were run to look at the overall relationship between the outcome and the covariate assumptions of normality linearity outliers homogeneity of variance covariance matrices and multicollinearity were tested and no serious violations were observed pillai s trace statistic is presented as a comparison since it tends to be more conservative pillai and mijares 1959 all analyses for multivariate linear model development were carried out using the ibm spss statistics software version 25 0 0 ibm corporation armonk ny statistical significance was used by p 0 05 two tailed 4 4 h c mlm method development the new method is called hybrid causal multivariate linear modelling h c mlm this method comprises the integration and hybridization of two modules cr and mlm modelling for this variables considered for both developments are equivalent but they are treated from a different approach in this sense cr considers each variable as a probabilistic distribution while mlm comprises a pure deterministic management of them both modules are integrated in a final interface fig 4 that combines temporal dependence from both sides and compares the deviation that for the studies in hand it is very low the value of dependence obtained from mlm can be considered as an average of the continuous analysis made through cr 5 results main results are shown in fig 4 results are divided in two groups quantitative and qualitative regarding quantitative it is worthy to highlight that the numerical outcome from mlm analysis represent an average value of the temporal behaviour for all basins this value is represented as a vertical red dash line fig 4 in this sense for porma basin the average value of runoff temporal dependence basin memory delivered by mlm is 2 0 years for adaja basin is 0 8 years and for mijares basin is 3 5 years those values indicate a very high degree of equivalence with the average behavior for runoff temporal behaviour of these 3 basins developed by the cr side this cr development maybe seen as a continuous and stochastic analysis providing a particular dmg for each basin regarding qualitative geometrical analysis first a symmetry analysis was carried out on the dmgs fig 4 this was applied to according to three cases that present disparate temporal behavior in this sense mijares basin presents the highest dependence then porma basin present a medium dependency and adaja is the most hydrologically independent with the lowest value of dependence furthermore for all dmgs the r2 coefficients for wrap around max w max and wrap around min w min equations show very high values between 0 97 porma w max and 0 99 the asymmetry for dmg mijares is obvious showing a very low w min this demonstrates the clear and strong dependent behaviour however the total dependence temporal horizon tdth hardly reaches 7 years dmg for porma presents weak symmetrical behaviour where there is a clearly dominant w max and very low w min consequently there is a clear strong dependence propagation regarding the dmg slope behaviour two zones can be clearly characterized one zone between the temporal elapse time period 0 5 with a quick lowering major slope and the other area within elapse time period 5 13 with a much slower mitigation on the other hand dmg for adaja has a very high symmetry where w max and w min behaviours are opposite defining a seven years tdth two areas can be clearly identified as well first where a strongest slope takes place elapse time period 0 1 and second where the slowest dynamic dominates for the elapse time period 1 7 6 discussion and conclusions this research comprises the combination of cr and mlm techniques the final numerical outcome with such high level of similarity from both approaches makes the analysis much more robust from a stochastic hydrology point of view the value of dependence obtained from mlm is understood here as an average of the continuous analysis made through cr consequently the result provided by the h c mlm method is a combination of continuous and average behaviour of temporal runoff records for rivers that gives much more power to the computation as well as enrich the result because it is coming from different approaches regarding qualitative analysis for all basins it is important to highlight that the more dmg asymmetry occurs the more dependent behaviour is in contrast symmetry between w max and w min functions shows a non dependent behaviour these results especially the average temporal dependence value are very useful for the optimal dimensioning of hydraulic infrastructures like reservoirs furthermore given the temporal scale of the analysis 1 year water planning and management of several water uses such as domestic water supply agriculture and industrial demands etc can be highly assisted by this new h c mlm method furthermore this method can be embedded as a tool module for a wider decision support system aimed to reach a sustainable and efficient integrated management of water systems credit authorship contribution statement jose luis molina conceptualization formal

4477,this study evaluates four high resolution satellite precipitation products spps and gauge based precipitation gauge in a well performed j2000 hydrological model across the himalayan river basin originated from the tibetan plateau the four high resolution spps include tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b 42 trmm climate hazards group infrared precipitation version 2 chirps multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 1 mswep and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr two methods were deployed to evaluate hydrological response on a daily and monthly scale the first method method i consists of calibration based on gauge and re running the model for spps with gauge based calibration parameters whereas input specific calibration of spps was adopted in the second method method ii the model driven by trmm demonstrated superior result followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively both on the daily and monthly scale under method i comparing the performance metric with the method i the substantial improvement of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias error pbias were observed in mswep whereas improvement of pbias was found in persiann cdr for method ii in the context of method i mswep could not predict hydrological behavior properly in the himalayan river basin while it performed best in method ii on both a daily and monthly scale spps could be used in the future to predict hydrological responses in the himalayan river basin with the application of the hydrological model but it contains error and bias which should be concisely examined and corrected before practical application for planning and management of water resources project keywords satellite precipitation products j2000 model streamflow 1 introduction water resources planning and management wrpm have many challenges with sparse ground based observations sheffield et al 2018 mainly in the himalayas in the context of climate change however the recent advancement of satellite based information provides many opportunities to explore various weather forcing elements and plan the water resources management activities timely to mitigate likely harms from hydrometeorological hazards among different weather forcing elements precipitation is the most crucial input variable to force the hydrologic model pandey et al 2020a sirisena et al 2018 talchabhadel et al 2018 thapa et al 2017 2016 precise information on the spatio temporal distribution of such forcing elements is the primary concern for several researchers practitioners planners and implementers in this context it has high value to understand the hydrologic response or streamflow simulation considering different precipitation products as an input which is the critical parameter for the effective implementation of wrpm in the himalayan region like nepal the in situ gauge measurement of precipitation is too sparse which is not sufficient to capture and accurately represent the distribution of precipitation talchabhadel et al 2018 it is not adequate to rely only on the in situ observation with a sparse network for evaluating the hydrologic responses and implement several wrpm activities nowadays as an alternative input satellite based precipitation products spps are widely used as complementary information to the in situ measurement for streamflow simulations for a better understanding of the hydrologic response these products are available in different spatial and temporal scales in spatial global and regional varying from 0 1 0 1 to 1 1 and in temporal half hourly hourly daily and monthly in the last 30 years several spps are available employing different algorithms some are available at a higher resolution but with less accuracy whereas some are more accurate but the resolution is coarse there are several spps readily available to estimate the precipitation value by multi satellite approach some of them used in this study include i tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b 42 trmm ii climate hazards group infrared precipitation version 2 chirps iii multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 1 mswep and iv precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr the evaluation of the accuracy of those spps through validation is profound due to marked differences in spatio temporal precipitation patterns those validations can be done either by quantifying individual error designing a series of field experiments direct comparison of precipitation with in situ observation based on streamflow simulation s predictive ability in a hydrologic framework bitew and gebremichael 2011a evaluation of variability and accuracy of the precipitation products through streamflow simulation was found paramount among the rest of the two categories hence several studies carried out in this regard in the past decades over an extensive range of scales from small catchment to global scale wang et al 2020 many researchers have validated the different spps as well as in situ observation through investigating those products as an input on hydrologic modeling and simulations in nepal s himalayan region bajracharya et al 2017 ghaju and alfredsen 2012 talchabhadel et al

2017 karnali river basin krb has a limited number of in situ precipitation observation networks density of station is one station per 870 km2 due to topographic limitation cook et al 2003 karki et al 2016 khatiwada et al 2016 pandey et al 2020a the sparse hydrometeorological network shows the importance of the application of spps to characterize and understand the hydrologic response of the basin

assessment khatiwada et al 2016 to date there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the different precipitation products as an input forcing for the hydrologic simulation in the krb using different spps in this context the study s objective is to evaluate the several precipitation products varying from in situ observation to different high resolution spps using daily time series 2000 2015 for hydrologic simulation using spatially distributed hydrologic model j2000 this study will provide valuable information on the degree of estimation of simulation biases in each satellite product the study will also test the utilities for streamflow forecast at krb which could support formulating and implementing the different wrpm activities at the field level with sound understanding and appraisal of different spps in the himalayan region the study s novel contribution is to examine the applicability of high resolution spps in the himalayan river basin we simulated the hydrologic response and examined their simulation capabilities in different time scales daily and monthly for the first time using j2000 in the western himalayan river basin of nepal 2 study area karnali river basin krb is one of the significant river basins with a perennial source the basin is located in the western part of nepal between 28 33 n 30 45 n and 80 55 e 83 68 e shown in fig 1 the karnali river is the longest river in nepal with a length of 507 km as illustrated in fig 1 it is a transboundary river originating from the mount kailash region in china reaches plain near chisapani and flows through nepal joining the ghaghara river in india the area of interest for the current study is an upstream area of a hydrologic monitoring station located at chisapani shown in fig 1 the basin experiences a considerable range of elevation from 184 m in the lower southern part to 7664 m in higher himalayan with an area of 43 671 km2 upstream of the chisapani discharge station the climate varies from tropical in the south plains to polar at north himalayas across the study area and the dominant climate class is temperate karki et al 2016 about 93 40 of the basin is located in nepal while the rest lies in tibetan plateau china 6 60 territories krb is divided into eight types of land use and land cover class in which higher land is dominated by snow bare land glaciers and grasslands and the lower part by forest and agriculture lands the basin experience substantial spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and climatic characteristics pandey et al 2020a we obtained a soil map of 896 m 896 m resolution from fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 in which acrisol and cambisol are dominant in the region the basin s annual average precipitation during 2000 2015 is about 1200 mm dhm nepal the spatial distribution of precipitation varies significantly as tibetan and higher himalayan receive less than 300 mm precipitation in a year in contrast some mountainous areas receive over 2400 mm in a year dahal et al 2020 due to orographic relief palazzi et al 2013 precipitation pattern in krb is associated with south asian monsoon topography and the westerlies nayava 1980 shrestha 2000 the temporal distribution of precipitation shows that the basin receives the highest precipitation in july 290 40 mm and the least precipitation in november 12 51 mm mainly four climatological seasons i e pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november and winter december february exist in the region 3 data and methods 3 1 satellite based precipitation products spps four multi satellite based spps were selected namely trmm chirps mswep and persiann cdr with an identical spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of one day these products were chosen because they show consistency with the ground based precipitation in the mountain tibetan and himalayan regions still these products were not concisely examined in a well performed hydrologic model in the complex terrains high elevation and himalayan region of nepal alazzy et al 2017 andermann et al 2011 dahri et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 tong et al 2014 venkatesh et

al 2015 3 2 meteorological and hydrologic dataset in this study 50 ground based rainfall stations and one discharge station that lies in the near boundary within the boundary of this study area was selected and daily time series data of these stations from the period 2000 2015 were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal these stations were selected based on the

precipitation input data in the form of point value we developed a script using r3 5 1 to extract the multi point pixel value from spps in krb considering the x and y coordinate from above selected 50 ground based rainfall stations bai and liu 2018 sharma et al 2020 talchabhadel et al 2021 thiemig et al 2012 meteorological data such as wind temperature humidity and sunshine were obtained from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set accessed through link https globalweather tamu edu for the period from 2000 to 01 01 to 2014 07 31 forty two climate stations were selected that

from the global weather station networks and satellite based products consisting of historic expected precipitation and temperature for each hour at any global land position fuka et al 2014 saha et al 2010 since the hydrologic modeling simulation was employed for 2000 2015 the missing 7 88 of meteorological data after 2014 07 31 were filled by linear interpolation a script in r 3 5 1 was developed

hydrologic model component and regionalization for j2000 modeling is described in gao et al 2012 nepal 2012 nepal et al 2014 and krause 2002 the layout of the j2000 hydrologic model is shown in fig 2 parameters that are used in the hydrologic model are the key factor that influences the accuracy of model simulations muleta and nicklow 2005 past research revealed that intensive measurement of parameter value doesn t have the desired result kherde 2016 some of the model parameters are technically and economically not feasible practically for a vast area refsgaard 1997 therefore a sensitivity analysis was conducted to find the optimal parameter value adopting a suitable numerical algorithm that addresses uncertainties in the input variables and model parameters saltelli et al 2000 the model was calibrated to observed discharge recorded at the chisapani discharge station in the krb considering the calibration period from 2000 to 2010 during sensitivity analysis 39 model parameters were chosen to execute at the jams platform using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 nsga2 we selected modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mod nse a logarithm of nash sutcliffe efficiency lognse and percentage bias error pbias as an objective function deb et al 2002 krause et al 2005 random sampling was used to choose the appropriate value range of 39 parameters furthermore model parameter values were already evaluated in the himalayan river basin by nepal 2012 and nepal et al 2014 the values of these regional parameters were also considered while selecting the ranges of this study s parameters afterward monte carlo analysis mca was proceeded in an online jams cloud developed by friedrich schiller university of jena germany to produce 1500 simulations outputting different parameter combinations and model responses these parameter values are selected based on filtering the normalizing values of pbias 0 05 and lognse 0 25 of 1500 simulations and then choosing the lowest value of the normalizing value of the mod nse the most suitable values for these calibrated parameters are given in table 2 then 1500 simulation results were analyzed by regional sensitivity analysis rsa spear and hornberger 1980 to evaluate the impact of the parameter on the model output however calibration process have biases in using simple objective function huang et al 2020 jian et al 2017 selection of calibration parameters and methods finger et al 2015 hydrologic parameter uncertainty ficklin and barnhart 2014 and input data model parameters and initial conditions gupta et al 2012 3 4 model calibration and validation two different calibration methods were applied for simulating streamflow from selected four spps without bias correction in method i the model was calibrated with ground based precipitation data and re running the model with selected spps method ii involved the calibration of the model with each spp the calibration period is from 2000 to 2007 and the validation period is from 2008 to 2015 except for mswep where the validation period in both methods is 2008 to 2014 two different approaches based on the following principle were conveniently applied for the first method the common use of the model parameter for all the spps input gives a clear insight into the variation of discharge simulation in the second method i e calibration of the model with selected spps provides a detailed visualization of the effect of different spps on both model calibration and subsequent streamflow simulations at the validation period bitew and gebremichael 2011a 3 5 standard verification of simulated discharge the evaluation of hydrologic model behavior and performance is done by simulated and observed variables the most commonly used objective functions for hydrologic simulations kralisch et al 2005 the main objective to evaluate in the hydrologic model is i to estimate and predict the historical and future hydrologic behavior ii further improvement of a model in terms of adjustment of the model parameter structure this research aims to compare the simulation result obtained by different spps by employing appropriate performance indicators the following statistical performance coefficient of determination r2 nse mod nse pbias were calculated for the evaluation of discharge simulation the equations are listed as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 2 n s e 1 o i p i 2 o i o 2 3 m o d n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i o j w i t h j 1 4 p b i a s p i o i o i 100 where n is the number of observations oi and pi are the observed and the corresponding satellite precipitation values at day i respectively o and p are the arithmetic mean of the observations and satellite estimates respectively r2 eq 1 measures how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model steel and torrie 1960 the r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 indicates the prediction s dispersion is equal to that of the observation product the major limitation of r2 is that if for example the model systematically over or under estimates the observations the r2 could be close to 1 even though the prediction is false krause et al 2005 nse eq 2 with a higher value indicates that the model predicts a more accurate discharge simulation the value ranges from to 1 where 1 value is a perfect fit nse value equal to 0 means that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data and an nse value less than 0 represents the observed mean as a better predictor than a model it does not respond well to systematic error because of underprediction during low flow season to overcome such a limitation mod nse eq 3 is used to respond to low seasonal flow legates and mccabe 1999 pushpalatha et al 2012 where the difference between the observed and the predicted values are not squared but their absolute values are applied the pbias eq 4 measures the percentage bias error which shows that the precipitation product results in overestimating or underestimating the flow observation a positive value indicates an overestimation of discharge value and vice versa as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 we have followed the rules to rank the model performance as very good 0 75 nse 1 good 0 65 nse 0 75 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory nse 0 5 the methodological framework of this research is illustrated in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrometerological characteristic of krb fig 4 shows the average monthly rainfall gauge and satellite based and observed runoff in krb in general all products revealed a similar intra annual variability meaning they captured seasonality however there is a noticeable variation in the magnitude of rainfall when compared with ground based rainfall amounts as the country has summer monsoon dominated rainfall from the moisture from the bay of bengal nepal s eastern region has a higher monsoon contribution than its western region talchabhadel et al 2018 approximately 70 74 of the annual precipitation falls in monsoon june september which is slightly less than country averaged monsoon contribution 80 shrestha 2000 and less than 12 between november and february the mswep overestimated the precipitation value throughout the year as compared to gauge based rainfall gauge chirps and persiann cdr overestimated the gauge precipitation in the winter season december february and underestimated it during other seasons however trmm showed the precipitation estimation nearly the same as a gauge whose seasonal variation is only between 0 02 mm and 0 12 mm because monthly gauge adjustments are included in the trmm 3b42 estimates huffman et al 2007 considering the yearly average precipitation gauge chirps and trmm showed nearly identical precipitation values of 1239 mm 1239 mm and 1224 mm respectively in the view of cumulative distribution analysis of average daily precipitation of basin as shown in fig 5 chirps showed the highest non precipitation days 36 2 followed by persiann cdr 12 2 trmm 3 1 gauge 2 2 and mswep 0 82 respectively during the period 2000 2015 the possible reason behind the highest non detection of rainfall events of chirps because the cloud tops may have a higher temperature value than the infrared precipitation irp cold cloud density threshold value i e 235 k dinku et al 2018 fig 6 a shows the observed discharge histogram which depicts that discharge range from 300 500 m3 s is dominant in the region which accounts for 25 67 and high flow discharge between 8000 18000 m3 s contributes only 0 38 of the total period as depicted in fig 6 b the mean annual observed discharge shows that discharge decreases at an annual rate of 14 67 m3 s along with higher inter annual variation discharge from 1095 m3 s to 1795 m3 s during 2000 2015 moreover there is higher seasonal variability of discharge which fluctuates from 453 m3 s in dry months november may to 2644 m3 s in wet months june october the flow duration curve fdc in fig 6 c shows that discharge of 100 m3 s has almost 100 probability exceedance 99 98 to be exact and discharge of 500 m3 s has a 60 probability exceedance in krb the river discharges at different probability exceedance are essential factors guiding the planning design installation and operation of various water sector projects like hydropower plants irrigation facilities or water supply projects 4 2 hydrologic performance of different precipitation products the hydrologic model is an efficient technique for understanding the watershed s hydrologic characteristics and performing various what if scenario analyses the model can also be used to evaluate the performance of different precipitation inputs the sparse gauge network and its interpolation cannot correctly represent the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics at the watershed scale liu et al 2017 and simulate the river discharge another popular way is to assess river discharge using different satellite based products however precipitation input errors can cause significant uncertainties in streamflow simulation and prediction ebert et al 2007 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 in this section the impacts of different precipitation products in hydrologic applications were tested at the outlet of krb as previously mentioned two methods were employed and the evaluation and comparison of streamflow simulations were carried out at daily and monthly scales 4 2 1 performance based under method i 4 2 1 1 comparison at a daily scale in the method i the model was calibrated based on gauge precipitation and the model was forced with selected spps fig 7 exhibits daily observed discharge and simulated discharge driven by gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm for krb during the calibration period 2000 2007 and validation period 2008 2015 respectively the results indicate that gauge chirps and trmm successfully stimulated the model to reproduce the discharge simulation the trend of rising and falling simulated discharge processes is in good agreement with the observed discharge overall both high and low flows are also equally mimicked by the model and the average flows for all rainfall products however few noticeable fluctuations could be seen in different years for instance significant underestimation for persiann cdr during 2008 slight underestimation for trmm during 2008 slight overestimation for chirps during 2011 considerable overestimation for mswep during 2010 2011 and so on table 3 exhibits the statistical performance of discharge simulation under a method i and b method ii on a daily scale based on the model performance categories proposed by moriasi et al 2007 gauge chirps and trmm attained an outstanding performance for both the calibration and validation periods except for the chirps nse 0 71 in the validation period gauge achieved the highest nse 0 92 for calibration and 0 87 for validation values and similar results were obtained compared to a major watershed basin in nepal as depicted in table 5 j2000 performed superiorly in nepal s major watershed basins in predicting hydrologic behavior as illustrated in table 5 it reveals that j2000 parameters could be transferred to the himalayan region with similar physiographic landscape characteristics nepal 2016 nepal et al 2017b for evaluation of snow and glacier melt contribution to water balance the gr4jsg model might be a better option due to a provision of the glacial store in that model and able to evaluate the parameter that controls snow and glacial stores which can be interlinked with existing parameters of gr4j however it has limitations in sensitivity to initial conditions slow trends in the internal states highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature input data nepal et al 2017a moreover table 5 shows the inconsistency in pbias during the calibration and validation stage this inconsistency is due to other selection criteria objective function during model calibration pellicciotti et al 2012 input data and model structure uncertainty renard et al 2010 internal inconsistencies between models penton et al 2016 length of calibration and validation period liu et al 2017 and uncertainty in discharge measurement during flood period kattelmann 1987 the simulated streamflow of mswep had the lowest nse 0 48 for calibration and 0 51 for validation value and the highest pbias error 34 28 for calibration and 42 42 validation overestimated the discharge simulation at all period the reason might be bias and error in the mswep as the hydrologic process is non linear any positive negative precipitation input bias can be transformed into a more considerable positive negative bias in the simulated streamflow su et al 2008 trmm performed best in terms of pbias 2 28 for calibration and 1 53 for validation considering the nse indicator persiann cdr performed well during calibration 0 74 and satisfactorily during validation 0 54 period and underestimated flow simulation in both calibration and validation moriasi et al 2007 fig 9 shows the scatter plot of daily observed and simulated discharge at the outlet of chisapani station fig 9 a b e exhibit that the model predicts well with the hydrologic cycle in both the calibration and validation periods and show the fair distribution of points around the diagonal of a plot which is assured by the regression slope rs of gauge 0 83 chirps 0 82 and trmm 0 86 respectively but the model doesn t predict well for persiann cdr rs 0 51 and mswep rs 1 3 as depicted in fig 9 d and c respectively the analysis indicates that the model showed good agreement in low flow rather than high flows if the objective was to examine high flow events in that case it is suggested to use the hydrologic model that captures such high flow events such as sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma and génie ruralà 4 paramètres journalier gr4j perrin et al 2003 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 or improving in the biases of spps by employing appropriate methods to improve the prediction of high flow in the hydrologic model bourgin et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 4 2 1 2 comparison at monthly scale fig s1 in the supplement section shows monthly observed and simulated discharge of gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm in krb under method i as shown in table 4 a gauge chirps and trmm performed very well whose nse values are above or equal to 0 90 in calibration and validation as compared to the daily time scale the monthly simulation performance increased substantially for example at the watershed scale during the validation period nse for chirps rose from 0 71 on a daily scale to 0 90 on a monthly scale in contrast nse increased from 0 54 to 0 64 for persiann cdr and from 0 51 to 0 59 for mswep however the pbias showed consistency in both the time scale the scatter plots of the monthly simulated discharge as shown in fig s3 indicate the distribution of point along diagonal lines whose rs is greater than 0 90 and less than 1 for gauge chirps and trmm while persiann cdr exhibited more distribution of points below the diagonal line means an underestimation of discharge simulation pbias 19 30 for calibration and 23 30 for validation and mswep depicted more distribution of points above diagonal line resulting in an overestimation of discharge simulation such a result of persiann cdr was in line with finding by miao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 and sirisena et al 2018 furthermore various studies described significant underestimation in persiann cdr at high elevations bitew and gebremichael 2011a hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 the underestimation by the spp may be linked with shallow convective systems in the high altitude areas where there is not much ice height for the microwave sensors to detect nesbitt et al 2008 and infrared sensors have difficulty in ascertaining light rain events bitew and gebremichael 2010 hong et al 2007 by referring to performance indicators after gauge trmm proved to be the best product for flow simulation during wet and dry periods at daily and monthly time series followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively the best performance is due to gauge correction is used for trmm estimate enhancing the quality of the product leading to minimization of bias during flow simulation over the mountainous area pan et al 2010 however trmm still consists of bias which can be corrected by improvement in the satellite orbits and sensor drift brown et al 2009 fisher and wolff 2011 as well as time dependence was noticed by krakauer et al 2013 in the evaluation of trmm bias precipitation in nepal which can be mitigated by an improvement in the estimation of the algorithm 4 2 2 performance based under method ii 4 2 2 1 comparison at a daily scale in this section we compare and evaluate the performance of the j2000 model that individual spp calibrated the scatter plot as shown in fig 10 reveals consistent rs for the chirps and trmm whereas the rs gets changed for persiann cdr 0 51 to 0 61 and mswep 1 3 to 0 86 and predict the simulated discharge reasonably the agreement shows the model executes well comparatively to method i the scatter plot of spps underestimated the observed discharge value except for chirps a similar outcome of a slight underestimation of trmm was also observed by ghaju and alfredsen 2012 islam 2009 and kumar and lakshmi 2018 for nepal due to low convective precipitation over high altitudes kumar et al 2016 shrestha et al 2012 fig 8 shows the plots of daily observed and simulated discharge of spps during the calibration and validation period as compared to the method i the hydrologic behavior of all the products is improved and the simulation curves match the observed discharge various studies jiang et al 2012 stisen and sandholt 2010 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2019 xue et al 2013 concluded that the efficiency of hydrologic simulation gets improved by input specific recalibration as summarized in tables 3 and 4 there is a moderate decline of all the metrics in the validation period compared to the calibration period for all spps in both methods this reason might be an error in the record of observed discharge dhami et al 2018 the nse of chirps increased from 0 77 to 0 83 for calibration and 0 71 to 0 74 for validation persiann cdr increased from 0 74 to 0 80 for calibration and 0 54 to 0 63 for validation and trmm increased from 0 85 to 0 88 for calibration and 0 77 to 0 78 for validation increased slightly surprisingly nse for mswep increased significantly from 0 48 to 0 87 at calibration and 0 51 to 0 82 at the validation period regarding the pbias the error decreased considerably for mswep 34 28 to 3 74 for calibration and 42 42 to 1 77 for validation and persiann cdr 19 39 to 0 61 for calibration and 23 47 to 2 12 for validation such agreement occurs due to a change in model parameter value as shown in table 2 however this change in parameter value may not represent the real field condition such as groundwater recharge interflow base flow snow accumulation glacier ice melt etc bitew et al 2012 liu et al 2017 as mod nse is more sensitive to the low flow period and the values are in the range of 0 66 to 0 76 in calibration and 0 54 to 0 73 in the validation period the r2 value is quite consistent in the result compared to the method i and the outcome of spps didn t vary much from others so r2 doesn t appear to be a good metric to examine the validity of spps senent aparicio et al 2018 regarding the goodness of fit tests in reality when using a graphical plot and another indicator the performance of spps is distinct 4 2 2 2 comparison at monthly scale fig s2 represents the monthly observed and simulated discharge at the study area under method ii the model predicts fairly both in the dry period and wet flow period all spps have an nse value greater than equal to 0 90 except persiann cdr nse 0 75 in the validation period and mod nse value greater than equal to 0 75 except chirps nse 0 74 in validation period comparing the monthly simulation with the method i the much improvement of nse and mod nse was noticed in mswep comparing the performance of chirps with persiann cdr in both methods chirps performed superiorly tuo et al 2016 recommended chirps data as the best choice for data scarce alpine regions they can be used for long term precipitation analyses with relatively higher confidence in a monsoon dominated region prakash 2019 however there are some limitations and uncertainties corrected persiann cdr data provides valuable information for hydrologic simulation in remote and high altitude areas faridzad et al 2018 method ii gives clear insight that mswep is the best product for flow simulation on daily as well as monthly timescales followed by trmm chirps and persiann cdr respectively such a similar higher performance of mswep was seen in a monsoon dominated mekong river basin tang et al 2019 while it exhibits inconsistent performance in peninsular spain senent aparicio et al 2018 moreover satellite precipitation algorithms can be divided into two categories based on the primary input used primarily mw data e g trmm mswep or those that use mainly ir data e g chirps persiann cdr bitew and gebremichael 2011b this study reveals that mw based precipitation performs better than ir based precipitation however mw based challenges over mountain regions because of very cold surfaces and ice over mountain tops which could confuse precipitation dinku et al 2008 4 3 sensitivity within the model sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of single parameters on the model result by a change in model parameter values the main concept is to categorize the different model samples into the behavioral and non behavioral populations and compare their distribution functions in the objective function krause et al 2009 fig 11 a e represents rsa of the highly sensitive parameter in gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm respectively the blue lines represent the cumulative distribution function of the behavioral parameter set and the red lines show the non behavior set the cumulative frequency of distribution was evaluated and plotted based on each parameter s likelihood normalization during the simulations wagener et al 2001 and fischer et al 2012 reveal that if the model performance is sufficiently sensitive to a specific parameter there will be a more considerable variation between the cumulative frequency distributions the rsa evaluated the parameter effect on model result and efficiency in the j2000 model based on mod nse criteria table s1 exhibits the sensitivity of parameters based on mod nse evaluation criteria in gauge and selected spps fcadaptation soil module soillatvertlps and soilconcrd1floodthresold are the most top three sensitive parameters in gauge impacting 10 8 6 7 and 4 9 respectively on the variation of model output as compared with rsa of gauge in dudhkoshi basin parameters such as soillatvertlps latvertdistlps and soilconcrd1 are the most sensitive nepal et al 2014 whereas soillatvertlps is examined as the most sensitive in tamor basin nepal et al 2017b based on nse criteria these variations in the most sensitive parameter are observed due to selecting the different objective functions in rsa analysis the range of parameter values defined the number of parameters selected and the number of simulation runs during model calibration the basin s geophysical and hydrologic characteristics such as shape size slope precipitation inputs soil type etc determine the parameters sensitivity nepal et al 2017b similarly snow trans 11 3 kice 5 7 and soilconcrd1 5 are most sensitive parameter for chirps the evaluation in mswep indicates that alphaice 11 1 fcadaptation 5 78 and gwcaprise 4 77 are the most sensitive parameter during discharge simulation looking towards the assessment for persiann cdr snow module parameter ddfic 19 93 is a highly sensitive parameter furthermore the precipitation distribution module snow trans snow trs and soil module soilconcrd1 are highly sensitive parameters in trmm hence sensitivity analysis determines the impact and influence of the parameters in model results and efficiency this study supports the use of satellite based rainfall products for hydrologic modeling both the methods used in this study can be applied in other regions for evaluating their performance however if there are high discrepancies in simulated discharge while using the method i the input satellite based products should be corrected using some bias correction techniques because in the method i we fix all parameters based on gauge precipitation and while implementing method ii since the parameters are calibrated using satellite based products we need to select the upper and lower threshold of some physical based parameters these parameters need to be within physically allowable limits our future work would be to use all grids of satellite based products instead of using around the gauge locations and also to calibrate and validate at multiple hydrologic stations to apply some intervention analysis on a watershed scale 5 conclusion the mountainous region of nepal has limited numbers or sparse and uneven distribution of ground based precipitation observations bajracharya et al 2014 subba et al 2019 and the network cannot represent the spatial distribution of precipitation andermann et al 2011 which leads to challenges in water resource assessment and development as compared to ground based precipitation networks the main benefit of spp is the wide global coverage and high spatial resolution spp should be comprehensively and concisely evaluated before the practical application and integration we used several spps and gauge based rainfall observations we forced them into a well performed j2000 hydrologic model in the himalayan basin nepal 2016 2012 to examine daily monthly and seasonal behavior across krb and assess performance of selected spps the main findings drawn in the study are listed below 1 the simulated streamflow derived from trmm performed best after gauge under the method i followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively both on a daily and monthly scale slight overestimation with the least pbias error was noticed in trmm while the highest underestimation and overestimation were observed in persiann cdr and mswep respectively 2 the performance metrics of spps were improved by input specific calibration result in differing model parameter values for each product however it might not represent the real field condition such as interflow snow and glacier melt snow accumulation recharge of groundwater etc this study highlighted that calibration based on spps depicted better results than calibration based on ground based precipitation when forcing spps into the j2000 model in the method ii mswep performed best with slight underestimation in calibration and slight overestimation in the validation period on both a daily and monthly time scale chirps showed underestimation in calibration and overestimation in validation while persiann cdr depicts underestimation in calibration and validation for both methods this study focused on evaluating selected spps based on the location of the existing 50 ground based rainfall stations the outcome of the spps may be different if we consider the centroid of each pixel as rainfall stations and recommended such a study in the future to assess the accuracy of the higher temporal and spatial resolution of spp in the data scare region our research shows a higher performance of spps in the hydrologic model although it has bias problems ciabatta et al 2016 villarini et al 2008 xie et al 2002 after correcting the spp bias it may be useful for water resource assessment in ungauged or poorly gauged basins credit authorship contribution statement rajesh khatakho conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation data curation writing

4477,this study evaluates four high resolution satellite precipitation products spps and gauge based precipitation gauge in a well performed j2000 hydrological model across the himalayan river basin originated from the tibetan plateau the four high resolution spps include tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b 42 trmm climate hazards group infrared precipitation version 2 chirps multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 1 mswep and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr two methods were deployed to evaluate hydrological response on a daily and monthly scale the first method method i consists of calibration based on gauge and re running the model for spps with gauge based calibration parameters whereas input specific calibration of spps was adopted in the second method method ii the model driven by trmm demonstrated superior result followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively both on the daily and monthly scale under method i comparing the performance metric with the method i the substantial improvement of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percentage bias error pbias were observed in mswep whereas improvement of pbias was found in persiann cdr for method ii in the context of method i mswep could not predict hydrological behavior properly in the himalayan river basin while it performed best in method ii on both a daily and monthly scale spps could be used in the future to predict hydrological responses in the himalayan river basin with the application of the hydrological model but it contains error and bias which should be concisely examined and corrected before practical application for planning and management of water resources project keywords satellite precipitation products j2000 model streamflow 1 introduction water resources planning and management wrpm have many challenges with sparse ground based observations sheffield et al 2018 mainly in the himalayas in the context of climate change however the recent advancement of satellite based information provides many opportunities to explore various weather forcing elements and plan the water resources management activities timely to mitigate likely harms from hydrometeorological hazards among different weather forcing elements precipitation is the most crucial input variable to force the hydrologic model pandey et al 2020a sirisena et al 2018 talchabhadel et al 2018 thapa et al 2017 2016 precise information on the spatio temporal distribution of such forcing elements is the primary concern for several researchers practitioners planners and implementers in this context it has high value to understand the hydrologic response or streamflow simulation considering different precipitation products as an input which is the critical parameter for the effective implementation of wrpm in the himalayan region like nepal the in situ gauge measurement of precipitation is too sparse which is not sufficient to capture and accurately represent the distribution of precipitation talchabhadel et al 2018 it is not adequate to rely only on the in situ observation with a sparse network for evaluating the hydrologic responses and implement several wrpm activities nowadays as an alternative input satellite based precipitation products spps are widely used as complementary information to the in situ measurement for streamflow simulations for a better understanding of the hydrologic response these products are available in different spatial and temporal scales in spatial global and regional varying from 0 1 0 1 to 1 1 and in temporal half hourly hourly daily and monthly in the last 30 years several spps are available employing different algorithms some are available at a higher resolution but with less accuracy whereas some are more accurate but the resolution is coarse there are several spps readily available to estimate the precipitation value by multi satellite approach some of them used in this study include i tropical rainfall measuring mission 3b 42 trmm ii climate hazards group infrared precipitation version 2 chirps iii multi source weighted ensemble precipitation version 1 mswep and iv precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr the evaluation of the accuracy of those spps through validation is profound due to marked differences in spatio temporal precipitation patterns those validations can be done either by quantifying individual error designing a series of field experiments direct comparison of precipitation with in situ observation based on streamflow simulation s predictive ability in a hydrologic framework bitew and gebremichael 2011a evaluation of variability and accuracy of the precipitation products through streamflow simulation was found paramount among the rest of the two categories hence several studies carried out in this regard in the past decades over an extensive range of scales from small catchment to global scale wang et al 2020 many researchers have validated the different spps as well as in situ observation through investigating those products as an input on hydrologic modeling and simulations in nepal s himalayan region bajracharya et al 2017 ghaju and alfredsen 2012 talchabhadel et al 2021 and other parts of the world alazzy et al 2017 bitew and gebremichael 2011a luo et al 2019 ma et al 2018 sirisena et al 2018 stisen and sandholt 2010 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 karnali river basin krb has a limited number of in situ precipitation observation networks density of station is one station per 870 km2 due to topographic limitation cook et al 2003 karki et al 2016 khatiwada et al 2016 pandey et al 2020a the sparse hydrometeorological network shows the importance of the application of spps to characterize and understand the hydrologic response of the basin and evaluate those products themselves krb is a highly heterogonous and important river basin having several important water resources projects in hydropower irrigation and multi purposes aspects pandey et al 2020b 2020a krb is one of the highly vulnerable basins due to climate change dahal et al 2020 khatiwada et al 2016 pandey et al 2020b variability of water availability affects several nationally important projects such as the rani jamara kuleriya irrigation project west seti high dam hydroelectric project upper karnali hydroelectric project bheri babai multipurpose diversion project etc located in the study area many studies have been conducted focusing on different aspects such as water availability assessment using the swat model pandey et al 2020a hydroclimatic assessment future impact of climate change using a different hydrologic model like swat and hbv bhatta et al 2020 dahal et al 2020 pandey et al 2020b shiwakoti 2012 hydro climatic variability assessment khatiwada et al 2016 to date there has been no comprehensive evaluation of the different precipitation products as an input forcing for the hydrologic simulation in the krb using different spps in this context the study s objective is to evaluate the several precipitation products varying from in situ observation to different high resolution spps using daily time series 2000 2015 for hydrologic simulation using spatially distributed hydrologic model j2000 this study will provide valuable information on the degree of estimation of simulation biases in each satellite product the study will also test the utilities for streamflow forecast at krb which could support formulating and implementing the different wrpm activities at the field level with sound understanding and appraisal of different spps in the himalayan region the study s novel contribution is to examine the applicability of high resolution spps in the himalayan river basin we simulated the hydrologic response and examined their simulation capabilities in different time scales daily and monthly for the first time using j2000 in the western himalayan river basin of nepal 2 study area karnali river basin krb is one of the significant river basins with a perennial source the basin is located in the western part of nepal between 28 33 n 30 45 n and 80 55 e 83 68 e shown in fig 1 the karnali river is the longest river in nepal with a length of 507 km as illustrated in fig 1 it is a transboundary river originating from the mount kailash region in china reaches plain near chisapani and flows through nepal joining the ghaghara river in india the area of interest for the current study is an upstream area of a hydrologic monitoring station located at chisapani shown in fig 1 the basin experiences a considerable range of elevation from 184 m in the lower southern part to 7664 m in higher himalayan with an area of 43 671 km2 upstream of the chisapani discharge station the climate varies from tropical in the south plains to polar at north himalayas across the study area and the dominant climate class is temperate karki et al 2016 about 93 40 of the basin is located in nepal while the rest lies in tibetan plateau china 6 60 territories krb is divided into eight types of land use and land cover class in which higher land is dominated by snow bare land glaciers and grasslands and the lower part by forest and agriculture lands the basin experience substantial spatial heterogeneity in biophysical and climatic characteristics pandey et al 2020a we obtained a soil map of 896 m 896 m resolution from fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2012 in which acrisol and cambisol are dominant in the region the basin s annual average precipitation during 2000 2015 is about 1200 mm dhm nepal the spatial distribution of precipitation varies significantly as tibetan and higher himalayan receive less than 300 mm precipitation in a year in contrast some mountainous areas receive over 2400 mm in a year dahal et al 2020 due to orographic relief palazzi et al 2013 precipitation pattern in krb is associated with south asian monsoon topography and the westerlies nayava 1980 shrestha 2000 the temporal distribution of precipitation shows that the basin receives the highest precipitation in july 290 40 mm and the least precipitation in november 12 51 mm mainly four climatological seasons i e pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november and winter december february exist in the region 3 data and methods 3 1 satellite based precipitation products spps four multi satellite based spps were selected namely trmm chirps mswep and persiann cdr with an identical spatial resolution of 0 25 and a temporal resolution of one day these products were chosen because they show consistency with the ground based precipitation in the mountain tibetan and himalayan regions still these products were not concisely examined in a well performed hydrologic model in the complex terrains high elevation and himalayan region of nepal alazzy et al 2017 andermann et al 2011 dahri et al 2016 shrestha et al 2017 tong et al 2014 venkatesh et al 2020 the daily time series from 2000 to 2015 were evaluated into the hydrologic model for all spps except mswep where daily time series from 2000 to 2014 were considered the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa products are accessible in two versions i e post real time research version 3b42 and real time version 3b42rt they differ in using monthly rain gauges for bias adjustment in research products tong et al 2014 moreover the research version applies the trmm combined instrument tci as a calibrator and the real time version uses tmi huffman and bolvin 2012 in this study trmm 3b42 is used which is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 3 h daily temporal resolution within a global coverage of 50 n s latitude huffman et al 2007 this data set s detailed description is available in huffman et al 2010 huffman and bolvin 2014 chirps version 2 was used in the study consisting of various kinds of precipitation products including global climatologies satellite estimates and in situ observations with different temporal resolutions i e six hourly daily pentad dekad monthly and yearly which produced in several steps katsanos et al 2016 it is sole ir infrared based climatic precipitation data available with spatial resolutions of 0 05 and 0 25 long term records 1981 to near present within a pseudo global coverage of 50 n s latitude funk et al 2015 a more detailed description of the dataset accessible at funk et al 2015 katsanos et al 2016 paredes trejo et al 2016 mswep is the precipitation dataset available globally at a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 25 0 5 and temporal resolution at three hourly daily and monthly available from 1979 to the present two versions of data sets are available in which version 1 of mswep was used in this study the mswep algorithm depends upon satellite infrared and microwave precipitation estimates gauge and reanalysis data the correction method is applied by considering catchment average precipitation from mean streamflow observations at 13 762 stations worldwide to address under catch and orographic effects beck et al 2017 persiann cdr is available at 0 25 spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution with global coverage of 60 n s latitude for 1983 to the near present the generation is based on the persiann algorithm hsu et al 1997 applying infrared brightness temperature data from geostationary satellites to estimate precipitation rate and updating its parameters using passive active microwave observations from low orbital satellites ashouri et al 2015 3 2 meteorological and hydrologic dataset in this study 50 ground based rainfall stations and one discharge station that lies in the near boundary within the boundary of this study area was selected and daily time series data of these stations from the period 2000 2015 were collected from the department of hydrology and meteorology dhm nepal these stations were selected based on the quality completeness and homogeneity of data the quality of data was assured by several steps of screening with the plot of data using the river basin information system rbis developed by the institute for technology and resources management in the tropics and subtropics itt technische hochschule th köln which can be accessed through link http rbis itt fh koeln de rbis can be applied for

users zander and kralisch 2016 the missing time series data of ground based rainfall stations were filled from asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources version 1901 aphrodite v1901 data the aphrodite data is derived from distance weighted interpolated data set from ground based rainfall station and interpolation is based on the station between 5 000 to 12 000 depending upon the availability of station including consideration of orographic factor hamada et al 2011 yatagai et al 2020 2012 the j2000 hydrologic model needs precipitation input data in the form of point value we developed a script using r3 5 1 to extract the multi point pixel value from spps in krb considering the x and y coordinate from above selected 50 ground based rainfall stations bai and liu 2018 sharma et al 2020 talchabhadel et al 2021 thiemig et al 2012 meteorological data such as wind temperature humidity and sunshine were obtained from climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr data set accessed through link https globalweather tamu edu for the period from 2000 to 01 01 to 2014 07 31 forty two climate stations were selected that distribute all over the entire basin at a spatial resolution of 38 km these data are generated from national centers for environmental prediction ncep by global forecast system they use information

hydrologic model component and regionalization for j2000 modeling is described in gao et al 2012 nepal 2012 nepal et al 2014 and krause 2002 the layout of the j2000 hydrologic model is shown in fig 2 parameters that are used in the hydrologic model are the key factor that influences the accuracy of model simulations muleta and nicklow 2005 past research revealed that intensive measurement of parameter value doesn t have the desired result kherde 2016 some of the model parameters are technically and economically not feasible practically for a vast area refsgaard 1997 therefore a sensitivity analysis was conducted to find the optimal parameter value adopting a suitable numerical algorithm that addresses uncertainties in the input variables and model parameters saltelli et al 2000 the model was calibrated to observed discharge recorded at the chisapani discharge station in the krb considering the calibration period from 2000 to 2010 during sensitivity analysis 39 model parameters were chosen to execute at the jams platform using non dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 nsga2 we selected modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mod nse a logarithm of nash sutcliffe efficiency lognse and percentage bias error pbias as an objective function deb et al 2002 krause et al 2005 random sampling was used to choose the appropriate value range of 39 parameters furthermore model parameter values were already evaluated in the himalayan river basin by nepal 2012 and nepal et al 2014 the values of these regional parameters were also considered while selecting the ranges of this study s parameters afterward monte carlo analysis mca was proceeded in an online jams cloud developed by friedrich schiller university of jena germany to produce 1500 simulations outputting different parameter combinations and model responses these parameter values are selected based on filtering the normalizing values of pbias 0 05 and lognse 0 25 of 1500 simulations and then choosing the lowest value of the normalizing value of the mod nse the most suitable values for these calibrated parameters are given in table 2 then 1500 simulation results were analyzed by regional sensitivity analysis rsa spear and hornberger 1980 to evaluate the impact of the parameter on the model output however calibration process have biases in using simple objective function huang et al 2020 jian et al 2017 selection of calibration parameters and methods finger et al 2015 hydrologic parameter uncertainty ficklin and barnhart 2014 and input data model parameters and initial conditions gupta et al 2012 3 4 model calibration and validation two different calibration methods were applied for simulating streamflow from selected four spps without bias correction in method i the model was calibrated with ground based precipitation data and re running the model with selected spps method ii involved the calibration of the model with each spp the calibration period is from 2000 to 2007 and the validation period is from 2008 to 2015 except for mswep where the validation period in both methods is 2008 to 2014 two different approaches based on the following principle were conveniently applied for the first method the common use of the model parameter for all the spps input gives a clear insight into the variation of discharge simulation in the second method i e calibration of the model with selected spps provides a detailed visualization of the effect of different spps on both model calibration and subsequent streamflow simulations at the validation period bitew and gebremichael 2011a 3 5 standard verification of simulated discharge the evaluation of hydrologic model behavior and performance is done by simulated and observed variables the most commonly used objective functions for hydrologic simulations kralisch et al 2005 the main objective to evaluate in the hydrologic model is i to estimate and predict the historical and future hydrologic behavior ii further improvement of a model in terms of adjustment of the model parameter structure this research aims to compare the simulation result obtained by different spps by employing appropriate performance indicators the following statistical performance coefficient of determination r2 nse mod nse pbias were calculated for the evaluation of discharge simulation the equations are listed as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n p i p 2 i 1 n o i o 2 2 2 n s e 1 o i p i 2 o i o 2 3 m o d n s e 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i o j w i t h j 1 4 p b i a s p i o i o i 100 where n is the number of observations oi and pi are the observed and the corresponding satellite precipitation values at day i respectively o and p are the arithmetic mean of the observations and satellite estimates respectively r2 eq 1 measures how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model steel and torrie 1960 the r2 value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates no correlation and 1 indicates the prediction s dispersion is equal to that of the observation product the major limitation of r2 is that if for example the model systematically over or under estimates the observations the r2 could be close to 1 even though the prediction is false krause et al 2005 nse eq 2 with a higher value indicates that the model predicts a more accurate discharge simulation the value ranges from to 1 where 1 value is a perfect fit nse value equal to 0 means that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data and an nse value less than 0 represents the observed mean as a better predictor than a model it does not respond well to systematic error because of underprediction during low flow season to overcome such a limitation mod nse eq 3 is used to respond to low seasonal flow legates and mccabe 1999 pushpalatha et al 2012 where the difference between the observed and the predicted values are not squared but their absolute values are applied the pbias eq 4 measures the percentage bias error which shows that the precipitation product results in overestimating or underestimating the flow observation a positive value indicates an overestimation of discharge value and vice versa as suggested by moriasi et al 2007 we have followed the rules to rank the model performance as very good 0 75 nse 1 good 0 65 nse 0 75 satisfactory 0 5 nse 0 65 and unsatisfactory nse 0 5 the methodological framework of this research is illustrated in fig 3 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrometerological characteristic of krb fig 4 shows the average monthly rainfall gauge and satellite based and observed runoff in krb in general all products revealed a similar intra annual variability meaning they captured seasonality however there is a noticeable variation in the magnitude of rainfall when compared with ground based rainfall amounts as the country has summer monsoon dominated rainfall from the moisture from the bay of bengal nepal s eastern region has a higher monsoon contribution than its western region talchabhadel et al 2018 approximately 70 74 of the annual precipitation falls in monsoon june september which is slightly less than country averaged monsoon contribution 80 shrestha 2000 and less than 12 between november and february the mswep overestimated the precipitation value throughout the year as compared to gauge based rainfall gauge chirps and persiann cdr overestimated the gauge precipitation in the winter season december february and underestimated it during other seasons however trmm showed the precipitation estimation nearly the same as a gauge whose seasonal variation is only between 0 02 mm and 0 12 mm because monthly gauge adjustments are included in the trmm 3b42 estimates huffman et al 2007 considering the yearly average precipitation gauge chirps and trmm showed nearly identical precipitation values of 1239 mm 1239 mm and 1224 mm respectively in the view of cumulative distribution analysis of average daily precipitation of basin as shown in fig 5 chirps showed the highest non precipitation days 36 2 followed by persiann cdr 12 2 trmm 3 1 gauge 2 2 and mswep 0 82 respectively during the period 2000 2015 the possible reason behind the highest non detection of rainfall events of chirps because the cloud tops may have a higher temperature value than the infrared precipitation irp cold cloud density threshold value i e 235 k dinku et al 2018 fig 6 a shows the observed discharge histogram which depicts that discharge range from 300 500 m3 s is dominant in the region which accounts for 25 67 and high flow discharge between 8000 18000 m3 s contributes only 0 38 of the total period as depicted in fig 6 b the mean annual observed discharge shows that discharge decreases at an annual rate of 14 67 m3 s along with higher inter annual variation discharge from 1095 m3 s to 1795 m3 s during 2000 2015 moreover there is higher seasonal variability of discharge which fluctuates from 453 m3 s in dry months november may to 2644 m3 s in wet months june october the flow duration curve fdc in fig 6 c shows that discharge of 100 m3 s has almost 100 probability exceedance 99 98 to be exact and discharge of 500 m3 s has a 60 probability exceedance in krb the river discharges at different probability exceedance are essential factors guiding the planning design installation and operation of various water sector projects like hydropower plants irrigation facilities or water supply projects 4 2 hydrologic performance of different precipitation products the hydrologic model is an efficient technique for understanding the watershed s hydrologic characteristics and performing various what if scenario analyses the model can also be used to evaluate the performance of different precipitation inputs the sparse gauge network and its interpolation cannot correctly represent the spatial and temporal rainfall characteristics at the watershed scale liu et al 2017 and simulate the river discharge another popular way is to assess river discharge using different satellite based products however precipitation input errors can cause significant uncertainties in streamflow simulation and prediction ebert et al 2007 nijssen and lettenmaier 2004 in this section the impacts of different precipitation products in hydrologic applications were tested at the outlet of krb as previously mentioned two methods were employed and the evaluation and comparison of streamflow simulations were carried out at daily and monthly scales 4 2 1 performance based under method i 4 2 1 1 comparison at a daily scale in the method i the model was calibrated based on gauge precipitation and the model was forced with selected spps fig 7 exhibits daily observed discharge and simulated discharge driven by gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm for krb during the calibration period 2000 2007 and validation period 2008 2015 respectively the results indicate that gauge chirps and trmm successfully stimulated the model to reproduce the discharge simulation the trend of rising and falling simulated discharge processes is in good agreement with the observed discharge overall both high and low flows are also equally mimicked by the model and the average flows for all rainfall products however few noticeable fluctuations could be seen in different years for instance significant underestimation for persiann cdr during 2008 slight underestimation for trmm during 2008 slight overestimation for chirps during 2011 considerable overestimation for mswep during 2010 2011 and so on table 3 exhibits the statistical performance of discharge simulation under a method i and b method ii on a daily scale based on the model performance categories proposed by moriasi et al 2007 gauge chirps and trmm attained an outstanding performance for both the calibration and validation periods except for the chirps nse 0 71 in the validation period gauge achieved the highest nse 0 92 for calibration and 0 87 for validation values and similar results were obtained compared to a major watershed basin in nepal as depicted in table 5 j2000 performed superiorly in nepal s major watershed basins in predicting hydrologic behavior as illustrated in table 5 it reveals that j2000 parameters could be transferred to the himalayan region with similar physiographic landscape characteristics nepal 2016 nepal et al 2017b for evaluation of snow and glacier melt contribution to water balance the gr4jsg model might be a better option due to a provision of the glacial store in that model and able to evaluate the parameter that controls snow and glacial stores which can be interlinked with existing parameters of gr4j however it has limitations in sensitivity to initial conditions slow trends in the internal states highly sensitive to rainfall and temperature input data nepal et al 2017a moreover table 5 shows the inconsistency in pbias during the calibration and validation stage this inconsistency is due to other selection criteria objective function during model calibration pellicciotti et al 2012 input data and model structure uncertainty renard et al 2010 internal inconsistencies between models penton et al 2016 length of calibration and validation period liu et al 2017 and uncertainty in discharge measurement during flood period kattelmann 1987 the simulated streamflow of mswep had the lowest nse 0 48 for calibration and 0 51 for validation value and the highest pbias error 34 28 for calibration and 42 42 validation overestimated the discharge simulation at all period the reason might be bias and error in the mswep as the hydrologic process is non linear any positive negative precipitation input bias can be transformed into a more considerable positive negative bias in the simulated streamflow su et al 2008 trmm performed best in terms of pbias 2 28 for calibration and 1 53 for validation considering the nse indicator persiann cdr performed well during calibration 0 74 and satisfactorily during validation 0 54 period and underestimated flow simulation in both calibration and validation moriasi et al 2007 fig 9 shows the scatter plot of daily observed and simulated discharge at the outlet of chisapani station fig 9 a b e exhibit that the model predicts well with the hydrologic cycle in both the calibration and validation periods and show the fair distribution of points around the diagonal of a plot which is assured by the regression slope rs of gauge 0 83 chirps 0 82 and trmm 0 86 respectively but the model doesn t predict well for persiann cdr rs 0 51 and mswep rs 1 3 as depicted in fig 9 d and c respectively the analysis indicates that the model showed good agreement in low flow rather than high flows if the objective was to examine high flow events in that case it is suggested to use the hydrologic model that captures such high flow events such as sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma and génie ruralà 4 paramètres journalier gr4j perrin et al 2003 wijayarathne and coulibaly 2020 or improving in the biases of spps by employing appropriate methods to improve the prediction of high flow in the hydrologic model bourgin et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 4 2 1 2 comparison at monthly scale fig s1 in the supplement section shows monthly observed and simulated discharge of gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm in krb under method i as shown in table 4 a gauge chirps and trmm performed very well whose nse values are above or equal to 0 90 in calibration and validation as compared to the daily time scale the monthly simulation performance increased substantially for example at the watershed scale during the validation period nse for chirps rose from 0 71 on a daily scale to 0 90 on a monthly scale in contrast nse increased from 0 54 to 0 64 for persiann cdr and from 0 51 to 0 59 for mswep however the pbias showed consistency in both the time scale the scatter plots of the monthly simulated discharge as shown in fig s3 indicate the distribution of point along diagonal lines whose rs is greater than 0 90 and less than 1 for gauge chirps and trmm while persiann cdr exhibited more distribution of points below the diagonal line means an underestimation of discharge simulation pbias 19 30 for calibration and 23 30 for validation and mswep depicted more distribution of points above diagonal line resulting in an overestimation of discharge simulation such a result of persiann cdr was in line with finding by miao et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 and sirisena et al 2018 furthermore various studies described significant underestimation in persiann cdr at high elevations bitew and gebremichael 2011a hirpa et al 2010 hong et al 2007 the underestimation by the spp may be linked with shallow convective systems in the high altitude areas where there is not much ice height for the microwave sensors to detect nesbitt et al 2008 and infrared sensors have difficulty in ascertaining light rain events bitew and gebremichael 2010 hong et al 2007 by referring to performance indicators after gauge trmm proved to be the best product for flow simulation during wet and dry periods at daily and monthly time series followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively the best performance is due to gauge correction is used for trmm estimate enhancing the quality of the product leading to minimization of bias during flow simulation over the mountainous area pan et al 2010 however trmm still consists of bias which can be corrected by improvement in the satellite orbits and sensor drift brown et al 2009 fisher and wolff 2011 as well as time dependence was noticed by krakauer et al 2013 in the evaluation of trmm bias precipitation in nepal which can be mitigated by an improvement in the estimation of the algorithm 4 2 2 performance based under method ii 4 2 2 1 comparison at a daily scale in this section we compare and evaluate the performance of the j2000 model that individual spp calibrated the scatter plot as shown in fig 10 reveals consistent rs for the chirps and trmm whereas the rs gets changed for persiann cdr 0 51 to 0 61 and mswep 1 3 to 0 86 and predict the simulated discharge reasonably the agreement shows the model executes well comparatively to method i the scatter plot of spps underestimated the observed discharge value except for chirps a similar outcome of a slight underestimation of trmm was also observed by ghaju and alfredsen 2012 islam 2009 and kumar and lakshmi 2018 for nepal due to low convective precipitation over high altitudes kumar et al 2016 shrestha et al 2012 fig 8 shows the plots of daily observed and simulated discharge of spps during the calibration and validation period as compared to the method i the hydrologic behavior of all the products is improved and the simulation curves match the observed discharge various studies jiang et al 2012 stisen and sandholt 2010 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2019 xue et al 2013 concluded that the efficiency of hydrologic simulation gets improved by input specific recalibration as summarized in tables 3 and 4 there is a moderate decline of all the metrics in the validation period compared to the calibration period for all spps in both methods this reason might be an error in the record of observed discharge dhami et al 2018 the nse of chirps increased from 0 77 to 0 83 for calibration and 0 71 to 0 74 for validation persiann cdr increased from 0 74 to 0 80 for calibration and 0 54 to 0 63 for validation and trmm increased from 0 85 to 0 88 for calibration and 0 77 to 0 78 for validation increased slightly surprisingly nse for mswep increased significantly from 0 48 to 0 87 at calibration and 0 51 to 0 82 at the validation period regarding the pbias the error decreased considerably for mswep 34 28 to 3 74 for calibration and 42 42 to 1 77 for validation and persiann cdr 19 39 to 0 61 for calibration and 23 47 to 2 12 for validation such agreement occurs due to a change in model parameter value as shown in table 2 however this change in parameter value may not represent the real field condition such as groundwater recharge interflow base flow snow accumulation glacier ice melt etc bitew et al 2012 liu et al 2017 as mod nse is more sensitive to the low flow period and the values are in the range of 0 66 to 0 76 in calibration and 0 54 to 0 73 in the validation period the r2 value is quite consistent in the result compared to the method i and the outcome of spps didn t vary much from others so r2 doesn t appear to be a good metric to examine the validity of spps senent aparicio et al 2018 regarding the goodness of fit tests in reality when using a graphical plot and another indicator the performance of spps is distinct 4 2 2 2 comparison at monthly scale fig s2 represents the monthly observed and simulated discharge at the study area under method ii the model predicts fairly both in the dry period and wet flow period all spps have an nse value greater than equal to 0 90 except persiann cdr nse 0 75 in the validation period and mod nse value greater than equal to 0 75 except chirps nse 0 74 in validation period comparing the monthly simulation with the method i the much improvement of nse and mod nse was noticed in mswep comparing the performance of chirps with persiann cdr in both methods chirps performed superiorly tuo et al 2016 recommended chirps data as the best choice for data scarce alpine regions they can be used for long term precipitation analyses with relatively higher confidence in a monsoon dominated region prakash 2019 however there are some limitations and uncertainties corrected persiann cdr data provides valuable information for hydrologic simulation in remote and high altitude areas faridzad et al 2018 method ii gives clear insight that mswep is the best product for flow simulation on daily as well as monthly timescales followed by trmm chirps and persiann cdr respectively such a similar higher performance of mswep was seen in a monsoon dominated mekong river basin tang et al 2019 while it exhibits inconsistent performance in peninsular spain senent aparicio et al 2018 moreover satellite precipitation algorithms can be divided into two categories based on the primary input used primarily mw data e g trmm mswep or those that use mainly ir data e g chirps persiann cdr bitew and gebremichael 2011b this study reveals that mw based precipitation performs better than ir based precipitation however mw based challenges over mountain regions because of very cold surfaces and ice over mountain tops which could confuse precipitation dinku et al 2008 4 3 sensitivity within the model sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the impact of single parameters on the model result by a change in model parameter values the main concept is to categorize the different model samples into the behavioral and non behavioral populations and compare their distribution functions in the objective function krause et al 2009 fig 11 a e represents rsa of the highly sensitive parameter in gauge chirps mswep persiann cdr and trmm respectively the blue lines represent the cumulative distribution function of the behavioral parameter set and the red lines show the non behavior set the cumulative frequency of distribution was evaluated and plotted based on each parameter s likelihood normalization during the simulations wagener et al 2001 and fischer et al 2012 reveal that if the model performance is sufficiently sensitive to a specific parameter there will be a more considerable variation between the cumulative frequency distributions the rsa evaluated the parameter effect on model result and efficiency in the j2000 model based on mod nse criteria table s1 exhibits the sensitivity of parameters based on mod nse evaluation criteria in gauge and selected spps fcadaptation soil module soillatvertlps and soilconcrd1floodthresold are the most top three sensitive parameters in gauge impacting 10 8 6 7 and 4 9 respectively on the variation of model output as compared with rsa of gauge in dudhkoshi basin parameters such as soillatvertlps latvertdistlps and soilconcrd1 are the most sensitive nepal et al 2014 whereas soillatvertlps is examined as the most sensitive in tamor basin nepal et al 2017b based on nse criteria these variations in the most sensitive parameter are observed due to selecting the different objective functions in rsa analysis the range of parameter values defined the number of parameters selected and the number of simulation runs during model calibration the basin s geophysical and hydrologic characteristics such as shape size slope precipitation inputs soil type etc determine the parameters sensitivity nepal et al 2017b similarly snow trans 11 3 kice 5 7 and soilconcrd1 5 are most sensitive parameter for chirps the evaluation in mswep indicates that alphaice 11 1 fcadaptation 5 78 and gwcaprise 4 77 are the most sensitive parameter during discharge simulation looking towards the assessment for persiann cdr snow module parameter ddfic 19 93 is a highly sensitive parameter furthermore the precipitation distribution module snow trans snow trs and soil module soilconcrd1 are highly sensitive parameters in trmm hence sensitivity analysis determines the impact and influence of the parameters in model results and efficiency this study supports the use of satellite based rainfall products for hydrologic modeling both the methods used in this study can be applied in other regions for evaluating their performance however if there are high discrepancies in simulated discharge while using the method i the input satellite based products should be corrected using some bias correction techniques because in the method i we fix all parameters based on gauge precipitation and while implementing method ii since the parameters are calibrated using satellite based products we need to select the upper and lower threshold of some physical based parameters these parameters need to be within physically allowable limits our future work would be to use all grids of satellite based products instead of using around the gauge locations and also to calibrate and validate at multiple hydrologic stations to apply some intervention analysis on a watershed scale 5 conclusion the mountainous region of nepal has limited numbers or sparse and uneven distribution of ground based precipitation observations bajracharya et al 2014 subba et al 2019 and the network cannot represent the spatial distribution of precipitation andermann et al 2011 which leads to challenges in water resource assessment and development as compared to ground based precipitation networks the main benefit of spp is the wide global coverage and high spatial resolution spp should be comprehensively and concisely evaluated before the practical application and integration we used several spps and gauge based rainfall observations we forced them into a well performed j2000 hydrologic model in the himalayan basin nepal 2016 2012 to examine daily monthly and seasonal behavior across krb and assess performance of selected spps the main findings drawn in the study are listed below 1 the simulated streamflow derived from trmm performed best after gauge under the method i followed by chirps persiann cdr and mswep respectively both on a daily and monthly scale slight overestimation with the least pbias error was noticed in trmm while the highest underestimation and overestimation were observed in persiann cdr and mswep respectively 2 the performance metrics of spps were improved by input specific calibration result in differing model parameter values for each product however it might not represent the real field condition such as interflow snow and glacier melt snow accumulation recharge of groundwater etc this study highlighted that calibration based on spps depicted better results than calibration based on ground based precipitation when forcing spps into the j2000 model in the method ii mswep performed best with slight underestimation in calibration and slight overestimation in the validation period on both a daily and monthly time scale chirps showed underestimation in calibration and overestimation in validation while persiann cdr depicts underestimation in calibration and validation for both methods this study focused on evaluating selected spps based on the location of the existing 50 ground based rainfall stations the outcome of the spps may be different if we consider the centroid of each pixel as rainfall stations and recommended such a study in the future to assess the accuracy of the higher temporal and spatial resolution of spp in the data scare region our research shows a higher performance of spps in the hydrologic model although it has bias problems ciabatta et al 2016 villarini et al 2008 xie et al 2002 after correcting the spp bias it may be useful for water

4478,the selection of future climate change scenarios may have issues in representing the full spectrum of climate projections in glacierized mountain regions where glaciers play an important role in hydrology thus the effect of glacier storage change must be considered in the selection approaches here a multi perspective approach was proposed to select climate models from cmip6 database considering the full spectrum of future climate change and effects of glaciers on hydrology this approach combines the envelope based approach ea past performance approach ppa and additional criteria to incorporate water energy balance and glacier storage change based on the turc budyko theory the approach physically diagnoses gcms by investigating their effects on glacier storage change compared to reference climate and observed mass balance data a step wise shortlisting and selection of appropriate climate models for the upper indus basin uib was made under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 based on a range of projected changes in mean values for four extreme future projections cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet b range of projected changes in climatic extremes c representation of water energy balance and storage change and d skill in representing historical climate the future projections indicate temperature and precipitation increase by 1 7 0 6 c and 7 5 3 3 1 3 c and 10 6 and 6 3 2 6 c and 22 13 under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 in 2071 2100 compared to 1985 2014 respectively the glacier area volume and length are projected to decrease by 22 33 51 63 and 13 22 under ensembled scenarios of full spectrum at selected glaciers the proposed multi perspective approach is advantageous in shortlisting a limited number of climate models representing the full range of possible future climatic conditions to assess the full range of expected impacts of climate changes on indigenous glacio hydrology such selection eventually reduces the glacio hydrological simulation task keywords cmip6 upper indus basin water energy balance ssps turc budyko glacio hydrology 1 introduction in mountain regions projections of future glacio hydrologic processes and water availability under climate change are forced by the outputs of general circulation models gcms in coupled model intercomparison project cmip at different phases eyring et al 2016 meehl et al 2007 taylor et al 2012 the projected results are further used in policymaking and for pro active management and mitigation decisions to cope with the predicted impacts gao et al 2018 sorg et al 2014 remarkable uncertainties are recognized among the projected climate changes by different gcms and transfer to the projected glacio hydrological results which make the reliability of impact assessments questionable woldemeskel et al 2014 multiple gcms are therefore adopted to account for both ensemble mean and variation scope of them the latest released cmip phase 6 cmip6 database includes several gcms with multiple scenarios https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip wgcm cmip6 the full spectrum indicates the projected future climate change domain which is defined in two dimensions one from the wettest to driest by precipitation and another from the warmest and coldest by temperature this domain is contained within four combinations of the most warm cold and wet dry which represents the large unavoidable and locally increasing future climate uncertainties joetzjer et al 2013 knutti and sedláček 2012 lutz et al 2016b full coverage of the domain is believed to be inefficient with consideration of the limited time and constraints in available human and computational resources a small number of gcms are usually selected for such a purpose however the selection process is not straightforward how to select proper gcms with the least number from the huge cmip6 database is the first and crucial step the selected gcms should represent the full spectrum of future climate changes and corresponding glacio hydrological simulation be maintained at least extent at the same time several approaches have been introduced to deal with such a selection of representative climate models for sector specific applications for example past performance approach biemans et al 2013 pierce et al 2009 envelope based approach and extreme changes approach immerzeel et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 cluster analysis algorithms cannon 2015 houle et al 2012 model dependence approach evans et al 2013 comparisons with simulated low flows van huijgevoort et al 2014 and comparison with cumulative potential groundwater recharge rossman et al 2018 each approach mentioned above has its advantages and disadvantages as well for example the selection of gcms based on high performance in representing history can miss the possible futures e g biemans et al 2013 pierce et al 2009 on the other hand the envelope based approach neglects a model s ability to simulate the climate and only the mean annual changes are the criteria for model selection the decisive criteria for selecting the gcms depend on the characteristics of the region of interest and the study s ultimate goals wilby 2017 the glaciered catchment presents some features that are unique due to the involvements of glaciers which respond sensitively to climate changes in both precipitation and temperature and affect the hydrological processes as a consequence in addition to precipitation the glacier melt can be considered an additive input source to the watershed water balance this is a noticeable aspect of the glaciered catchment distinguishing from a non glaciered one although glaciers play a crucial role in the hydrology of glacierized basins researchers did not consider the impact of change in glacier storage in their analysis jury et al 2020 khan and koch 2018 lutz et al 2016b change in glacier storage has a critical effect on hydrology and it depends on the water energy balance of the watershed the involvement of glacier change complicates the hydrological processes on the other hand observations of glacier changes may provide additional criteria for selecting the suitable gcms which comes from understanding to the watershed scale water energy balance derived from the generally so called budyko s theoretical framework budyko 1963 based on this framework formulas were empirically designed or theoretically derived and establish analytical relationships among annual streamflow q precipitation p potential etp and actual evapotranspiration eta in most cases the water storage change among the water balance components is assumed negligible carmona et al 2014 ning et al 2018 sivapalan et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 the turc budyko theory which is one among quite a few others based on turc 1954 and budyko 1974 deals with water and energy balance at the watershed and annual scale coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 applied to the glacierized watershed where glacier storage change is obvious the approaches formulated as such should reflect the watershed water imbalance when watershed water storage change is neglected a q must not be negative i e q 0 b q must not be less than the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration i e q p etp and c q must be less than the available precipitation i e q p andréassian and perrin 2012 however in glacierized watersheds the meltwater is involved in the water balance therefore considering the glacial storage change can provide useful information when glacier storage changes happen and meltwater releases to streamflow the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow will go beyond the principles mentioned above the available approaches have several drawbacks when applied individually as mentioned above possibly incorporation of this section into the present workflows may be helpful for selecting the suitable gcms for a glaciered catchment in this study it is hypothesized that multi perspective criteria might assist in shortlisting the most suitable set of gcms which can represent the full spectrum of future climate and local applicability especially the influence of glaciers on the watershed hydrology this work is thus 1 to propose a multi perspective approach to select a set of representative climate models from cmip6 for the glaciered catchments and 2 to apply the approach to upper indus basin uib to test its performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the uib is highly glacierized with a total area of 173 435 km2 which spans over the high elevation hindukush himalaya karakorum mountains fig 1 about 13 545 glaciers with 19 328 km2 area glacier area ratio gar 11 are present in uib rgi consortium 2017 glacier and permanent snowmelt contribute 70 of streamflow in uib lutz et al 2016a tahir et al 2011 the multi source climate system in uib is unique and it has a strong relationship with the elevation the temperature decreases with the elevation whereas precipitation increases with elevation up to a specific elevation and then starts decreasing almost 67 of precipitation falls in winter due to westerlies hewitt 2007 and the rest in summer due to monsoons the average annual corrected precipitation in uib is 593 mm yr 1 shafeeque et al 2019 the maximum precipitation region is located between 3900 and 6600 masl future changes in temperature and precipitation will impact the glacier melt and disturb the timing and magnitudes of the water availability in the basin extreme events like floods wijngaard et al 2017 and droughts natural disasters like glacier surges and glacial lakes outburst flows glof will be more frequent in the future 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 reference data precipitation and temperature the problem of low density and uneven distribution of meteorological stations is huge common and unavoidable in most alpine regions isotta et al 2015 same in uib the observed meteorological data were collected from the water and power development authority wapda of pakistan the elevation of uib ranges between 300 8569 masl while the meteorological stations are located below 5000 masl with an average elevation of 3100 m supplementary table s1 no observed data at above 5000 masl are available which is an unavoidable limitation in this region winiger et al 2005 instead gridded precipitation datasets were used as a proxy in this region immerzeel et al 2015 however the gridded datasets have issues capturing the actual picture of the climate in the region palazzi et al 2013 shafeeque et al 2019 as previous studies basist et al 1994 bookhagen and burbank 2006 hu et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 johansson and chen 2003 yoon et al 2019 pointed out that precipitation is largely affected by topography the low elevation meteorological stations were used to correct the datasets with the topographic factors considered however the stations at lower locations might not represent the higher elevation precipitation therefore using such station data for performance evaluation may induce uncertainty in the analyzed results several previous studies in the region have corrected the precipitation using reverse modeling approaches dahri et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2019 taking glaciers vertical gradients and spatial variations of precipitation into account shafeeque et al 2019 prepared a dataset based on the corrected aphrodite and trmm datasets in the dataset aphrodite precipitation covers the period from 1985 2000 and trmm from 2001 2014 the details of the preparation of the corrected precipitation dataset are referred to shafeeque et al 2019 similarly another gridded dataset princeton global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modelling pgmfd was corrected based on observed temperature and then used as a reference temperature dataset in the current study supplementary information stream discharge the discharge data were collected from the wapda of pakistan supplementary table s2 based on the collected data the average annual discharge was observed 2450 m3 sec 1 topography the topography of the basin and selected glaciers was extracted from digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m obtained from the u s geological survey http www usgs gov glacier glacier inventories the glacier boundaries fig 1 and other related information were extracted from randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 rgi consortium 2017 glacier mass balance glacier mass balance data were compiled from the modelling and observation based literature see fig 1 a and supplementary table s3 mass balance rate varies spatially in west karakorum hunza basin the annual change rate was taken as 0 11 m w e yr 1 gardelle et al 2013 muhammad et al 2019 in the east karakorum shigar and shyok basin 0 09 m w e yr 1 region gardelle et al 2013 in the west himalaya and astore basin were 0 45 m w e yr 1 gardelle et

were extracted from global reference evapo transpiration global et0 at 1 km resolution antonio and zomer 2018 fig 1 d the potential evapotranspiration data was estimated from the fao penman monteith equations antonio and zomer 2018 the actual evapotranspiration fig 1 e data were extracted from esri hydro average annual actual evapotranspiration derived by the researchers at the university of montana based on the data from mod16 global evapotranspiration product esri 2019 2 2 2 gcm data the combined socioeconomic and technological development scenarios of cmip6 named shared socioeconomic pathways ssps were used in this study for the selection of climate models there are five ssps in cmip6 supplementary table s4 among the scenarios ssp1 represents potential futures of green fuelled growth van vuuren et al 2017 ssp5 represents fossil fuelled growth kriegler et al 2017 ssp3 represents high inequality between the countries fujimori et al 2017 ssp4 represents high inequality within countries calvin et al 2017 and ssp2 represents middle of the road characteristics fricko et al 2017 several radiative forcing targets can be met under each ssp based on policies at either local or global scale for the 21st century riahi et al 2017 to cover the whole range of ssp scenarios one sustainability ssp126 one middle of the road ssp245 and one fossil fuelled development ssp ssp585 were chosen for the climate model selection supplementary table s4 the first shortlisting for screening the gcms from the cmip database requires that the climate models provide daily data covering the history and future scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 supplementary table s5 the selected gcm scenarios establish the initial pool for the multi perspective approach described in the following section all the data are resampled to a common resolution 0 25 0 25 2 3 multi perspective approach fig 2 describes the step wise procedure adopted in the proposed multi perspective approach round 1 and 2 are based on the available envelope based approach round 3 added the watershed water energy formula to the workflow as described in fig 2 b round 4 finalizes the screening of the gcms based on historical performance for further bias correction and downscaling each step in the workflow is briefed as follows round 1 envelope based approach a projected changes in climatic means the annual precipitation and temperature changes were calculated for average values during 2071 2100 referenced to 1985 2014 the climate data operator cdo https code mpimet mpg de projects cdo was used for initial wrangling and extraction and then other calculations were performed in rstudio the projected changes in precipitation and temperature by the gcms in the initial pool defined a full spectrum domain its four corners i e cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet were extracted fig 2 a the adoption of the 10th and 90th percentile avoids the selection of outliers a percentile rank score was calculated to select the representative gcms within the proximity of each projection corner as following 1 rank ea 1 p i t p j t 2 p i p p j p 2 where rankea 1 represents the proximity distance of each gcm from the coroner 10th or 90th percentile pt and pp represent the change in temperature and precipitation respectively the subscript i and j represent the entire ensemble and individual model respectively from each corner four models with the lowest distance were selected for each ssp additional consideration was made while selecting the corner gcms based on the availability of daily data required at later stages of analysis and final application round 2 envelope based approach b projected changes in climatic extremes the climate models were shortlisted based on the projected extreme changes using four etccdi indices peterson 2005 two etccdi i e cold spell duration index csdi and warm spell duration index wsdi were adopted for temperature similarly precipitation due to extremely wet days r99ptot and consecutive dry days cdd were used for precipitation rclimdex software package https github com eccc cdas rclimdex was used to calculate etccdi indices and then percent changes in selected etccdi were calculated averaged over 30 years between 1985 and 2014 and 2071 2100 using daily outputs of the selected gcms for each year the percent changes were then averaged over the entire study area round 3 representation of water energy balance and change in glacier storage the realistic closure of water energy balance was tested using gcm climate evapotranspiration observed runoff and mass balance in uib then a skill score was calculated based on the water energy balance state and change in glacier storage long term water yield or runoff coefficient q p was plotted as a function of long term aridity index p etp i e q p f p etp coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 all three limits in the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot are based on the water balance equation of a water tight conservative catchment the water balance equation for a conservative catchment can be written as follows 2 p q α et p w h e r e α 1 the etp was calculated for observed and gcms historical period based on the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 using drought indices calculator drinc v1 7 software tigkas et al 2014 daily maximum and minimum temperatures from each gcm were used to calculate etp the point representing a catchment different positions in the plot for different gcms that falls within the feasible domain is considered a realistic or true watershed a feasible domain is an area below or equal to the water limit and above or equal to the energy limit fig 2b if a data point falls above the water limit i e q p or below the energy limit then it is called gaining or leaky catchment fig 2 b respectively andréassian and perrin 2012 in glacierized catchments the water balance equation can be written as 3 δ s δ t p q et a m b where δ s eta and mb represent the change in storage actual evapotranspiration and net mass balance contribution to the water balance of watershed respectively based on the literature data the average mass balance was found 0 17 m w e yr 1 in uib it is important to mention that water storage in soil and percolation were assumed neutralized in this calculation it has been argued that the baseflow contributions to the total runoff may compensate these terms over a multi year period immerzeel et al 2015 the actual et based on gcm data et a gcm was estimated using the following relationship 4 et a gcm et a m et p m et p gcm where et p gcm and et a gcm represent the estimated potential and actual evapotranspiration for a gcm respectively while et p m and et a m are the potential and actual evapotranspiration which are used as reference et data respectively calculated et p gcm and et a gcm are presented in supplementary fig s8 the actual over or under estimation can be calculated based on the change in storage when a glacierized catchment falls in the gaining zone q p it implies that there must be an additional water term that contributes to total runoff therefore in this case δ s 0 fig 2 b the meltwater contributions to total runoff highlight that higher precipitation is required to sustain such glacier systems hence the precipitation in that gcm is underestimated compared to the actual water input in a glacierized catchment on the other hand in the case of the leaky catchment when the runoff is less than the available energy it implies that a part of total runoff is missing from the water balance or the temperature is very low underestimated etp or the precipitation is overestimated in glacierized catchments the missing water can be stored in the form of a positive mass balance therefore in such cases δ s 0 fig 2 b while calculating the skill score the gcms fall within the gaining or leaky domain got 50 weight based on water energy state and 50 for glacier storage changes at each projection corner round 4 past performance approach statistical comparisons precipitation and temperature data from the selected gcms after round 3 were then validated for past performance against corrected precipitation and temperature datasets in uib for 1985 2014 the gcms were ranked based on the performance to represent the monthly and seasonal distributions and annual variations in average precipitation sums and average temperature the statistical indices are used to rank the gcms which include mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias ratio of standard deviations rsd nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d coefficient of persistence cp correlation coefficient cc coefficient of determination r2 and kling gupta efficiency kge taylor s diagrams taylor 2001 were used to present the comparison results visually 2 4 bias correction and downscaling bias correction and downscaling for the selected gcms were then performed they were bias corrected through the cmhyd software https swat tamu edu software cmhyd there are five bias correction methods available in cmhyd this study adopted the widely used delta change dc bosshard et al 2011 gellens and roulin 1998 graham et al 2007 luo et al 2018 lutz et al 2014 moore et al 2008 which bias corrects the projected climatic factors based on the historical statistics and thus conserves the linear spatial temporal and multi variable dependence structure in the future climate this feature of dc should be noticed before it is applied maraun 2016 the bias corrected gcms were further downscaled to 1 km resolution using the anusplin package https fennerschool anu edu au research products anusplin based on 1 km dem 2 5 glacio hydrological simulations ensembles of the selected cmip6 scenarios were used to simulate glacio hydrological processes in uib by the oggm open global glacier model maussion et al 2019 oggm simulates glacier dynamics explicitly based on isothermal shallow ice equations for computing the depth integrated ice flux farinotti et al 2017 2019a including changes in glacier area volume length ela and meltwater https docs oggm org en latest introduction html glacier melt is estimated by the temperature index approach marzeion et al 2012 technical details can be referenced to maussion et al 2019 oggm provides a default parameter database that comes from the calibration based on 250 glaciers around the globe https cluster klima uni bremen de github crossval and claims that the default parameters can produce reliable outputs world widely this study adopted the default parameter database the simulated results were evaluated by available observations of glacier area length and volume the assessment statistics showed an outstanding efficiency supplementary fig s24 3 results 3 1 future changes in mean climate in round 1 48 gcms out of 105 were selected as representatives of the full spectrum of future climate changes supplementary table s6 as expected the variation range of climate change increases with ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 fig 3 the temperature changes ranged from 2 86 9 82 c 0 72 5 39 c 0 36 3 41 c for ssp585 ssp245 and ssp126 respectively similarly the precipitation changes ranged from 7 36 58 75 0 18 36 90 and 1 85 20 88 for ssp585 ssp245 and ssp126 respectively the differing degrees of clustering in the scatter plots highlight the apparent differences in the ranges fig 3 a c the models were located closer to the cold dry and warm wet corner for all three ssps it is important to mention that the spatial heterogeneity was not considered in this step because the values were averaged for the entire study area 3 2 future changes in climatic extremes in round 2 a combined rank of mean and extreme temperature and precipitation changes was used to scrutinize the climate models between 2071 and 2100 and 1985 2014 the advantage of selection based on the combined score is that it avoids selecting models showing the greatest changes in only one of them it was also noted that models that projected large changes in mean values also projected the largest changes in extreme values for example canesm5 r1i1p1f1 and canesm5 r1i1p2f1 showed the highest increase in r99ptot and wsdi for both ssp245 and ssp585 respectively table 1 these models showed the greatest changes in mean temperature and precipitation fig 3 d e this direct relationship between the values of mean and extreme changes ensured that the model selection during the first round did not miss the models with important changes in the extreme values after the round 2 based on the combined total rank for changes in mean and extreme climate supplementary fig s9 three models at each corner of every ssp were selected for further processing 3 3 water energy balance and change in storage in round 3 the shortlisted models were further scrutinized based on the water energy and glacier storage change using a non dimensional representation of physical water energy balance in a watershed from 1985 2014 fig 4 the gcms with very low historical precipitation broke the water limit and were fallen within the gaining domain i e the water energy balance state was unrealistic for such gcms in uib for example canesm5 r2i1p1f1 p 294 mm yr 1 in fig 4 a on the other hand the gcms with very high precipitation or very low etp i e low temperature were out of energy limit and fallen within the leaky domain i e they represented an unrealistic state of water energy balance for example nesm3 r2i1p1f1 etp 320 mm yr 1 in fig 4 a the δ s ranged from 299 to 187 mm y 1 for all the included models fig 4 b the calculated δ s highlighted the actual under and over estimations in gcms 19 142 mm yr 1 the models that broke the water limit showed a negative change δ s 0 or underestimation 152 126 mm yr 1 whereas a positive change in storage δ s 0 or overestimation 74 65 mm yr 1 was shown by the models that surpass the energy limit fig 4 a b one of the included gcms nesm3 r2i1p1f1 was found out of the energy limit i e q was less than the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the the calculated skill score fig 4 c was based on the state of water energy balance gaining leaky or true and the proximal distance from the location of the point representing δ s 0 while a higher skill score represents closer proximity in this step we had to choose two models at each corner for every ssp following the rule we chose canesm5 r1i1p1f1 at the warm wet corner for ssp245 and ssp585 however it was out of the water limit i e the runoff was greater than precipitation 38 it implies that this gcm underestimated precipitation in the historical period given the important meltwater contributions to streamflow the negative change in storage will be higher representing a higher glacier loss in the future however for future projections it was noted that this gcm showed a significant increase in precipitation for all the ssps 10 to 36 and occupied the warm wet corner based on such evidence it is expected that this gcm may overcome the underestimated bias in the future climate the uncertainties in the p q mb and et used in the water balance approach may cause uncertainty in the analysis the contributions of different sources of uncertainties need to be quantified separately in order to understand where to focus the resources therefore uncertainties related to the parameters in eq 3 were quantified to estimate the overall uncertainty in water energy balance and calculated change in glacier storage the distributions of p and eta fig 4 d are the average of all included gcms and reference data supplementary figs s10 and s11 the uncertainty in average p and eta values was 2 and 3 respectively meanwhile the average p and eta were 5 and 17 different from reference precipitation and esri actual evapotranspiration the calculated average δ s might be affected by 75 21 390 and 41 due to the uncertainties in p eta q and mb respectively fig 4 e the overall uncertainty in δ s 63 was a combined effect of all the uncertainties in the water energy balance components in the glacierized watershed 3 4 monthly seasonal and annual variations in round 4 gcms were shortlisted based on the differences in mimicking the monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and temperature variations over 1985 2014 fig 5 a f ten different statistical indices were used to estimate the gcms skill in representing the reference climate at different scales all gcms showed an excellent correlation cc 0 9 with the monthly reference data while the correlation between the average reference and gcm summer temperature was around 0 5 fig 5 a b the gcm temperature was mostly negatively biased with the reference temperature ranging from 155 1 to 28 6 for all included models supplementary table s7 an under satisfactory performance of gcm precipitation was identified in representing the distribution and variations of reference precipitation fig 5 d f some of the included gcms even showed a negative correlation with reference data at seasonal and annual scales ranging between 0 24 to 0 46 the sums of gcm precipitation during monsoon months jun sep for most of the gcms were higher than the reference precipitation at the seasonal scale the overall bias ranged between 75 to 73 for all included models at all scales supplementary table s8 the final skill score was the weighted average of all the skill scores calculated based on the statistical indices for both precipitation and temperature at all scales i e monthly seasonal and annual fig 5 g finally the selected pool of gcms was shrunk to four gcms for every ssp 3 5 future climate the future climate scenarios were composed after bias correction and downscaling the selected models using the dc method table 2 based on the selected models the future temperature changes will range between 1 04 c and 9 43 c under the coldest and warmest scenarios for all the ssps in uib up to 2100 the average change in temperature will be 1 7 0 6 c 3 3 1 1 c and 6 3 2 2 c under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 similarly the future projected changes in precipitation ranged between 2 48 and 36 3 under the driest to wettest scenarios for all ssps in uib up to 2100 respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 the average annual precipitation will change by 6 6 3 9 9 9 5 6 and 21 9 11 7 respectively for ssp126 and ssp245 the cold dry corner showed less precipitation increase than the warm dry corner whereas for ssp585 the opposite was true based on the selected gcms the mean annual temperature will be 7 0 0 6 c 8 6 1 1 c and 11 6 2 2 c under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 in uib respectively fig 6 similarly the average temperature changes at cd cw wd and ww projection corners will be 2 6 c 2 5 c 4 4 c and 5 6 c compared to the reference period respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 the average annual precipitation will be 633 23 mm yr 1 654 33 mm yr 1 and 725 70 mm yr 1 in uib by the end of the 21st century respectively fig 6 3 6 future glacio hydrology for the selected glaciers the glacier area volume and length are projected to decrease averagely by 22 33 51 63 and 13 22 while ela to increase by 4 19 under ensembled scenarios very distinct impacts of future climate change were projected on glacier geometry changes under different future climatic conditions fig 7 a d the maximum changes up to 92 reduction in glacier volume occurred for the glaciers with small area sizes supplementary fig s27 for most glaciers the glacier geometries changes showed a sharper decrease after the 2060 s indicating a faster retreat and possible tipping points for some glaciers e g glaciers in the western himalayas it is also important to mention that the ensembles for ssp245 and ssp585 similarly impacted most glaciers this behavior was due to the inclusion of a common gcm with a faster temperature increase i e canesm5 in the ensembles at their warm wet projection corner table 2 a faster glacier retreat under canesm5 has also been projected for other mountain glaciers in neighboring regions e g dongkemadi glacier in the tanggula mountains gao et al 2020a the annual changes in glacier water storage were compared based on the results of oggm forced by ensembles of cd cw wd and ww projection corners to explore the role of glaciers as water resources the negative changes in the glacier water storage indicate the meltwater contributions to the total runoff in the respective month for any glacier fig 8 the integration of monthly values gives the annual changes in glacier water resources the storage changes for selected glaciers in the zanskar and astore sub basins durung drong kungi and toshian were almost similar under ensembles of projection corners fig 8 indicating similar impacts of climate change on future water resources the glaciers located in the gilgit sub basin ghalsapar and mushk bar will contribute lesser glacier meltwater in the future than the historical period indicating that their tipping points peak water huss and hock 2018 have already been passed this might be due to their small sizes supplementary table s9 the tipping point of the glaciers located in the zanskar and astore sub basins are projected to occur during 2060 2080 the tipping points for all the remaining glaciers are expected to occur after 2100 moreover the cd and cw corners had similar impacts on the meltwater contributions while the contributions will be higher under ensembles of wd and ww for the remaining selected glaciers in uib this highlights that glacier meltwater is more sensitive to change in temperature than precipitation the behavior of glaciers located in the karakoram is in line with the findings of previous studies gao et al 2020b immerzeel et al 2013 4 discussions the objective of the study is to propose an advanced multi perspective approach for an efficient selection of a representative set of gcms for climate change impact assessments in glacierized watersheds the multi perspective approach was applied in uib as a case study for selecting cmip6 scenarios to project climate change impacts on glacio hydrology the hypothesis has been proved true that multi perspective criteria might shortlist the most suitable set of gcms which eventually reduces the workload for glacio hydrological simulation in the climate change impact assessment studies the introduction of the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot andréassian and perrin 2012 coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 into the multi perspective approach is advantageous to identify the actual under and over estimation in gcms the combination of water energy and mass balance is a simpler and effective method for assessing the meltwater contributions and changes in glacier storage fig 4 as compared to the positive degree days and snow accumulation under a constant value of average temperature jury et al 2020 used as a proxy to detect the total melt and accumulation the q p et and mb are usually measured and can easily be available for the physical diagnosis of gcms given the important role of glaciers in the hydrology of glacierized catchments the selection of gcms based on water energy and mass balance is also advantageous compared to the selection based on groundwater recharge van huijgevoort et al 2014 and only simulated flows van huijgevoort et al 2014 in addition to identifying the under and over estimation of precipitation in any gcm the aridity index on the abscissa in the turc budyko plot helps identify wetter and drier characteristics of a watershed for gcm temperature and precipitation this information might be helpful when gcms are used to force hydrological models for future drought and flood analysis the water limit helps identify the additional water term in the water balance or missing water input coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 under the gaining state the projected hydrology will be underestimated or projected negative changes in glaciers will be very high on the other hand under the leaky state the projected hydrology will be overestimated or will result in higher positive glacier storage and it may simulate implausible positive mass balance conditions in glacio hydrological modeling therefore scrutinizing the gcms representing very high glacier changes or gaining leaky states is an efficient feature of the multi perspective approach the representation of a real change in glacier storage by gcm historical climate is critically important in uib because 70 of streamflow is contributed by meltwater zhang et al 2013 while considerable mass loss has been projected under future climate change rounce et al 2020 in such situations the multi perspective approach is handy to choose the best suited set of gcms for hydrological simulations in highly glacierized mountain regions the downscaled gcm ensembles for ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 show that the future climate is highly uncertain in the uib the average warming in the uib 1 04 to 9 43 c between 1985 and 2014 and 2071 2100 table 2 is likely stronger than the global average knutti and sedláček 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 similar projected changes in the temperature have been reported based on different scenarios and climate models in the indus river basin e g by ali et al 2015 mishra 2015 however a direct comparison with absolute results is difficult due to different scenarios and climate models the uncertain projected future climate changes press for the improvement of climate models for better future predictions the selected models are mostly different from the previous studies in the region khan and koch 2018 lutz et al 2016b however the range of projected changes have slight differences the differences in the selected set of models are due to a the consideration of local applicability perspectives to represent the changes in glacier storage based on water energy and mass balance and b the use of updated cmip6 scenarios which are considered better than their predecessors because of the reduced complexity improved resolutions and other protocols eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 xin et al 2020 from the results of projected glacio hydrology figs 7 and 8 it is evident that the selection of gcms might significantly influence the outputs except for the smaller sized glaciers all other glaciers show distinct futures under different possible future climatic conditions expected future meltwater contributions from selected glaciers also respond differently under the full range of distinct future projections as shown in fig 8 the overall behavior of glaciers is in line with several past studies in the region gao et al 2020b hock et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2013 rounce et al 2020 the tipping points of glaciers in the hindukush region gilgit sub basin have already been passed and glaciers in the western himalaya will cross their tipping point during 2060 2080 i e before 2100 whereas the glaciers in the karakoram region will not face their tipping points before 2100 such a diverse expected glacio hydrological future can only be projected if a suitable set of gcms is selected covering the full range of possible future climate changes 4 1 uncertainties and their check the issues in the availability of gcms their temporal and spatial resolutions and number of future scenarios under different experiments may be the sources of uncertainty firstly at present not all the data from all gcms are available in the cmip6 archive therefore in the first step the gcms with data at the monthly scale were included then only those gcms which have daily data were chosen for further shortlisting the selection in this manner may have some impact on the overall procedure in the round 1 however it was tried to be very close to the boundary conditions based on the statistical tools used in the study the selection of outliers was avoided by choosing the 10th and 90th percentile eq 1 fig 3 a c contrasting to the selections made based on the extreme corners in previous studies e g in immerzeel et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 secondly all the selected gcms were resampled at a common resolution during the initial data wrangling which may pose some extent of uncertainty in the selection process however in cmip6 the climate models have a better and higher resolution than cmip5 eyring et al 2016 so the extent of uncertainty is expected to be very less in fact the use of cmip6 models in the case study is a plus point because it represents a substantial expansion over cmip5 eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 the models in cmip6 show an improvement in simulating the distribution of the climatological precipitation relative to the previous cmip5 models and they capture various indian and east asian monsoon characteristics very well gusain et al 2020 xin et al 2020 moreover a significant reduction in model bias is detected in cmip6 models gusain et al 2020 fourth the range of uncertainties in the projected temperature and precipitation based on the selected models were not very different as compared to the entire included cmip6 pool e g for precipitation 62 to 69 in the final set versus 55 to 70 in the initial pool the smaller differences were due to the exclusion of outliers this indicates that the multi perspective approach efficiently shortlisted a smaller set of gcms which can represent the full spectrum of future climate changes in the turc budyko water energy balance and change in glacier storage calculations the impact of groundwater percolation was not considered while it may have a slight effect on the representation and seasonal storage coron et al 2015 it is argued that the effect of groundwater percolation can be neutralized in the form of baseflow contribution over a multi year period immerzeel et al 2015 therefore its impact on overall water energy balance and change in glacier storage is considered neutralized for the 30 year historical period 1985 2014 in this study the study area is extensively glacierized and has typical vegetative soil and topographic characteristics hence the deviations from water and energy limits fig 4 a may be translated into glacier storage characteristics of the watershed fig 4 b it is important to mention that the precipitation used in the physical diagnosis is the sum of rain and snow fig 4 a also the etp used in aridity index does not exclude the energy consumed by melt when snowfall is considered there may be some differences in the energy and water terms involved zhang et al 2015 the energy consumed in melting process may have a slight effect on overall energy balance in glacierized catchments meanwhile information on the snow ratio would help in assessing the spatial distribution of runoff changes and their predictions the ability to conserves the linear spatial temporal and multi variable dependence structure of climate makes the dc method better than others supplementary fig s12 however the bias corrections may pose some uncertainties as they encounter certain limitations like they do not have any physical basis ehret et al 2012 it has been argued that the stationarity of correction factors is the main limitation and it is not the case in reality under changing climate ehret et al 2012 vannitsem 2011 4 2 advantages and implications for the studies dealing with the climate change impact assessments it is imperative to select the most suitable gcm or set of gcms because of the uncertainties in gcms and other limiting factors e g available time resources and computational capacities the proposed multi perspective approach is advantageous in shortlisting the best suited set of representative gcms talking of future perspectives it considers all the possible mean and extreme projections of future changes to represent the full spectrum of climate change as shown in fig 3 a c meanwhile it avoids the risk of missing any gcm with significant changes in both mean and extremes as shown in fig 3 d e the observed mass balance information is helpful to estimate the actual water balance and assess the meltwater contributions to streamflow and eventually correct the gcms for possible biases based on their actual location in the feasible zone of the turc budyko framework fig 4 a b for the local applicability perspectives the turc budyko component of the proposed approach is instrumental in identifying the actual under or over estimation in gcms based on the watershed water energy balance the under or over estimations in gcms can be translated into glacier storage change mass balance based on the rationality between the streamflow and glacier changes in a glacierized catchment shafeeque and luo 2020 this combination of water and energy limits and change in storage helps in selecting the most suitable set of gcms for further glacio hydrological applications at regional scales given the severity of expected impacts of climate change on glacio hydrology kraaijenbrink et al 2017 rounce et al 2020 and related socioeconomics farinotti et al 2019b immerzeel et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 it is imperative to consider the local applicability of gcms before forcing glacio hydrological models the proposed multi perspective approach can serve the purpose as evident by figs 7 and 8 and it also focuses on reducing the simulation task by shortlisting a smaller number of gcms from a greater pool as the selected set of gcms is based on multi perspective criteria including the full spectrum of future changes in mean and extreme values water energy and mass balance and statistical past performance evaluation thus such set of gcms can be applied for most kinds of glacio hydrological studies e g extreme events floods droughts glacier changes seasonal and annual water flows natural disasters like glacier surges and glacial lakes outburst flows glof among the others 5 conclusions in this study a multi perspective approach was proposed and applied in uib as a case study to select the best suited set of gcms for climate change assessments on glacio hydrology in this approach the future perspectives ensure that the selected gcms are representative of the full spectrum of projected changes in the mean and extreme climate cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet similarly the local applicability perspectives ensure that the selected gcms can represent the water energy balance changes in glacier storage and historical climatology in the region given the importance of glaciers involvement in hydrology the turc budyko component can account for such impact based on water energy and mass balance and thus assists in estimating the actual over or under estimation of precipitation and temperature in a gcm the proposed approach showed its capacity in selecting a set of smaller number of gcms from the cmip6 to compose the full spectrum of climate change ensembles which eventually reduces the glacio hydrological simulation task in the case study twelve gcms were shortlisted out of the initial pool of 105 while each gcm represents one projection corner cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet in uib a warmer and wetter future is projected with increased warm spells and extreme precipitation whereas decreased cold spells and consecutive dry days the selected models were different as compared to previous studies because a the gcm archive was different i e cmip6 versus cmip5 and b the scrutiny was based on the change in glacier storage to ensure the local applicability the area volume and length are projected to decrease under ensembles of shortlisted gcms at selected glaciers the projections reveal distinct impacts of possible future climate changes on glacio hydrology in uib in the turc budyko component of the proposed approach the impact of groundwater percolation and soil moisture was not considered explicitly while it was assumed to be neutralized with the baseflow for a multi year period the approach will be improved by including the indigenous socioeconomic indices considering the applications of impact assessment studies in glacierized river basins credit authorship contribution statement muhammad shafeeque

4478,the selection of future climate change scenarios may have issues in representing the full spectrum of climate projections in glacierized mountain regions where glaciers play an important role in hydrology thus the effect of glacier storage change must be considered in the selection approaches here a multi perspective approach was proposed to select climate models from cmip6 database considering the full spectrum of future climate change and effects of glaciers on hydrology this approach combines the envelope based approach ea past performance approach ppa and additional criteria to incorporate water energy balance and glacier storage change based on the turc budyko theory the approach physically diagnoses gcms by investigating their effects on glacier storage change compared to reference climate and observed mass balance data a step wise shortlisting and selection of appropriate climate models for the upper indus basin uib was made under three shared socioeconomic pathways ssps ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 based on a range of projected changes in mean values for four extreme future projections cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet b range of projected changes in climatic extremes c representation of water energy balance and storage change and d skill in representing historical climate the future projections indicate temperature and precipitation increase by 1 7 0 6 c and 7 5 3 3 1 3 c and 10 6 and 6 3 2 6 c and 22 13 under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 in 2071 2100 compared to 1985 2014 respectively the glacier area volume and length are projected to decrease by 22 33 51 63 and 13 22 under ensembled scenarios of full spectrum at selected glaciers the proposed multi perspective approach is advantageous in shortlisting a limited number of climate models representing the full range of possible future climatic conditions to assess the full range of expected impacts of climate changes on indigenous glacio hydrology such selection eventually reduces the glacio hydrological simulation task keywords cmip6 upper indus basin water energy balance ssps turc budyko glacio hydrology 1 introduction in mountain regions projections of future glacio hydrologic processes and water availability under climate change are forced by the outputs of general circulation models gcms in coupled model intercomparison project cmip at different phases eyring et al 2016 meehl et al 2007 taylor et al 2012 the projected results are further used in policymaking and for pro active management and mitigation decisions to cope with the predicted impacts gao et al 2018 sorg et al 2014 remarkable uncertainties are recognized among the projected climate changes by different gcms and transfer to the projected glacio hydrological results which make the reliability of impact assessments questionable woldemeskel et al 2014 multiple gcms are therefore adopted to account for both ensemble mean and variation scope of them the latest released cmip phase 6 cmip6 database includes several gcms with multiple scenarios https www wcrp climate org wgcm cmip wgcm cmip6 the full spectrum indicates the projected future climate change domain which is defined in two dimensions one from the wettest to driest by precipitation and another from the warmest and coldest by temperature this domain is contained within four combinations of the most warm cold and wet dry which represents the large unavoidable and locally increasing future climate uncertainties joetzjer et al 2013 knutti and sedláček 2012 lutz et al 2016b full coverage of the domain is believed to be inefficient with consideration of the limited time and constraints in available human and computational resources a small number of gcms are usually selected for such a purpose however the selection process is not straightforward how to select proper gcms with the least number from the huge cmip6 database is the first and crucial step the selected gcms should represent the full spectrum of future climate changes and corresponding glacio hydrological simulation be maintained at least extent at the same time several approaches have been introduced to deal with such a selection of representative climate models for sector specific applications for example past performance approach biemans et al 2013 pierce et al 2009 envelope based approach and extreme changes approach immerzeel et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 warszawski et al 2014 cluster analysis algorithms cannon 2015 houle et al 2012 model dependence approach evans et al 2013 comparisons with simulated low flows van huijgevoort et al 2014 and comparison with cumulative potential groundwater recharge rossman et al 2018 each approach mentioned above has its advantages and disadvantages as well for example the selection of gcms based on high performance in representing history can miss the possible futures e g biemans et al 2013 pierce et al 2009 on the other hand the envelope based approach neglects a model s ability to simulate the climate and only the mean annual changes are the criteria for model selection the decisive criteria for selecting the gcms depend on the characteristics of the region of interest and the study s ultimate goals wilby 2017 the glaciered catchment presents some features that are unique due to the involvements of glaciers which respond sensitively to climate changes in both precipitation and temperature and affect the hydrological processes as a consequence in addition to precipitation the glacier melt can be considered an additive input source to the watershed water balance this is a noticeable aspect of the glaciered catchment distinguishing from a non glaciered one although glaciers play a crucial role in the hydrology of glacierized basins researchers did not consider the impact of change in glacier storage in their analysis jury et al 2020 khan and koch 2018 lutz et al 2016b change in glacier storage has a critical effect on hydrology and it depends on the water energy balance of the watershed the involvement of glacier change complicates the hydrological processes on the other hand observations of glacier changes may provide additional criteria for selecting the suitable gcms which comes from understanding to the watershed scale water energy balance derived from the generally so called budyko s theoretical framework budyko 1963 based on this framework formulas were empirically designed or theoretically derived and establish analytical relationships among annual streamflow q precipitation p potential etp and actual evapotranspiration eta in most cases the water storage change among the water balance components is assumed negligible carmona et al 2014 ning et al 2018 sivapalan et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 the turc budyko theory which is one among quite a few others based on turc 1954 and budyko 1974 deals with water and energy balance at the watershed and annual scale coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 applied to the glacierized watershed where glacier storage change is obvious the approaches formulated as such should reflect the watershed water imbalance when watershed water storage change is neglected a q must not be negative i e q 0 b q must not be less than the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration i e q p etp and c q must be less than the available precipitation i e q p andréassian and perrin 2012 however in glacierized watersheds the meltwater is involved in the water balance therefore considering the glacial storage change can provide useful information when glacier storage changes happen and meltwater releases to streamflow the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow will go beyond the principles mentioned above the available approaches have several drawbacks when applied individually as mentioned above possibly incorporation of this section into the present workflows may be helpful for selecting the suitable gcms for a glaciered catchment in this study it is hypothesized that multi perspective criteria might assist in shortlisting the most suitable set of gcms which can represent the full spectrum of future climate and local applicability especially the influence of glaciers on the watershed hydrology this work is thus 1 to propose a multi perspective approach to select a set of representative climate models from cmip6 for the glaciered catchments and 2 to apply the approach to upper indus basin uib to test its performance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the uib is highly glacierized with a total area of 173 435 km2 which spans over the high elevation hindukush himalaya karakorum mountains fig 1 about 13 545 glaciers with 19 328 km2 area glacier area ratio gar 11 are present in uib rgi consortium 2017 glacier and permanent snowmelt contribute 70 of streamflow in uib lutz et al 2016a tahir et al 2011 the multi source climate system in uib is unique and it has a strong relationship with the elevation the temperature decreases with the elevation whereas precipitation increases with elevation up to a specific elevation and then starts decreasing almost 67 of precipitation falls in winter due to westerlies hewitt 2007 and the rest in summer due to monsoons the average annual corrected precipitation in uib is 593 mm yr 1 shafeeque et al 2019 the maximum precipitation region is located between 3900 and 6600 masl future changes in temperature and precipitation will impact the glacier melt and disturb the timing and magnitudes of the water availability in the basin extreme events like floods wijngaard et al 2017 and droughts natural disasters like glacier surges and glacial lakes outburst flows glof will be more frequent in the future 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 reference data precipitation and temperature the problem of low density and uneven distribution of meteorological stations is huge common and unavoidable in most alpine regions isotta et al 2015 same in uib the observed meteorological data were collected from the water and power development authority wapda of pakistan the elevation of uib ranges between 300 8569 masl while the meteorological stations are located below 5000 masl with an average elevation of 3100 m supplementary table s1 no observed data at above 5000 masl are available which is an unavoidable limitation in this region winiger et al 2005 instead gridded precipitation datasets were used as a proxy in this region immerzeel et al 2015 however the gridded datasets have issues capturing the actual picture of the climate in the region palazzi et al 2013 shafeeque et al 2019 as previous studies basist et al 1994 bookhagen and burbank 2006 hu et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 johansson and chen 2003 yoon et al 2019 pointed out that precipitation is largely affected by topography the low elevation meteorological stations were used to correct the datasets with the topographic factors considered however the stations at lower locations might not represent the higher elevation precipitation therefore using such station data for performance evaluation may induce uncertainty in the analyzed results several previous studies in the region have corrected the precipitation using reverse modeling approaches dahri et al 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2019 taking glaciers vertical gradients and spatial variations of precipitation into account shafeeque et al 2019 prepared a dataset based on the corrected aphrodite and trmm datasets in the dataset aphrodite precipitation covers the period from 1985 2000 and trmm from 2001 2014 the details of the preparation of the corrected precipitation dataset are referred to shafeeque et al 2019 similarly another gridded dataset princeton global meteorological forcing

chosen for the climate model selection supplementary table s4 the first shortlisting for screening the gcms from the cmip database requires that the climate models provide daily data covering the history and future scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 supplementary table s5 the selected gcm scenarios establish the initial pool for the multi perspective approach described in the following section all the data are resampled to a common resolution 0 25 0 25 2 3 multi perspective approach fig 2 describes the step wise procedure adopted in the proposed multi perspective approach round 1 and 2 are based on the available envelope based approach round 3 added the watershed water energy formula to the workflow as described in fig 2 b round 4 finalizes the screening of the gcms based on historical performance for further bias correction and downscaling each step in the workflow is briefed as follows round 1 envelope based approach a projected changes in climatic means the annual precipitation and temperature changes were calculated for average values during 2071 2100 referenced to 1985 2014 the climate data operator cdo https code mpimet mpg de projects cdo was used for initial wrangling and extraction and then other calculations were performed in rstudio the projected changes in precipitation and temperature by the gcms in the initial pool defined a full spectrum domain its four corners i e cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet were extracted fig 2 a the adoption of the 10th and 90th percentile avoids the selection of outliers a percentile rank score was calculated to select the representative gcms within the proximity of each projection corner as following 1 rank ea 1 p i t p j t 2 p i p p j p 2 where rankea 1 represents the proximity distance of each gcm from the coroner 10th or 90th percentile pt and pp represent the change in temperature and precipitation respectively the subscript i and j represent the entire ensemble and individual model respectively from each corner four models with the lowest distance were selected for each ssp additional consideration was made while selecting the corner gcms based on the availability of daily data required at later stages of analysis and final application round 2 envelope based approach b projected changes in climatic extremes the climate models were shortlisted based on the projected extreme changes using four etccdi indices peterson 2005 two etccdi i e cold spell duration index csdi and warm spell duration index wsdi were adopted for temperature similarly precipitation due to extremely wet days r99ptot and consecutive dry days cdd were used for precipitation rclimdex software package https github com eccc cdas rclimdex was used to calculate etccdi indices and then percent changes in selected etccdi were calculated averaged over 30 years between 1985 and 2014 and 2071 2100 using daily outputs of the selected gcms for each year the percent changes were then averaged over the entire study area round 3 representation of water energy balance and change in glacier storage the realistic closure of water energy balance was tested using gcm climate evapotranspiration observed runoff and mass balance in uib then a skill score was calculated based on the water energy balance state and change in glacier storage long term water yield or runoff coefficient q p was plotted as a function of long term aridity index p etp i e q p f p etp coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 all three limits in the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot are based on the water balance equation of a water tight conservative catchment the water balance equation for a conservative catchment can be written as follows 2 p q α et p w h e r e α 1 the etp was calculated for observed and gcms historical period based on the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 using drought indices calculator drinc v1 7 software tigkas et al 2014 daily maximum and minimum temperatures from each gcm were used to calculate etp the point representing a catchment different positions in the plot for different gcms that falls within the feasible domain is considered a realistic or true watershed a feasible domain is an area below or equal to the water limit and above or equal to the energy limit fig 2b if a data point falls above the water limit i e q p or below the energy limit then it is called gaining or leaky catchment fig 2 b respectively andréassian and perrin 2012 in glacierized catchments the water balance equation can be written as 3 δ s δ t p q et a m b where δ s eta and mb represent the change in storage actual evapotranspiration and net mass balance contribution to the water balance of watershed respectively based on the literature data the average mass balance was found 0 17 m w e yr 1 in uib it is important to mention that water storage in soil and percolation were assumed neutralized in this calculation it has been argued that the baseflow contributions to the total runoff may compensate these terms over a multi year period immerzeel et al 2015 the actual et based on gcm data et a gcm was estimated using the following relationship 4 et a gcm et a m et p m et p gcm where et p gcm and et a gcm represent the estimated potential and actual evapotranspiration for a gcm respectively while et p m and et a m are the potential and actual evapotranspiration which are used as reference et data respectively calculated et p gcm and et a gcm are presented in supplementary fig s8 the actual over or under estimation can be calculated based on the change in storage when a glacierized catchment falls in the gaining zone q p it implies that there must be an additional water term that contributes to total runoff therefore in this case δ s 0 fig 2 b the meltwater contributions to total runoff highlight that higher precipitation is required to sustain such glacier systems hence the precipitation in that gcm is underestimated compared to the actual water input in a glacierized catchment on the other hand in the case of the leaky catchment when the runoff is less than the available energy it implies that a part of total runoff is missing from the water balance or the temperature is very low underestimated etp or the precipitation is overestimated in glacierized catchments the missing water can be stored in the form of a positive mass balance therefore in such cases δ s 0 fig 2 b while calculating the skill score the gcms fall within the gaining or leaky domain got 50 weight based on water energy state and 50 for glacier storage changes at each projection corner round 4 past performance approach statistical comparisons precipitation and temperature data from the selected gcms after round 3 were then validated for past performance against corrected precipitation and temperature datasets in uib for 1985 2014 the gcms were ranked based on the performance to represent the monthly and seasonal distributions and annual variations in average precipitation sums and average temperature the statistical indices are used to rank the gcms which include mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse percent bias pbias ratio of standard deviations rsd nash sutcliffe efficiency nse index of agreement d coefficient of persistence cp correlation coefficient cc coefficient of determination r2 and kling gupta efficiency kge taylor s diagrams taylor 2001 were used to present the comparison results visually 2 4 bias correction and downscaling bias correction and downscaling for the selected gcms were then performed they were bias corrected through the cmhyd software https swat tamu edu software cmhyd there are five bias correction methods available in cmhyd this study adopted the widely used delta change dc bosshard et al 2011 gellens and roulin 1998 graham et al 2007 luo et al 2018 lutz et al 2014 moore et al 2008 which bias corrects the projected climatic factors based on the historical statistics and thus conserves the linear spatial temporal and multi variable dependence structure in the future climate this feature of dc should be noticed before it is applied maraun 2016 the bias corrected gcms were further downscaled to 1 km resolution using the anusplin package https fennerschool anu edu au research products anusplin based on 1 km dem 2 5 glacio hydrological simulations ensembles of the selected cmip6 scenarios were used to simulate glacio hydrological processes in uib by the oggm open global glacier model maussion et al 2019 oggm simulates glacier dynamics explicitly based on

that comes from the calibration based on 250 glaciers around the globe https cluster klima uni bremen de github crossval and claims that the default parameters can produce reliable outputs world widely this study adopted the default parameter database the simulated results were evaluated by available observations of glacier area length and volume the assessment statistics showed an outstanding efficiency supplementary fig s24 3 results 3 1 future changes in mean climate in round 1 48 gcms out of 105 were selected as representatives of the full spectrum of future climate changes supplementary table s6 as expected the variation range of climate change increases with ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 fig 3 the temperature changes ranged from 2 86 9 82 c 0 72 5 39 c 0 36 3 41 c for ssp585 ssp245 and ssp126 respectively similarly the precipitation changes ranged from 7 36 58 75 0 18 36 90 and 1 85 20 88 for ssp585 ssp245 and ssp126 respectively the differing degrees of clustering in the scatter plots highlight the apparent differences in the ranges fig 3 a c the models were located closer to the cold dry and warm wet corner for all three ssps it is important to mention that the spatial heterogeneity was not considered in this step because the values were averaged for the entire study area 3 2 future changes in climatic extremes in round 2 a combined rank of mean and extreme temperature and precipitation changes was used to scrutinize the climate models between 2071 and 2100 and 1985 2014 the advantage of selection based on the combined score is that it avoids selecting models showing the greatest changes in only one of them it was also noted that models that projected large changes in mean values also projected the largest changes in extreme values for example canesm5 r1i1p1f1 and canesm5 r1i1p2f1 showed the highest increase in r99ptot and wsdi for both ssp245 and ssp585 respectively table 1 these models showed the greatest changes in mean temperature and precipitation fig 3 d e this direct relationship between the values of mean and extreme changes ensured that the model selection during the first round did not miss the models with important changes in the extreme values after the round 2 based on the combined total rank for changes in mean and extreme climate supplementary fig s9 three models at each corner of every ssp were selected for further processing 3 3 water energy balance and change in storage in round 3 the shortlisted models were further scrutinized based on the water energy and glacier storage change using a non dimensional representation of physical water energy balance in a watershed from 1985 2014 fig 4 the gcms with very low historical precipitation broke the water limit and were fallen within the gaining domain i e the water energy balance state was unrealistic for such gcms in uib for example canesm5 r2i1p1f1 p 294 mm yr 1 in fig 4 a on the other hand the gcms with very high precipitation or very low etp i e low temperature were out of energy limit and fallen within the leaky domain i e they represented an unrealistic state of water energy balance for example nesm3 r2i1p1f1 etp 320 mm yr 1 in fig 4 a the δ s ranged from 299 to 187 mm y 1 for all the included models fig 4 b the calculated δ s highlighted the actual under and over estimations in gcms 19 142 mm yr 1 the models that broke the water limit showed a negative change δ s 0 or underestimation 152 126 mm yr 1 whereas a positive change in storage δ s 0 or overestimation 74 65 mm yr 1 was shown by the models that surpass the energy limit fig 4 a b one of the included gcms nesm3 r2i1p1f1 was found out of the energy limit i e q was less than the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration the the calculated skill score fig 4 c was based on the state of water energy balance gaining leaky or true and the proximal distance from the location of the point representing δ s 0 while a higher skill score represents closer proximity in this step we had to choose two models at each corner for every ssp following the rule we chose canesm5 r1i1p1f1 at the warm wet corner for ssp245 and ssp585 however it was out of the water limit i e the runoff was greater than precipitation 38 it implies that this gcm underestimated precipitation in the historical period given the important meltwater contributions to streamflow the negative change in storage will be higher representing a higher glacier loss in the future however for future projections it was noted that this gcm showed a significant increase in precipitation for all the ssps 10 to 36 and occupied the warm wet corner based on such evidence it is expected that this gcm may overcome the underestimated bias in the future climate the uncertainties in the p q mb and et used in the water balance approach may cause uncertainty in the analysis the contributions of different sources of uncertainties need to be quantified separately in order to understand where to focus the resources therefore uncertainties related to the parameters in eq 3 were quantified to estimate the overall uncertainty in water energy balance and calculated change in glacier storage the distributions of p and eta fig 4 d are the average of all included gcms and reference data supplementary figs s10 and s11 the uncertainty in average p and eta values was 2 and 3 respectively meanwhile the average p and eta were 5 and 17 different from reference precipitation and esri actual evapotranspiration the calculated average δ s might be affected by 75 21 390 and 41 due to the uncertainties in p eta q and mb respectively fig 4 e the overall uncertainty in δ s 63 was a combined effect of all the uncertainties in the water energy balance components in the glacierized watershed 3 4 monthly seasonal and annual variations in round 4 gcms were shortlisted based on the differences in mimicking the monthly seasonal and annual precipitation and temperature variations over 1985 2014 fig 5 a f ten different statistical indices were used to estimate the gcms skill in representing the reference climate at different scales all gcms showed an excellent correlation cc 0 9 with the monthly reference data while the correlation between the average reference and gcm summer temperature was around 0 5 fig 5 a b the gcm temperature was mostly negatively biased with the reference temperature ranging from 155 1 to 28 6 for all included models supplementary table s7 an under satisfactory performance of gcm precipitation was identified in representing the distribution and variations of reference precipitation fig 5 d f some of the included gcms even showed a negative correlation with reference data at seasonal and annual scales ranging between 0 24 to 0 46 the sums of gcm precipitation during monsoon months jun sep for most of the gcms were higher than the reference precipitation at the seasonal scale the overall bias ranged between 75 to 73 for all included models at all scales supplementary table s8 the final skill score was the weighted average of all the skill scores calculated based on the statistical indices for both precipitation and temperature at all scales i e monthly seasonal and annual fig 5 g finally the selected pool of gcms was shrunk to four gcms for every ssp 3 5 future climate the future climate scenarios were composed after bias correction and downscaling the selected models using the dc method table 2 based on the selected models the future temperature changes will range between 1 04 c and 9 43 c under the coldest and warmest scenarios for all the ssps in uib up to 2100 the average change in temperature will be 1 7 0 6 c 3 3 1 1 c and 6 3 2 2 c under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 similarly the future projected changes in precipitation ranged between 2 48 and 36 3 under the driest to wettest scenarios for all ssps in uib up to 2100 respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 the average annual precipitation will change by 6 6 3 9 9 9 5 6 and 21 9 11 7 respectively for ssp126 and ssp245 the cold dry corner showed less precipitation increase than the warm dry corner whereas for ssp585 the opposite was true based on the selected gcms the mean annual temperature will be 7 0 0 6 c 8 6 1 1 c and 11 6 2 2 c under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 in uib respectively fig 6 similarly the average temperature changes at cd cw wd and ww projection corners will be 2 6 c 2 5 c 4 4 c and 5 6 c compared to the reference period respectively under ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 the average annual precipitation will be 633 23 mm yr 1 654 33 mm yr 1 and 725 70 mm yr 1 in uib by the end of the 21st century respectively fig 6 3 6 future glacio hydrology for the selected glaciers the glacier area volume and length are projected to decrease averagely by 22 33 51 63 and 13 22 while ela to increase by 4 19 under ensembled scenarios very distinct impacts of future climate change were projected on glacier geometry changes under different future climatic conditions fig 7 a d the maximum changes up to 92 reduction in glacier volume occurred for the glaciers with small area sizes supplementary fig s27 for most glaciers the glacier geometries changes showed a sharper decrease after the 2060 s indicating a faster retreat and possible tipping points for some glaciers e g glaciers in the western himalayas it is also important to mention that the ensembles for ssp245 and ssp585 similarly impacted most glaciers this behavior was due to the inclusion of a common gcm with a faster temperature increase i e canesm5 in the ensembles at their warm wet projection corner table 2 a faster glacier retreat under canesm5 has also been projected for other mountain glaciers in neighboring regions e g dongkemadi glacier in the tanggula mountains gao et al 2020a the annual changes in glacier water storage were compared based on the results of oggm forced by ensembles of cd cw wd and ww projection corners to explore the role of glaciers as water resources the negative changes in the glacier water storage indicate the meltwater contributions to the total runoff in the respective month for any glacier fig 8 the integration of monthly values gives the annual changes in glacier water resources the storage changes for selected glaciers in the zanskar and astore sub basins durung drong kungi and toshian were almost similar under ensembles of projection corners fig 8 indicating similar impacts of climate change on future water resources the glaciers located in the gilgit sub basin ghalsapar and mushk bar will contribute lesser glacier meltwater in the future than the historical period indicating that their tipping points peak water huss and hock 2018 have already been passed this might be due to their small sizes supplementary table s9 the tipping point of the glaciers located in the zanskar and astore sub basins are projected to occur during 2060 2080 the tipping points for all the remaining glaciers are expected to occur after 2100 moreover the cd and cw corners had similar impacts on the meltwater contributions while the contributions will be higher under ensembles of wd and ww for the remaining selected glaciers in uib this highlights that glacier meltwater is more sensitive to change in temperature than precipitation the behavior of glaciers located in the karakoram is in line with the findings of previous studies gao et al 2020b immerzeel et al 2013 4 discussions the objective of the study is to propose an advanced multi perspective approach for an efficient selection of a representative set of gcms for climate change impact assessments in glacierized watersheds the multi perspective approach was applied in uib as a case study for selecting cmip6 scenarios to project climate change impacts on glacio hydrology the hypothesis has been proved true that multi perspective criteria might shortlist the most suitable set of gcms which eventually reduces the workload for glacio hydrological simulation in the climate change impact assessment studies the introduction of the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot andréassian and perrin 2012 coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 into the multi perspective approach is advantageous to identify the actual under and over estimation in gcms the combination of water energy and mass balance is a simpler and effective method for assessing the meltwater contributions and changes in glacier storage fig 4 as compared to the positive degree days and snow accumulation under a constant value of average temperature jury et al 2020 used as a proxy to detect the total melt and accumulation the q p et and mb are usually measured and can easily be available for the physical diagnosis of gcms given the important role of glaciers in the hydrology of glacierized catchments the selection of gcms based on water energy and mass balance is also advantageous compared to the selection based on groundwater recharge van huijgevoort et al 2014 and only simulated flows van huijgevoort et al 2014 in addition to identifying the under and over estimation of precipitation in any gcm the aridity index on the abscissa in the turc budyko plot helps identify wetter and drier characteristics of a watershed for gcm temperature and precipitation this information might be helpful when gcms are used to force hydrological models for future drought and flood analysis the water limit helps identify the additional water term in the water balance or missing water input coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 under the gaining state the projected hydrology will be underestimated or projected negative changes in glaciers will be very high on the other hand under the leaky state the projected hydrology will be overestimated or will result in higher positive glacier storage and it may simulate implausible positive mass balance conditions in glacio hydrological modeling therefore scrutinizing the gcms representing very high glacier changes or gaining leaky states is an efficient feature of the multi perspective approach the representation of a real change in glacier storage by gcm historical climate is critically important in uib because 70 of streamflow is contributed by meltwater zhang et al 2013 while considerable mass loss has been projected under future climate change rounce et al 2020 in such situations the multi perspective approach is handy to choose the best suited set of gcms for hydrological simulations in highly glacierized mountain regions the downscaled gcm ensembles for ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 show that the future climate is highly uncertain in the uib the average warming in the uib 1 04 to 9 43 c between 1985 and 2014 and 2071 2100 table 2 is likely stronger than the global average knutti and sedláček 2012 kraaijenbrink et al 2017 similar projected changes in the temperature have been reported based on different scenarios and climate models in the indus river basin e g by ali et al 2015 mishra 2015 however a direct comparison with absolute results is difficult due to different scenarios and climate models the uncertain projected future climate changes press for the improvement of climate models for better future predictions the selected models are mostly different from the previous studies in the region khan and koch 2018 lutz et al 2016b however the range of projected changes have slight differences the differences in the selected set of models are due to a the consideration of local applicability perspectives to represent the changes in glacier storage based on water energy and mass balance and b the use of updated cmip6 scenarios which are considered better than their predecessors because of the reduced complexity improved resolutions and other protocols eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 gusain et al 2020 xin et al 2020 from the results of projected glacio hydrology figs 7 and 8 it is evident that the selection of gcms might significantly influence the outputs except for the smaller sized glaciers all other glaciers show distinct futures under different possible future climatic conditions expected future meltwater contributions from selected glaciers also respond differently under the full range of distinct future projections as shown in fig 8 the overall behavior of glaciers is in line with several past studies in the region gao et al 2020b hock et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2013 rounce et al 2020 the tipping points of glaciers in the hindukush region gilgit sub basin have already been passed and glaciers in the western himalaya will cross their tipping point during 2060 2080 i e before 2100 whereas the glaciers in the karakoram region will not face their tipping points before 2100 such a diverse expected glacio hydrological future can only be projected if a suitable set of gcms is selected covering the full range of possible future climate changes 4 1 uncertainties and their check the issues in the availability of gcms their temporal and spatial resolutions and number of future scenarios under different experiments may be the sources of uncertainty firstly at present not all the data from all gcms are available in the cmip6 archive therefore in the first step the gcms with data at the monthly scale were included then only those gcms which have daily data were chosen for further shortlisting the selection in this manner may have some impact on the overall procedure in the round 1 however it was tried to be very close to the boundary conditions based on the statistical tools used in the study the selection of outliers was avoided by choosing the 10th and 90th percentile eq 1 fig 3 a c contrasting to the selections made based on the extreme corners in previous studies e g in immerzeel et al 2013 sorg et al 2014 secondly all the selected gcms were resampled at a common resolution during the initial data wrangling which may pose some extent of uncertainty in the selection process however in cmip6 the climate models have a better and higher resolution than cmip5 eyring et al 2016 so the extent of uncertainty is expected to be very less in fact the use of cmip6 models in the case study is a plus point because it represents a substantial expansion over cmip5 eyring et al 2016 gidden et al 2019 the models in cmip6 show an improvement in simulating the distribution of the climatological precipitation relative to the previous cmip5 models and they capture various indian and east asian monsoon characteristics very well gusain et al 2020 xin et al 2020 moreover a significant reduction in model bias is detected in cmip6 models gusain et al 2020 fourth the range of uncertainties in the projected temperature and precipitation based on the selected models were not very different as compared to the entire included cmip6 pool e g for precipitation 62 to 69 in the final set versus 55 to 70 in the initial pool the smaller differences were due to the exclusion of outliers this indicates that the multi perspective approach efficiently shortlisted a smaller set of gcms which can represent the full spectrum of future climate changes in the turc budyko water energy balance and change in glacier storage calculations the impact of groundwater percolation was not considered while it may have a slight effect on the representation and seasonal storage coron et al 2015 it is argued that the effect of groundwater percolation can be neutralized in the form of baseflow contribution over a multi year period immerzeel et al 2015 therefore its impact on overall water energy balance and change in glacier storage is considered neutralized for the 30 year historical period 1985 2014 in this study the study area is extensively glacierized and has typical vegetative soil and topographic characteristics hence the deviations from water and energy limits fig 4 a may be translated into glacier storage characteristics of the watershed fig 4 b it is important to mention that the precipitation used in the physical diagnosis is the sum of rain and snow fig 4 a also the etp used in aridity index does not exclude the energy consumed by melt when snowfall is considered there may be some differences in the energy and water terms involved zhang et al 2015 the energy consumed in melting process may have a slight effect on overall energy balance in glacierized catchments meanwhile information on the snow ratio would help in assessing the spatial distribution of runoff changes and their predictions the ability to conserves the linear spatial temporal and multi variable dependence structure of climate makes the dc method better than others supplementary fig s12 however the bias corrections may pose some uncertainties as they encounter certain limitations like they do not have any physical basis ehret et al 2012 it has been argued that the stationarity of correction factors is the main limitation and it is not the case in reality under changing climate ehret et al 2012 vannitsem 2011 4 2 advantages and implications for the studies dealing with the climate change impact assessments it is imperative to select the most suitable gcm or set of gcms because of the uncertainties in gcms and other limiting factors e g available time resources and computational capacities the proposed multi perspective approach is advantageous in shortlisting the best suited set of representative gcms talking of future perspectives it considers all the possible mean and extreme projections of future changes to represent the full spectrum of climate change as shown in fig 3 a c meanwhile it avoids the risk of missing any gcm with significant changes in both mean and extremes as shown in fig 3 d e the observed mass balance information is helpful to estimate the actual water balance and assess the meltwater contributions to streamflow and eventually correct the gcms for possible biases based on their actual location in the feasible zone of the turc budyko framework fig 4 a b for the local applicability perspectives the turc budyko component of the proposed approach is instrumental in identifying the actual under or over estimation in gcms based on the watershed water energy balance the under or over estimations in gcms can be translated into glacier storage change mass balance based on the rationality between the streamflow and glacier changes in a glacierized catchment shafeeque and luo 2020 this combination of water and energy limits and change in storage helps in selecting the most suitable set of gcms for further glacio hydrological applications at regional scales given the severity of expected impacts of climate change on glacio hydrology kraaijenbrink et al 2017 rounce et al 2020 and related socioeconomics farinotti et al 2019b immerzeel et al 2020 mishra et al 2020 it is imperative to consider the local applicability of gcms before forcing glacio hydrological models the proposed multi perspective approach can serve the purpose as evident by figs 7 and 8 and it also focuses on reducing the simulation task by shortlisting a smaller number of gcms from a greater pool as the selected set of gcms is based on multi perspective criteria including the full spectrum of future changes in mean and extreme values water energy and mass balance and statistical past performance evaluation thus such set of gcms can be applied for most kinds of glacio hydrological studies e g extreme events floods droughts glacier changes seasonal and annual water flows natural disasters like glacier surges and glacial lakes outburst flows glof among the others 5 conclusions in this study a multi perspective approach was proposed and applied in uib as a case study to select the best suited set of gcms for climate change assessments on glacio hydrology in this approach the future perspectives ensure that the selected gcms are representative of the full spectrum of projected changes in the mean and extreme climate cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet similarly the local applicability perspectives ensure that the selected gcms can represent the water energy balance changes in glacier storage and historical climatology in the region given the importance of glaciers involvement in hydrology the turc budyko component can account for such impact based on water energy and mass balance and thus assists in estimating the actual over or under estimation of precipitation and temperature in a gcm the proposed approach showed its capacity in selecting a set of smaller number of gcms from the cmip6 to compose the full spectrum of climate change ensembles which eventually reduces the glacio hydrological simulation task in the case study twelve gcms were shortlisted out of the initial pool of 105 while each gcm represents one projection corner cold dry cold wet warm dry and warm wet in uib a warmer and wetter future is projected with increased warm spells and extreme precipitation whereas decreased cold spells and consecutive dry days the selected models were different as compared to previous studies because a the gcm archive was different i e cmip6 versus cmip5 and b the scrutiny was based on the change in glacier storage to ensure the local applicability the area volume and length are projected to decrease under ensembles of shortlisted gcms at selected glaciers the projections reveal distinct impacts of possible future climate changes on glacio hydrology in uib in the turc budyko component of the proposed approach the impact of groundwater percolation and soil moisture was not considered explicitly while it was assumed to be neutralized with the baseflow for a multi year period the approach will be improved by including the indigenous socioeconomic indices considering the applications of impact assessment studies in glacierized river basins credit authorship contribution statement muhammad shafeeque

4479,the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff has been recognized as a major source of non point source pollution and it is of great significance to predict the solute transfer process using a modeling approach tong et al 2010 developed a two layer soil mixing model with a soil mixing layer and a layer of ponding runoff water on soil surface the model has three critical parameters i e depth dmix of the soil mixing layer and incomplete mixing parameters α and γ that determine solute concentration in the ponding runoff layer and the soil layer beneath the soil mixing layer respectively

important at later time and it had strong interactions with α and dmix γ was found to be the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t all the time for case 1 however in case 3 γ

sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity indices 1 introduction the agricultural non point source pollution anpsp plays an increasingly more important role in the environmental pollution and has become the main pollution source of the surface water and sub surface water in the world the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff has been recognized as a major anpsp which has become a severe environmental pollution problem in china sun et al 2012 traditionally there are two methods to describe soil solute transfer into surface runoff named the lumped mixing layer approach and the diffusion approach wallach 1991 wallach and van genuchten 1990 wallach et al 1988 the influence of raindrops on the soil solute transfer into surface runoff process was not considered in the diffusion approach where the physical definition of the diffusion coefficient was not clear ahuja 1990 and the mixing layer approach became more and more popular li et al 2017 the mixing layer is a thin soil layer depth dmix under the soil surface where the soil water surface runoff water and rainwater mix instantaneously and completely or incompletely named complete mixing or incomplete mixing theory the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer is uniform and it is the only solute source of solute in surface runoff ahuja and lehman 1983 zhang et al 1997 the complete mixing layer theory with complete mixing parameters of α and γ related to the soil mixing layer and surface runoff and related to the soil mixing layer and underlying soil was used by many people to predict the soil solute transfer into surface runoff water steenhuis and walter 1980 zhang et al 1997 1999 2005 gao et al 2004 ahuja et al 1981 have showed that the degree of solute interaction between the runoff and soil surface decreased exponentially with soil depth below the soil surface most solutes in the surface runoff come from the degree of interaction zhang et al 1997 used three soils exposed to three consecutive simulated rains under dry wet and water table conditions with gypsum as a tracer placed at a 5 mm depth to evaluate the extent and nature of chemical transfer from soil solution to runoff and to determine the effective depth of the mixing layer it is concluded that there is solute diffusion from the underlying soil layer to the soil mixing layer under the condition of inhibiting infiltration people further applied the incomplete mixing layer theory with incomplete mixing parameters of α and γ tong et al 2010 2015 wu et al 2014 tong et al 2010 developed a two layer incomplete mixing layer theory to predict the soil solute transfer into the surface runoff where the simulated solute concentrations in surface runoff were in good agreement with the observed data using best fitting method but there are three important uncertain parameters of dmix α and γ in their model how to determine these uncertain parameters is very essential to the prediction accuracy generally we should rank the parameters importance to the predicted solute concentration in the surface runoff and then we can know how much effort we should put on which parameter loosvelt et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis sa which involves testing the relative impact of model parameters on the model predictions has been proved to be an efficient way to rank model parameters importance in prediction models and has been applied in many fields hamby 1994 had reviewed techniques for parameter sa of environmental models and coyle et al 2003 had discussed the sa measures employed in the field of economics saltelli et al 2005 2012 had focused on sa in chemical models some studies have stated that sa can improve parameter calibration efficiency avoid overparameterization reduce model uncertainty aid in understanding model structure and generate more accurate model prediction saltelli et al 2008 in general sa methods can be grouped into two types local methods and global methods local sensitivity analysis is simple to operate while the drawback is that they cannot determine the interactions between parameters thus may result in a large bias of sensitivity analysis cai et al 2008 therefore in recent years global sensitivity analysis gsa has become popular for analyzing the parameters sensitivity of prediction models zhang et al 2013 there are many gsa methods such as morris screening method morris 1991 the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast method cukier et al 1973 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue hornberger and spear 1981 sobol s method sobol 1993 and so on among them the variance based sobol s methods have become one of the most widely used methods in gsa due to its simple form and calculation more recently the sobol s methods have been applied to hydrological models tang et al 2007a 2007b used sobol s method to a distributed hydrological watershed model termed as the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm and the sa results demonstrated that the method provides robust sensitivity rankings and that these rankings could be used to significantly reduce the number of parameters when calibrating the hl rdhm cibin et al 2010 used sobol s method to analyze the sensitivities of soil and water assessment tool swat models for two watersheds with different climatic settings and flow regimes by considering each parameter s individual contribution first order index foi and the total contribution total order index toi to the model output in terms of two commonly used statistical metrics i e root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the results indicated that modeled stream flows showed varying parameters sensitivity to model outputs in different climatic settings and flow regimes nossent et al 2011 presented a sobol s sa for flow simulations by a swat model of the river kleine nete with the objective to assess the foi second order index soi and toi based on sobol s method zhang et al 2013 had compared the sensitivity and interactions of storm water management model swmm model parameters under typical dry normal and wet years respectively dai et al 2017 had developed a new method to explore model output sensitivity to competing process models by integrating model averaging methods with sobol s method choi et al 2017 had presented the daily based morgan morgan finney dmmf model and used the sobol s method to investigate the relative importance of input parameters on the amount of surface runoff and sediment loss from an element however little attention has been paid to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff using gsa via sobol s method ranking the parameters importance and considering parameters interactions in order to rank the parameters importance parameters interactions and to improve the model accuracy for the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff in this study the sobol s methods were used to perform a gsa for dmix α and γ main parameters importance and all parameters interactions would be considered by evaluating foi soi the third order index doi toi and toi foi for the gsa the quantity of interest is the model output of solute concentrations in surface runoff under three study cases as follows initially unsaturated soil with controlled sub surface drainage initially saturated soil with controlled sub surface drainage and with restricted sub surface drainage which were denoted as study case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively the rest of the manuscript was organized as follows in section 2 the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff in tong et al 2010 and the parameters for initial conditions of three study cases were briefly introduced the gsa of sobol s method was provided in section 3 in section 4 the gsa study results via applying sobol s method to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff were analyzed and discussed major conclusions were given in section 5 2 prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff and study cases the prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff and corresponding laboratory experiments were described in detail in tong et al 2010 and only a brief description is given to make this paper self contained in tong et al 2010 the prediction model was a one dimensional two layer mathematical model where the solute were only considered to be transported vertically steenhuis and walter 1980 shown in fig 1 when rainfall started with the rate p cm min 1 the soil mixing layer was firstly saturated and then ponding water occurred on soil surface with rainfall event the ponding water depth was increasing until it reached the maximum depth hp cm then the surface runoff rate q cm min 1 happened and the ponding water depth was constant as hp the soil infiltration rate was i cm min 1 and the soil solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was cw μg cm 3 from the figure we can see that the upper layer was the whole mixing layer including the ponding runoff layer on soil surface and the soil mixing layer the lower layer was the underlying soil layer below the soil mixing layer between the soil mixing layer and the underlying soil layer soil solutes are transported by the upward diffusion and downward infiltration processes and γ was defined as the vector composite index of the downward infiltration and upward diffusion in addition the impact of raindrop on solute transport should be considered between the soil mixing layer and the ponding runoff layer and α represented the vector composite index of solute infiltration diffusion and raindrop impact disturbance between these two layers on soil surface when the upward moving solute mass is greater than the downward moving solute mass the incomplete mixing parameter α is positive otherwise α will be negative the concentration of soluble solutes in surface runoff water can never be negative so the value of the parameter α should vary between 0 and 1 the reason and range for the incomplete mixing parameter of γ was the same ahuja et al 1981 and zhang et al 1999 indicated that the soil mixing layer depth should be 2 to 3 mm and havis et al 1992 showed that the thickness of the exchange layer should be 0 52 to 0 57 cm under infiltration conditions and it was 0 9 to 1 0 cm under non infiltration conditions therefore in this paper the value of dmix was chosen to be 0 1 cm the soil soluble solute mass in the whole mixing layer can be expressed as following 1 m w c w α h w d mix θ s d mix θ s where mw was the soluble solute mass in the whole mixing layer per unit area μg cm 2 hw was the water depth in the whole mixing layer cm dmix within 0 1 cm was the soil mixing layer depth cm θs was the soil saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 the solute mass in the whole mixing layer was lost through downward infiltration water and surface runoff flux so the solute mass conservation equation at any time of rainfall event was 2 d m w t dt γ i c w t α q c w t before the ponding water occurs on soil surface the rainfall infiltrates to and saturates the soil mixing layer with the saturation time ts min as 3 t s d mix θ s θ 0 p where θ0 was the soil initial water content from the time ts to the ponding water occurs at the time tp min the rainfall infiltrates the soil mixing layer with i q and there was no surface runoff with q 0 so the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer from ts to tp was 4 c w t c 0 e x p γ 0 p t t s d mix θ s where c0 was the initial saturated soil solute concentration mg l 1 by substituting tp into equation 4 we can obtain the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer at time tp was 5 c w t p c 0 e x p γ 0 p t p t s d mix θ s from the tp to the surface runoff beginning time tr min the initial soil solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was equation 5 the average soil infiltration rate was assumed to be f1 cm min 1 so the ponding water depth at any time t was hp t p f1 t tp and there was no surface runoff with q 0 so the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was 6 c w t c w t p α p f 1 t t p d mix θ s d mix θ s γ f 1 α p f 1 by substituting tr into equation 6 we can obtain the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer at time tr min 7 c w t r c w t p α p f 1 t r t p d mix θ s d mix θ s γ f 1 α p f 1 equation 7 was also the initial solute concentration in the soil mixing layer from the time tr to the end of the rainfall event time te min after tr the maximum ponding water depth was constant as hp and the average soil infiltration rate was f2 cm min so the solute concentration in surface runoff was 8 α c w t α c w t r e x p γ 0 f 2 α p f 2 t t r α h p d mix θ s αcw t in equation 8 was the prediction model output of solute concentration in surface runoff 2 1 study cases although gsa does not need observed data the laboratory experimental data as initial conditions for the three cases are needed so that the numerical simulations of the sensitivity analysis are realistic to obtain the physical parameters for the soil solute transfer into surface runoff three laboratory experiments of case 1 case 2 and case 3 were conducted detailed experimental conditions can be seen in tong et al 2010 and they would be described briefly here for completeness the experimental soil in a box for each experimental case was sand and the θs was 0 443 in the experiments the subsurface drainage outlet can set to a certain height from the box bottom to control subsurface drainage for cases 1 and 2 or restrict subsurface drainage for case 3 physical experimental parameters for these three study cases were shown in table 1 and they were c0 θs θ0 hp p f1 f2 tp tr te from the table we can see that the experimental soil was initially unsaturated with θ0 0 046 in case 1 and initially saturated with θ0 θs 0 443 in cases 2 and 3 under condition of restrict subsurface drainage in case 3 there was no subsurface drainage water with f 2 0 after surface runoff occurred and f 1 0 017 cm min 1 while with controlled subsurface drainage f 1 0 012 cm min 1 f 2 0 007 cm min 1 in case 1 and f 1 0 032 cm min 1 f 2 0 032 cm min 1 in case 2 experiments lasted for 400 146 and 203 min for case 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 sobol s method sobol s method sobol 1993 is a gsa approach based on variance decomposition with certain physical parameters in table 1 and three model parameters of α γ and dmix predicted αcw t can be obtained from equation 8 which could also be represented in the following form 9 αcw t f α γ dmix in sobol s method the total variance of f d αcw t is decomposed into component variances from individual parameters and their interactions 10 d α c w t i d i i j d ij d 123 where di is the amount of variance due to the ith parameter with i 1 2 3 corresponded to α γ and dmix in this study and dij is the amount of variance due to the interaction between the ith and jth parameter with j 1 2 3 and j i the sensitivity of single parameter or parameter interaction i e sobol s sensitivity indices of different orders is then assessed based on their percentage contribution to the total variance d 11 f o i s i d i d 12 s o i s ij d ij d 13 t o i s ti 1 d i d where d i is the amount of variance due to all of the parameters except for the ith parameter si measures the sensitivity from the main effect of the ith parameter sij measures the sensitivity from the interactions between the ith and jth parameter and sti measures the main effect of the ith parameter and its interactions with all the other parameters there were three model parameters of α γ and dmix in this study so the third order index doi measuring the sensitivity from the interactions between the three parameters can be expressed as 14 d o i s 123 d 123 d t o i f o i s o i the variances in equation 10 can be evaluated using approximate monte carlo numerical integration particularly when the model is highly nonlinear and complex such as the prediction model of solute concentration in this study sobol s sensitivity indices have been shown to be more effective than other approaches in capturing the interactions between variables for highly nonlinear models tang et al 2007a 2007b model parameters of α γ and dmix were assumed to follow the uniform distribution u 0 1 and the monte carlo sample generated by a matlab built in function sobolset was used in this study 4 results and discussion overall computing foi soi and toi requires n m 2 model evaluations where n is the number of monte carlo samples and m is the number of parameters being analyzed in this study m 3 with model parameters of α γ and dmix the foi of the parameters α γ and dmix for one case i e case 1 with different monte carlo sample size of 1000 10000 100 000 and 300 000 were shown in the fig 2 from the figure we can see that the foi of the α γ and dmix became stable and converged when the monte carlo sample size was no less than 100000 which was used in our study considering the gsa accuracy and calculation cost it should be noted that the foi soi doi of the parameters α γ and dmix for each study case were converged with the monte carlo sample size of 100000 so only the foi of the α γ and dmix in study case 1 with different monte carlo sample size were presented in fig 2 as a representative here based on theses 100 000 sobol sequence data for α γ and dmix and the physical experimental parameters for each study case in table 1 the gsa results of the α γ and dmix to the predicted αcw t in equation 8 over time were obtained with the foi soi doi toi and toi foi of each parameter as described in section 3 the foi is the sensitivity from the main effect of one parameter α or γ or dmix the soi is sensitivity from the interactions between two parameters such as α and γ or α and dmix or γ and dmix the doi is the sensitivity from the interactions among three parameters α γ and dmix the toi is the main effect of the one parameter and its interactions with the other two parameters i e the main effect of α and its interactions with the γ and dmix it should be noted that the difference between the foi and toi measures the total interactive contribution of one parameter with the other two parameters denoting as toi foi 4 1 case 1 for the study case 1 with the initially unsaturated soil under the controlled subsurface drainage the foi of the γ were highest among the three parameters over all the time in fig 3 a indicating the model output of αcw t was the most sensitive to the γ and the α and dmix were insensitive while the foi of α and dmix had opposite variation trend and the sum of three parameters fois was less than 1 indicating that the interactions effect between the parameters i e soi or doi cannot be ignored similarly in fig 3 b the interaction between parameter γ and the other two parameters of α and dmix was large and the variation trends of αγ and γdmix were opposite this indicated that the parameter γ had a strong interaction with the other two parameters of α or dmix directly furthermore without γ the interaction between parameters α and dmix was very small in fig 3 b which further proved the strong sensitivity of parameter γ to the predicted αcw t indirectly this was because with the initially unsaturated soil in case 1 the downward soil infiltration rate is large which was the main way the solute in the soil mixing layer lost and affected the solute concentration lost from soil mixing layer to the in surface runoff consequently based on the physical meaning of γ the ratio of the downward infiltrated solute mass substracting the upward diffused solute mass to the downward infiltrated solute mass it was very sensitive to the predicted solute concentration in surface runoff and it was also why the parameters α and dmix was insensitive to the predicted αcw t and why the interaction values between the α and dmix over time was very small soil solute lost mainly via the downward soil infiltration water the cw t and αcw t decreased to very small values quickly so the foi of α and dmix varied oppositely and became small moreover the soi of γ and α varied oppositely to the soi of γ and dmix in fig 3 b which corresponded to the opposite variation trends between α and dmix for foi in fig 3 a the three parameters interaction doi in the fig 3 c had same variation trend with the soi of α and dmix after the tr in the fig 3 b and had same decrease trend with the soi of γ before the tr in the fig 3 a this was because after the tr α and dmix directly affected the predicted αcw t and before the tr with the small soi of α and dmix the doi decreased over time the toi of γ was highest and close to 1 in the fig 3 d which further verified that γ was the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t the toi of dmix decreased to a minimum value and then increased to a constant value with time while the toi of α increased and then decrease and then increase over time this was due to the more and more important interaction of γ α and dmix at later time the role of α and dmix became more and more important with increasing toi of α and dmix at later time in fig 3 d although the dmix was insensitive and not important for the predicted αcw t with small foi value the interactions between other parameters of γ and α was very important which lead to the same decreasing trends with the soi and doi of dmix at early time resulting in the decreasing toi of dmix at early time similarly the α was insensitive and not important with small foi value the interactions between other parameters of γ and dmix was very important the doi of dmix decreased but the soi of dmix increased at early time and then they decreased which leaded to the small increasing toi of α at early time and then decreased sharply while the interaction importance of one parameter with other parameters can be seen in the fig 3 e where toi foi was first decreased and then increased in case 1 and the increase time of toi foi was around the ponding water occurred on soil surface the reason may be that the soil in this case was initially unsaturated before the ponding water occurred on soil surface solutes mainly entered the deep soil layer with infiltration water which affects the solutes concentration lost to surface runoff from the soil mixing layer therefore the parameter γ played a major role on the model output of αcw t after the ponding water occurred on soil surface the amount of infiltration water entering the deep soil layer was reduced that was the independent influence of parameter γ on the predicted αcw t gradually decreased while the independent influence of the other two parameters on the model was negligible at later time while the parameters interaction related to γ on the model output αcw t gradually became more prominent this further represented the reason for variations of α and γ in fig 3 d and dmix in fig 3 c at later time this was because decreasing influence of γ on the predicted αcw t affected the influence of α and dmix on the predicted αcw t and interaction of γ with α or dmix became stronger at later time 4 2 case 2 for the study case 2 with initially saturated soil under condition of controlled sub surface drainage in fig 4 a the foi of γ and dmix increased at early time indicating γ and dmix became more and more important at early time and then the foi of γ and dmix gradually decreased at later time indicating γ and dmix became less and less important at later time the increase and decrease rates for the foi of dmix were larger than that of γ so the foi of dmix was larger than that of γ soon even though the former one was less at first and it became less again at later time conversely the foi of α decreased quickly at early time and then increased gradually at later time and the foi of α was the highest among these three parameters at first which suggested that α was the most sensitive and important to the predicted αcw t this was because with the initially saturated soil surface runoff occurred soon the predicted αcw t was most sensitive to α at first with decreasing solute concentration in the soil mixing layer solute in the soil mixing layer was the only solute source for the surface runoff this was why the foi of dmix increased at early time with controlled subsurface drainage much solute in the soil mixing layer lost to the downward infiltration water so γ became more and more important for the predicted αcw t with the increasing foi of γ at first with time solute concentration in the soil mixing layer and surface runoff became less and less so the dmix and γ did not have much influence on the αcw t and it became less and less important at later time the foi sum of α γ and dmix increased a little at the very early time and then decreased to about 0 2 indicating the parameter interactions were very strong at later time this was verified by the soi sum of α γ and dmix in fig 4 b where the soi sum had a converse variation trend with the foi sum decreasing a little at first and then increasing all the time with more than 0 5 at last and the soi of α and γ had similar variation trend with the soi sum decreasing a little at first and then increasing all the time and it became the highest among three interaction at later time indicating very strong interaction between α and γ for the predicted αcw t this was because at later time solute in the soil mixing layer was the only source for the surface runoff and the underlying soil if α became more important γ would became less important and vice versa this suggested that α variation would surely affect the γ variation and they interacted strongly the soi of α and dmix was the least in the fig 4 b at later time and this was because the α and dmix became less and less important for the predicted αcw t at later time but the soi of α and dmix gradually increased and was almost 0 1 suggesting a strong interaction between α and dmix at later time in fig 4 c the doi decreased a little at the very early time and then increased all the time this further verified that α γ and dmix had strong interaction at later time in fig 4 d the tois of α and γ decreased at early time and then increased soon and the toi of γ was the largest at later time followed by the toi of α indicating γ became more and more important and was the most important parameter for the predicted αcw t at later time followed by α this was similar to the foi of α and γ at later time and the toi of α was highest at first indicating α was the most important at first which was also similar to the foi of α while the toi of dmix increased at early time and decreased at later time and it became least at later time suggesting dmix became less and less important at later time this variation trend was the same with the foi of dmix the interaction importance of one parameter with other parameters was shown in fig 4 e where three values decreased at early time and increased at later time this indicated stronger and stronger interactions between other parameters at later time and it further proved variations of α γ and dmix in fig 4 b and 4 c similarly the reason for this strong interaction between parameter was described for fig 4 b and 4 c so it was not described here again 4 3 case 3 for the study case 3 with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage in fig 5 a the foi of γ was almost 0 with the secondary axis indicating γ was not important for the predicted αcw t and can be ignored this was because with no subsurface drainage water under condition of restricted subsurface drainage there was no downward infiltration water i γ was not used and not sensitive to the predicted αcw t the foi of α and dmix had opposite variation trend the former one with early decrease and later increase while the latter one with early increase and later decrease which was similar to the foi of α and dmix in case 2 of fig 4 a the reason for the fois of α and dmix variation was the same as explained for case 2 this was because with the initially saturated soil surface runoff occurred soon the predicted αcw t was most sensitive to α at first with decreasing solute concentration in the soil mixing layer it was the only source for the solute in surface runoff this was why the foi of dmix increased at early time the foi sum of α γ and dmix decreased at later time indicating increasing interaction between parameters at later time and this was verified by the opposite variation trend for the soi of α and dmix in fig 5 b similar to case 2 this suggested that α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time for case 3 which corresponded to the opposite variation trends of the fois for α and dmix the reason was also similar to case 2 since γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t the sots of γ and α and γ and dmix were close to 0 with the second axis in fig 5 b and the doi of α γ and dmix was close to 0 in fig 5 c expectedly this was also why the sum of sois for two parameters interactions was close to the soi of α and dmix in fig 5 b it was also the reason for the small toi of γ as close to 0 in fig 5 d in fig 5 d the variation trends of tois for α and dmix were similar to that for case 2 in fig 4 d with early decrease and later increase for α and early increase and later decrease for dmix which was also similar to corresponding variation trends of fois in fig 5 e the γ interactions with α and dmix was close to 0 since γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage it was also why α interactions with γ and dmix and dmix interactions with γ and α were the same with the soi of α and γ this further indicated that the predicted αcw t was sensitive to α and dmix comparing three cases for the initially unsaturated and saturated soils in cases 1 3 the fois of α and dmix varied oppositely and α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time this was because the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer showed a decreasing trend during the surface runoff process and eventually reached zero which leaded to complete mixing of solutes between the soil mixing layer and ponding runoff layer the mixing layer depth dmix and the parameter α affected the predicted αcw t at the same time which leaded to the stronger interaction between the parameters α and dmix under condition of subsurface drainage with downward infiltrated water in cases 1 and 2 γ was important for the predicted αcw t which was the most important at later time and it had strong interactions with α and dmix in each case according to the tois of α γ and dmix γ was found to be the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t in case 1 all the time with the initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage the change trends of the parameter interactions in case 2 and case 3 on the predicted αcw t were similar the only difference was that case 3 was the initially saturated soil under condition of restrict subsurface drainage without downward infiltration water so all the parameters related to the γ were not important to the model output of αcw t including the parameter γ and its interaction with other parameters therefore in case 3 the parameter γ can be set as a constant where predicted αcw t was affected by the parameters α and dmix and the parameters interactions was indicated by them 5 conclusions a gsa method via the sobol was applied to the prediction model of the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff by tong et al 2010 to determine the importance of parameters dmix α and γ for the predicted αcw t assessing the first order index foi total order index toi third order index doi toi and toi foi and the main parameters importance and all parameters interactions were analyzed three study experiments case 1 with initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage initially saturated soils under conditions of controlled and restricted subsurface drainage named cases 2 and 3 were used main conclusions can be obtained the importance of α γ and dmix for the predicted αcw t varied with time for the three cases for the initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage γ was the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t this was because with the initially unsaturated soil in case 1 the downward soil infiltration rate was large which was the main way the solute in the soil mixing layer lost and affected the solute concentration lost from the soil mixing layer to the surface runoff consequently under condition of subsurface drainage with downward infiltrated water for the initially unsaturated and saturated soils in cases 1 and 2 γ was important for the predicted αcw t which was the most important at later time and it had strong interactions with α and dmix in cases 1 3 the fois of α and dmix varied oppositely and α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time in other words the parameter importance of α will reduce the parameter importance of dmix to the predicted αcw t and vise versa in case 3 with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage water γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t with almost no interactions of γ with α or dmix where the parameter γ can be set as a constant the study results can provide reference for the control of anpsp however the experimental time was extended so the gsas of α γ and dmix via sobol were stable in this study using sobol s method to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff with real enough experimental time and obtain stable gsas of α γ and dmix is an issue can be done in future credit

4479,the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff has been recognized as a major source of non point source pollution and it is of great significance to predict the solute transfer process using a

sensitivity analysis sobol sensitivity indices 1 introduction the agricultural non point source pollution anpsp plays an increasingly more important role in the environmental pollution and has become the main pollution source of the surface water and sub surface water in the world the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff has been recognized as a major anpsp which has become a severe environmental pollution problem in china sun et al 2012 traditionally there are two methods to describe soil solute transfer into surface runoff named the lumped mixing layer approach and the diffusion approach wallach 1991 wallach and van genuchten 1990 wallach et al 1988 the influence of raindrops on the soil solute transfer into surface runoff process was not considered in the diffusion approach where the physical definition of the diffusion coefficient was not clear ahuja 1990 and the mixing layer approach became more and more popular li et al 2017 the mixing layer is a thin soil layer depth dmix under the soil surface where the soil water surface runoff water and rainwater mix instantaneously and completely or incompletely named complete mixing or incomplete mixing theory the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer is uniform and it is the only solute source of solute in surface runoff ahuja and lehman 1983 zhang et al 1997 the complete mixing layer theory with complete mixing parameters of α and γ related to the soil mixing layer and surface runoff and related to the soil mixing layer and underlying soil was used by many people to predict the soil solute transfer into surface runoff water steenhuis and walter 1980 zhang et al 1997 1999 2005 gao et al 2004 ahuja et al 1981 have showed that the degree of solute interaction between the runoff and soil surface decreased exponentially with soil depth below the soil surface most solutes in the surface runoff come from the degree of interaction zhang et al 1997 used three soils exposed to three consecutive simulated rains under dry wet and water table conditions with gypsum as a tracer placed at a 5 mm depth to evaluate the extent and nature of chemical transfer from soil solution to runoff and to determine the effective depth of the mixing layer it is concluded that there is solute diffusion from the underlying soil layer to the soil mixing layer under the condition of inhibiting infiltration people further applied the incomplete mixing layer theory with incomplete mixing parameters of α and γ tong et al 2010 2015 wu et al 2014 tong et al 2010 developed a two layer incomplete mixing layer theory to predict the soil solute transfer into the surface runoff where the simulated solute concentrations in surface runoff were in good agreement with the observed data using best fitting method but there are three important uncertain parameters of dmix α and γ in their model how to determine these uncertain parameters is very essential to the prediction accuracy generally we should rank the parameters importance to the predicted solute concentration in the surface runoff and then we can know how much effort we should put on which parameter loosvelt et al 2013 the sensitivity analysis sa which involves testing the relative impact of model parameters on the model predictions has been proved to be an efficient way to rank model parameters importance in prediction models and has been applied in many fields hamby 1994 had reviewed techniques for parameter sa of environmental models and coyle et al 2003 had discussed the sa measures employed in the field of economics saltelli et al 2005 2012 had focused on sa in chemical models some studies have stated that sa can improve parameter calibration efficiency avoid overparameterization reduce model uncertainty aid in understanding model structure and generate more accurate model prediction saltelli et al 2008 in general sa methods can be grouped into two types local methods and global methods local sensitivity analysis is simple to operate while the drawback is that they cannot determine the interactions between parameters thus may result in a large bias of sensitivity analysis cai et al 2008 therefore in recent years global sensitivity analysis gsa has become popular for analyzing the parameters sensitivity of prediction models zhang et al 2013 there are many gsa methods such as morris screening method morris 1991 the extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test fast method cukier et al 1973 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue hornberger and spear 1981 sobol s method sobol 1993 and so on among them the variance based sobol s methods have become one of the most widely used methods in gsa due to its simple form and calculation more recently the sobol s methods have been applied to hydrological models tang et al 2007a 2007b used sobol s method to a distributed hydrological watershed model termed as the hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrologic model hl rdhm and the sa results demonstrated that the method provides robust sensitivity rankings and that these rankings could be used to significantly reduce the number of parameters when calibrating the hl rdhm cibin et al 2010 used sobol s method to analyze the sensitivities of soil and water assessment tool swat models for two watersheds with different climatic settings and flow regimes by considering each parameter s individual contribution first order index foi and the total contribution total order index toi to the model output in terms of two commonly used statistical metrics i e root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the results indicated that modeled stream flows showed varying parameters sensitivity to model outputs in different climatic settings and flow regimes nossent et al 2011 presented a sobol s sa for flow simulations by a swat model of the river kleine nete with the objective to assess the foi second order index soi and toi based on sobol s method zhang et al 2013 had compared the sensitivity and interactions of storm water management model swmm model parameters under typical dry normal and wet years respectively dai et al 2017 had developed a new method to explore model output sensitivity to competing process models by integrating model averaging methods with sobol s method choi et al 2017 had presented the daily based morgan morgan finney dmmf model and used the sobol s method to investigate the relative importance of input parameters on the amount of surface runoff and sediment loss from an element however little attention has been paid to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff using gsa via sobol s method ranking the parameters importance and considering parameters interactions in order to rank the parameters importance parameters interactions and to improve the model accuracy for the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff in this study the sobol s methods were used to perform a gsa for dmix α and γ main parameters importance and all parameters interactions would be considered by evaluating foi soi the third order index doi toi and toi foi for the gsa the quantity of interest is the model output of solute concentrations in surface runoff under three study cases as follows initially unsaturated soil with controlled sub surface drainage initially saturated soil with controlled sub surface drainage and with restricted sub surface drainage which were denoted as study case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively the rest of the manuscript was organized as follows in section 2 the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff in tong et al 2010 and the parameters for initial conditions of three study cases were briefly introduced the gsa of sobol s method was provided in section 3 in section 4 the gsa study results via applying sobol s method to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into the surface runoff were analyzed and discussed major conclusions were given in section 5 2 prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff and study cases the prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff and corresponding laboratory experiments were described in detail in tong et al 2010 and only a brief description is given to make this paper self contained in tong et al 2010 the prediction model was a one dimensional two layer mathematical model where the solute were only considered to be transported vertically steenhuis and walter 1980 shown in fig 1 when rainfall started with the rate p cm min 1 the soil mixing layer was firstly saturated and then ponding water occurred on soil surface with rainfall event the ponding water depth was increasing until it reached the maximum depth hp cm then the surface runoff rate q cm min 1 happened and the ponding water depth was constant as hp the soil infiltration rate was i cm min 1 and the soil solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was cw μg cm 3 from the figure we can see that the upper layer was the whole mixing layer including the ponding runoff layer on soil surface and the soil mixing layer the lower layer was the underlying soil layer below the soil mixing layer between the soil mixing layer and the underlying soil layer soil solutes are transported by the upward diffusion and downward infiltration processes and γ was defined as the vector composite index of the downward infiltration and upward diffusion in addition the impact of raindrop on solute transport should be considered between the soil mixing layer and the ponding runoff layer and α represented the vector composite index of solute infiltration diffusion and raindrop impact disturbance between these two layers on soil surface when the upward moving solute mass is greater than the downward moving solute mass the incomplete mixing parameter α is positive otherwise α will be negative the concentration of soluble solutes in surface runoff water can never be negative so the value of the parameter α should vary between 0 and 1 the reason and range for the incomplete mixing parameter of γ was the same ahuja et al 1981 and zhang et al 1999 indicated that the soil mixing layer depth should be 2 to 3 mm and havis et al 1992 showed that the thickness of the exchange layer should be 0 52 to 0 57 cm under infiltration conditions and it was 0 9 to 1 0 cm under non infiltration conditions therefore in this paper the value of dmix was chosen to be 0 1 cm the soil soluble solute mass in the whole mixing layer can be expressed as following 1 m w c w α h w d mix θ s d mix θ s where mw was the soluble solute mass in the whole mixing layer per unit area μg cm 2 hw was the water depth in the whole mixing layer cm dmix within 0 1 cm was the soil mixing layer depth cm θs was the soil saturated volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 the solute mass in the whole mixing layer was lost through downward infiltration water and surface runoff flux so the solute mass conservation equation at any time of rainfall event was 2 d m w t dt γ i c w t α q c w t before the ponding water occurs on soil surface the rainfall infiltrates to and saturates the soil mixing layer with the saturation time ts min as 3 t s d mix θ s θ 0 p where θ0 was the soil initial water content from the time ts to the ponding water occurs at the time tp min the rainfall infiltrates the soil mixing layer with i q and there was no surface runoff with q 0 so the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer from ts to tp was 4 c w t c 0 e x p γ 0 p t t s d mix θ s where c0 was the initial saturated soil solute concentration mg l 1 by substituting tp into equation 4 we can obtain the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer at time tp was 5 c w t p c 0 e x p γ 0 p t p t s d mix θ s from the tp to the surface runoff beginning time tr min the initial soil solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was equation 5 the average soil infiltration rate was assumed to be f1 cm min 1 so the ponding water depth at any time t was hp t p f1 t tp and there was no surface runoff with q 0 so the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer was 6 c w t c w t p α p f 1 t t p d mix θ s d mix θ s γ f 1 α p f 1 by substituting tr into equation 6 we can obtain the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer at time tr min 7 c w t r c w t p α p f 1 t r t p d mix θ s d mix θ s γ f 1 α p f 1 equation 7 was also the initial solute concentration in the soil mixing layer from the time tr to the end of the rainfall event time te min after tr the maximum ponding water depth was constant as hp and the average soil infiltration rate was f2 cm min so the solute concentration in surface runoff was 8 α c w t α c w t r e x p γ 0 f 2 α p f 2 t t r α h p d mix θ s αcw t in equation 8 was the prediction model output of solute concentration in surface runoff 2 1 study cases although gsa does not need observed data the laboratory experimental data as initial conditions for the three cases are needed so that the numerical simulations of the sensitivity analysis are realistic to obtain the physical parameters for the soil solute transfer into surface runoff three laboratory experiments of case 1 case 2 and case 3 were conducted detailed experimental conditions can be seen in tong et al 2010 and they would be described briefly here for completeness the experimental soil in a box for each experimental case was sand and the θs was 0 443 in the experiments the subsurface drainage outlet can set to a certain height from the box bottom to control subsurface drainage for cases 1 and 2 or restrict subsurface drainage for case 3 physical experimental parameters for these three study cases were shown in table 1 and they were c0 θs θ0 hp p f1 f2 tp tr te from the table we can see that the experimental soil was initially unsaturated with θ0 0 046 in case 1 and initially saturated with θ0 θs 0 443 in cases 2 and 3 under condition of restrict subsurface drainage in case 3 there was no subsurface drainage water with f 2 0 after surface runoff occurred and f 1 0 017 cm min 1 while with controlled subsurface drainage f 1 0 012 cm min 1 f 2 0 007 cm min 1 in case 1 and f 1 0 032 cm min 1 f 2 0 032 cm min 1 in case 2 experiments lasted for 400 146 and 203 min for case 1 2 and 3 respectively 3 sobol s method sobol s method sobol 1993 is a gsa approach based on variance decomposition with certain physical parameters in table 1 and three model parameters of α γ and dmix predicted αcw t can be obtained from equation 8 which could also be represented in the following form 9 αcw t f α γ dmix in sobol s method the total variance of f d αcw t is decomposed into component variances from individual parameters and their interactions 10 d α c w t i d i i j d ij d 123 where di is the amount of variance due to the ith parameter with i 1 2 3 corresponded to α γ and dmix in this study and dij is the amount of variance due to the interaction between the ith and jth parameter with j 1 2 3 and j i the sensitivity of single parameter or parameter interaction i e sobol s sensitivity indices of different orders is then assessed based on their percentage contribution to the total variance d 11 f o i s i d i d 12 s o i s ij d ij d 13 t o i s ti 1 d i d where d i is the amount of variance due to all of the parameters except for the ith parameter si measures the sensitivity from the main effect of the ith parameter sij measures the sensitivity from the interactions between the ith and jth parameter and sti measures the main effect of the ith parameter and its interactions with all the other parameters there were three model parameters of α γ and dmix in this study so the third order index doi measuring the sensitivity from the interactions between the three parameters can be expressed as 14 d o i s 123 d 123 d t o i f o i s o i the variances in equation 10 can be evaluated using approximate monte carlo numerical integration particularly when the model is highly nonlinear and complex such as the prediction model of solute concentration in this study sobol s sensitivity indices have been shown to be more effective than other approaches in capturing the interactions between variables for highly nonlinear models tang et al 2007a 2007b model parameters of α γ and dmix were assumed to follow the uniform distribution u 0 1 and the monte carlo sample generated by a matlab built in function sobolset was used in this study 4 results and discussion overall computing foi soi and toi requires n m 2 model evaluations where n is the number of monte carlo samples and m is the number of parameters being analyzed in this study m 3 with model parameters of α γ and dmix the foi of the parameters α γ and dmix for one case i e case 1 with different monte carlo sample size of 1000 10000 100 000 and 300 000 were shown in the fig 2 from the figure we can see that the foi of the α γ and dmix became stable and converged when the monte carlo sample size was no less than 100000 which was used in our study considering the gsa accuracy and calculation cost it should be noted that the foi soi doi of the parameters α γ and dmix for each study case were converged with the monte carlo sample size of 100000 so only the foi of the α γ and dmix in study case 1 with different monte carlo sample size were presented in fig 2 as a representative here based on theses 100 000 sobol sequence data for α γ and dmix and the physical experimental parameters for each study case in table 1 the gsa results of the α γ and dmix to the predicted αcw t in equation 8 over time were obtained with the foi soi doi toi and toi foi of each parameter as described in section 3 the foi is the sensitivity from the main effect of one parameter α or γ or dmix the soi is sensitivity from the interactions between two parameters such as α and γ or α and dmix or γ and dmix the doi is the sensitivity from the interactions among three parameters α γ and dmix the toi is the main effect of the one parameter and its interactions with the other two parameters i e the main effect of α and its interactions with the γ and dmix it should be noted that the difference between the foi and toi measures the total interactive contribution of one parameter with the other two parameters denoting as toi foi 4 1 case 1 for the study case 1 with the initially unsaturated soil under the controlled subsurface drainage the foi of the γ were highest among the three parameters over all the time in fig 3 a indicating the model output of αcw t was the most sensitive to the γ and the α and dmix were insensitive while the foi of α and dmix had opposite variation trend and the sum of three parameters fois was less than 1 indicating that the interactions effect between the parameters i e soi or doi cannot be ignored similarly in fig 3 b the interaction between parameter γ and the other two parameters of α and dmix was large and the variation trends of αγ and γdmix were opposite this indicated that the parameter γ had a strong interaction with the other two parameters of α or dmix directly furthermore without γ the interaction between parameters α and dmix was very small in fig 3 b which further proved the strong sensitivity of parameter γ to the predicted αcw t indirectly this was because with the initially unsaturated soil in case 1 the downward soil infiltration rate is large which was the main way the solute in the soil mixing layer lost and affected the solute concentration lost from soil mixing layer to the in surface runoff consequently based on the physical meaning of γ the ratio of the downward infiltrated solute mass substracting the upward diffused solute mass to the downward infiltrated solute mass it was very sensitive to the predicted solute concentration in surface runoff and it was also why the parameters α and dmix was insensitive to the predicted αcw t and why the interaction values between the α and dmix over time was very small soil solute lost mainly via the downward soil infiltration water the cw t and αcw t decreased to very small values quickly so the foi of α and dmix varied oppositely and became small moreover the soi of γ and α varied oppositely to the soi of γ and dmix in fig 3 b which corresponded to the opposite variation trends between α and dmix for foi in fig 3 a the three parameters interaction doi in the fig 3 c had same variation trend with the soi of α and dmix after the tr in the fig 3 b and had same decrease trend with the soi of γ before the tr in the fig 3 a this was because after the tr α and dmix directly affected the predicted αcw t and before the tr with the small soi of α and dmix the doi decreased over time the toi of γ was highest and close to 1 in the fig 3 d which further verified that γ was the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t the toi of dmix decreased to a minimum value and then increased to a constant value with time while the toi of α increased and then decrease and then increase over time this was due to the more and more important interaction of γ α and dmix at later time the role of α and dmix became more and more important with increasing toi of α and dmix at later time in fig 3 d although the dmix was insensitive and not important for the predicted αcw t with small foi value the interactions between other parameters of γ and α was very important which lead to the same decreasing trends with the soi and doi of dmix at early time resulting in the decreasing toi of dmix at early time similarly the α was insensitive and not important with small foi value the interactions between other parameters of γ and dmix was very important the doi of dmix decreased but the soi of dmix increased at early time and then they decreased which leaded to the small increasing toi of α at early time and then decreased sharply while the interaction importance of one parameter with other parameters can be seen in the fig 3 e where toi foi was first decreased and then increased in case 1 and the increase time of toi foi was around the ponding water occurred on soil surface the reason may be that the soil in this case was initially unsaturated before the ponding water occurred on soil surface solutes mainly entered the deep soil layer with infiltration water which affects the solutes concentration lost to surface runoff from the soil mixing layer therefore the parameter γ played a major role on the model output of αcw t after the ponding water occurred on soil surface the amount of infiltration water entering the deep soil layer was reduced that was the independent influence of parameter γ on the predicted αcw t gradually decreased while the independent influence of the other two parameters on the model was negligible at later time while the parameters interaction related to γ on the model output αcw t gradually became more prominent this further represented the reason for variations of α and γ in fig 3 d and dmix in fig 3 c at later time this was because decreasing influence of γ on the predicted αcw t affected the influence of α and dmix on the predicted αcw t and interaction of γ with α or dmix became stronger at later time 4 2 case 2 for the study case 2 with initially saturated soil under condition of controlled sub surface drainage in fig 4 a the foi of γ and dmix increased at early time indicating γ and dmix became more and more important at early time and then the foi of γ and dmix gradually decreased at later time indicating γ and dmix became less and less important at later time the increase and decrease rates for the foi of dmix were larger than that of γ so the foi of dmix was larger than that of γ soon even though the former one was less at first and it became less again at later time conversely the foi of α decreased quickly at early time and then increased gradually at later time and the foi of α was the highest among these three parameters at first which suggested that α was the most sensitive and important to the predicted αcw t this was because with the initially saturated soil surface runoff occurred soon the predicted αcw t was most sensitive to α at first with decreasing solute concentration in the soil mixing layer solute in the soil mixing layer was the only solute source for the surface runoff this was why the foi of dmix increased at early time with controlled subsurface drainage much solute in the soil mixing layer lost to the downward infiltration water so γ became more and more important for the predicted αcw t with the increasing foi of γ at first with time solute concentration in the soil mixing layer and surface runoff became less and less so the dmix and γ did not have much influence on the αcw t and it became less and less important at later time the foi sum of α γ and dmix increased a little at the very early time and then decreased to about 0 2 indicating the parameter interactions were very strong at later time this was verified by the soi sum of α γ and dmix in fig 4 b where the soi sum had a converse variation trend with the foi sum decreasing a little at first and then increasing all the time with more than 0 5 at last and the soi of α and γ had similar variation trend with the soi sum decreasing a little at first and then increasing all the time and it became the highest among three interaction at later time indicating very strong interaction between α and γ for the predicted αcw t this was because at later time solute in the soil mixing layer was the only source for the surface runoff and the underlying soil if α became more important γ would became less important and vice versa this suggested that α variation would surely affect the γ variation and they interacted strongly the soi of α and dmix was the least in the fig 4 b at later time and this was because the α and dmix became less and less important for the predicted αcw t at later time but the soi of α and dmix gradually increased and was almost 0 1 suggesting a strong interaction between α and dmix at later time in fig 4 c the doi decreased a little at the very early time and then increased all the time this further verified that α γ and dmix had strong interaction at later time in fig 4 d the tois of α and γ decreased at early time and then increased soon and the toi of γ was the largest at later time followed by the toi of α indicating γ became more and more important and was the most important parameter for the predicted αcw t at later time followed by α this was similar to the foi of α and γ at later time and the toi of α was highest at first indicating α was the most important at first which was also similar to the foi of α while the toi of dmix increased at early time and decreased at later time and it became least at later time suggesting dmix became less and less important at later time this variation trend was the same with the foi of dmix the interaction importance of one parameter with other parameters was shown in fig 4 e where three values decreased at early time and increased at later time this indicated stronger and stronger interactions between other parameters at later time and it further proved variations of α γ and dmix in fig 4 b and 4 c similarly the reason for this strong interaction between parameter was described for fig 4 b and 4 c so it was not described here again 4 3 case 3 for the study case 3 with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage in fig 5 a the foi of γ was almost 0 with the secondary axis indicating γ was not important for the predicted αcw t and can be ignored this was because with no subsurface drainage water under condition of restricted subsurface drainage there was no downward infiltration water i γ was not used and not sensitive to the predicted αcw t the foi of α and dmix had opposite variation trend the former one with early decrease and later increase while the latter one with early increase and later decrease which was similar to the foi of α and dmix in case 2 of fig 4 a the reason for the fois of α and dmix variation was the same as explained for case 2 this was because with the initially saturated soil surface runoff occurred soon the predicted αcw t was most sensitive to α at first with decreasing solute concentration in the soil mixing layer it was the only source for the solute in surface runoff this was why the foi of dmix increased at early time the foi sum of α γ and dmix decreased at later time indicating increasing interaction between parameters at later time and this was verified by the opposite variation trend for the soi of α and dmix in fig 5 b similar to case 2 this suggested that α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time for case 3 which corresponded to the opposite variation trends of the fois for α and dmix the reason was also similar to case 2 since γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t the sots of γ and α and γ and dmix were close to 0 with the second axis in fig 5 b and the doi of α γ and dmix was close to 0 in fig 5 c expectedly this was also why the sum of sois for two parameters interactions was close to the soi of α and dmix in fig 5 b it was also the reason for the small toi of γ as close to 0 in fig 5 d in fig 5 d the variation trends of tois for α and dmix were similar to that for case 2 in fig 4 d with early decrease and later increase for α and early increase and later decrease for dmix which was also similar to corresponding variation trends of fois in fig 5 e the γ interactions with α and dmix was close to 0 since γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage it was also why α interactions with γ and dmix and dmix interactions with γ and α were the same with the soi of α and γ this further indicated that the predicted αcw t was sensitive to α and dmix comparing three cases for the initially unsaturated and saturated soils in cases 1 3 the fois of α and dmix varied oppositely and α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time this was because the solute concentration in the soil mixing layer showed a decreasing trend during the surface runoff process and eventually reached zero which leaded to complete mixing of solutes between the soil mixing layer and ponding runoff layer the mixing layer depth dmix and the parameter α affected the predicted αcw t at the same time which leaded to the stronger interaction between the parameters α and dmix under condition of subsurface drainage with downward infiltrated water in cases 1 and 2 γ was important for the predicted αcw t which was the most important at later time and it had strong interactions with α and dmix in each case according to the tois of α γ and dmix γ was found to be the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t in case 1 all the time with the initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage the change trends of the parameter interactions in case 2 and case 3 on the predicted αcw t were similar the only difference was that case 3 was the initially saturated soil under condition of restrict subsurface drainage without downward infiltration water so all the parameters related to the γ were not important to the model output of αcw t including the parameter γ and its interaction with other parameters therefore in case 3 the parameter γ can be set as a constant where predicted αcw t was affected by the parameters α and dmix and the parameters interactions was indicated by them 5 conclusions a gsa method via the sobol was applied to the prediction model of the solute transfer from soil to surface runoff by tong et al 2010 to determine the importance of parameters dmix α and γ for the predicted αcw t assessing the first order index foi total order index toi third order index doi toi and toi foi and the main parameters importance and all parameters interactions were analyzed three study experiments case 1 with initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage initially saturated soils under conditions of controlled and restricted subsurface drainage named cases 2 and 3 were used main conclusions can be obtained the importance of α γ and dmix for the predicted αcw t varied with time for the three cases for the initially unsaturated soil under condition of subsurface drainage γ was the most sensitive and important parameter for the predicted αcw t this was because with the initially unsaturated soil in case 1 the downward soil infiltration rate was large which was the main way the solute in the soil mixing layer lost and affected the solute concentration lost from the soil mixing layer to the surface runoff consequently under condition of subsurface drainage with downward infiltrated water for the initially unsaturated and saturated soils in cases 1 and 2 γ was important for the predicted αcw t which was the most important at later time and it had strong interactions with α and dmix in cases 1 3 the fois of α and dmix varied oppositely and α and dmix had stronger and stronger interactions at later time in other words the parameter importance of α will reduce the parameter importance of dmix to the predicted αcw t and vise versa in case 3 with initially saturated soil under condition of restricted subsurface drainage water γ was not sensitive to the predicted αcw t with almost no interactions of γ with α or dmix where the parameter γ can be set as a constant the study results can provide reference for the control of anpsp however the experimental time was extended so the gsas of α γ and dmix via sobol were stable in this study using sobol s method to the prediction model of soil solute transfer into surface runoff with real enough experimental time and obtain stable gsas of α γ and dmix is an issue can be done in future credit
