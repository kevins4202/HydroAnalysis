tonnes sharing 26 5 of the world s annual production goi government of india 2021 the lower gangetic plain lgp contributes 10 3 0 16 million ha of the country s total lentil growing area and 9 6 0 15 million tonnes of annual production goi government of india 2019 the rice fallows of the lower gangetic plains lgp store about 150 200 mm carryover soil water bandyopadhyay et al 2018 which provides a good opportunity for the cultivation of less water requirement crops like lentil however farmers in this region usually grow lentil during pre winter from late november to early december after the harvesting of long duration 150 160 days puddled transplanted rice bandyopadhyay et al 2018 which delayed the sowing of lentil lentil generally requires temperature from 18 to 30 c for optimum growth but more specifically it requires low temperatures during early to mid growth stages and warm temperatures only during maturity sinsawat et al 2004 temperatures above 32 20 c max min at the time of flowering and pod filling stages of lentil fatally hinder the production potential bourgault et al 2018 moreover delayed sowing with conventional tillage also strongly affects crop phenology by shortening the crop growth cycle bandyopadhyay et al 2018 furthermore the hasty soil water depletion after rice harvest followed by a fast decline in the water table in this sub tropical region caused mid and terminal drought at flowering and pod filling stages of lentil bandyopadhyay et al 2016 nandi et al 2021 one of the management practices may be manipulating the time of sowing and choosing a lentil cultivar with an appropriate maturity pattern early sowing of the crops with their rapid canopy development may allow less evaporation from the soil in this environment resulting in greater dry matter production earlier flowering and an improved harvest index after rice harvest plowing of those soils results in the formation of large clods having high breaking strength with low soil water that affects lentil germination bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 additionally regular tillage reduces soil organic matter lowers soil water holding capacity and soil fertility and increases wind and water erosion kar and kumar 2009 so proper selection of tillage is necessary which can help to utilize stored water by increasing soil water storage capacity reducing soil evaporation and allowing a better development of root systems the inclusion of no tillage nt and minimum tillage mt practices causes low evaporation due to more surface cover and in addition the higher bulk density increases the proportion of capillary pores that supply water to plants and seeds also gain an advantage from the capillary rise of water in deeper layers badalíková 2010 it is worth mentioning that relay sowing nt into the standing rice crop opens a new potential niche for lentils as it avoids delays due to the land is not dry enough for plowing however as the sowing date is critical for successful lentil cropping conservation tillage nt and mt with resource conservation technologies may improve soil water conservation and take care of the problems as well tillage causes a delay in sowing leading to reduce productivity as well as increased cost of production and under such situations no or minimum tillage options are effective in the timely planting of crops to mitigate soil water stress the effect of soil water stress on the plant and its mitigating option is the modern challenging work in climate change water stress indicators viz the relative water content of leaves leaf area index root proliferation and biomass production are very much sensitive to the soil water stress even chlorophyll concentration can be a consideration as a non stomata limiting factor in drought stress conditions serraj et al 2011 data on roots for adaptation to water limitation is important but tedious as compared to shoots trumbore and gaudinski 2003 strock et al 2019 an understanding of root architecture and soil water stress can explore better elucidation of water scarcity throughout the life of the crop so quantification of the coexistence between soil water stress and plant water stress indicators at different phenophases of plant growth is vital data that may help to mitigate stress potassium k has been proved to be actively involved in stomatal regulation water conduction and maintenance of water potential gradient under stress oddo et al 2020 arquero et al 2006 it k also promotes root growth and root lifespan armengaud et al 2004 which must have a role in the mitigation of abiotic stresses the application of k fertilizer to the soil or the lentil foliage may influence the k regulating power of the plant under stress environments and may act as an insurance strategy hence proper technology of sowing time modification low input conservation tillage and the method of application of potassium may control the response of morpho physiological and biochemical parameters regulating lentil growth however comprehensive information on stress enacted evapotranspiration eta as well as rooting behavior of lentil and the explication of plant physiological appearances as influenced by stress controller method mechanism following growth stages are very scanty keeping these in view the hypothesizes of the present study are set as i the introduction of short duration rice variety supports early sowing of lentil at post rainy season which could be an effective option in the utilization of stored soil moisture for lentil growth ii no tillage or minimum tillage are effective in conserve soil moisture owing to more surface cover that reduces soil evaporation and a higher proportion of capillary pores that confirms steady supply of soil water to plants allowing a better root development for alleviating terminal drought and iii the potassium application could be an insurance strategy to reduce the adverse effect of stress to plants by modification of morpho physiological and biochemical parameters regulating lentil growth to address these hypotheses a field experiment was conducted in rice fallows with two dates of sowing of lentil early and late three tillage practices nt mt and ct and k fertilizer application methods basal foliar and combinations with the objectives 1 to find out the extent of abiotic stresses vis à vis the scope of the management practices in stress mitigation 2 to evaluate the plant physiological and biochemical responses against abiotic stresses in this respect and 3 to detect the effect of management practices in the grain yield and evapotranspiration of lentil 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil information the study was conducted at the experimental field of bidhan chandra krishi

strips of land 1 m wide acted as buffer areas between the main plots and 0 75 m buffer areas between replications the seed rate method of sowing and total growth period of lentil during the experimental years along with the depth of residual soil water content at the time of sowing are given in table 2 on average the duration of lentil under early and late sown conditions were observed at 109 and 102 days respectively while the growth period of lentil under nt mt and ct were noticed at 112 108 and 98 days respectively under the nt system only surface seeding was done called relay cropping where soaked seeds of lentil were broadcasted in the standing rice crop in muddy or well moistened soils 15 days before harvesting in this system no tillage was applied and soils remained undisturbed in the second crop season in mt and ct systems seeds were sown ensuring adequate seed soil contact the matured rice crop was harvested leaving the stubble height at 20 cm which left 0 35

preparation table 2 fertilizers were broadcasted harvesting of lentil under different treatments started in the middle of february and continued up to mid march 2 3 observations the root zone soil water rzsw data were recorded weekly up to 40 cm soil depth 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 cm depth during the lentil growth period using soil water probes pr2 6 delta t devices ltd cambridge uk the reading of the probe was also calibrated using gravimetric soil samples and the bulk density values for the four depths 10 20 30 and 40 cm were found comparable a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 925 p 0 01 was obtained with a calibration equation of y 1 033x where y and x are soil water content measured by soil auger and pr2 6 profile probe water meter the total available water taw content mm at a depth of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm was calculated as the difference between the water content at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa using the pressure plate apparatus richard 1949 as 1 taw θ fc θ wp z r where zr effective rooting depth mm θfc and θwp are the volumetric soil water content at field capacity mm3 mm 3 and permanent wilting point mm3 mm 3 respectively the critical water content θc for each soil depth was calculated as 2 θ c 1 p θ fc θ wp θ wp where p is the soil water depletion fraction that any crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress and a value of 0 5 was considered for lentil in this study allen et al 1998 the soil water stress coefficient ks was calculated following bandyopadhyay et al 2016 a modified version

range 0 1 values over 1 are set to 1 the seasonal as well as growth stage wise actual evapotranspiration was computed using the following water balance relationship allen et al 1998 bandyopadhyay et al 2005 4 eta pr i c d r s where pr is effective precipitation in the crop growth season mm pr is calculated by deducting the amount of surplus water that occurred after precipitation from the actual amount of precipitation as 5 pr r a inf a l l w a t e r s u r p l u s where any amount of water in excess of the net water holding capacity or storage capacity of root zone soil is surplus water which is lost as deep percolation or runoff but in our study no surplus water was observed so the amount of precipitation that occurred during the growth period is considered effective precipitation i

rootzone mm and was assumed nil as the soil remained below ﬁeld capacity most of the time and neither heavy rain occurred nor irrigations were applied r is the surface runoff mm and was also assumed zero as no water moved horizontally below the surface and δs is the change in soil water storage within root zone depth mm and was determined from the successive soil water sampling measurements using the relationship as 6 s 0 z t 1 t 2 θ t δ z δ t where θ is the depth basis soil water content mm between two dates the end of period value t2 and beginning of period value t1 depth z was from 0 to 400 mm respectively undisturbed soil cores collected in stainless steel core samplers 5 cm diameter and 5 cm length were used for the collection of core samples from the treated plots for the determination of bulk density following the method of blake and hartge 1986 the soil cores were dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h knowing the volume of the soil core sampler and the weight of the oven dried soil the bulk density expressed as mg m 3 was calculated using the formula 7 bulk density oven dry weight of the soil volume of the soil core soil penetration was measured by using a hand held pocket penetrometer astm c 403 with a flat tip having a surface area of 0 3 cm2 as the method described by lal 1997 in each treatment three spots were chosen for the measurement of soil strength the penetration resistance pr was measured from the pit of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm from where soil bulk density measurements were made during the measurement of soil pr soil water content was also determined then the bulk density bd soil water content θ and pr values were fitted into a multiple non linear regression model given by upadhyaya et al 1982 to measure pr and the parameters were estimated as 8 pr a bd n ρ s c b θ where a 0 33 n 1 436 c 7 494 b 0 009 and ρ s particle density 2 65 mg m 3 the reference evapotranspiration et0 mm was calculated using data from a standard uswb class a evaporation pan epan mm installed in the research farm as 9 e t o e p a n k p where kp the pan coefficient was considered a value of 0 85 for relative humidity as medium 40 70 wind speed as

root parameters viz root length density root volume root diameter and root surface area were determined by the image analysis software winrhizo arsenault et al 1995 himmelbaueret al 2004 root mass was measured by oven drying samples at 65 c for more than 48 h till the constant weight of the samples five plant samples from each replicated sub plots were selected randomly at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages of lentil for relative leaf water content rwc leaf chlorophyll concentration and proline content measurement the rwc was estimated by the method of barrs and weatherly 1962 by using the following equation 10 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 where tw turgid weight dw dry weight and fw fresh weight of leaves total chlorophyll concentration was determined from 10 to 15 fully expanded lentil leaves from plants of each plot by 95 v v ethanol extraction method followed by spectroscopic absorbance measurement at 645 and 663 nm arnon 1949 the total chlorophyll content mg g 1 fresh

leaf area plant no of plants ground area m 2 three plant samples from each plot in each replication were selected randomly for biomass measurement and the mean of three replications was computed plant samples were collected by uprooting the whole plant by soil excavation at vegetative flowering and pod formation periods after excavation the samples were slaked by dipping them into the water and washed with gently flowing water for dry biomass analysis the collected plant samples were oven dried at 60 c for more than 48 h till the constant weight of the samples was obtained the calculated total dry matter was expressed as mg ha 1 after lentil plants reached physiological maturity grain yield was determined by hand harvesting from each plot and water productivity was calculated as the

zone 0 40 cm during the critical growth periods of lentil i e sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods of two growing seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 are presented in fig 2 the soil water content ranged from 139 to 154 mm under early sown and from 135 to 142 mm under late sown lentil at the time of sowing during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons that straightway decreased in the succeeding growing periods and contained only 76 and 79 mm water respectively at harvesting time of both the growing years early sown lentil accounted for significantly higher soil water storage at flowering 27 3 and 21 2 and pod formation periods 25 3 and 21 6 as compared to late sown lentil additionally the time span in the growing period that falls under the readily available water raw zone as shown in fig 2 was also more in the case of early sown lentil on the other hand among the tillage practices nt stored the highest amount of soil water amounting to 128 7 mm at vegetative 113 9 mm at flowering and 100 9 mm at the pod formation stage respectively although on average the greatest rate of depletion of soil water particularly at the early growth stage was observed under ct 0 65 mm d 1 while at mid to later growth stages mt showed a higher depletion rate 0 70 mm d 1 that resulted in ct reserving the least amount of soil water for the reproductive period and ct showed an early drop from the raw water zone at 62 67 das under early sown and 45 48 das under late sown conditions however the interaction between sowing time and tillage effect was observed as significant during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods the early sown nt mt and ct depleted 28 14 and 24 higher soil water than the late sown lentil though early sown nt stored the highest soil water mt stored a sufficient amount of soil water so that mt reached below the critical soil water θc after peak reproductive stages 75 das fig 2 meanwhile late sown ct reserved the least root zone soil water throughout application of potassium caused higher depletion of root zone soil water and kbf resulted in the least soil water storage in the root zone followed by kb the interaction of sowing time and potassium treatment was observed significant during the flowering period only 3 2 extent of soil water stress and soil compaction the effect of soil water stress by emphasizing the water supplying capacity of soil quantified as soil water stress coefficient ks a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor under different sowing time tillage practices and potassium fertilizer management during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons are presented in fig 3 plants showed no stress ks 1 during the initial vegetative period 20 25 das but starting from peak vegetative to pre flowering stages plants faced stress as ks dropped below 1 plants under early and late sown faced respectively 37 and 43 stress at the flowering stage 60 65 das and 66 and 61 stress at the pod formation stage 75 85 das moreover late sowing caused 10 15 days of early stress appearance ks 1 than early sowing of lentil among the tillage practices lentil under conservation tillage nt and mt showed marginal stress at the flowering and pod formation periods 23 40 which was crucial for seed production while ct faced water stress earlier 50 55 das as well as the stress intensified thereafter by 61 and 74 during the mentioned periods among interactions effect early sown nt resulted in significantly the highest ks i e the least stress followed by mt throughout the lentil growth while a steep decrease of ks was most convincing under late sown ct with the least value at flowering 0 36 and pod formation 0 21 periods fig 3 in that scenario early sowing of ct reduced water stress than late sowing of ct by overall 51 nevertheless ks under kbf secured significantly the lowest value as compared to other k treatments however kb and kf showed no significant variations among them interaction between sowing time and tillage practices s t sowing time and potassium s k tillage and potassium t k and interactions among these three factors s t k were noticed significant during the late growth stages of lentil for both the cropping seasons as the cropped approached maturity the soil became drier that cause compaction as measured through the increment of bd and pr the maximum increment of bd and pr were recorded at surface soil that dried quickly and the least change occurred at 20 30 cm depth that dried slowly nt showed significantly the highest bd 1 55 mg m 3 followed by mt 1 52 mg m 3 while ct resulted in the lowest bd pr significantly increased mainly with the decrement of soil water r2 0 73 p 0 01 but in the case of nt production of soil cracks mainly at later stages of crop growth had significantly increased bd fig 4 the interrelationships among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k were found significant at 0 10 and 10 20 cm depth of soil 3 3 plant physiological changes 3 3 1 relative water content and chlorophyll content the relative water content rwc of leaves decreased from the vegetative to the flowering period at a slower rate 0 21 day 1 and from the flowering to pod formation stage at a steeper rate 0 68 day 1 while the chlorophyll content of leaves lcc increased collectively 13 starting from vegetative up to pod formation period of lentil table 3 the changes in rwc and lcc indicated the effect of water stress on plant physiology mainly at reproductive stages where the water conservation reduced the stress and a significant positive relationship showed a 3 7 increment in rwc with every 10 mm increase in soil water storage fig 11 on average early sown lentil significantly improved 10 2 11 2 and 6 9 rwc and 5 11 and 7 lcc as compared to late sown lentil during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively the maximum water stress under ct showed the highest diminution 14 of rwc table 3 nt sown early and late produced significantly 6 5 and 3 8 higher rwc than mt while mt recorded significantly 14 greater chlorophyll over nt during the reproductive period ct under late sown showed the least amount of both rwc and chlorophyll while early sowing helped to produce comparable rwc and lcc with nt the overall effect in rwc and chlorophyll content of leaves during mid and terminal growth stages followed the order kbf kb kf k0 table 3 the kbf produced significantly 3 7 greater rwc and 0 18 mg g 1 higher lcc than the nearest treatment kb during the flowering period the implication of k in improving rwc and lcc was mostly observed under ct the interactions of sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k were found significant during flowering and pod formation stages and interactions among sowing time tillage and k management s t k of lentil were found to be significant only during the pod formation period of lentil mostly during second year of experiment table 3 3 3 2 leaf area development the increase in leaf area index lai continued up to the flowering period by reaching a maximum of 3 2 and remained almost constant afterwards early sowing elevated 39 lai than late sowing fig 5 the rapid increment of leaf area was mainly observed under nt 1 90 3 28 followed by mt 2 65 3 02 in the case of early sown lentil nt alone and for late sown lentil conjointly nt and mt produced maximum lai the application of k significantly improved lai as compared to its non application the kbf treatment showed significantly 23 33 and 60 higher lai during flowering and 22 34 and 69 higher lai during the pod formation period over kb kf and k0 respectively 3 4 rooting behavior of plants the root related parameters i e root length density rld root surface area rsa mean root diameter mrd and root volume rv were measured in the root zone depth 0 40 cm to gather information of root growing behavior among the different treatments during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons and here the average values of two cropping years are depicted in fig 6 then a further assessment of fine to coarse roots distribution patterns in these treatments was also performed the collected dataset showed that the root distribution mainly concentrated in the sub surface layer 10 20 cm as compared to the surface layer 0 10 cm the surface layer drying may be reasoned for root accumulation at 10 20 cm soil layer where sufficient water and root respiration created the congenial environment for root growth however with a further increment of soil depth presence of roots abruptly decreased as seen from rooting parameters rld increased with the advancement of crop growth and the growth rate was as usual faster in the lower layer 20 30 cm and the maximum increment was noticed during the flowering to pod formation period and on average rld at 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm depths shared 39 38 19 and 4 of roots respectively fig 6 it was observed that early sown lentil produced significantly 51 30 and 31 higher rld as compared to late sown during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods interestingly under late sown conditions 16 higher root growth rld was observed at lower depths 20 30 cm than early sown lentil in concern to the tillage practices ct produced significantly 25 and 10 higher rld during the initial period of lentil growth over mt in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 respectively but starting from the peak vegetative stage mt maintained consistently the maximum rld till harvesting while nt showed the least rld at initial growth and intermediate values of rld was observed thereafter in the case of early sown lentil the depth wise rld followed the order mt ct nt and the trend followed for late sown lentil was mt nt ct the diameter class root distribution showed a significantly higher percentage of roots in the 0 0 5 mm diameter class and the percentage share of roots in higher diameter classes decreased consistently with the increase in diameter class fig 7 ct resulted in the highest percentage of roots in 0 0 5 mm diameter class followed by mt while the diameter class of 0 5 1 0 and 1 0 1 5 mm were dominated by both nt and mt on average early sowing treatment was noticed to produce 36 higher root diameter rd over the late sown lentil fig 6 and the highest proportion of rd was positioned at 0 10 cm soil layer that decreased continuously with soil depth though initially ct produced 19 higher rd than nt at reproductive stages and thereafter nt resulted in the highest rd values however the late sowing of mt produced significant rd improvement late sown ct showed a 12 higher increment of rd than early sown ct at later stages of crop growth the total root surface area trsa was significantly higher under mt in the upper 2 layers 0 20 cm while nt produced the least trsa throughout the soil depth when trsa was classified into different diameter classes significant variations in the treatments were observed the maximum portioned of trsa was found in the 0 0 5 mm diameter class where ct contributed the highest while in 0 5 1 0 and 1 0 1 5 mm diameter classes mt and nt interchangeably produced the maximum trsa though ct produced the smallest portion fig 7 now in case of rv mt had the highest rv at 0 5 and 10 20 cm soil layers the overall rv possessed the highest proportion of roots in the 0 5 1 0 mm diameter class ct produced maximum roots in the very fine root class 0 0 5 mm where rv of nt flourished under the coarse 0 5 1 0 mm root class rv at higher diameter classes 1 0 mm was dominated by nt l400 regarding k management a significant effect on rooting behavior has been observed rld rsa and rv were noticed maximum under kbf followed by kb the major effect of k was mainly observed at 10 20 cm depth although there was a miniature effect observed in surface soil also the kbf and kb showed significantly 0 002 0 018 and 0 003 0 020 cm cm 3 higher rld than kf and k0 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 8 the kbf resulted in the highest rd that was significantly 14 higher than kb k improved rd and rsa in almost all diameter classes the maximum improvement was observed in very fine roots 0 0 5 mm and fine roots 0 5 1 0 mm categories fig 7 while k improved maximum rv in 0 5 1 30 mm diameter class k also increased the amount of trt and trf significantly in all root zone depths however maximum improved was noticed at the 10 20 cm soil layer the overall effect of root growth is maximized by kbf followed by kb the sole foliar k application did not improve root growth significantly over k0 among all the rooting parameters k improved the rv parameter the most the combined analysis of variance indicated that the interrelationship between sowing time and k management s k was significant throughout the growth period where the interrelationship among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k were found to be significant at mid and later stages of lentil in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons 3 5 soil water depletion and evapotranspiration soil water depletion rate dr as influenced by different treatments during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons are presented in table 4 the crop received 20 7 21 7 mm and 11 8 15 9 mm of effective rainfall throughout the crop life span during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons considering different duration and times of growth periods while early and late sown lentil received 19 1 and 17 6 mm rainfall in 2016 2017 and 12 4 and 11 2 mm rainfall in 2017 2018 respectively a sudden reduction of dr was observed as and when received rainfall early sown lentil showed 72 24 and 43 higher periodic soil water change δs and 53 29 and 21 higher eta at vegetative to flowering flowering to pod formation and pod formation to harvest periods table 4 though ct recorded a higher depletion rate of 0 86 mm d 1 at the early growth stages nt and mt significantly depleted more water during the precious reproductive period the δs of mt showed 35 and 31 higher values as compared to nt and 16 and 87 5 higher as compared to ct at vegetative to flowering and flowering to pod formation period respectively table 4 by using the water balance method the mean measured seasonal eta were observed at 104 97 and 86 mm under early sown nt mt and ct though no significant difference in seasonal eta was noticed between early sown nt and mt late sowing made a significant difference between them application of k improved dr δs and eta during the important phenophases of lentil where kbf and kb resulted in higher values of them during both years on average seasonal eta under kbf and kb accounted for 89 5 mm which was 2 5 and 1 8 more than k0 and kf respectively the interrelationships among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k significantly influenced eta for 2016 2017 at vegetative to flowering and flowering to pod formation periods table 4 3 6 total biomass production grain yield and water productivity total dry biomass tb of lentil plants ranged from 22 0 to 44 4 q ha 1 and 20 2 to 39 8 q ha 1 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively early sown lentil overall produced significantly 44 higher tb than a late sown lentil during the initial growth period of lentil mt and ct produced elevated tb manifold over nt while during flowering and pod formation periods nt overthrust the biomass production rate and achieved higher tb over mt table 5 the relationship between tb and root zone soil water showed an increment of 410 and 310 kg ha 1 tb with 10 mm improved in root zone soil water during vegetative and flowering periods respectively where the potassium application produced a more significant effect in improving tb than its non application during critical growth phases of lentil the kbf showed significantly the highest tb and the overall effect of k on tb followed the order kbf kb kf k0 all the combinations of sowing time tillage and potassium were found significant during the flowering and pod formation periods of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 the vegetative stage showed no significant differences in the tb of lentil effects of sowing time tillage practices and potassium management on grain yield and water productivity wp in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 are presented in table 5 the grain yield and wp ranged from 4 27 to 14 23 q ha 1 and 5 9 to 15 8 kg ha mm 1 during 2016 2017 and 3 59 13 07 q ha 1 and 6 3 16 1 2 3 kg ha mm 1 during 2017 2018 respectively early sown lentil produced 12 36 and 11 12 q ha 1 seed yields which were significantly 49 and 47 more than late sown lentil 8 31 and 7 56 q ha 1 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons again early sown lentil significantly possessed 30 and 28 more wp as compared to the late sown lentil in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 lentil seed yield y and actual evapotranspiration eta relationship developed by considering y and eta data across the management practices is expressed as 13 y i e l d 0 14 e t a 2 84 r 2 0 35 p 0 05 results showed that about 35 of the variations in seed yield could be attributed to variation in eta in such a way that every 14 kg of additional grain yield was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta in this scenario mt resulted in a significant increase in grain yield and wp over ct while nt and ct showed no significant differences between them table 5 mt resulted in significantly 14 and 23 higher grain yield and 23 and 25 improved wp under early sown conditions and 24 and 10 greater grain yield and 23 and 31 enhanced wp under late sown conditions than nt during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively the grain yield and wp under kbf were estimated significantly 6 and 10 higher over kb respectively table 5 likewise during 2016 2017 kf had significantly improved grain yield and wp of lentil by 6 and 7 to k0 respectively while no significant variations between kf and k0 were observed during the 2017 2018 season in the case of early sown lentil kbf resulted in significantly 6 and 11 higher grain yield and wp while under late sown conditions kbf produced significantly 6 and 10 higher grain yield and wp over kb it was further apparent that during both seasons the interaction effect of sowing time and potassium s k tillage and potassium t k and among these three factors s t k were found significant table 5 4 discussion 4 1 profile water distribution and root zone soil water storage the different patterns of soil water distribution in the profile occurred with the advancement of crop growth as the root exploited water from different depths of soil with various intensities nonetheless the evaporative demand of the atmosphere mostly affected the initial soil water distribution while plant evapotranspiration coupled with the upward or downward flux of water modified the root zone soil water allocation at the mid and later part of crop growth the prevalence of higher soil water at the time of sowing vis a vis spending a lesser time under acute atmospheric temperature unlike late sown was the probable reason for the comparatively higher soil water under early sown lentil a similar pattern of persistence of soil water was found by saha et al 2021 in their study during working with lentil as lentil seeds were incorporated in standing paddy crops under nt soil water reserve in the root zone was ample at sowing time moreover the lower amount of macroporosity under conservation tillage i e nt or mt restricted the vertical water movement and resulted in a higher reservation of water as compared to ct table 4 this result was also followed by yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 additionally the retention of rice stubbles also contributed to the reduction of evaporation from the soil surface vis à vis slowed the rate of upward movement of soil water under nt and mt thereby conserving more water as elucidated by mandal et al 2004 lower evaporative depletion of soil water in the presence of standing rice stubbles along with the reduced rate of vertical soil water movement within the compacted puddled rice soil under conservation tillage has been reported by saxena 2009 nandi et al 2021 and mukherjee et al 2022 while for tillage operation ct plots required proper soil water and that was done by keeping the land to sunlight causing loss of soil water creating a low water storage situation at sowing and thereafter in addition das et al 2018 and obia et al 2020 pointed out that the modification of the pore geometry of the soil in the tilled plots and porous structure of the soil and the removal of residues all in combination increased the soil water movement and hastened the depletion of root zone soil water potassium application resulted in a significant effect on soil water storage due to its effect on plant metabolic activity and growth which modified root soil interactions resulting in higher water uptake white and karley 2010 also reported the modification of soil water storage through the effect of k by thrusting the its effect on plant physiological improvement hence the improved soil water reserve through early sowing and lesser water depletion by residue retention and improved canopy coverage by k application are the pathways toward mitigation of water stress in the plant 4 2 soil water stress and soil compaction physical properties of soil bd and pr were modified due to the disappearance of soil water differently by modification of sowing time and tillage practices the rapid drying of surface soil through evaporation and root water uptake ensured water derived shrinkage resulting in maximum compaction at surface soil means higher bd and pr in that region although the complete check of root growth was not achieved due to the water shortage as the pr values were below the critical pr 0 25 mpa kees 2005 the pulverized soil under ct caused the lowest bd but with the prevalence of the least amount of water ct resulted in maximum pr values a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between root zone soil water content and pr fig 9 showed the importance of water conservation to reduce the negative impact of pr souza et al 2021 also reported a similar increment of pr under water scarcity conditions scientists also credited the blockage of pores via small soil particles for the compaction of ct s soil moure et al 2016 while the implication of conservation tillage higher root zone soil water content was achieved which caused lesser pr under both mt and nt on the other hand the formation of cracks in soil starting from mid growth stages of lentil somewhat compacted the soil of nt the comparative higher compaction of nt was also shown by alvarez and steinbach 2009 and romaneckas et al 2015 moreover the soil cracking induced bd increment as evidenced by the relationship between bd and crack volume fig 4 potassium has a significant effect on the growth and development of plant roots as confirmed by jung et al 2009 which may modify the bd positively in connection with that fig 10 confirmed a significant role of root length density rld in the modification of bd of soil the expression of soil water stress emphasizing the water supplying capacity of soil as quantified by soil water stress coefficient ks was observed sequentially approaching zero with the advancement of crop growth during the initial crop growth period soil water depletion by evapotranspiration was less than the amount of readily available water and so ks showed a value of 1 i e no stress situation but with the continuous exploitation of reserved root zone soil water following crop growth ks started to fall below indicating stress which intensified thereafter up to maturity of lentil starting from the sowing period early sown lentil reserved comparatively higher soil water than late sown lentil resulting in higher values of ks throughout the growing period additionally the late sowing missed the rain events at an early vegetative stage in 2016 2017 as well as at the peak vegetative stage in 2017 2018 which had an impact on soil water stress ks on the other hand the rapid disappearance of soil water through open soil structure and the preponderance of microporosity lowered the ks values under ct that indicated lesser availability of soil water for plant uptake and thus experienced soil water stress for a prolonged time bandyopadhyay et al 2016 similarly observed lower ks values under ct at later stages of lentil and rai et al 2017 observed the same in pigeon pea the appearance of moisture stress caused forced maturity of lentil resulting crop duration of 95 98 days for ct as compared to 108 112 days for nt and mt while the higher amount of initial soil water vis a vis more persistence of soil water availability period due to the presence of more micropores under nt secured the highest ks values followed by mt however the rapid decline of ks values at terminal growth stages under late sown nt occurred may be due to the production of cracks in the soil which gave direction to the stored water for escapement which as a whole increased the ks scenario of early sown lentil at later part of growth 4 3 soil water depletion and actual evapotranspiration the depletion of soil water occurred mainly due to the cumulative effect of eta which differed in various growth stages of crop and variable atmospheric evaporative demand initially water got depleted by evaporation from the soil surface marginally covered by vegetation or standing stubbles and later by transpiration when the maximum soil surface became covered by plant foliage early sown lentil secured a greater depletion rate dr than late sown because depletion efficiency appeared to be dependent on the depth and availability of soil water at that depth and the overlying depths bandyopadhyay et al 2005 and as early sown lentil stored more soil water thus higher eta was recorded again the concomitant increase in atmospheric temperature and formation of the bare spot in soil due to the senescence of plant caused higher dr during pod formation to harvest period mainly evidenced under ct and most particularly under late sown conditions while the standing crop stubbles modified the hydro thermal regimes between the soil atmosphere interface which in turn might mitigate the soil water stress under nt and mt bandyopadhyay et al 2018 in addition to that the establishment of substantial growth of canopy coverage under these treatments increased the contribution of the transpiration component of eta as mentioned earlier the more amount of micropores and better continuity of these pores helped nt and mt to supply a continuous flow of soil water to plants which accounted for transpiration in the meantime the formation of cracks at later growth stages also caused the higher eta under nt and the findings of kumar et al 2020 and nandi et al 2021 are in line with ours in the puddled rice soil system different scientists reported water requirements for lentil ranging from 70 to 155 mm crops with life saving irrigation given externally or with the occurrence of rainfall in india bandyopadhyay et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019 nandi et al 2021 but in our experiment the maximum eta of 99 104 mm was observed under nt and mt which may be because of standing stubbles that acted as mulch and reduced the loss of evaporation from the soil surface by forming a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere during the crop growth period in the meantime the application of k modified plant physiology causing an increment in eta the application of potassium through controlling stomatal movement and water relations turgor regulation and osmotic adjustment in plants has been shown to enhance transpiration zain and ismail 2016 the interaction e nt kbf secured the highest eta of all as the early sown nt conserved soil water with standing rice stubble and k fertilizer application both as basal and foliar was effective in maintaining higher transpiration and checking the loss of evaporation from the soil surface 4 4 relative water content chlorophyll content and development of leaves relative water content rwc of leaves is an important indicator of water status in plants in terms of the physiological consequence of cellular water deficit and it reflected the balance between water supply to the leaf tissue and transpiration rate lugojan and ciulca 2011 in the case of early sown lentil nt and mt treatments maintained higher rwc by providing a continuous supply of soil water to maintain water absorption vis a vis metabolic activities as compared to late sown lentil and ct treatments limited water availability under ct mainly at mid and late growth stages reduced the root water uptake resulting in lower rwc also evidenced by other researchers talukdar 2013 saha et al 2020 nandi et al 2021 the water manipulated rwc is confirmed by the significant positive relationship between root zone soil water and rwc in fig 11 the turgidity of leaves prevailing under nt during the later stage of growth improved leaf chlorophyll content as well while lower chlorophyll content under ct might be due to the deficit of soil water interestingly the increment of lcc with maturity vis a vis water depletion created a situation where root zone soil water storage as well as rwc showed no significant relationships with the lcc fig 11 in support of our finding kamble et al 2015 also observed the maximum total chlorophyll content in older leaves than those showing the highest net photosynthesis on a comparative scene soil water stress restricted lcc development under late sown conditions due to the degradation of synthesized chlorophyll as well as inhibition of the synthesis of new chlorophyll pigments mathobo et al 2017 however the interaction effect of sowing time and tillage s t was found statistically significant throughout the growing period of lentil this might be due to the capability of soil water storage root growth physical improvement of soil etc which helped in the effective supply of the requisite amount of water to plant in all the growth periods availability of soil water provided little scope for k to improve further rwc during the early growth period but with the depletion of soil water k s role in maintaining the turgor pressure of leaves became significant many researchers bahrami rad and hajiboland 2017 turcios et al 2021 observed the role of k in improving leaf water status in crops like mung bean maize and wheat jákli et al 2017 pointed out the k facilities to the diffusion of co2 from the atmosphere into the chloroplast and that may be correlated with chlorophyll content lai values increased with the crop ages up to the flowering period the occurrence of stagnant lai values after the flowering period may be because the rate of leaf development as well as the leaf senescence became almost equal among the sowing treatments the early appearance of the senescence stage observed by drying and shattering of leaves as opined by pal et al 2012 resulted in the late sowing of lentil while the faster root development owing to better seed soil contact and water conservation produced higher lai under mt at mid and late growth stages yusuf 2006 similarly observed the increment in lai attributed to higher roots in connection to more uptake of water and nutrient on the other hand the rapid development of lai of nt at mid and late growth stages suggested the positive effect of the presence of higher root zone soil water storage which was sufficient to support the further new leaf development vegetative growth of plants despite of having the surface placement of seeds a significant positive relationship between root zone soil water storage and lai supported the hypothesis fig 11 these results also agree with the findings of saha et al 2010 on the other hand the diminution of the leaf development rate under ct especially in late sown conditions is caused due to scarcity of root zone water the decrease in lai as a result of soil water stress was also observed by talukdar 2013 k is effective in leaf expansion which got reduced as a result of k deficiency improved lai through the application of k in soybean was also found by zain and ismail 2016 4 5 rooting behavior of plants increasing depth of soil tends to be compacted vis a vis less prevalence of oxygen and so the roots have to overcome greater friction to obtain water and which resulted in less intense soil water depletion at 20 30 cm depth also from the study by fitter et al 2002 it is clear that root system architecture determines the overall exploration capacity of the soil profile via the synchronization of water availability and depth distribution of root segments here the sink soil water distribution revealed that with the advancement of depletion of soil water over time upper layer extraction was increasingly sourced limited while towards lower layers sink strength was limited by the lower rooting density wasson et al 2012 observed a similar shifting of rooting density during rainfed wheat production in the discussion with tillage systems nt showed the least root distribution rld of all during the initial and vegetative stages of lentil which may be because of lesser seed to soil contact where the plant had to find a soft spot to enter into the soil while the tilled porous soil under ct with good contact with the seed provided better conditions for quick root growth as compared to root growth in conservation tillage based nt and mt soil the nt gradually increased the mechanical impediment of the surface soil limiting the distribution of roots in the upper soil profile and restricting downward root proliferation the relationship between soil water storage and rld fig 9 during the later stages of lentil growth provided information that the scarcity of soil water compelled higher root growth at lower depths however mt made better seed soil contact as tyne drawn in the seed line than nt and with higher soil water than ct produced higher rld especially at later growth periods ogban et al 2008 also observed mt s better contribution to root growth the hinge of root length density rld at 10 20 cm depth for both early and late sown was due to the presence of superior soil water regimes at that depth than the surface layer with better depletion rates similar results were found by ali et al 2002 and benjamin and nielsen 2006 under insufficiency of soil moisture for late sown lentil root continued its search for water to lower depth 20 30 cm similarly an increase in root growth particularly responsive to reductions in soil water was reported by wasson et al 2012 on the other hand the application of k accelerated the growth of the entire root system which might be related to the higher mobility of k within a plant sánchez calderón et al 2005 the differences in the mean root diameter rd between the early and late sown lentil were associated with the delay in plant growth performances it was evident that lower root zone soil water storage under late sown during flowering and pod formation periods significantly affected the rd liu et al 2011 also found a similar pattern of root diameter while working with lentil the sproutings of finer and active roots during the flowering period resulted in lower rd which effectively provides water and nutrients to plants while ct produced higher rd during the vegetative period mostly due to a favorable loose soil environment which emphasized the overall growth of roots in the sufficiency of void spaces but with the course of plant growth nt faced maximum resistance for root growth due to undisturbed soil coupled with depleting soil water compelling the root to grow in diameter higher rd to search for water and nutrients mainly during reproductive periods the significant positive correlation between bulk density and rd justified the reasons for higher rd under nt as nt showed lower bulk density as compared to mt and ct similar results were found by gu et al 2017 expanded root cortical cells and the presence of additional cell layers induced by the presence of mechanical impedance could explain thickened roots additionally the subsurface water logging under nt changed the rooting pattern by inhibiting root branching on one hand and increasing the rd on the other as observed by palta et al 2010 while working with chickpeas the application of k as basal and foliar improved rd because the transport of photosynthesis products from the leaves to the roots was controlled by k and thus the accumulation of photosynthates at roots increased the rd under k applied treatments hell and mendel 2010 rsa and trl are closely related to antecedent soil water contents and are considered efficient indicators for root resource uptake ability elazab et al 2012 2016 olmo et al 2016 page et al 2016 benjamin and nielsen 2006 similarly observed a decrease distribution of root surface area in the surface layer and an increase in deeper soil layers at the mid pod fill stage in soybean the abundance of fine roots appeared under ct at the early stages of lentil growth but the disappearance of soil water may either dry the finer roots or not allow the plants to grow further finer roots mechanical impedance decreases the rate of root elongation because of a decrease in the rate of cell division in the meristematic region and a decrease in the cell length bengough et al 2011 on the other hand in the micropore dominated mt plants mainly utilized their finer roots to extract water during the reproductive growth period in the case of nt primarily the weak establishment of the plant and secondarily the increased bd and crack formation caused the plant to shift its root growth towards coarse fractions soil compaction significantly reduced taproot growth by up to four times whereas root diameter significantly increased in non compacted soil as observed by chen and weil 2011 chen et al 2014 k s effect on growing finer roots was previously reported by zhang et al 2009 the abundance of soil water increased finer roots whereas the unavailability of soil water produced coarser roots as shown in the figures figs 6 and 7 4 6 biomass development grain yield and water productivity biomass development in plants is directly related to the available soil water storage and thus at later growth stages plants started to build up active osmolytes in their cells to cope with water stress and lowered plant growth slama et al 2011 evidenced that phenomenon in legumes the cumulative effect of reduction in the physiological parameters under water stress ct treatment as observed earlier was ultimately manifested in the total dry mass accumulation of plants the retardation of growth usually comes as a cumulative effect of low water relation stomatal nature low photosynthesis mineral nutrition and other morpho physiological features related to root and shoot growth as reviewed in different legumes including black gram and mung bean pratap and sharma 2010 kumar et al 2011 fig 12 shows that with a 10 mm improvement in root zone soil water tb increased by about 410 and 310 kg ha 1 during vegetative and flowering periods respectively under water stress k improved the tolerance towards drought and amanullah 2015 reported improvement in crop production and the partitioning of dry matter in treatments well supplied with k here our results suggest using both basal and foliar application of k to lentil water productivity refers to the ratio between the yield obtained and the water used the total quantity of water consumed by crops is the cumulative water used from the plant and soil surfaces in addition to that retained within plant structures by increasing water use in plants vis a vis plant physiology grain yield is certainly to be improved early sown lentil improved plant physiology by improving lai rlwc slw chlorophyll content etc of lentil which was desired for maximizing seed yield das and jana 2015 and palta et al 2005 also found the contribution of these parameters on grain yield while the decreased root zone water under late sown conditions induced water stress that adversely affected plant functioning thomas and howarth 2000 grain yield and wp are well connected to the amount of intercept solar radiation and consequent utilization for rapid growth under optimum soil water availability which is in agreement with previous findings of hanlan et al 2006 the higher grain yield of lentil under mt was associated with higher water status that increased root proliferation and thus enhanced the availability of nutrients to crop roots thereby reflecting higher plant water status chlorophyll content and ultimately grain yield which is in agreement with the findings of bandyopadhyay et al 2018 and kumar et al 2020 whereas the ct supported the plant by porous soil structure which helped the plant to move its roots further and extract soil water in the early growing period but unavailability of soil water during partitioning and translocation of assimilates to grain got hampered thereafter the higher water productivity for mt was due to the higher yield vis a vis more water storage and better utilization of that water via transpiration where ct especially under late sown conditions was compelled to compete with higher atmospheric water demand that extracted a huge amount of soil water via evaporation and reserved less amount of soil water for reproductive growth and thus destined lower grain yield the direct inhibition of soil water evaporation by standing stubbles and the diminishing water movement from deeper soil layers to the topsoil through vapor transfer and capillarity maintained a relatively stable level of soil water content in the topsoil which improved wp under mt and nt similar findings were observed by tian et al 2003 and wang et al 2009 k had no direct impact on soil water depletion or water holding capacity of the soil but improved the plant growth indirectly under water stress conditions by positively influencing the stomatal aperture reducing transpiration loss enzymatic activities and improving the transportation of photosynthates through the phloem martineau et al 2017 5 conclusion our study suggests that the fast depletion of soil water under ct creates the early appearance of stress on late sown lentil while early sowing of lentil conserved higher soil water throughout the crop growth period on the other hand nt and mt stored a higher amount of carryover soil water and thus increasing the persistence time of soil water though higher bd and pr in nt restricted root proliferation higher conserved water alleviated the negative soil physical impact plant biomass lai rwc chlorophyll content and rooting characteristics were very much affected by the soil water storage and lai chlorophyll content and rwc showed the best plant water stress indicators k management as kbf induced higher biochemicals to resist early stress influencing rooting behavior especially in the case of late sown lentil the best seed soil contact in mt improved root activity with higher soil water storage and evapotranspiration reduced plant water stress and increased yield and water productivity hence to minimize the effect of soil water stress under cultivation in conserved moisture condition early sowing of lentil in mt condition managed with kbf can be adopted for enhancing the crop physiology and ultimately the crop

tonnes sharing 26 5 of the world s annual production goi government of india 2021 the lower gangetic plain lgp contributes 10 3 0 16 million ha of the country s total lentil growing area and 9 6 0 15 million tonnes of annual production goi government of india 2019 the rice fallows of the lower gangetic plains lgp store about 150 200 mm carryover soil water bandyopadhyay et al 2018 which provides a good opportunity for the cultivation of less water requirement crops like lentil however farmers in this region usually grow lentil during pre winter from late november to early december after the harvesting of long duration 150 160 days puddled transplanted rice bandyopadhyay et al 2018 which delayed the sowing of lentil lentil generally requires temperature from 18 to 30 c for optimum growth but more specifically it requires low temperatures during early to mid growth stages and warm temperatures only during maturity sinsawat et al 2004 temperatures above 32 20 c max min at the time of flowering and pod filling stages of lentil fatally hinder the production potential bourgault et al 2018 moreover delayed sowing with conventional tillage also strongly affects crop phenology by shortening the crop growth cycle bandyopadhyay et al 2018 furthermore the hasty soil water depletion after rice harvest followed by a fast decline in the water table in this sub tropical region caused mid and terminal drought at flowering and pod filling stages of lentil bandyopadhyay et al 2016 nandi et al 2021 one of the management practices may be manipulating the time of sowing and choosing a lentil cultivar with an appropriate maturity pattern early sowing of the crops with their rapid canopy development may allow less evaporation from the soil in this environment resulting in greater dry matter production earlier flowering and an improved harvest index after rice harvest plowing of those soils results in the formation of large clods having high breaking strength with low soil water that affects lentil germination bandyopadhyay et al 2016 2018 additionally regular tillage reduces soil organic matter lowers soil water holding capacity and soil fertility and increases wind and water erosion kar and kumar 2009 so proper selection of tillage is necessary which can help to utilize stored water by increasing soil water storage capacity reducing soil evaporation and allowing a better development of root systems the inclusion of no tillage nt and minimum tillage mt practices causes low evaporation due to more surface cover and in addition the higher bulk density increases the proportion of capillary pores that supply water to plants and seeds also gain an advantage from the capillary rise of water in deeper layers badalíková 2010 it is worth mentioning that relay sowing nt into the standing rice crop opens a new potential niche for lentils as it avoids delays due to the land is not dry enough for plowing however as the sowing date is critical for successful lentil cropping conservation tillage nt and mt with resource conservation technologies may improve soil water conservation and take care of the problems as well tillage causes a delay in sowing leading to reduce productivity as well as increased cost of production and under such situations no or minimum tillage options are effective in the timely planting of crops to mitigate soil water stress the effect of soil water stress on the plant and its mitigating option is the modern challenging work in climate change water stress indicators viz the relative water content of leaves leaf area index root proliferation and biomass production are very much sensitive to the soil water stress even chlorophyll concentration can be a consideration as a non stomata limiting factor in drought stress conditions serraj et al 2011 data on roots for adaptation to water limitation is important but tedious as compared to shoots trumbore and gaudinski 2003 strock et al 2019 an understanding of root architecture and soil water stress can explore better elucidation of water scarcity throughout the life of the crop so quantification of the coexistence between soil water stress and plant water stress indicators at different phenophases of plant growth is vital data that may help to mitigate stress potassium k has been proved to be actively involved in stomatal regulation water conduction and maintenance of water potential gradient under stress oddo et al 2020 arquero et al 2006 it k also promotes root growth and root lifespan armengaud et al 2004 which must have a role in the mitigation of abiotic stresses the application of k fertilizer to the soil or the lentil foliage may influence the k regulating power of the plant under stress environments and may act as an insurance strategy hence proper technology of sowing time modification low input conservation tillage and the method of application of potassium may control the response of morpho physiological and biochemical parameters regulating lentil growth however comprehensive information on stress enacted evapotranspiration eta as well as rooting behavior of lentil and the explication of plant physiological appearances as influenced by stress controller method mechanism following growth stages are very scanty keeping these in view the hypothesizes of the present study are set as i the introduction of short duration rice variety supports early sowing of lentil at post rainy season which could be an effective option in the utilization of stored soil moisture for lentil growth ii no tillage or minimum tillage are effective in conserve soil moisture owing to more surface cover that reduces soil evaporation and a higher proportion of capillary pores that confirms steady supply of soil water to plants allowing a better root development for alleviating terminal drought and iii the potassium application could be an insurance strategy to reduce the adverse effect of stress to plants by modification of morpho physiological and biochemical parameters regulating lentil growth to address these hypotheses a field experiment was conducted in rice fallows with two dates of sowing of lentil early and late three tillage practices nt mt and ct and k fertilizer application methods basal foliar and combinations with the objectives 1 to find out the extent of abiotic stresses vis à vis the scope of the management practices in stress mitigation 2 to evaluate the plant physiological and biochemical responses against abiotic stresses in this respect and 3 to detect the effect of management practices in the grain yield and evapotranspiration of lentil 2 materials and methods 2 1 site and soil information the study was conducted at the experimental field of bidhan chandra krishi

experimental years along with the depth of residual soil water content at the time of sowing are given in table 2 on average the duration of lentil under early and late sown conditions were observed at 109 and 102 days respectively while the growth period of lentil under nt mt and ct were noticed at 112 108 and 98 days respectively under the nt system only surface seeding was done called relay cropping where soaked seeds of lentil were broadcasted in the standing rice crop in muddy or well moistened soils 15 days before harvesting in this system no tillage was applied and soils remained undisturbed in the second crop season in mt and ct systems seeds were sown ensuring adequate seed soil contact the matured rice crop was harvested leaving the stubble height at 20 cm which left 0 35

depth of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm was calculated as the difference between the water content at field capacity 0 033 mpa and permanent wilting point 1 5 mpa using the pressure plate apparatus richard 1949 as 1 taw θ fc θ wp z r where zr effective rooting depth mm θfc and θwp are the volumetric soil water content at field capacity mm3 mm 3 and permanent wilting point mm3 mm 3 respectively the critical water content θc for each soil depth was calculated as 2 θ c 1 p θ fc θ wp θ wp where p is the soil water depletion fraction that any crop can extract from the root zone without suffering from water stress and a value of 0 5 was considered for lentil in this study allen et al 1998 the soil water stress coefficient ks was calculated following bandyopadhyay et al 2016 a modified version

amount of precipitation as 5 pr r a inf a l l w a t e r s u r p l u s where any amount of water in excess of the net water holding capacity or storage capacity of root zone soil is surplus water which is lost as deep percolation or runoff but in our study no surplus water was observed so the amount of precipitation that occurred during the growth period is considered effective precipitation i

the relationship as 6 s 0 z t 1 t 2 θ t δ z δ t where θ is the depth basis soil water content mm between two dates the end of period value t2 and beginning of period value t1 depth z was from 0 to 400 mm respectively undisturbed soil cores collected in stainless steel core samplers 5 cm diameter and 5 cm length were used for the collection of core samples from the treated plots for the determination of bulk density following the method of blake and hartge 1986 the soil cores were dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h knowing the volume of the soil core sampler and the weight of the oven dried soil the bulk density expressed as mg m 3 was calculated using the formula 7 bulk density oven dry weight of the soil volume of the soil core soil penetration was measured by using a hand held pocket penetrometer astm c 403 with a flat tip having a surface area of 0 3 cm2 as the method described by lal 1997 in each treatment three spots were chosen for the measurement of soil strength the penetration resistance pr was measured from the pit of 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm from where soil bulk density measurements were made during the measurement of soil pr soil water content was also determined then the bulk density bd soil water content θ and pr values were fitted into a multiple non linear regression model given by upadhyaya et al 1982 to measure pr and the parameters were estimated as 8 pr a bd n ρ s c b θ where a 0 33 n 1 436 c 7 494 b 0 009 and ρ s particle density 2 65 mg m 3 the reference evapotranspiration et0 mm was calculated using data from a standard uswb

root parameters viz root length density root volume root diameter and root surface area were determined by the image analysis software winrhizo arsenault et al 1995 himmelbaueret al 2004 root mass was measured by oven drying samples at 65 c for more than 48 h till the constant weight of the samples five plant samples from each replicated sub plots were selected randomly at vegetative flowering and pod formation stages of lentil for relative leaf water content rwc leaf chlorophyll concentration and proline content measurement the rwc was estimated by the method of barrs and weatherly 1962 by using the following equation 10 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 where tw turgid weight dw dry weight and fw fresh weight of leaves total chlorophyll concentration was determined from 10 to 15 fully expanded lentil leaves from plants of each plot by 95 v v ethanol extraction method followed by spectroscopic absorbance measurement at 645 and 663 nm arnon 1949 the total chlorophyll content mg g 1 fresh

leaf area plant no of plants ground area m 2 three plant samples from each plot in each replication were selected randomly for biomass measurement and the mean of three replications was computed plant samples were collected by uprooting the whole plant by soil excavation at vegetative flowering and pod formation periods after excavation the samples were slaked by dipping them into the water and washed with gently flowing water for dry biomass analysis the collected plant samples were oven dried at 60 c for more than 48 h till the constant weight of the samples was obtained the calculated total dry matter was expressed as mg ha 1 after lentil plants reached physiological maturity grain yield was determined by hand harvesting from each plot and water productivity was calculated as the

zone 0 40 cm during the critical growth periods of lentil i e sowing vegetative flowering and pod formation periods of two growing seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 are presented in fig 2 the soil water content ranged from 139 to 154 mm under early sown and from 135 to 142 mm under late sown lentil at the time of sowing during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons that straightway decreased in the succeeding growing periods and contained only 76 and 79 mm water respectively at harvesting time of both the growing years early sown lentil accounted for significantly higher soil water storage at flowering 27 3 and 21 2 and pod formation periods 25 3 and 21 6 as compared to late sown lentil additionally the time span in the growing period that falls under the readily available water raw zone as shown in fig 2 was also more in the case of early sown lentil on the other hand among the tillage practices nt stored the highest amount of soil water amounting to 128 7 mm at vegetative 113 9 mm at flowering and 100 9 mm at the pod formation stage respectively although on average the greatest rate of depletion of soil water particularly at the early growth stage was observed under ct 0 65 mm d 1 while at mid to later growth stages mt showed a higher depletion rate 0 70 mm d 1 that resulted in ct reserving the least amount of soil water for the reproductive period and ct showed an early drop from the raw water zone at 62 67 das under early sown and 45 48 das under late sown conditions however the interaction between sowing time and tillage effect was observed as significant during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods the early sown nt mt and ct depleted 28 14 and 24 higher soil water than the late sown lentil though early sown nt stored the highest soil water mt stored a sufficient amount of soil water so that mt reached below the critical soil water θc after peak reproductive stages 75 das fig 2 meanwhile late sown ct reserved the least root zone soil water throughout application of potassium caused higher depletion of root zone soil water and kbf resulted in the least soil water storage in the root zone followed by kb the interaction of sowing time and potassium treatment was observed significant during the flowering period only 3 2 extent of soil water stress and soil compaction the effect of soil water stress by emphasizing the water supplying capacity of soil quantified as soil water stress coefficient ks a dimensionless transpiration reduction factor under different sowing time tillage practices and potassium fertilizer management during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons are presented in fig 3 plants showed no stress ks 1 during the initial vegetative period 20 25 das but starting from peak vegetative to pre flowering stages plants faced stress as ks dropped below 1 plants under early and late sown faced respectively 37 and 43 stress at the flowering stage 60 65 das and 66 and 61 stress at the pod formation stage 75 85 das moreover late sowing caused 10 15 days of early stress appearance ks 1 than early sowing of lentil among the tillage practices lentil under conservation tillage nt and mt showed marginal stress at the flowering and pod formation periods 23 40 which was crucial for seed production while ct faced water stress earlier 50 55 das as well as the stress intensified thereafter by 61 and 74 during the mentioned periods among interactions effect early sown nt resulted in significantly the highest ks i e the least stress followed by mt throughout the lentil growth while a steep decrease of ks was most convincing under late sown ct with the least value at flowering 0 36 and pod formation 0 21 periods fig 3 in that scenario early sowing of ct reduced water stress than late sowing of ct by overall 51 nevertheless ks under kbf secured significantly the lowest value as compared to other k treatments however kb and kf showed no significant variations among them interaction between sowing time and tillage practices s t sowing time and potassium s k tillage and potassium t k and interactions among these three factors s t k were noticed significant during the late growth stages of lentil for both the cropping seasons as the cropped approached maturity the soil became drier that cause compaction as measured through the increment of bd and pr the maximum increment of bd and pr were recorded at surface soil that dried quickly and the least change occurred at 20 30 cm depth that dried slowly nt showed significantly the highest bd 1 55 mg m 3 followed by mt 1 52 mg m 3 while ct resulted in the lowest bd pr significantly increased mainly with the decrement of soil water r2 0 73 p 0 01 but in the case of nt production of soil cracks mainly at later stages of crop growth had significantly increased bd fig 4 the interrelationships among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k were found significant at 0 10 and 10 20 cm depth of soil 3 3 plant physiological changes 3 3 1 relative water content and chlorophyll content the relative water content rwc of leaves decreased from the vegetative to the flowering period at a slower rate 0 21 day 1 and from the flowering to pod formation stage at a steeper rate 0 68 day 1 while the chlorophyll content of leaves lcc increased collectively 13 starting from vegetative up to pod formation period of lentil table 3 the changes in rwc and lcc indicated the effect of water stress on plant physiology mainly at reproductive stages where the water conservation reduced the stress and a significant positive relationship showed a 3 7 increment in rwc with every 10 mm increase in soil water storage fig 11 on average early sown lentil significantly improved 10 2 11 2 and 6 9 rwc and 5 11 and 7 lcc as compared to late sown lentil during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods respectively the maximum water stress under ct showed the highest diminution 14 of rwc table 3 nt sown early and late produced significantly 6 5 and 3 8 higher rwc than mt while mt recorded significantly 14 greater chlorophyll over nt during the reproductive period ct under late sown showed the least amount of both rwc and chlorophyll while early sowing helped to produce comparable rwc and lcc with nt the overall effect in rwc and chlorophyll content of leaves during mid and terminal growth stages followed the order kbf kb kf k0 table 3 the kbf produced significantly 3 7 greater rwc and 0 18 mg g 1 higher lcc than the nearest treatment kb during the flowering period the implication of k in improving rwc and lcc was mostly observed under ct the interactions of sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k were found significant during flowering and pod formation stages and interactions among sowing time tillage and k management s t k of lentil were found to be significant only during the pod formation period of lentil mostly during second year of experiment table 3 3 3 2 leaf area development the increase in leaf area index lai continued up to the flowering period by reaching a maximum of 3 2 and remained almost constant afterwards early sowing elevated 39 lai than late sowing fig 5 the rapid increment of leaf area was mainly observed under nt 1 90 3 28 followed by mt 2 65 3 02 in the case of early sown lentil nt alone and for late sown lentil conjointly nt and mt produced maximum lai the application of k significantly improved lai as compared to its non application the kbf treatment showed significantly 23 33 and 60 higher lai during flowering and 22 34 and 69 higher lai during the pod formation period over kb kf and k0 respectively 3 4 rooting behavior of plants the root related parameters i e root length density rld root surface area rsa mean root diameter mrd and root volume rv were measured in the root zone depth 0 40 cm to gather information of root growing behavior among the different treatments during 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons and here the average values of two cropping years are depicted in fig 6 then a further assessment of fine to coarse roots distribution patterns in these treatments was also performed the collected dataset showed that the root distribution mainly concentrated in the sub surface layer 10 20 cm as compared to the surface layer 0 10 cm the surface layer drying may be reasoned for root accumulation at 10 20 cm soil layer where sufficient water and root respiration created the congenial environment for root growth however with a further increment of soil depth presence of roots abruptly decreased as seen from rooting parameters rld increased with the advancement of crop growth and the growth rate was as usual faster in the lower layer 20 30 cm and the maximum increment was noticed during the flowering to pod formation period and on average rld at 0 10 10 20 20 30 and 30 40 cm depths shared 39 38 19 and 4 of roots respectively fig 6 it was observed that early sown lentil produced significantly 51 30 and 31 higher rld as compared to late sown during vegetative flowering and pod formation periods interestingly under late sown conditions 16 higher root growth rld was observed at lower depths 20 30 cm than early sown lentil in concern to the tillage practices ct produced significantly 25 and 10 higher rld during the initial period of lentil growth over mt in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 respectively but starting from the peak vegetative stage mt maintained consistently the maximum rld till harvesting while nt showed the least rld at initial growth and intermediate values of rld was observed thereafter in the case of early sown lentil the depth wise rld followed the order mt ct nt and the trend followed for late sown lentil was mt nt ct the diameter class root distribution showed a significantly higher percentage of roots in the 0 0 5 mm diameter class and the percentage share of roots in higher diameter classes decreased consistently with the increase in diameter class fig 7 ct resulted in the highest percentage of roots in 0 0 5 mm diameter class followed by mt while the diameter class of 0 5 1 0 and 1 0 1 5 mm were dominated by both nt and mt on average early sowing treatment was noticed to produce 36 higher root diameter rd over the late sown lentil fig 6 and the highest proportion of rd was positioned at 0 10 cm soil layer that decreased continuously with soil depth though initially ct produced 19 higher rd than nt at reproductive stages and thereafter nt resulted in the highest rd values however the late sowing of mt produced significant rd improvement late sown ct showed a 12 higher increment of rd than early sown ct at later stages of crop growth the total root surface area trsa was significantly higher under mt in the upper 2 layers 0 20 cm while nt produced the least trsa throughout the soil depth when trsa was classified into different diameter classes significant variations in the treatments were observed the maximum portioned of trsa was found in the 0 0 5 mm diameter class where ct contributed the highest while in 0 5 1 0 and 1 0 1 5 mm diameter classes mt and nt interchangeably produced the maximum trsa though ct produced the smallest portion fig 7 now in case of rv mt had the highest rv at 0 5 and 10 20 cm soil layers the overall rv possessed the highest proportion of roots in the 0 5 1 0 mm diameter class ct produced maximum roots in the very fine root class 0 0 5 mm where rv of nt flourished under the coarse 0 5 1 0 mm root class rv at higher diameter classes 1 0 mm was dominated by nt l400 regarding k management a significant effect on rooting behavior has been observed rld rsa and rv were noticed maximum under kbf followed by kb the major effect of k was mainly observed at 10 20 cm depth although there was a miniature effect observed in surface soil also the kbf and kb showed significantly 0 002 0 018 and 0 003 0 020 cm cm 3 higher rld than kf and k0 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 8 the kbf resulted in the highest rd that was significantly 14 higher than kb k improved rd and rsa in almost all diameter classes the maximum improvement was observed in very fine roots 0 0 5 mm and fine roots 0 5 1 0 mm categories fig 7 while k improved maximum rv in 0 5 1 30 mm diameter class k also increased the amount of trt and trf significantly in all root zone depths however maximum improved was noticed at the 10 20 cm soil layer the overall effect of root growth is maximized by kbf followed by kb the sole foliar k application did not improve root growth significantly over k0 among all the rooting parameters k improved the rv parameter the most the combined analysis of variance indicated that the interrelationship between sowing time and k management s k was significant throughout the growth period where the interrelationship among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k were found to be significant at mid and later stages of lentil in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons 3 5 soil water depletion and evapotranspiration soil water depletion rate dr as influenced by different treatments during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons are presented in table 4 the crop received 20 7 21 7 mm and 11 8 15 9 mm of effective rainfall throughout the crop life span during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 cropping seasons considering different duration and times of growth periods while early and late sown lentil received 19 1 and 17 6 mm rainfall in 2016 2017 and 12 4 and 11 2 mm rainfall in 2017 2018 respectively a sudden reduction of dr was observed as and when received rainfall early sown lentil showed 72 24 and 43 higher periodic soil water change δs and 53 29 and 21 higher eta at vegetative to flowering flowering to pod formation and pod formation to harvest periods table 4 though ct recorded a higher depletion rate of 0 86 mm d 1 at the early growth stages nt and mt significantly depleted more water during the precious reproductive period the δs of mt showed 35 and 31 higher values as compared to nt and 16 and 87 5 higher as compared to ct at vegetative to flowering and flowering to pod formation period respectively table 4 by using the water balance method the mean measured seasonal eta were observed at 104 97 and 86 mm under early sown nt mt and ct though no significant difference in seasonal eta was noticed between early sown nt and mt late sowing made a significant difference between them application of k improved dr δs and eta during the important phenophases of lentil where kbf and kb resulted in higher values of them during both years on average seasonal eta under kbf and kb accounted for 89 5 mm which was 2 5 and 1 8 more than k0 and kf respectively the interrelationships among sowing time and k management s k tillage and k management t k and sowing time tillage and k management s t k significantly influenced eta for 2016 2017 at vegetative to flowering and flowering to pod formation periods table 4 3 6 total biomass production grain yield and water productivity total dry biomass tb of lentil plants ranged from 22 0 to 44 4 q ha 1 and 20 2 to 39 8 q ha 1 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively early sown lentil overall produced significantly 44 higher tb than a late sown lentil during the initial growth period of lentil mt and ct produced elevated tb manifold over nt while during flowering and pod formation periods nt overthrust the biomass production rate and achieved higher tb over mt table 5 the relationship between tb and root zone soil water showed an increment of 410 and 310 kg ha 1 tb with 10 mm improved in root zone soil water during vegetative and flowering periods respectively where the potassium application produced a more significant effect in improving tb than its non application during critical growth phases of lentil the kbf showed significantly the highest tb and the overall effect of k on tb followed the order kbf kb kf k0 all the combinations of sowing time tillage and potassium were found significant during the flowering and pod formation periods of 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 the vegetative stage showed no significant differences in the tb of lentil effects of sowing time tillage practices and potassium management on grain yield and water productivity wp in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 are presented in table 5 the grain yield and wp ranged from 4 27 to 14 23 q ha 1 and 5 9 to 15 8 kg ha mm 1 during 2016 2017 and 3 59 13 07 q ha 1 and 6 3 16 1 2 3 kg ha mm 1 during 2017 2018 respectively early sown lentil produced 12 36 and 11 12 q ha 1 seed yields which were significantly 49 and 47 more than late sown lentil 8 31 and 7 56 q ha 1 in the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons again early sown lentil significantly possessed 30 and 28 more wp as compared to the late sown lentil in 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 lentil seed yield y and actual evapotranspiration eta relationship developed by considering y and eta data across the management practices is expressed as 13 y i e l d 0 14 e t a 2 84 r 2 0 35 p 0 05 results showed that about 35 of the variations in seed yield could be attributed to variation in eta in such a way that every 14 kg of additional grain yield was obtained for every 1 mm increase in eta in this scenario mt resulted in a significant increase in grain yield and wp over ct while nt and ct showed no significant differences between them table 5 mt resulted in significantly 14 and 23 higher grain yield and 23 and 25 improved wp under early sown conditions and 24 and 10 greater grain yield and 23 and 31 enhanced wp under late sown conditions than nt during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively the grain yield and wp under kbf were estimated significantly 6 and 10 higher over kb respectively table 5 likewise during 2016 2017 kf had significantly improved grain yield and wp of lentil by 6 and 7 to k0 respectively while no significant variations between kf and k0 were observed during the 2017 2018 season in the case of early sown lentil kbf resulted in significantly 6 and 11 higher grain yield and wp while under late sown conditions kbf produced significantly 6 and 10 higher grain yield and wp over kb it was further apparent that during both seasons the interaction effect of sowing time and potassium s k tillage and potassium t k and among these three factors s t k were found significant table 5 4 discussion 4 1 profile water distribution and root zone soil water storage the different patterns of soil water distribution in the profile occurred with the advancement of crop growth as the root exploited water from different depths of soil with various intensities nonetheless the evaporative demand of the atmosphere mostly affected the initial soil water distribution while plant evapotranspiration coupled with the upward or downward flux of water modified the root zone soil water allocation at the mid and later part of crop growth the prevalence of higher soil water at the time of sowing vis a vis spending a lesser time under acute atmospheric temperature unlike late sown was the probable reason for the comparatively higher soil water under early sown lentil a similar pattern of persistence of soil water was found by saha et al 2021 in their study during working with lentil as lentil seeds were incorporated in standing paddy crops under nt soil water reserve in the root zone was ample at sowing time moreover the lower amount of macroporosity under conservation tillage i e nt or mt restricted the vertical water movement and resulted in a higher reservation of water as compared to ct table 4 this result was also followed by yadav and hassanizadeh 2011 additionally the retention of rice stubbles also contributed to the reduction of evaporation from the soil surface vis à vis slowed the rate of upward movement of soil water under nt and mt thereby conserving more water as elucidated by mandal et al 2004 lower evaporative depletion of soil water in the presence of standing rice stubbles along with the reduced rate of vertical soil water movement within the compacted puddled rice soil under conservation tillage has been reported by saxena 2009 nandi et al 2021 and mukherjee et al 2022 while for tillage operation ct plots required proper soil water and that was done by keeping the land to sunlight causing loss of soil water creating a low water storage situation at sowing and thereafter in addition das et al 2018 and obia et al 2020 pointed out that the modification of the pore geometry of the soil in the tilled plots and porous structure of the soil and the removal of residues all in combination increased the soil water movement and hastened the depletion of root zone soil water potassium application resulted in a significant effect on soil water storage due to its effect on plant metabolic activity and growth which modified root soil interactions resulting in higher water uptake white and karley 2010 also reported the modification of soil water storage through the effect of k by thrusting the its effect on plant physiological improvement hence the improved soil water reserve through early sowing and lesser water depletion by residue retention and improved canopy coverage by k application are the pathways toward mitigation of water stress in the plant 4 2 soil water stress and soil compaction physical properties of soil bd and pr were modified due to the disappearance of soil water differently by modification of sowing time and tillage practices the rapid drying of surface soil through evaporation and root water uptake ensured water derived shrinkage resulting in maximum compaction at surface soil means higher bd and pr in that region although the complete check of root growth was not achieved due to the water shortage as the pr values were below the critical pr 0 25 mpa kees 2005 the pulverized soil under ct caused the lowest bd but with the prevalence of the least amount of water ct resulted in maximum pr values a significant negative correlation p 0 01 between root zone soil water content and pr fig 9 showed the importance of water conservation to reduce the negative impact of pr souza et al 2021 also reported a similar increment of pr under water scarcity conditions scientists also credited the blockage of pores via small soil particles for the compaction of ct s soil moure et al 2016 while the implication of conservation tillage higher root zone soil water content was achieved which caused lesser pr under both mt and nt on the other hand the formation of cracks in soil starting from mid growth stages of lentil somewhat compacted the soil of nt the comparative higher compaction of nt was also shown by alvarez and steinbach 2009 and romaneckas et al 2015 moreover the soil cracking induced bd increment as evidenced by the relationship between bd and crack volume fig 4 potassium has a significant effect on the growth and development of plant roots as confirmed by jung et al 2009 which may modify the bd positively in connection with that fig 10 confirmed a significant role of root length density rld in the modification of bd of soil the expression of soil water stress emphasizing the water supplying capacity of soil as quantified by soil water stress coefficient ks was observed sequentially approaching zero with the advancement of crop growth during the initial crop growth period soil water depletion by evapotranspiration was less than the amount of readily available water and so ks showed a value of 1 i e no stress situation but with the continuous exploitation of reserved root zone soil water following crop growth ks started to fall below indicating stress which intensified thereafter up to maturity of lentil starting from the sowing period early sown lentil reserved comparatively higher soil water than late sown lentil resulting in higher values of ks throughout the growing period additionally the late sowing missed the rain events at an early vegetative stage in 2016 2017 as well as at the peak vegetative stage in 2017 2018 which had an impact on soil water stress ks on the other hand the rapid disappearance of soil water through open soil structure and the preponderance of microporosity lowered the ks values under ct that indicated lesser availability of soil water for plant uptake and thus experienced soil water stress for a prolonged time bandyopadhyay et al 2016 similarly observed lower ks values under ct at later stages of lentil and rai et al 2017 observed the same in pigeon pea the appearance of moisture stress caused forced maturity of lentil resulting crop duration of 95 98 days for ct as compared to 108 112 days for nt and mt while the higher amount of initial soil water vis a vis more persistence of soil water availability period due to the presence of more micropores under nt secured the highest ks values followed by mt however the rapid decline of ks values at terminal growth stages under late sown nt occurred may be due to the production of cracks in the soil which gave direction to the stored water for escapement which as a whole increased the ks scenario of early sown lentil at later part of growth 4 3 soil water depletion and actual evapotranspiration the depletion of soil water occurred mainly due to the cumulative effect of eta which differed in various growth stages of crop and variable atmospheric evaporative demand initially water got depleted by evaporation from the soil surface marginally covered by vegetation or standing stubbles and later by transpiration when the maximum soil surface became covered by plant foliage early sown lentil secured a greater depletion rate dr than late sown because depletion efficiency appeared to be dependent on the depth and availability of soil water at that depth and the overlying depths bandyopadhyay et al 2005 and as early sown lentil stored more soil water thus higher eta was recorded again the concomitant increase in atmospheric temperature and formation of the bare spot in soil due to the senescence of plant caused higher dr during pod formation to harvest period mainly evidenced under ct and most particularly under late sown conditions while the standing crop stubbles modified the hydro thermal regimes between the soil atmosphere interface which in turn might mitigate the soil water stress under nt and mt bandyopadhyay et al 2018 in addition to that the establishment of substantial growth of canopy coverage under these treatments increased the contribution of the transpiration component of eta as mentioned earlier the more amount of micropores and better continuity of these pores helped nt and mt to supply a continuous flow of soil water to plants which accounted for transpiration in the meantime the formation of cracks at later growth stages also caused the higher eta under nt and the findings of kumar et al 2020 and nandi et al 2021 are in line with ours in the puddled rice soil system different scientists reported water requirements for lentil ranging from 70 to 155 mm crops with life saving irrigation given externally or with the occurrence of rainfall in india bandyopadhyay et al 2016 sandhu et al 2019 nandi et al 2021 but in our experiment the maximum eta of 99 104 mm was observed under nt and mt which may be because of standing stubbles that acted as mulch and reduced the loss of evaporation from the soil surface by forming a barrier between the soil surface and the atmosphere during the crop growth period in the meantime the application of k modified plant physiology causing an increment in eta the application of potassium through controlling stomatal movement and water relations turgor regulation and osmotic adjustment in plants has been shown to enhance transpiration zain and ismail 2016 the interaction e nt kbf secured the highest eta of all as the early sown nt conserved soil water with standing rice stubble and k fertilizer application both as basal and foliar was effective in maintaining higher transpiration and checking the loss of evaporation from the soil surface 4 4 relative water content chlorophyll content and development of leaves relative water content rwc of leaves is an important indicator of water status in plants in terms of the physiological consequence of cellular water deficit and it reflected the balance between water supply to the leaf tissue and transpiration rate lugojan and ciulca 2011 in the case of early sown lentil nt and mt treatments maintained higher rwc by providing a continuous supply of soil water to maintain water absorption vis a vis metabolic activities as compared to late sown lentil and ct treatments limited water availability under ct mainly at mid and late growth stages reduced the root water uptake resulting in lower rwc also evidenced by other researchers talukdar 2013 saha et al 2020 nandi et al 2021 the water manipulated rwc is confirmed by the significant positive relationship between root zone soil water and rwc in fig 11 the turgidity of leaves prevailing under nt during the later stage of growth improved leaf chlorophyll content as well while lower chlorophyll content under ct might be due to the deficit of soil water interestingly the increment of lcc with maturity vis a vis water depletion created a situation where root zone soil water storage as well as rwc showed no significant relationships with the lcc fig 11 in support of our finding kamble et al 2015 also observed the maximum total chlorophyll content in older leaves than those showing the highest net photosynthesis on a comparative scene soil water stress restricted lcc development under late sown conditions due to the degradation of synthesized chlorophyll as well as inhibition of the synthesis of new chlorophyll pigments mathobo et al 2017 however the interaction effect of sowing time and tillage s t was found statistically significant throughout the growing period of lentil this might be due to the capability of soil water storage root growth physical improvement of soil etc which helped in the effective supply of the requisite amount of water to plant in all the growth periods availability of soil water provided little scope for k to improve further rwc during the early growth period but with the depletion of soil water k s role in maintaining the turgor pressure of leaves became significant many researchers bahrami rad and hajiboland 2017 turcios et al 2021 observed the role of k in improving leaf water status in crops like mung bean maize and wheat jákli et al 2017 pointed out the k facilities to the diffusion of co2 from the atmosphere into the chloroplast and that may be correlated with chlorophyll content lai values increased with the crop ages up to the flowering period the occurrence of stagnant lai values after the flowering period may be because the rate of leaf development as well as the leaf senescence became almost equal among the sowing treatments the early appearance of the senescence stage observed by drying and shattering of leaves as opined by pal et al 2012 resulted in the late sowing of lentil while the faster root development owing to better seed soil contact and water conservation produced higher lai under mt at mid and late growth stages yusuf 2006 similarly observed the increment in lai attributed to higher roots in connection to more uptake of water and nutrient on the other hand the rapid development of lai of nt at mid and late growth stages suggested the positive effect of the presence of higher root zone soil water storage which was sufficient to support the further new leaf development vegetative growth of plants despite of having the surface placement of seeds a significant positive relationship between root zone soil water storage and lai supported the hypothesis fig 11 these results also agree with the findings of saha et al 2010 on the other hand the diminution of the leaf development rate under ct especially in late sown conditions is caused due to scarcity of root zone water the decrease in lai as a result of soil water stress was also observed by talukdar 2013 k is effective in leaf expansion which got reduced as a result of k deficiency improved lai through the application of k in soybean was also found by zain and ismail 2016 4 5 rooting behavior of plants increasing depth of soil tends to be compacted vis a vis less prevalence of oxygen and so the roots have to overcome greater friction to obtain water and which resulted in less intense soil water depletion at 20 30 cm depth also from the study by fitter et al 2002 it is clear that root system architecture determines the overall exploration capacity of the soil profile via the synchronization of water availability and depth distribution of root segments here the sink soil water distribution revealed that with the advancement of depletion of soil water over time upper layer extraction was increasingly sourced limited while towards lower layers sink strength was limited by the lower rooting density wasson et al 2012 observed a similar shifting of rooting density during rainfed wheat production in the discussion with tillage systems nt showed the least root distribution rld of all during the initial and vegetative stages of lentil which may be because of lesser seed to soil contact where the plant had to find a soft spot to enter into the soil while the tilled porous soil under ct with good contact with the seed provided better conditions for quick root growth as compared to root growth in conservation tillage based nt and mt soil the nt gradually increased the mechanical impediment of the surface soil limiting the distribution of roots in the upper soil profile and restricting downward root proliferation the relationship between soil water storage and rld fig 9 during the later stages of lentil growth provided information that the scarcity of soil water compelled higher root growth at lower depths however mt made better seed soil contact as tyne drawn in the seed line than nt and with higher soil water than ct produced higher rld especially at later growth periods ogban et al 2008 also observed mt s better contribution to root growth the hinge of root length density rld at 10 20 cm depth for both early and late sown was due to the presence of superior soil water regimes at that depth than the surface layer with better depletion rates similar results were found by ali et al 2002 and benjamin and nielsen 2006 under insufficiency of soil moisture for late sown lentil root continued its search for water to lower depth 20 30 cm similarly an increase in root growth particularly responsive to reductions in soil water was reported by wasson et al 2012 on the other hand the application of k accelerated the growth of the entire root system which might be related to the higher mobility of k within a plant sánchez calderón et al 2005 the differences in the mean root diameter rd between the early and late sown lentil were associated with the delay in plant growth performances it was evident that lower root zone soil water storage under late sown during flowering and pod formation periods significantly affected the rd liu et al 2011 also found a similar pattern of root diameter while working with lentil the sproutings of finer and active roots during the flowering period resulted in lower rd which effectively provides water and nutrients to plants while ct produced higher rd during the vegetative period mostly due to a favorable loose soil environment which emphasized the overall growth of roots in the sufficiency of void spaces but with the course of plant growth nt faced maximum resistance for root growth due to undisturbed soil coupled with depleting soil water compelling the root to grow in diameter higher rd to search for water and nutrients mainly during reproductive periods the significant positive correlation between bulk density and rd justified the reasons for higher rd under nt as nt showed lower bulk density as compared to mt and ct similar results were found by gu et al 2017 expanded root cortical cells and the presence of additional cell layers induced by the presence of mechanical impedance could explain thickened roots additionally the subsurface water logging under nt changed the rooting pattern by inhibiting root branching on one hand and increasing the rd on the other as observed by palta et al 2010 while working with chickpeas the application of k as basal and foliar improved rd because the transport of photosynthesis products from the leaves to the roots was controlled by k and thus the accumulation of photosynthates at roots increased the rd under k applied treatments hell and mendel 2010 rsa and trl are closely related to antecedent soil water contents and are considered efficient indicators for root resource uptake ability elazab et al 2012 2016 olmo et al 2016 page et al 2016 benjamin and nielsen 2006 similarly observed a decrease distribution of root surface area in the surface layer and an increase in deeper soil layers at the mid pod fill stage in soybean the abundance of fine roots appeared under ct at the early stages of lentil growth but the disappearance of soil water may either dry the finer roots or not allow the plants to grow further finer roots mechanical impedance decreases the rate of root elongation because of a decrease in the rate of cell division in the meristematic region and a decrease in the cell length bengough et al 2011 on the other hand in the micropore dominated mt plants mainly utilized their finer roots to extract water during the reproductive growth period in the case of nt primarily the weak establishment of the plant and secondarily the increased bd and crack formation caused the plant to shift its root growth towards coarse fractions soil compaction significantly reduced taproot growth by up to four times whereas root diameter significantly increased in non compacted soil as observed by chen and weil 2011 chen et al 2014 k s effect on growing finer roots was previously reported by zhang et al 2009 the abundance of soil water increased finer roots whereas the unavailability of soil water produced coarser roots as shown in the figures figs 6 and 7 4 6 biomass development grain yield and water productivity biomass development in plants is directly related to the available soil water storage and thus at later growth stages plants started to build up active osmolytes in their cells to cope with water stress and lowered plant growth slama et al 2011 evidenced that phenomenon in legumes the cumulative effect of reduction in the physiological parameters under water stress ct treatment as observed earlier was ultimately manifested in the total dry mass accumulation of plants the retardation of growth usually comes as a cumulative effect of low water relation stomatal nature low photosynthesis mineral nutrition and other morpho physiological features related to root and shoot growth as reviewed in different legumes including black gram and mung bean pratap and sharma 2010 kumar et al 2011 fig 12 shows that with a 10 mm improvement in root zone soil water tb increased by about 410 and 310 kg ha 1 during vegetative and flowering periods respectively under water stress k improved the tolerance towards drought and amanullah 2015 reported improvement in crop production and the partitioning of dry matter in treatments well supplied with k here our results suggest using both basal and foliar application of k to lentil water productivity refers to the ratio between the yield obtained and the water used the total quantity of water consumed by crops is the cumulative water used from the plant and soil surfaces in addition to that retained within plant structures by increasing water use in plants vis a vis plant physiology grain yield is certainly to be improved early sown lentil improved plant physiology by improving lai rlwc slw chlorophyll content etc of lentil which was desired for maximizing seed yield das and jana 2015 and palta et al 2005 also found the contribution of these parameters on grain yield while the decreased root zone water under late sown conditions induced water stress that adversely affected plant functioning thomas and howarth 2000 grain yield and wp are well connected to the amount of intercept solar radiation and consequent utilization for rapid growth under optimum soil water availability which is in agreement with previous findings of hanlan et al 2006 the higher grain yield of lentil under mt was associated with higher water status that increased root proliferation and thus enhanced the availability of nutrients to crop roots thereby reflecting higher plant water status chlorophyll content and ultimately grain yield which is in agreement with the findings of bandyopadhyay et al 2018 and kumar et al 2020 whereas the ct supported the plant by porous soil structure which helped the plant to move its roots further and extract soil water in the early growing period but unavailability of soil water during partitioning and translocation of assimilates to grain got hampered thereafter the higher water productivity for mt was due to the higher yield vis a vis more water storage and better utilization of that water via transpiration where ct especially under late sown conditions was compelled to compete with higher atmospheric water demand that extracted a huge amount of soil water via evaporation and reserved less amount of soil water for reproductive growth and thus destined lower grain yield the direct inhibition of soil water evaporation by standing stubbles and the diminishing water movement from deeper soil layers to the topsoil through vapor transfer and capillarity maintained a relatively stable level of soil water content in the topsoil which improved wp under mt and nt similar findings were observed by tian et al 2003 and wang et al 2009 k had no direct impact on soil water depletion or water holding capacity of the soil but improved the plant growth indirectly under water stress conditions by positively influencing the stomatal aperture reducing transpiration loss enzymatic activities and improving the transportation of photosynthates through the phloem martineau et al 2017 5 conclusion our study suggests that the fast depletion of soil water under ct creates the early appearance of stress on late sown lentil while early sowing of lentil conserved higher soil water throughout the crop growth period on the other hand nt and mt stored a higher amount of carryover soil water and thus increasing the persistence time of soil water though higher bd and pr in nt restricted root proliferation higher conserved water alleviated the negative soil physical impact plant biomass lai rwc chlorophyll content and rooting characteristics were very much affected by the soil water storage and lai chlorophyll content and rwc showed the best plant water stress indicators k management as kbf induced higher biochemicals to resist early stress influencing rooting behavior especially in the case of late sown lentil the best seed soil contact in mt improved root activity with higher soil water storage and evapotranspiration reduced plant water stress and increased yield and water productivity hence to minimize the effect of soil water stress under cultivation in conserved moisture condition early sowing of lentil in mt condition managed with kbf can be adopted for enhancing the crop physiology and ultimately the crop

9136,emerging studies provide promising evidence that applying zeolite combined with water saving irrigation could effectively retain soil nutrients and increase rice yields however the effects of this water nitrogen management strategy on soil nitrogen n loss through leaching and runoff are unclear under field conditions herein we explored the dynamics of n concentrations quantified soil n losses through leachate and runoff and investigated the response of reducing n loss on rice yield a three year field experiment 2018 2020 was conducted in donggang city of liaoning province in northeast china the field experiment used a split plot design including two irrigation regimes continuously flooded irrigation cf and alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd as main plots and two zeolite applications z0 no zeolite z10 10 t ha 1 zeolite as sub plots so as to quantify their effects on tn nh4 n no3 n loss and rice yield averaged across 3 years our results showed that awd reduced the volume of irrigation leachate and runoff by 22 2 20 8 and 18 9 respectively compared with cf awd also decreased the losses of total n tn nh4 n and no3 n by 25 5 17 5 and 11 1 in leachate and by 22 9 18 3 and 26 3 in runoff respectively compared with cf compared to z0 z10 reduced the losses of tn nh4 n and no3 n by 16 0 16 9 and 19 4 in leachate and by 10 0 14 0 and 5 9 in runoff respectively n output through leaching and runoff under awd and z10 was decreased by 2 1 and 2 2 respectively compared with cf and z0 no significant difference was found in rice yield between cf and awd whereas rice yields increased 3 3 under z10 compared with z0 altogether our results highlight that the combination of zeolite and awd can simultaneously produce more rice yield and reduce soil n losses graphical abstract ga1 keywords paddy fields nitrogen management water saving irrigation nitrogen output agricultural environment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l is a pivotal food crop accounting for nearly one third of agricultural cultivation in china and feeding at least 60 of the total population faostat 2017 hamoud et al 2019 increasing grain yield is crucial to ensure food security in china however high yields can negatively impact the environment owing to large synthetic n fertilizer inputs dou 2018 peng et al 2006 singh et al 2018 xue et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 leaching and runoff are considered major pathways of soil n migration into surrounding waterbodies from rice fields threatening groundwater and oceans ladha et al 2005 jiang et al 2019 it was estimated that soil n losses through leaching and runoff have increased by 114 and 108 respectively during 1980 2010 owing to increased fertilizer application in china he et al 2018 this negative impact on the environment may even be worse with climate change martinez mena et al 2020 øygarden et al 2014 thus simultaneously mitigating soil n loss while increasing grain yields are needed to address environmental protection and food security requirements in rice growing systems water managements can dramatically alter the water migration process han et al 2021 li et al 2021 excessive irrigation will promote solute n migration with water movement and threaten surrounding water quality wang et al 2014 alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd a water saving irrigation practice is widely recognized as an eco friendly strategy to decrease water use and nutrient loss while maintaining or increasing rice yields compared with continuously flooded irrigation cf carrijo et al 2017 kukal et al 2005 lahue et al 2016 ye et al 2013 improvements in water use efficiency can reach 63 and the reduction of irrigation volume can reach 54 under awd compared with cf lampayan et al 2015 linquist et al 2015 in addition amin et al 2021 and liang et al 2013 found that awd can reduce water losses through leaching and runoff up to 70 and 37 respectively although it is obvious that awd will reduce water input and output substantially the effects of awd on the characteristics of n entering the aquatic environment remain inconsistent zheng et al 2019 showed that controlled irrigation significantly reduced n leaching losses compared with conventional irrigation though the average concentration of tn was remarkably increased liang et al 2013 found that awd reduced tn losses by 23 3 30 4 whereas the nutrient concentrations were not decreased in runoff in contrast sun et al 2019 and tan et al 2013 demonstrated that awd significantly increased inorganic n concentration in the leachate and thereby enhanced n leaching relative to cf added to this previous results were based on a single n pathway or short term studies from lysimeters amin et al 2021 sun et al 2019 a more comprehensive assessment of the driving mechanisms of awd on soil n loss is necessary to improve the development of more resilient agriculture numerous soil n management practices i e zeolite biochar and controlled released fertilizer and urease inhibitor have been proposed as a feasible measure to reduce soil n loss while increase grain yields lateef et al 2016 hermassi et al 2020 nigussie et al 2016 skrzypczak et al 2019 of these zeolite is considered a more attractive material than others due to high selectivity of ion exchange regenerable adsorption relative abundance ease of application and low cost maghsoodi et al 2020 misaelides 2011 ramesh and reddy 2011 volcanic sedimentary mineral zeolites are structured by a three dimensional framework of aluminosilicate which are linked by oxygen atoms ramesh and reddy 2011 wojciechowska et al 2019 this structural feature allows zeolite to have large specific surface area and high cation exchange capacity many results have been proven that the application of zeolite to soil show several prominent agricultural benefits such as increasing soil surface area promoting n retention and reducing soil urease activity de campos bernardi et al 2016 he et al 2002 furthermore previous investigations have observed that zeolite can construct the water plant soil microbe zeolite system so that the soil nutrients availability for crop uptake are substantially prolonged gholamhoseini et al 2012 torma et al 2014 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021 for example sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 demonstrated that 8 t ha 1 zeolite improved grain yields due to increasing soil n retention wu et al 2020 observed that 10 t ha 1 zeolite application provided a more stable process for grain filling because of increasing n accumulation however before applying zeolite to large areas the environmental impacts of zeolite application in rice fields should be determined to address these knowledge deficits we have conducted a three year field experiment to investigate the effects of the combination of zeolite with two irrigation regimes on soil n loss through leaching and runoff and rice yield in the paddy fields the specific objectives are to a explore the dynamic characteristics in n forms to identify the critical nodes of n loss reduction following application of optimizing water nitrogen strategies b quantify the effects of optimizing water nitrogen strategies on soil n loss and c investigate the responses of rice yield to soil n loss reduction under optimizing water nitrogen strategies such optimizing strategies will assist in reducing the impact of soil nutrient losses on the eutrophication of surrounding water environment while ensuring sustainable rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

1992 the ridges 60 cm in wide 20 cm in high covered with a plastic membrane inserted into the plough layer 35 cm were used to isolate the water between cf and awd as well as experimental plots and outer filed in order to avoid hydrologic changes fig 2a the plots were enclosed by a 45 cm high polyvinyl chloride barrier 35 cm buried blow the soil to reduce horizontal flow of nutrients chen et al 2017 urea 46 n potassium sulfate 50 k2o and superphosphate 12 p2o5 were applied according to local fertilization practices with the rates shown in table 1 the particle sizes of zeolite clinoptilolite were 0 18 0 38 mm which was purchased from faku county of liaoning province china the components of zeolite available at www syxyfsc cn were as follows 67 90 sio2 12 44 al2o3 6 51 cao 1 22 mgo 1 20

soil surface only once in the first year according to the local rice cultivation practices the water used for irrigation was sourced from donggang irrigation district it was stored in a pond within the experimental site from the beginning of transplanting each year the n concentration in the irrigation water was tested each year and averaged tn 0 28 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 14 mg l 1 no3 n 0 03 mg l 1 in cf the water layer was kept at 1 5 cm above soil surface for the entire rice season after transplanting and then naturally dried 15 days before harvest in awd a 1 3 cm water layer was kept 15 days facilitating seedling recovery after transplanting thereafter the water surface of the awd cycle changed from 10 cm below the soil surface to 3 cm above the soil surface except for allowing it to drop 25 cm below the soil surface with one week at the final tillering stage table 2 standing water was also maintained before each fertilization and spraying pesticide each plot had an independent irrigation and drainage system water meters mywt minyi china were used to measure water volume the water level of each plot was measured a field tube consisting of a pvc pipe 20 cm in diameter 40 cm in length 5 mm diameter holes 20 mm spaced apart the pipe was inserted in the soil and the soil removed from its inside fig 2b bouman and tuong 2001 rice seedings of cultivar dongyan 18 were produced from april 20 to may 30 transplanted on may 31 and harvested on september 22 the row line spacing was 14 30 cm with three seedlings each hill weeding was performed regularly by hand while pest control and other field management followed local practices 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 leachate sampling leachate was defined at the depth of 30 cm below the root zone this is because a large portion of nh4 n in deeper leachate 30 cm came from the slow decomposition and mineralization of organic n in subsoil rather than migration of ammonium n from fertilizers zhang et al 2018 previous studies have shown that n leaching loss diminished with increasing soil depth and most of the n loss was retained in 0 40 cm depth of soil wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 a bottom sealed pvc pipe 90 cm long 5 cm in diameter perforated with 6 rows of 5 mm holes the first row 15 cm from the bottom was installed vertically in each plot at the depth of 50 cm fig 2b ye et al 2015 the holes were wrapped with gauze to prevent surrounding silt entering the upper pipe wall was sealed by dried clay powder to avoid surface water and soil to enter the pvc pipe qiao et al 2013 the top of the pipe was covered to prevent rain and insects a self priming pump was used to drain out all remaining water at 8 00 am and collected the fresh leachate samples at 16 00 pm samples of 100 ml were collected in plastic bottles the sampling frequency was 2 3 d intervals after fertilization and then at 10 15 d intervals until rice maturity in addition leachate was collected immediately after heavy precipitation 50 mm 2 3 2 runoff loss sampling runoff water was collected after each continuous or intensive precipitation event an overflow barrel 100 cm high 80 cm in diameter with a lid was buried 80 cm below the soil surface and 40 cm away from one of the long sides of each plot which was linked with an overflow pipe as shown in fig 2b all connection parts were sealed with metal buckle plastic gaskets and waterproof adhesive the height of runoff depth was above 8 cm in the paddy filed which is the same with local drainage outlet a 100 ml sample was collected after mixing in the barrels for test after collecting the sample the runoff water was drained from these barrels in time for next collection the volume of runoff was calculated by difference of water level before and after runoff events in the barrel 2 3 3 rice yield rice yield was measured in each plot by manual harvesting the harvested grain was naturally dried for 7 days and the rice weight measured after threshing using a hand driven thresher the dry matter yield was determined assuming a moisture content of 14 2 3 4 samples testing and analysis the total quantity of leachate s t was calculated as follows 1 s t w t i t p t r t e t

of water samples included ammonia n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and total n tn the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n were measured by the cga seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany the concentration of tn was measured by the uv 2700 spectrophotometer after digestion by potassium peroxodisulfate the data were visually assessed using shapiro wilk normality test which did not show any non normal distribution mishra et al 2019 therefore a three factor anova was conducted to assess the impact of year irrigation regimes zeolite applications and their interactions in sas proc mixed procedure sas

the quantity of irrigation precipitation leaching and runoff was 341 505 466 881 316 684 and 55 418 mm across the three years respectively table 3 the largest volume of irrigation 505 mm and leachate 684 mm were reached in 2018 the maximum quantity of runoff 418 mm occurred in 2020 due to higher precipitation than in 2018 and 2019 the contribution of precipitation to water consumption in different growing seasons was 48 8 72 2 the loss of leachate and runoff accounted for 35 3 61 7 and 6 6 31 6 of total water input precipitation and irrigation across the three years respectively table 3 compared with cf awd significantly reduced irrigation frequency by 41 7 45 5 irrigation volume by 18 8 24 6 leachate volume by 18 2 26 8 and runoff volume by 9 9 26 7 across the three years table 3 3 2 n concentrations and losses in the leachate the three year concentrations of tn displayed a similar decreasing tendency during the rice growing season fig 3 the maximum tn concentration observed following the 1st fertilization the 2nd fertilization resulted in elevating slightly in tn concentration and then decreasing a similar trend of tn concentration variation was observed under two irrigation regimes during the rice growing season of each year the average concentration of tn in awd was slightly higher than that of cf the treatment of z10 exhibited lower concentration of tn than did treatment of z0 especially during 1st fertilization in 2018 and the 2nd fertilization in 2019 and 2020 respectively the loss of tn was markedly affected by the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z table 4 the cumulative tn losses in the leachate were 12 1 9 5 and 12 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 7 0 5 5 and 7 3 of the n applied irrespective of zeolite applications the treatment of awd caused 38 6 20 6 and 17 4 less tn losses respectively than did cf in 2018 2019 and 2020 regardless of irrigation regimes z10 significantly lowered the losses of tn by 8 5 in 2018 16 2 in 2019 23 4 in 2020 respectively in comparison to the z0 treatment the variations of nh4 n concentration in three years showed similar dynamic patterns with tn fig 4 the losses of nh4 n in the leachate was affected by the year irrigation regimes and zeolite application but not the interaction of them table 4 the cumulative nh4 n losses were 4 1 6 3 and 8 4 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 33 8 66 1 66 9 of seasonal total tn losses averaged across zeolite applications the awd treatment showed 17 5 reductions in nh4 n losses compared to the cf treatment the three year average seasonal cumulative nh4 n losses were significantly reduced by 16 9 with zeolite addition as compared to no zeolite addition the no3 n was maintained at low concentration over the rice growing season and the variation exhibited greater temporal variability during the fertilization stage fig 5 the trend of no3 n variation in awd was almost identical to the cf the addition of zeolite resulted in lower concentration of no3 n than no zeolite especially during the 1st and 2nd fertilization in 2018 concerning the losses of no3 n the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z were statistically significant table 4 the cumulative no3 n losses were 1 6 0 5 and 0 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 13 0 5 0 and 4 7 of seasonal total tn losses the no3 n losses were 12 5 8 0 12 7 lower for the awd treatment than for the cf treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively averaged across irrigation regimes z10 had 21 6 15 4 and 21 2 lower no3 n losses than z0 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively 3 3 n concentration and losses in runoff there were nine runoff events occurred in three years across the three years the average concentrations of tn and nh4 n during the first two fertilization stage was higher than that during the 3rd fertilization stage figs 6 and 7 the concentration differences of tn in different irrigation treatments were not significant the zeolite application lowered the tn concentration in each runoff event the loss of tn was significantly affected by the year and irrigation regime but not zeolite application and the interaction of them table 5 the losses of tn in the runoff were 0 7 0 5 and 2 0 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively which was 0 4 0 3 and 1 2 of applied n averaged across zeolite applications the tn losses in the runoff was 22 9 lower for the awd treatment than for the cf treatment averaged across irrigation regimes z10 reduced tn loss by 10 0 compared with z0 both of awd and zeolite application reduced nh4 n concentration in runoff year irrigation regime zeolite application and y z were significant effect factors of nh4 n losses response table 5 the loss of nh4 n in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 4 0 3 and 1 2 kg ha 1 respectively which accounted for 55 1 71 1 and 62 0 of tn loss averaged across zeolite applications the awd treatment significantly resulted in 18 3 lower nh4 n losses than in the cf treatment regardless of the irrigation regimes the nh4 n losses was reduced by 7 5 14 7 and 19 7 in the z10 treatment than in the z0 treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the maximum concentration of no3 n was observed during the 1st fertilization in 2019 fig 8 the treatments of awd and z10 had no obvious effects on no3 n concentration reduction with respect to cf and z0 respectively the loss of no3 n in the runoff were significantly affected by year irrigation regime and zeolite application table 5 the cumulative no3 n losses were 0 1 0 1 and 0 3 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 which accounted for 15 9 15 6 15 5 of tn losses respectively the three year average seasonal cumulative no3 n losses was significantly lowered by 26 3 with awd treatment as compared to cf treatment averaged across irrigation regimes the treatment of z10 significantly reduced seasonal cumulative no3 n losses by 5 9 compared with z0 3 4 n output and rice yield across the three years the total n output via leaching and runoff accounted for 5 8 8 5 of n applied the total n loss ratio was significantly affected by the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z table 6 averaged across zeolite applications awd reduced n loss ratio by 3 5 in 2018 1 4 in 2019 and 1 6 in 2020 respectively regardless of irrigation regimes the n loss ratio was lowered by 1 4 2 0 and 3 0 under z10 compared with z0 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively rice yield was significantly negatively correlated with tn loss in z0 and it was more closely in awd than in cf there was no such relationship discovered in z10 under two irrigation regimes fig 9 year and zeolite application had significant effects on rice yield table 6 averaged across the three years the rice yield was 7 4 7 9 and 7 0 mg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively irrigation regimes did not cause significant differences in rice yield across the three years averaged across irrigation regimes the z10 treatment significantly increased rice yields by 3 3 with respect to z0 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd on leaching and runoff leaching and runoff are two vital pathways for water migration to nearby rivers and groundwater in the paddy field specifically the process of leaching is approximately continuous due to the water demand characteristics of rice growth fu et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 it was highly associated with water input patterns irrigation or precipitation yang et al 2015 mo et al 2022 in the present study leaching was the dominant pathway of water loss with respect to runoff which accounted for 35 3 61 7 of water input similarly amin et al 2021 and hatiye et al 2017 found that the leaching water loss was in the range of 37 9 86 0 of water input however xu et al 2019 and li et al 2017 reported that the leaching water loss ranged from 23 2 to 37 6 of water input which was lower than the present study the discrepancies are attributed to different infiltration rate caused by irrigation intensity precipitation distribution groundwater depth and soil types xu et al 2017 tan et al 2013 the application of water saving irrigation can lower the rate of infiltration and thus reduce the risk of n loss we found that the application of awd significantly reduced leachate volume by 18 2 26 8 compared with cf which was within the range of 7 4 42 5 as observed by liang et al 2021 and peng et al 2011 the common effect is due to the lower irrigation amount and frequency under awd weakening soil water vertical movement and switching it from leaching into the groundwater capillary rise in contrast to cf xu et al 2019 the runoff events are random and uncontrollable which is driven by precipitation intensity and frequency yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2012 in the present study the runoff events and the volume showed significant differences across the three years this discrepancy is attributed to the time interval between precipitation and irrigation and the frequency and intensity of precipitation mo et al 2022 we found that the runoff volume was significantly reduced by 9 9 26 7 under awd compared with cf which agreed with liang et al 2013 this is mainly because awd lowered the water surface depth and expanded precipitation loading capacity han et al 2021 liang et al 2019 4 2 effects of awd and zeolite on n loss in the leachate leaching was the main pathway of n loss accounting for 5 5 7 3 of n applied similarly ding et al 2020 and han et al 2021 reported that tn loss accounted for 4 8 and 5 4 of the n applied respectively however amin et al 2021 observed that n losses in the leachate were up to 9 36 of fertilizer applied which was higher than the present study this discrepancy was caused by different fertilizer application rates irrigation volume and precipitation in the other areas riley et al 2001 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the variations of n loss concentration in the leachate were influenced by fertilization especially the first application wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 this phenomenon was also observed in this study it can be construed that plant absorbed the less n and the soil was disturbed before transplanting resulting in exceeding nutrients at early stage after application of fertilizer was more than the loading range of the soil and roots prone to high leaching concentration chen et al 2021b liang et al 2013 in this study nh4 n was the main inorganic n loss form in the leachate across the three years which was consistent with previous studies akter et al 2018 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2019 this was caused by the rapid hydrolysis of urea and mineralization of organic n ke et al 2018 the continuous flooding conditions resulted in low nitrate nitrogen concentrations in this study due to the anaerobic environment created for denitrification zhao et al 2012 nevertheless several studies found that tn loss was dominated by no3 n mo allim et al 2018 shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2012 the difference of n loss forms in the leachate was caused by different sampling depths soil types fertilizer and total water input ji et al 2011 yang et al 2015 notably the present result showed that the remaining n loss organic n dominated was also one of the main forms of n loss in 2018 obtained from difference subtraction in table 4 which was also found by previous research qiao et al 2013 this can be explained by higher fertilizer rates and lower temperature during early stage after transplanting the low activity of urease was not sufficient to decompose a large amount of soluble organic n resulting in organic n content exceeding soil loading capacity while the downward movement of organic n molecules with the leachate was faster than that of inorganic n duan et al 2016 water saving irrigation could reduce n loss relative to more frequent irrigation jiao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 in the present study the results showed that the average concentration of tn of the awd treatment was higher than that of cf nevertheless compared with cf the application of awd reduced tn loss by 17 4 38 6 in the leachate similarly jiao et al 2018 demonstrated that the application of awd increased inorganic n concentration but conventional irrigation caused more tn loss in the leachate amin et al 2021 observed the similar total mineral n concentration in awd and cf treatments whereas n loss was reduced by 44 in awd than that in cf furthermore our results showed that the loss of nh4 n was lowered by 17 5 under awd compared with cf it was lower than 23 4 and 46 0 as observed by chen et al 2021b and peng et al 2011 due to low fertilizer application rates in this study notably the effect of awd on no3 n is controversial in the present study the loss of no3 n was reduced by 8 0 12 7 which was similar to the results of chen et al 2021b and peng et al 2011 in contrast tan et al 2013 found that awd increased no3 n loss by 29 4 compared with cf it was due to the different duration of the aerobic environment caused by different intensity of the alternating wet and dry conditions in turn leading to significant differences in the concentration of no3 n zeolite application can improve soil physical and chemical properties and minimize nutrient loss colombani et al 2016 we found that zeolite application reduced tn loss by 8 5 23 4 across the three years similarly gholamhoseini et al 2012 showed that 9 t ha 1 zeolite application reduced n loss by 36 37 in the rape field khodaeijoghan et al 2010 found that n loss in the leachate was reduced by 16 under zeolite application latifah et al 2017 showed that zeolite application increased soil tn content this was due to the entry of urea molecules into the zeolite which avoided partial exposure to urease and delayed conversion of urea to ammonium maghsoodi et al 2020 moreover our results observed that nh4 n loss was reduced by 16 9 on average with zeolite application similarly zwingmann et al 2009 showed that zeolite application reduced nh4 n loss by 31 it is due to the large cation exchange capacity of zeolite as well as the large specific surface area our results also showed that no3 n loss was reduced by 15 4 21 6 in the zeolite treatments similarly malekian et al 2011 found that zeolite application could reduce no3 n loss by 22 furthermore torma et al 2014 observed that no3 n losses were reduced up to 66 78 with zeolite application the reasons for this significant difference are as follows a the application of zeolite improved the ability of the soil to retain nh4 n minimizing the conversion of nh4 n to no3 n ahmed et al 2006 mumpton 1999 zwingmann et al 2009 b nitrifying bacteria can not enter the pores due to the selective adsorption characteristics of zeolite thus avoiding the inner ammonium ions nitrification ramesh and reddy 2011 4 3 effects of awd and zeolite on n loss in runoff the runoff events are random and the amounts of n losses with runoff were negligible relative to leaching losses we found that n loss was 0 3 1 2 of n applied across the three years it was similar to ding et al 2020 who reported that 2 6 of the n applied was lost via runoff however gu et al 2015 showed that the n loss via runoff was up to 13 of n applied this discrepancy is caused by irrigation regimes fertilization rates and climatic conditions in different regions pandey et al 2018 øygarden et al 2014 furthermore the interval between precipitation events and fertilizer application is also an important factor influencing n runoff kim et al 2006 sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 the longer the interval between the runoff event and fertilizer application the lower n concentration in the runoff in turn reducing the risk of n discharge to surrounding water environment through runoff zhao et al 2012 in the present study nh4 n was the dominant form of n loss in the runoff which accounted for 55 1 71 7 of n measured wang et al 2019 also reported that nh4 n loss was accounted for 52 of total n lost via runoff in rice season this is mainly due to the rapid conversion of urea to ammonium n promoted by urease furthermore the depletion of rice growth and microbial activities further weakened the nitrate n content yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 optimizing water management is essential to reduce runoff n losses from the paddy fields fu et al 2021 our results showed that awd reduced tn losses by 22 9 compared with cf averaged across the three years similarly liang et al 2013 observed that awd reduced tn losses by 23 3 30 4 relative to cf yu et al 2021 and peng et al 2011 also showed that the controlled irrigation lowered n losses by 60 8 and 53 9 via runoff respectively this was mainly due to the fact that awd effectively reduced the depth of the water layer at the surface of the field in turn extending water storage duration moreover some results showed that surface n runoff loss is influenced by rainfall intensity shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 notably dong et al 2012 showed that although awd reduces n runoff loss the negative effects of denitrification through ammonia volatilization may be exacerbated by high nutrient concentrations furthermore we found that awd could reduce nh4 n by 18 3 and no3 n by 26 3 which is consistent with liang et al 2013 and peng et al 2011 to our knowledge the effect of zeolite on runoff n loss in the paddy field is reported first in this study zeolite application reduced tn losses by 11 1 but no significance this may be caused by the low n loss in this experiment we also found that zeolite application reduced nh4 n losses by 7 5 19 7 and no3 n by 5 9 it was because zeolite was applied to the surface layer in turn reducing the risk of nutrient loss to the topsoil from precipitation splash behzadfar et al 2017 4 4 effects of awd and zeolite on n output and rice yield n output through leaching and runoff in the paddy field could be quantified by n loss ratio wei et al 2021 in the present study total n output accounted for 5 8 8 5 of n applied which was consistent with the findings of tian et al 2007 who reported a 5 6 8 3 n output via leaching and runoff it was lower than n output via denitrification and ammonia volatilization chen et al 2021a the reasons for this were as follows a urea was usually applied to the surface water as n fertilizer leading to high nh4 n concentration thereby increasing ammonia volatilization shi et al 2020 b the paddy field was flooded for most of the growing season resulting in a strong denitrification progress thereby promoting gaseous n emissions zhou et al 2020 nevertheless n output through water flow was more closely associated with water pollution relative to gaseous n output into the atmosphere zhao et al 2012 in our results both awd and zeolite reduced n output through leaching and runoff however the interaction of them was not significant it was limited by agronomic various environmental and biological factors wang and li 2019 a significant negative correlation was observed between n loss and yield which was consistent with previous findings irfan et al 2018 linquist et al 2013 lyu et al 2021 this is because the more the n lost the less is absorbed by plants which in turn leads to lower grain yields yang et al 2021 the results in this study showed that the application of water saving irrigation or zeolite alone could reduce the risk of rice yield reduction the interaction effect of irrigation i and zeolite z on increasing grain yield was not observed table 6 which was inconsistent with previous findings for example sun et al 2019 reported that the application of zeolite effectively increased rice yields and the aforementioned process was significantly enhanced by awd ozbahce et al 2018 found that the combination of zeolite with urea and 75 of full irrigation was beneficial for potato growth the similar result was obtained by pratt et al 2009 who showed that awd improved the performance of zeolite applications one of the reasons for this difference was that these results were based on a lysimeter experiment with no consideration of precipitation distribution another reason was the short experiment stage as most were conducted for one to two years 5 conclusions our results clarified the effects of zeolite awd and their interactions on rice yield and soil n loss the results fill an important knowledge gap of zeolite and awd for n output reduce through leaching and runoff on paddy fields across the three years awd significantly reduced the amount of irrigation leachate and runoff by 18 8 24 6 18 2 26 8 and 9 9 26 7 respectively compared with cf zeolite and awd alone effectively reduced n losses by 8 5 23 4 and 17 4 38 6 in leachate and 10 0 and 22 9 in runoff respectively as compared to z0 and cf n output through leaching and runoff in awd and z10 was 1 4 3 5 and 1 4 3 0 lower than in cf and z0 respectively in addition rice yield was increased by 3 3 under zeolite application overall the combined application of zeolite and awd can be considered as an environmentally friendly strategy that can increase rice yields while reducing soil n loss the present study demonstrated the feasibility of combined awd and zeolite at the plot scale it should be further explored in terms of filed commercial scale soil types farm conditions rice cultivars etc furthermore the comprehensive economic benefits of this strategy should be evaluated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement yanzhi wang writing original draft writing review editing

9136,emerging studies provide promising evidence that applying zeolite combined with water saving irrigation could effectively retain soil nutrients and increase rice yields however the effects of this water nitrogen management strategy on soil nitrogen n loss through leaching and runoff are unclear under field conditions herein we explored the dynamics of n concentrations quantified soil n losses through leachate and runoff and investigated the response of reducing n loss on rice yield a three year field experiment 2018 2020 was conducted in donggang city of liaoning province in northeast china the field experiment used a split plot design including two irrigation regimes continuously flooded irrigation cf and alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd as main plots and two zeolite applications z0 no zeolite z10 10 t ha 1 zeolite as sub plots so as to quantify their effects on tn nh4 n no3 n loss and rice yield averaged across 3 years our results showed that awd reduced the volume of irrigation leachate and runoff by 22 2 20 8 and 18 9 respectively compared with cf awd also decreased the losses of total n tn nh4 n and no3 n by 25 5 17 5 and 11 1 in leachate and by 22 9 18 3 and 26 3 in runoff respectively compared with cf compared to z0 z10 reduced the losses of tn nh4 n and no3 n by 16 0 16 9 and 19 4 in leachate and by 10 0 14 0 and 5 9 in runoff respectively n output through leaching and runoff under awd and z10 was decreased by 2 1 and 2 2 respectively compared with cf and z0 no significant difference was found in rice yield between cf and awd whereas rice yields increased 3 3 under z10 compared with z0 altogether our results highlight that the combination of zeolite and awd can simultaneously produce more rice yield and reduce soil n losses graphical

oryza sativa l is a pivotal food crop accounting for nearly one third of agricultural cultivation in china and feeding at least 60 of the total population faostat 2017 hamoud et al 2019 increasing grain yield is crucial to ensure food security in china however high yields can negatively impact the environment owing to large synthetic n fertilizer inputs dou 2018 peng et al 2006 singh et al 2018 xue et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 leaching and runoff are considered major pathways of soil n migration into surrounding waterbodies from rice fields threatening groundwater and oceans ladha et al 2005 jiang et al 2019 it was estimated that soil n losses through leaching and runoff have increased by 114 and 108 respectively during 1980 2010 owing to increased fertilizer application in china he et al 2018 this negative impact on the environment may even be worse with climate change martinez mena et al 2020 øygarden et al 2014 thus simultaneously mitigating soil n loss while increasing grain yields are needed to address environmental protection and food security requirements in rice growing systems water managements can dramatically alter the water migration process han et al 2021 li et al 2021 excessive irrigation will promote solute n migration with water movement and threaten surrounding water quality wang et al 2014 alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd a water saving irrigation practice is widely recognized as an eco friendly strategy to decrease water use and nutrient loss while maintaining or increasing rice yields compared with continuously flooded irrigation cf carrijo et al 2017 kukal et al 2005 lahue et al 2016 ye et al 2013 improvements in water use efficiency can reach 63 and the reduction of irrigation volume can reach 54 under awd compared with cf lampayan et al 2015 linquist et al 2015 in addition amin et al 2021 and liang et al 2013 found that awd can reduce water losses through leaching and runoff up to 70 and 37 respectively although it is obvious that awd will reduce water input and output substantially the effects of awd on the characteristics of n entering the aquatic environment remain inconsistent zheng et al 2019 showed that controlled irrigation significantly reduced n leaching losses compared with conventional irrigation though the average concentration of tn was remarkably increased liang et al 2013 found that awd reduced tn losses by 23 3 30 4 whereas the nutrient concentrations were not decreased in runoff in contrast sun et al 2019 and tan et al 2013 demonstrated that awd significantly increased inorganic n concentration in the leachate and thereby enhanced n leaching relative to cf added to this previous results were based on a single n pathway or short term studies from lysimeters amin et al 2021 sun et al 2019 a more comprehensive assessment of the driving mechanisms of awd on soil n loss is necessary to improve the development of more resilient agriculture numerous soil n management practices i e zeolite biochar and controlled released fertilizer and urease inhibitor have been proposed as a feasible measure to reduce soil n loss while increase grain yields lateef et al 2016 hermassi et al 2020 nigussie et al 2016 skrzypczak et al 2019 of these zeolite is considered a more attractive material than others due to high selectivity of ion exchange regenerable adsorption relative abundance ease of application and low cost maghsoodi et al 2020 misaelides 2011 ramesh and reddy 2011 volcanic sedimentary mineral zeolites are structured by a three dimensional framework of aluminosilicate which are linked by oxygen atoms ramesh and reddy 2011 wojciechowska et al 2019 this structural feature allows zeolite to have large specific surface area and high cation exchange capacity many results have been proven that the application of zeolite to soil show several prominent agricultural benefits such as increasing soil surface area promoting n retention and reducing soil urease activity de campos bernardi et al 2016 he et al 2002 furthermore previous investigations have observed that zeolite can construct the water plant soil microbe zeolite system so that the soil nutrients availability for crop uptake are substantially prolonged gholamhoseini et al 2012 torma et al 2014 wang et al 2017 wang et al 2021 for example sepaskhah and barzegar 2010 demonstrated that 8 t ha 1 zeolite improved grain yields due to increasing soil n retention wu et al 2020 observed that 10 t ha 1 zeolite application provided a more stable process for grain filling because of increasing n accumulation however before applying zeolite to large areas the environmental impacts of zeolite application in rice fields should be determined to address these knowledge deficits we have conducted a three year field experiment to investigate the effects of the combination of zeolite with two irrigation regimes on soil n loss through leaching and runoff and rice yield in the paddy fields the specific objectives are to a explore the dynamic characteristics in n forms to identify the critical nodes of n loss reduction following application of optimizing water nitrogen strategies b quantify the effects of optimizing water nitrogen strategies on soil n loss and c investigate the responses of rice yield to soil n loss reduction under optimizing water nitrogen strategies such optimizing strategies will assist in reducing the impact of soil nutrient losses on the eutrophication of surrounding water environment while ensuring sustainable rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

2 m the main plots were two irrigation regimes cf continuously flooded irrigation and awd alternate wetting and drying irrigation the sub plots were two zeolite applications z0 no zeolite and z10 10 t

1992 the ridges 60 cm in wide 20 cm in high covered with a plastic membrane inserted into the plough layer 35 cm were used to isolate the water between cf and awd as well as experimental plots and outer filed in order to avoid hydrologic changes fig 2a the plots were enclosed by a 45 cm high polyvinyl chloride barrier 35 cm buried blow the soil to reduce horizontal flow of nutrients chen et al 2017 urea 46 n potassium sulfate 50 k2o and superphosphate 12 p2o5 were applied according to local fertilization practices with the rates shown in table 1 the particle sizes of zeolite clinoptilolite were 0 18 0 38 mm which was purchased from faku county of liaoning province china the components of zeolite available at www syxyfsc cn were as follows 67 90 sio2 12 44 al2o3 6 51 cao 1 22 mgo 1 20

soil surface only once in the first year according to the local rice cultivation practices the water used for irrigation was sourced from donggang irrigation district it was stored in a pond within the experimental site from the beginning of transplanting each year the n concentration in the irrigation water was tested each year and averaged tn 0 28 mg l 1 nh4 n 0 14 mg l 1 no3 n 0 03 mg l 1 in cf the water layer was kept at 1 5 cm above soil surface for the entire rice season after transplanting and then naturally dried 15 days before harvest in awd a 1 3 cm water layer was kept 15 days facilitating seedling recovery after transplanting thereafter the water surface of the awd cycle changed from 10 cm below the soil surface to 3 cm above the soil surface except for allowing it to drop 25 cm below the soil surface with one week at the final tillering stage table 2 standing water was also maintained before each fertilization and spraying pesticide each plot had an independent irrigation and drainage system water meters mywt minyi china were used to measure water volume the water level of each plot was measured a field tube consisting of a pvc pipe 20 cm in diameter 40 cm in length 5 mm diameter holes 20 mm spaced apart the pipe was inserted in the soil and the soil removed from its inside fig 2b bouman and tuong 2001 rice seedings of cultivar dongyan 18 were produced from april 20 to may 30 transplanted on may 31 and harvested on september 22 the row line spacing was 14 30 cm with three seedlings each hill weeding was performed regularly by hand while pest control and other field management followed local practices 2 3 sampling and analysis 2 3 1 leachate sampling leachate was defined at the depth of 30 cm below the root zone this is because a large portion of nh4 n in deeper leachate 30 cm came from the slow decomposition and mineralization of organic n in subsoil rather than migration of ammonium n from fertilizers zhang et al 2018 previous studies have shown that n leaching loss diminished with increasing soil depth and most of the n loss was retained in 0 40 cm depth of soil wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 a bottom sealed pvc pipe 90 cm long 5 cm in diameter perforated with 6 rows of 5 mm holes the first row 15 cm from the bottom was installed vertically in each plot at the depth of 50 cm fig 2b ye et al 2015 the holes were wrapped with gauze to prevent surrounding silt entering the upper pipe wall was sealed by dried clay powder to avoid surface water and soil to enter the pvc pipe qiao et al 2013 the top of the pipe was covered to prevent rain and insects a self priming pump was used to drain out all remaining water at 8 00 am and collected the fresh leachate samples at 16 00 pm samples of 100 ml were collected in plastic bottles the sampling frequency was 2 3 d intervals after fertilization and then at 10 15 d intervals until rice maturity in addition leachate was collected immediately after heavy precipitation 50 mm 2 3 2 runoff loss sampling runoff water was collected after each continuous or intensive precipitation event an overflow barrel 100 cm high 80 cm in diameter with a lid was buried 80 cm below the soil surface and 40 cm away from one of the long sides of each plot which was linked with an overflow pipe as shown in fig 2b all connection parts were sealed with metal buckle plastic gaskets and waterproof adhesive the height of runoff depth was above 8 cm in the paddy filed which is the same with local drainage outlet a 100 ml sample was collected after mixing in the barrels for test after collecting the sample the runoff water was drained from these barrels in time for next collection the volume of runoff was calculated by difference of water level before and after runoff events in the barrel 2 3 3 rice yield rice yield was measured in each plot by manual harvesting the harvested grain was naturally dried for 7 days and the rice weight measured after threshing using a hand driven thresher the dry matter yield was determined assuming a moisture content of 14 2 3 4 samples testing and analysis the total quantity of leachate s t was calculated as follows 1 s t w t i t p t r t e t

of water samples included ammonia n nh4 n nitrate n no3 n and total n tn the concentration of nh4 n and no3 n were measured by the cga seal analytical autoanalyzer 3 germany the concentration of tn was measured by the uv 2700 spectrophotometer after digestion by potassium peroxodisulfate the data were visually assessed using shapiro wilk normality test which did not show any non normal distribution mishra et al 2019 therefore a three factor anova was conducted to assess the impact of year irrigation regimes zeolite applications and their interactions in sas proc mixed procedure sas

the quantity of irrigation precipitation leaching and runoff was 341 505 466 881 316 684 and 55 418 mm across the three years respectively table 3 the largest volume of irrigation 505 mm and leachate 684 mm were reached in 2018 the maximum quantity of runoff 418 mm occurred in 2020 due to higher precipitation than in 2018 and 2019 the contribution of precipitation to water consumption in different growing seasons was 48 8 72 2 the loss of leachate and runoff accounted for 35 3 61 7 and 6 6 31 6 of total water input precipitation and irrigation across the three years respectively table 3 compared with cf awd significantly reduced irrigation frequency by 41 7 45 5 irrigation volume by 18 8 24 6 leachate volume by 18 2 26 8 and runoff volume by 9 9 26 7 across the three years table 3 3 2 n concentrations and losses in the leachate the three year concentrations of tn displayed a similar decreasing tendency during the rice growing season fig 3 the maximum tn concentration observed following the 1st fertilization the 2nd fertilization resulted in elevating slightly in tn concentration and then decreasing a similar trend of tn concentration variation was observed under two irrigation regimes during the rice growing season of each year the average concentration of tn in awd was slightly higher than that of cf the treatment of z10 exhibited lower concentration of tn than did treatment of z0 especially during 1st fertilization in 2018 and the 2nd fertilization in 2019 and 2020 respectively the loss of tn was markedly affected by the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z table 4 the cumulative tn losses in the leachate were 12 1 9 5 and 12 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 7 0 5 5 and 7 3 of the n applied irrespective of zeolite applications the treatment of awd caused 38 6 20 6 and 17 4 less tn losses respectively than did cf in 2018 2019 and 2020 regardless of irrigation regimes z10 significantly lowered the losses of tn by 8 5 in 2018 16 2 in 2019 23 4 in 2020 respectively in comparison to the z0 treatment the variations of nh4 n concentration in three years showed similar dynamic patterns with tn fig 4 the losses of nh4 n in the leachate was affected by the year irrigation regimes and zeolite application but not the interaction of them table 4 the cumulative nh4 n losses were 4 1 6 3 and 8 4 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 33 8 66 1 66 9 of seasonal total tn losses averaged across zeolite applications the awd treatment showed 17 5 reductions in nh4 n losses compared to the cf treatment the three year average seasonal cumulative nh4 n losses were significantly reduced by 16 9 with zeolite addition as compared to no zeolite addition the no3 n was maintained at low concentration over the rice growing season and the variation exhibited greater temporal variability during the fertilization stage fig 5 the trend of no3 n variation in awd was almost identical to the cf the addition of zeolite resulted in lower concentration of no3 n than no zeolite especially during the 1st and 2nd fertilization in 2018 concerning the losses of no3 n the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z were statistically significant table 4 the cumulative no3 n losses were 1 6 0 5 and 0 6 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively and contributed 13 0 5 0 and 4 7 of seasonal total tn losses the no3 n losses were 12 5 8 0 12 7 lower for the awd treatment than for the cf treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively averaged across irrigation regimes z10 had 21 6 15 4 and 21 2 lower no3 n losses than z0 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively 3 3 n concentration and losses in runoff there were nine runoff events occurred in three years across the three years the average concentrations of tn and nh4 n during the first two fertilization stage was higher than that during the 3rd fertilization stage figs 6 and 7 the concentration differences of tn in different irrigation treatments were not significant the zeolite application lowered the tn concentration in each runoff event the loss of tn was significantly affected by the year and irrigation regime but not zeolite application and the interaction of them table 5 the losses of tn in the runoff were 0 7 0 5 and 2 0 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively which was 0 4 0 3 and 1 2 of applied n averaged across zeolite applications the tn losses in the runoff was 22 9 lower for the awd treatment than for the cf treatment averaged across irrigation regimes z10 reduced tn loss by 10 0 compared with z0 both of awd and zeolite application reduced nh4 n concentration in runoff year irrigation regime zeolite application and y z were significant effect factors of nh4 n losses response table 5 the loss of nh4 n in 2018 2019 and 2020 were 0 4 0 3 and 1 2 kg ha 1 respectively which accounted for 55 1 71 1 and 62 0 of tn loss averaged across zeolite applications the awd treatment significantly resulted in 18 3 lower nh4 n losses than in the cf treatment regardless of the irrigation regimes the nh4 n losses was reduced by 7 5 14 7 and 19 7 in the z10 treatment than in the z0 treatment in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively the maximum concentration of no3 n was observed during the 1st fertilization in 2019 fig 8 the treatments of awd and z10 had no obvious effects on no3 n concentration reduction with respect to cf and z0 respectively the loss of no3 n in the runoff were significantly affected by year irrigation regime and zeolite application table 5 the cumulative no3 n losses were 0 1 0 1 and 0 3 kg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 which accounted for 15 9 15 6 15 5 of tn losses respectively the three year average seasonal cumulative no3 n losses was significantly lowered by 26 3 with awd treatment as compared to cf treatment averaged across irrigation regimes the treatment of z10 significantly reduced seasonal cumulative no3 n losses by 5 9 compared with z0 3 4 n output and rice yield across the three years the total n output via leaching and runoff accounted for 5 8 8 5 of n applied the total n loss ratio was significantly affected by the year irrigation regime zeolite application y i and y z table 6 averaged across zeolite applications awd reduced n loss ratio by 3 5 in 2018 1 4 in 2019 and 1 6 in 2020 respectively regardless of irrigation regimes the n loss ratio was lowered by 1 4 2 0 and 3 0 under z10 compared with z0 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively rice yield was significantly negatively correlated with tn loss in z0 and it was more closely in awd than in cf there was no such relationship discovered in z10 under two irrigation regimes fig 9 year and zeolite application had significant effects on rice yield table 6 averaged across the three years the rice yield was 7 4 7 9 and 7 0 mg ha 1 in 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively irrigation regimes did not cause significant differences in rice yield across the three years averaged across irrigation regimes the z10 treatment significantly increased rice yields by 3 3 with respect to z0 treatment 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd on leaching and runoff leaching and runoff are two vital pathways for water migration to nearby rivers and groundwater in the paddy field specifically the process of leaching is approximately continuous due to the water demand characteristics of rice growth fu et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 it was highly associated with water input patterns irrigation or precipitation yang et al 2015 mo et al 2022 in the present study leaching was the dominant pathway of water loss with respect to runoff which accounted for 35 3 61 7 of water input similarly amin et al 2021 and hatiye et al 2017 found that the leaching water loss was in the range of 37 9 86 0 of water input however xu et al 2019 and li et al 2017 reported that the leaching water loss ranged from 23 2 to 37 6 of water input which was lower than the present study the discrepancies are attributed to different infiltration rate caused by irrigation intensity precipitation distribution groundwater depth and soil types xu et al 2017 tan et al 2013 the application of water saving irrigation can lower the rate of infiltration and thus reduce the risk of n loss we found that the application of awd significantly reduced leachate volume by 18 2 26 8 compared with cf which was within the range of 7 4 42 5 as observed by liang et al 2021 and peng et al 2011 the common effect is due to the lower irrigation amount and frequency under awd weakening soil water vertical movement and switching it from leaching into the groundwater capillary rise in contrast to cf xu et al 2019 the runoff events are random and uncontrollable which is driven by precipitation intensity and frequency yan et al 2021 zhao et al 2012 in the present study the runoff events and the volume showed significant differences across the three years this discrepancy is attributed to the time interval between precipitation and irrigation and the frequency and intensity of precipitation mo et al 2022 we found that the runoff volume was significantly reduced by 9 9 26 7 under awd compared with cf which agreed with liang et al 2013 this is mainly because awd lowered the water surface depth and expanded precipitation loading capacity han et al 2021 liang et al 2019 4 2 effects of awd and zeolite on n loss in the leachate leaching was the main pathway of n loss accounting for 5 5 7 3 of n applied similarly ding et al 2020 and han et al 2021 reported that tn loss accounted for 4 8 and 5 4 of the n applied respectively however amin et al 2021 observed that n losses in the leachate were up to 9 36 of fertilizer applied which was higher than the present study this discrepancy was caused by different fertilizer application rates irrigation volume and precipitation in the other areas riley et al 2001 xiao et al 2019 yang et al 2015 the variations of n loss concentration in the leachate were influenced by fertilization especially the first application wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 this phenomenon was also observed in this study it can be construed that plant absorbed the less n and the soil was disturbed before transplanting resulting in exceeding nutrients at early stage after application of fertilizer was more than the loading range of the soil and roots prone to high leaching concentration chen et al 2021b liang et al 2013 in this study nh4 n was the main inorganic n loss form in the leachate across the three years which was consistent with previous studies akter et al 2018 peng et al 2011 wang et al 2019 this was caused by the rapid hydrolysis of urea and mineralization of organic n ke et al 2018 the continuous flooding conditions resulted in low nitrate nitrogen concentrations in this study due to the anaerobic environment created for denitrification zhao et al 2012 nevertheless several studies found that tn loss was dominated by no3 n mo allim et al 2018 shi et al 2020 zhao et al 2012 the difference of n loss forms in the leachate was caused by different sampling depths soil types fertilizer and total water input ji et al 2011 yang et al 2015 notably the present result showed that the remaining n loss organic n dominated was also one of the main forms of n loss in 2018 obtained from difference subtraction in table 4 which was also found by previous research qiao et al 2013 this can be explained by higher fertilizer rates and lower temperature during early stage after transplanting the low activity of urease was not sufficient to decompose a large amount of soluble organic n resulting in organic n content exceeding soil loading capacity while the downward movement of organic n molecules with the leachate was faster than that of inorganic n duan et al 2016 water saving irrigation could reduce n loss relative to more frequent irrigation jiao et al 2018 shi et al 2020 in the present study the results showed that the average concentration of tn of the awd treatment was higher than that of cf nevertheless compared with cf the application of awd reduced tn loss by 17 4 38 6 in the leachate similarly jiao et al 2018 demonstrated that the application of awd increased inorganic n concentration but conventional irrigation caused more tn loss in the leachate amin et al 2021 observed the similar total mineral n concentration in awd and cf treatments whereas n loss was reduced by 44 in awd than that in cf furthermore our results showed that the loss of nh4 n was lowered by 17 5 under awd compared with cf it was lower than 23 4 and 46 0 as observed by chen et al 2021b and peng et al 2011 due to low fertilizer application rates in this study notably the effect of awd on no3 n is controversial in the present study the loss of no3 n was reduced by 8 0 12 7 which was similar to the results of chen et al 2021b and peng et al 2011 in contrast tan et al 2013 found that awd increased no3 n loss by 29 4 compared with cf it was due to the different duration of the aerobic environment caused by different intensity of the alternating wet and dry conditions in turn leading to significant differences in the concentration of no3 n zeolite application can improve soil physical and chemical properties and minimize nutrient loss colombani et al 2016 we found that zeolite application reduced tn loss by 8 5 23 4 across the three years similarly gholamhoseini et al 2012 showed that 9 t ha 1 zeolite application reduced n loss by 36 37 in the rape field khodaeijoghan et al 2010 found that n loss in the leachate was reduced by 16 under zeolite application latifah et al 2017 showed that zeolite application increased soil tn content this was due to the entry of urea molecules into the zeolite which avoided partial exposure to urease and delayed conversion of urea to ammonium maghsoodi et al 2020 moreover our results observed that nh4 n loss was reduced by 16 9 on average with zeolite application similarly zwingmann et al 2009 showed that zeolite application reduced nh4 n loss by 31 it is due to the large cation exchange capacity of zeolite as well as the large specific surface area our results also showed that no3 n loss was reduced by 15 4 21 6 in the zeolite treatments similarly malekian et al 2011 found that zeolite application could reduce no3 n loss by 22 furthermore torma et al 2014 observed that no3 n losses were reduced up to 66 78 with zeolite application the reasons for this significant difference are as follows a the application of zeolite improved the ability of the soil to retain nh4 n minimizing the conversion of nh4 n to no3 n ahmed et al 2006 mumpton 1999 zwingmann et al 2009 b nitrifying bacteria can not enter the pores due to the selective adsorption characteristics of zeolite thus avoiding the inner ammonium ions nitrification ramesh and reddy 2011 4 3 effects of awd and zeolite on n loss in runoff the runoff events are random and the amounts of n losses with runoff were negligible relative to leaching losses we found that n loss was 0 3 1 2 of n applied across the three years it was similar to ding et al 2020 who reported that 2 6 of the n applied was lost via runoff however gu et al 2015 showed that the n loss via runoff was up to 13 of n applied this discrepancy is caused by irrigation regimes fertilization rates and climatic conditions in different regions pandey et al 2018 øygarden et al 2014 furthermore the interval between precipitation events and fertilizer application is also an important factor influencing n runoff kim et al 2006 sun et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 the longer the interval between the runoff event and fertilizer application the lower n concentration in the runoff in turn reducing the risk of n discharge to surrounding water environment through runoff zhao et al 2012 in the present study nh4 n was the dominant form of n loss in the runoff which accounted for 55 1 71 7 of n measured wang et al 2019 also reported that nh4 n loss was accounted for 52 of total n lost via runoff in rice season this is mainly due to the rapid conversion of urea to ammonium n promoted by urease furthermore the depletion of rice growth and microbial activities further weakened the nitrate n content yang et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 optimizing water management is essential to reduce runoff n losses from the paddy fields fu et al 2021 our results showed that awd reduced tn losses by 22 9 compared with cf averaged across the three years similarly liang et al 2013 observed that awd reduced tn losses by 23 3 30 4 relative to cf yu et al 2021 and peng et al 2011 also showed that the controlled irrigation lowered n losses by 60 8 and 53 9 via runoff respectively this was mainly due to the fact that awd effectively reduced the depth of the water layer at the surface of the field in turn extending water storage duration moreover some results showed that surface n runoff loss is influenced by rainfall intensity shi et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 notably dong et al 2012 showed that although awd reduces n runoff loss the negative effects of denitrification through ammonia volatilization may be exacerbated by high nutrient concentrations furthermore we found that awd could reduce nh4 n by 18 3 and no3 n by 26 3 which is consistent with liang et al 2013 and peng et al 2011 to our knowledge the effect of zeolite on runoff n loss in the paddy field is reported first in this study zeolite application reduced tn losses by 11 1 but no significance this may be caused by the low n loss in this experiment we also found that zeolite application reduced nh4 n losses by 7 5 19 7 and no3 n by 5 9 it was because zeolite was applied to the surface layer in turn reducing the risk of nutrient loss to the topsoil from precipitation splash behzadfar et al 2017 4 4 effects of awd and zeolite on n output and rice yield n output through leaching and runoff in the paddy field could be quantified by n loss ratio wei et al 2021 in the present study total n output accounted for 5 8 8 5 of n applied which was consistent with the findings of tian et al 2007 who reported a 5 6 8 3 n output via leaching and runoff it was lower than n output via denitrification and ammonia volatilization chen et al 2021a the reasons for this were as follows a urea was usually applied to the surface water as n fertilizer leading to high nh4 n concentration thereby increasing ammonia volatilization shi et al 2020 b the paddy field was flooded for most of the growing season resulting in a strong denitrification progress thereby promoting gaseous n emissions zhou et al 2020 nevertheless n output through water flow was more closely associated with water pollution relative to gaseous n output into the atmosphere zhao et al 2012 in our results both awd and zeolite reduced n output through leaching and runoff however the interaction of them was not significant it was limited by agronomic various environmental and biological factors wang and li 2019 a significant negative correlation was observed between n loss and yield which was consistent with previous findings irfan et al 2018 linquist et al 2013 lyu et al 2021 this is because the more the n lost the less is absorbed by plants which in turn leads to lower grain yields yang et al 2021 the results in this study showed that the application of water saving irrigation or zeolite alone could reduce the risk of rice yield reduction the interaction effect of irrigation i and zeolite z on increasing grain yield was not observed table 6 which was inconsistent with previous findings for example sun et al 2019 reported that the application of zeolite effectively increased rice yields and the aforementioned process was significantly enhanced by awd ozbahce et al 2018 found that the combination of zeolite with urea and 75 of full irrigation was beneficial for potato growth the similar result was obtained by pratt et al 2009 who showed that awd improved the performance of zeolite applications one of the reasons for this difference was that these results were based on a lysimeter experiment with no consideration of precipitation distribution another reason was the short experiment stage as most were conducted for one to two years 5 conclusions our results clarified the effects of zeolite awd and their interactions on rice yield and soil n loss the results fill an important knowledge gap of zeolite and awd for n output reduce through leaching and runoff on paddy fields across the three years awd significantly reduced the amount of irrigation leachate and runoff by 18 8 24 6 18 2 26 8 and 9 9 26 7 respectively compared with cf zeolite and awd alone effectively reduced n losses by 8 5 23 4 and 17 4 38 6 in leachate and 10 0 and 22 9 in runoff respectively as compared to z0 and cf n output through leaching and runoff in awd and z10 was 1 4 3 5 and 1 4 3 0 lower than in cf and z0 respectively in addition rice yield was increased by 3 3 under zeolite application overall the combined application of zeolite and awd can be considered as an environmentally friendly strategy that can increase rice yields while reducing soil n loss the present study demonstrated the feasibility of combined awd and zeolite at the plot scale it should be further explored in terms of filed commercial scale soil types farm conditions rice cultivars etc furthermore the comprehensive economic benefits of this strategy should be evaluated in future studies credit authorship contribution statement yanzhi wang writing original draft writing review editing

9137,compound dry and hot events or extremes cdhes can cause reduced crop yield posing threat to food security their impacts can be even higher than their univariate counterparts due to the compounding effects of the two extremes as such understanding the agricultural risk of cdhes is critical for devising adaptation measures for the agricultural sector under global warming however previous studies mainly focus on changes in the hazard related characteristics of cdhes while the risk assessment encompassing hazards exposure and vulnerability is still lacking in this study we assess changes in the risk of cdhes to cropland in historical and future periods across the mainland of china which incorporates cropland exposure and socio economic vulnerability at regional scales along with increased hazards of cdhes and heterogeneous changes of vulnerability the risk of cdhes was shown to increase across large regions of the country e g northeast china north china and east china for the historical period from 1967 to 2014 based on cmip6 simulations the agricultural risk of cdhes is projected to increase in the future period 2053 2100 by a factor of 1 3 compared with that in the historical period this study provides a useful basis for agricultural risk assessments of cdhes and developing adaptation measures in china under global warming keywords extremes hazards compound events cmip6 climate change data availability i have shared the link of the data in the manuscript 1 introduction china has been vulnerable to increased frequency and intensity of extremes e g droughts and heatwaves under global warming due to the fast temperature increase and vulnerability of the natural environment and human society ding et al 2021 among high impact extremes droughts and hot extremes e g heat waves can be incredibly harmful and induce devastating impacts on multiple sectors of china resulting in natural disasters that capture public attention with the increase in global mean temperature the frequency and intensity of droughts and hot extremes in china have increased and are projected to increase in the future posing great risks to multiple sectors including agriculture chen et al 2018 dai et al 2020 han et al 2021 leng et al 2015 thus it is important to understand the risk of droughts and hot extremes in china to cope with extremes under global warming quantitative and qualitative risk assessments of droughts and hot extremes have been conducted in different regions including china blauhut 2020 he et al 2013 prabnakorn et al 2019 though different definitions or conceptualizations exist drought risk assessments are generally based on hazards exposure and vulnerability carrao et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 hazards of droughts are usually defined based on the frequency severity or return periods from a suite of drought indicators such as the standardized precipitation index spi or standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei guo et al 2022 liu and chen 2021 ribeiro et al 2019 while the exposure and vulnerability are mainly based on agricultural social and economic indicators hagenlocher et al 2019 prabnakorn et al 2019 for example dai et al 2020 assessed the dynamics of agricultural drought risk in the pearl river delta region of china by combining exposure vulnerability and resilience and found that agricultural drought risk has increased considerably in most regions over the last fifty years monteleone et al 2022 evaluated the risk of agricultural systems in northern italy by establishing a vulnerability curve between drought hazards and losses and highlighted the importance of appropriate irrigation strategies to cope with yield losses from droughts the risk of hot extremes can be assessed similarly by incorporating associated hazards e g heat related indicators and exposure vulnerability which generally concerns societal factors dubey et al 2021 he et al 2021 li et al 2021 and agriculture dong et al 2018 sharma et al 2020 teixeira et al 2013 wang et al 2021 for example teixeira et al 2013 evaluated the risk of agriculture including four key crops of wheat maize rice and soybean to heat stress at a global scale and found temperate and sub tropical agricultural regions were subject to significant crop yield losses due to extreme temperature these risk assessments of droughts and hot extremes can be useful for devising adaptation measures for extremes under global warming owing to multiple driving factors large scale circulation patterns and land atmospheric feedbacks droughts and hot extremes may co occur leading to the so called compound dry and hot events or extremes cdhes cheng et al 2019 hao and singh 2020 miralles et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2018 the cdhes may lead to compounding risks to multiple sectors or systems including agricultural production and food security ipcc 2022 as such it is important to evaluate the risk of cdhes to agriculture to mitigate their impacts recently the risk of cdhes to agriculture has been highlighted feng et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2022 however previous studies mainly assessed the risk from the perspective of hazards or exposures for example the increased frequency and intensity of cdhes across china i e hazard related characteristics have been found in historical periods chen et al 2019 feng et al 2022 yu and zhai 2020 zhang et al 2022 which causes increased exposure of cropland or population to cdhes in china feng et al 2022 wu et al 2021 yu and zhai 2020 although great progress has already been made on hazards or exposure of cdhes in china agricultural risk assessments of cdhes incorporating the hazards exposure and vulnerability at the national scale are still lacking the objective of this study is to quantify the agricultural risk of cdhes for historical and future periods in the mainland of china by taking into account the hazards frequency of cdhe exposure cropland fraction and vulnerability we first explored the changes in the hazards of cdhes and associated cropland exposures for two equal periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 the vulnerability based on irrigation and gross domestic product gdp was then calculated from which the risk distribution maps of cdhes in china were then constructed to evaluate changes in historical periods finally based on the future hazards from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 simulations we explored changes in the risk of cdhes between historical periods 1967 2014 and future periods 2053 2100 2 data the meteorological data for the period from 1967 to 2014 were obtained from the cn05 1 dataset to calculate the frequency of cdhes in china this dataset was developed based on around 2400 meteorological stations and is available at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 wu et al 2017 for the exposure of cropland we use the global cropland distribution dataset in the year 2000 from nasa s socioeconomic data and applications center sedac with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 ramankutty et al 2008 the meteorological data and cropland data were bilinearly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the gdp and irrigated area fraction for two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 were employed as vulnerability indicators represented by data in 1990 and 2015 the gdp data were obtained from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center liu et al 2005a and were regridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on the spatial aggregation the irrigation area data of the province for 1990 and 2015 were obtained from the china statistical yearbook the irrigation data were exported as raster data in the arcgis software and resampled to 0 5 0 5 to evaluate future agricultural risks of cdhes we obtained the monthly precipitation and temperature data from the cmip6 model simulations eyring et al 2016 under ssp585 scenarios we chose 10 cmip6 models with a relatively high resolution details of these models are provided in table s1 and all simulations were bilinearly gridded to the 0 5 0 5 resolution we employed data from historical simulations for the period from 1967 to 2014 and future projections from 2053 to 2100 48 years for both periods for future agricultural risks we only considered changes in hazards and used the same indicators of exposure and vulnerability for historical periods due to data limitation 3 method of risk estimation the risk of extremes depends not only on the physical intensity of exposure to natural hazards but also on the vulnerability of socioeconomics susceptibility of being adversely affected following previous studies in defining the risk of natural hazards ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 carrao et al 2016 the risk of cdhes in this study consists of three factors including hazards the frequency of cdhes exposure cropland fraction and vulnerability gdp and irrigated area fraction the computation of risk can be expressed as ipcc 2022 1 risk hazard exposure vulnerability the general framework of the risk assessment in this study is shown in fig 1 the computation of hazard exposure and vulnerability is introduced as follows 3 1 hazard estimation the hazard indicator of cdhes in this study is defined as the frequency or likelihood of occurrence for each grid during each period i e 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 following previous studies bevacqua et al 2021 ribeiro et al 2020 we choose a percentage based threshold to define cdhes specifically the dry event is defined as monthly precipitation below the 25th percentile while the hot event is detected as the monthly temperature exceeding the 75th percentile wu et al 2021 the frequency of compound events for the two historical periods of 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 and for the future period 2053 2100 are all calculated based on the thresholds of the period 1967 2014 the frequency of two periods is defined as the number of occurrences of cdhes n 1 and n 2 respectively divided by the total number of months during each period to compare the changes in hazards between the two periods the relative change h c for the two periods is calculated as follows 2 h c n 2 n 1 n 1 100 3 2 exposure to cdhes the proportion of cropland in 2000 is used as the exposure indicator we also compute the cropland exposed to cdhes following previous studies jones et al 2015 raymond et al 2022 sarhadi et al 2018 weber et al 2020 the exposure of cropland to cdhes can be calculated as the product of the frequency of cdhes and the proportion of cropland at each grid point the computation of the exposure to cdhes i e exposure to the hazard e h at each grid point is expressed as follows 3 e h pc f where e h represents the exposure of cropland to cdhes pc represents the proportion of cropland and f represents the frequency of cdhes based on eq 1 risks are also equal to the exposure of cropland to cdhes multiplied by the vulnerability indicator 3 3 vulnerability following previous studies in assessing the vulnerability to natural disasters ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 carrao et al 2016 cutter and finch 2008 the gdp and irrigated area fraction are selected as vulnerability indicators in this study gdp can reflect the development of an area and developed areas are expected to better mitigate the adverse effects of cdhes the larger irrigated area fraction indicates that it is less affected by cdhes therefore both gdp and irrigated area fraction are negatively correlated with vulnerability due to differences in the unit the two vulnerability indicators are normalized to characterize the vulnerability carrao et al 2016 the min max normalization method is employed to normalize all indicators to values between 0 and 1 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 naumann et al 2014 the normalization of the two negative indicators of vulnerability can be expressed as 4 x max x x max x min x where x represents the normalized result and x represents the raw data max x is the maximum value of the gdp or irrigated area fraction of the two periods 1990 and 2015 across all grids min x is the minimum value estimated in a similar way the vulnerability index is generally computed by assigning weights to the standardized values in previous literature the equal weight method and expert scoring method have been employed to determine the weights of each index kim et al 2021 meza et al 2021 prabnakorn et al 2019 villani et al 2022 in this study the two indicators are assigned the same weight and the vulnerability is calculated using the arithmetic average method as follows 5 v x 1 x 2 2 where v represents vulnerability x 1 and x 2 represent the normalized result of gdp and irrigated area fraction respectively 4 results 4 1 hazard of cdhes fig 2 a shows the frequency distribution of cdhes in china from 1967 to 1990 the frequency of cdhes during 1991 2014 is generally higher than that during 1967 1990 as shown in fig 2 b the higher frequency of cdhes for the recent period is shown in northeast china north china and eastern regions of northwest southwest china fig 2 c shows the relative changes of cdhes for the two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 with the regional results shown in fig 2 d there is an overall increase in the frequency of cdhes across most regions in china the national average frequency has almost doubled for the recent period 1991 2014 0 12 compared with that for 1967 1990 0 06 at the regional scale the frequency is shown to increase in all 7 regions for the two periods regions including northeast china north china northwest china and southwest china have a higher increase in frequency with relative changes of 109 199 93 and 97 respectively these results highlight the increase in hazards of cdhes during recent decades which is consistent with previous studies feng et al 2019 yu and zhai 2020 4 2 exposure to cdhes the cropland of china in 2000 shown in fig s1 is mainly distributed in the northeast plain north china plain and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river liu et al 2005b lu et al 2016 the exposure of cropland to chdes which is computed based on eq 3 for the two periods and associated changes are shown in fig 3 by comparing the exposure of the two periods we found an increase in the exposure of large regions for the recent periods as shown in fig 3 c since the same cropland fraction was selected for the two periods the difference in exposure was determined by the frequency of changes in cdhes fig 4 a shows the relative change of exposure to cdhes at regional scales which demonstrates increased exposure for all 7 regions the relative increase of exposure is high in northeast china north china east china and northwest china which are 110 200 113 and 137 respectively 4 3 vulnerability based on gdp and irrigated area fraction based on the two indicators of gdp and irrigated area fraction for the two periods of 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 the overall vulnerability across china for the two periods is then computed as shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of vulnerability in 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 is similar with high vulnerability in regions such as northeast china and eastern parts of northwest china partly related to the slow economic development or low gdp which can result in potentially poor ability to resist cdhes in these regions regions such as the north china plain and southeast coastal areas of china with developed economies and a high proportion of irrigated areas fig s2 and fig s3 have a high capacity to resist cdhes fig 5 c shows the relative change of vulnerability across the mainland of china with the regional changes shown in fig 4 b the relative decrease of vulnerability in northeast china north china and northwest china is 8 5 and 2 respectively which implies that these regions are less susceptible in recent periods 4 4 risk assessment of cdhes fig 6 a and b show the risk of cdhes in china from 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 respectively for the two periods northeast china north china east china and eastern regions of northwest china southwest china show higher risk the relative changes in risks for the two periods are shown in fig 6 c increased risks are shown in the vast majority of the study area the risk is reduced only in limited regions the national average risk increases by 111 from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 at the regional scale the relative changes in the risk of cdhes in 7 regions are shown in fig 4 c increased risk is shown across all 7 regions in china from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 with relatively high increase in risk in northeast china north china east china and northwest china by 92 183 108 and 158 respectively based on the cmip6 model simulations we further evaluate the risk of cdhes for both the historical period 1967 2014 and future period 2053 2100 the agricultural risk of cdhes in china only considering future hazards for the two periods and relative changes are shown in fig 7 the exposure is based on cropland fraction in 2000 and vulnerability irrigation and gdp is based on the average between 1990 and 2015 there is a remarkable increase in the risk of cdhes for the future period 2053 2100 compared with the historical period 1967 2014 as shown in fig 7 a b note that with constant indicators of exposure and vulnerability in both historical and future periods the increase in risk here is dominated by an increase in hazards large regions such as northeast china north china east china show higher risk in the future fig 7 c shows the future changes in risk relative to the historical period highlighting a larger increase in southeastern china on average the agricultural risk of cdhes in the future period would increase by a factor of around 1 3 this highlights the potentially increased agricultural risk of cdhes in the future which may pose challenges to agricultural water management and food security in china 5 discussions 5 1 past and future risk the risk of cdhes and associated changes for two historical periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 in china were investigated in this study though an overall increase in the hazard was shown across mainland of china the changes in risk differed substantially at the regional scale which is due to the spatial variability of exposure and vulnerability for example in western china a remarkable increase in the hazard is shown however due to the low cropland proportion the exposure of croplands to cdhes is relatively low the vulnerability should also be carefully assessed in understanding the risk of cdhes under a continuously warming climate cdhes likely become more frequent and severe in china in the future as shown in several projection studies chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 based on cmip6 projections the risk assessments in this study revealed high risks of cdhes across northeastern southwestern china in the future with higher increase in the southeastern regions fig 7 these results highlight the urgency to devise adaptation measures in these areas to reduce negative impacts of cdhes on agriculture in china 5 2 linkages to agricultural water management the risk assessment results in this study can be useful for disaster risk reduction or adaptation strategies based on structural measures e g irrigation infrastructure water supply systems and early warning systems or non structural measures use of fertilizer implementation of crop climate risk insurance changes in farming practices hagenlocher et al 2019 the high and increased risk revealed from this study may pose a challenge to the sustainable development of agriculture which calls for effective agricultural risk management of cdhes it is therefore important to strengthen the resilience e g improved irrigation measures to the increased risk with different adaptation measures depending on regions for example irrigation measures need to be strengthened and evaluated to cope with the impact or damage from concurrences of droughts and hot extremes hao et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2021 however in certain regions such as north china the existing water shortage may limit the suitability of such measures other adaptation strategies such as drought heat tolerant crops and varieties improved agricultural management and crop insurance can be resorted to depending on regions villani et al 2022 5 3 limitation and uncertainty due to the data availability only two vulnerability indicators gdp and irrigated area fraction were included to assess the risk of croplands to cdhes this may limit the accuracy of the vulnerability or risk assessments other physical social or economic indicators guo et al 2022 meza et al 2021 villani et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 can be incorporated to provide a more meaningful risk assessment of cdhes in further research in addition information about crops such as growing seasons and crop varieties e g maize wheat were not considered in the risk assessments the resistance of different crops to cdhes can be different ribeiro et al 2020 which necessitates future efforts to explore the difference of adaptation measures moreover statistical validation of the risk outcomes in this study with observed crop losses or damages was not conducted which limits the evaluation of the reliability and robustness of risk assessments hagenlocher et al 2019 last but not the least the contribution of different components of the hazards e g drought heat stress and interactions and risk e g hazard exposure vulnerability and interaction to risk changes which can be useful for implementing adaptation measures was not quantified for example increased drought impacts and decreased effects of temperature extremes on agricultural risk were found in india sharma et al 2020 which may induce complex patterns of combined impacts risks of droughts and hot extremes on agricultural productivity and associated mitigation measures understanding the relative importance of different influencing factors is needed in future studies for devising adaptation measures to minimize the risk of cdhes in china uncertainties exist in the data products and processing procedures previous studies have shown the uncertainty in the gridded datasets compared with agricultural weather station data allen 1996 blankenau et al 2020 at the local scale with agricultural weather station data the gridded product in this study should be further evaluated for the accurate estimation of the hazards in addition due to the limited availability of irrigation data and gdp we generated these data by resampling the province level records to the gridded level of irrigation data and regridding gdp data based on spatial aggregation which may induce uncertainties in the vulnerability indicator future assessment of agricultural drought risk of cdhes at the regional scale should carefully evaluate the uncertainty associated with the gridded data meteorological variables or exposure vulnerability indicators in addition the changed risk can be induced by changes in hazards exposure and vulnerability along with changed characteristics of hazards of cdhes changes or trends in exposure and vulnerability of the socioeconomics also exist hagenlocher et al 2019 the use of limited periods of exposure and vulnerability indicators may not capture the dynamic changes in them causing uncertainties in the risk assessments thus dynamic risk assessments of cdhes are needed in future studies 6 conclusion in this paper the risk assessments of compound drought and hot events cdhes in china were conducted by incorporating hazards frequency of cdhes based on precipitation and temperature exposure cropland area fraction and vulnerability gdp and irrigated area fraction for two historical periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 and the future period 2053 2100 results show that the hazard of cdhes has increased from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 with a double increase in recent period along with an increase in the cropland exposure to cdhes vulnerability is shown to decrease in several areas such as northeast north and northwest china the average risk index of china for the two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 shows an increase of 111 with relatively higher increase in northeast china north china east china and northwest china 92 183 108 and 158 respectively the risk of cdhes in the future period 2053 2100 under the ssp585 scenario is projected to increase by a factor of 1 3 compared with the historical period 1967 2014 across china this study provides risk assessments of cdhes for agricultural systems while the risk for other sectors such as water resources is also needed results from this study can be useful for identifying tailored measures to reduce

quantitative and qualitative risk assessments of droughts and hot extremes have been conducted in different regions including china blauhut 2020 he et al 2013 prabnakorn et al 2019 though different definitions or conceptualizations exist drought risk assessments are generally based on hazards exposure and vulnerability carrao et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 hazards of droughts are usually defined based on the frequency severity or return periods from a suite of drought indicators such as the standardized precipitation index spi or standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei guo et al 2022 liu and chen 2021 ribeiro et al 2019 while the exposure and vulnerability are mainly based on agricultural social and economic indicators hagenlocher et al 2019 prabnakorn et al 2019 for example dai et al 2020 assessed the dynamics of agricultural drought risk in the pearl river delta region of china by combining exposure vulnerability and resilience and found that agricultural drought risk has increased considerably in most regions over the last fifty years monteleone et al 2022 evaluated the risk of agricultural systems in northern italy by establishing a vulnerability curve between drought hazards and losses and highlighted the importance of appropriate irrigation strategies to cope with yield losses from droughts the risk of hot extremes can be assessed similarly by incorporating associated hazards e g heat related indicators and exposure vulnerability which generally concerns societal factors dubey et al 2021 he et al 2021 li et al 2021 and agriculture dong et al 2018 sharma et al 2020 teixeira et al 2013 wang et al 2021 for example teixeira et al 2013 evaluated the risk of agriculture including four key crops of wheat maize rice and soybean to heat stress at a global scale and found temperate and sub tropical agricultural regions were subject to significant crop yield losses due to extreme temperature these risk assessments of droughts and hot extremes can be useful for devising adaptation measures for extremes under global warming owing to multiple driving factors large scale circulation patterns and land atmospheric feedbacks droughts and hot extremes may co occur leading to the so called compound dry and hot events or extremes cdhes cheng et al 2019 hao and singh 2020 miralles et al 2018 zscheischler et al 2018 the cdhes may lead to compounding risks to multiple sectors or systems including agricultural production and food security ipcc 2022 as such it is important to evaluate the risk of cdhes to agriculture to mitigate their impacts recently the risk of cdhes to agriculture has been highlighted feng et al 2019 ribeiro et al 2019 2020 wu et al 2022 however previous studies mainly assessed the risk from the perspective of hazards or exposures for example the increased frequency and intensity of cdhes across china i e hazard related characteristics have been found in historical periods chen et al 2019 feng et al 2022 yu and zhai 2020 zhang et al 2022 which causes increased exposure of cropland or population to cdhes in china feng et al 2022 wu et al 2021 yu and zhai 2020 although great progress has already been made on hazards or exposure of cdhes in china agricultural risk assessments of cdhes incorporating the hazards exposure and vulnerability at the national scale are still lacking the objective of this study is to quantify the agricultural risk of cdhes for historical and future periods in the mainland of china by taking into account the hazards frequency of cdhe exposure cropland fraction and vulnerability we first explored the changes in the hazards of cdhes and associated cropland exposures for two equal periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 the vulnerability based on irrigation and gross domestic product gdp was then calculated from which the risk distribution maps of cdhes in china were then constructed to evaluate changes in historical periods finally based on the future hazards from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 simulations we explored changes in the risk of cdhes between historical periods 1967 2014 and future periods 2053 2100 2 data the meteorological data for the period from 1967 to 2014 were obtained from the cn05 1 dataset to calculate the frequency of cdhes in china this dataset was developed based on around 2400 meteorological stations and is available at a resolution of 0 25 0 25 wu and gao 2013 wu et al 2017 for the exposure of cropland we use the global cropland distribution dataset in the year 2000 from nasa s socioeconomic data and applications center sedac with a spatial resolution of 0 083 0 083 ramankutty et al 2008 the meteorological data and cropland data were bilinearly interpolated to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the gdp and irrigated area fraction for two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 were employed as vulnerability indicators represented by data in 1990 and 2015 the gdp data were obtained from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center liu et al 2005a and were regridded to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 based on the spatial aggregation the irrigation area data of the province for 1990 and 2015 were obtained from the china statistical yearbook the irrigation data were exported as raster data in the arcgis software and resampled to 0 5 0 5 to evaluate future agricultural risks of cdhes we obtained the monthly precipitation and temperature data from the cmip6 model simulations eyring et al 2016 under ssp585 scenarios we chose 10 cmip6 models with a relatively high resolution details of these models are provided in table s1 and all simulations were bilinearly gridded to the 0 5 0 5 resolution we employed data from historical simulations for the period from 1967 to 2014 and future projections from 2053 to 2100 48 years for both periods for future agricultural risks we only considered changes in hazards and used the same indicators of exposure and vulnerability for historical periods due to data limitation 3 method of risk estimation the risk of extremes depends not only on the physical intensity of exposure to natural hazards but also on the vulnerability of socioeconomics susceptibility of being adversely affected following previous studies in defining the risk of natural hazards ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 carrao et al 2016 the risk of cdhes in this study consists of three factors including hazards the frequency of cdhes exposure cropland fraction and vulnerability gdp and irrigated area fraction the computation of risk can be expressed as ipcc 2022 1 risk hazard exposure vulnerability the general framework of the risk assessment in this study is shown in fig 1 the computation of hazard exposure and vulnerability is introduced as follows 3 1 hazard estimation the hazard indicator of cdhes in this study is defined as the frequency or likelihood of occurrence for each grid during each period i e 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 following previous studies bevacqua et al 2021 ribeiro et al 2020 we choose a percentage based threshold to define cdhes specifically the dry event is defined as monthly precipitation below the 25th percentile while the hot event is detected as the monthly temperature exceeding the 75th percentile wu et al 2021 the frequency of compound events for the two historical periods of 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 and for the future period 2053 2100 are all calculated based on the thresholds of the period 1967 2014 the frequency of two periods is defined as the number of occurrences of cdhes n 1 and n 2 respectively divided by the total number of months during each period to compare the changes in hazards between the two periods the relative change h c for the two periods is calculated as follows 2 h c n 2 n 1 n 1 100 3 2 exposure to cdhes the proportion of cropland in 2000 is used as the exposure indicator we also compute the cropland exposed to cdhes following previous studies jones et al 2015 raymond et al 2022 sarhadi et al 2018 weber et al 2020 the exposure of cropland to cdhes can be calculated as the product of the frequency of cdhes and the proportion of cropland at each grid point the computation of the exposure to cdhes i e exposure to the hazard e h at each grid point is expressed as follows 3 e h pc f where e h represents the exposure of cropland to cdhes pc represents the proportion of cropland and f represents the frequency of cdhes based on eq 1 risks are also equal to the exposure of cropland to cdhes multiplied by the vulnerability indicator 3 3 vulnerability following previous studies in assessing the vulnerability to natural disasters ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 carrao et al 2016 cutter and finch 2008 the gdp and irrigated area fraction are selected as vulnerability indicators in this study gdp can reflect the development of an area and developed areas are expected to better mitigate the adverse effects of cdhes the larger irrigated area fraction indicates that it is less affected by cdhes therefore both gdp and irrigated area fraction are negatively correlated with vulnerability due to differences in the unit the two vulnerability indicators are normalized to characterize the vulnerability carrao et al 2016 the min max normalization method is employed to normalize all indicators to values between 0 and 1 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2018 naumann et al 2014 the normalization of the two negative indicators of vulnerability can be expressed as 4 x max x x max x min x where x represents the normalized result and x represents the raw data max x is the maximum value of the gdp or irrigated area fraction of the two periods 1990 and 2015 across all grids min x is the minimum value estimated in a similar way the vulnerability index is generally computed by assigning weights to the standardized values in previous literature the equal weight method and expert scoring method have been employed to determine the weights of each index kim et al 2021 meza et al 2021 prabnakorn et al 2019 villani et al 2022 in this study the two indicators are assigned the same weight and the vulnerability is calculated using the arithmetic average method as follows 5 v x 1 x 2 2 where v represents vulnerability x 1 and x 2 represent the normalized result of gdp and irrigated area fraction respectively 4 results 4 1 hazard of cdhes fig 2 a shows the frequency distribution of cdhes in china from 1967 to 1990 the frequency of cdhes during 1991 2014 is generally higher than that during 1967 1990 as shown in fig 2 b the higher frequency of cdhes for the recent period is shown in northeast china north china and eastern regions of northwest southwest china fig 2 c shows the relative changes of cdhes for the two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 with the regional results shown in fig 2 d there is an overall increase in the frequency of cdhes across most regions in china the national average frequency has almost doubled for the recent period 1991 2014 0 12 compared with that for 1967 1990 0 06 at the regional scale the frequency is shown to increase in all 7 regions for the two periods regions including northeast china north china northwest china and southwest china have a higher increase in frequency with relative changes of 109 199 93 and 97 respectively these results highlight the increase in hazards of cdhes during recent decades which is consistent with previous studies feng et al 2019 yu and zhai 2020 4 2 exposure to cdhes the cropland of china in 2000 shown in fig s1 is mainly distributed in the northeast plain north china plain and the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river liu et al 2005b lu et al 2016 the exposure of cropland to chdes which is computed based on eq 3 for the two periods and associated changes are shown in fig 3 by comparing the exposure of the two periods we found an increase in the exposure of large regions for the recent periods as shown in fig 3 c since the same cropland fraction was selected for the two periods the difference in exposure was determined by the frequency of changes in cdhes fig 4 a shows the relative change of exposure to cdhes at regional scales which demonstrates increased exposure for all 7 regions the relative increase of exposure is high in northeast china north china east china and northwest china which are 110 200 113 and 137 respectively 4 3 vulnerability based on gdp and irrigated area fraction based on the two indicators of gdp and irrigated area fraction for the two periods of 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 the overall vulnerability across china for the two periods is then computed as shown in fig 5 the spatial distribution of vulnerability in 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 is similar with high vulnerability in regions such as northeast china and eastern parts of northwest china partly related to the slow economic development or low gdp which can result in potentially poor ability to resist cdhes in these regions regions such as the north china plain and southeast coastal areas of china with developed economies and a high proportion of irrigated areas fig s2 and fig s3 have a high capacity to resist cdhes fig 5 c shows the relative change of vulnerability across the mainland of china with the regional changes shown in fig 4 b the relative decrease of vulnerability in northeast china north china and northwest china is 8 5 and 2 respectively which implies that these regions are less susceptible in recent periods 4 4 risk assessment of cdhes fig 6 a and b show the risk of cdhes in china from 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 respectively for the two periods northeast china north china east china and eastern regions of northwest china southwest china show higher risk the relative changes in risks for the two periods are shown in fig 6 c increased risks are shown in the vast majority of the study area the risk is reduced only in limited regions the national average risk increases by 111 from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 at the regional scale the relative changes in the risk of cdhes in 7 regions are shown in fig 4 c increased risk is shown across all 7 regions in china from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 with relatively high increase in risk in northeast china north china east china and northwest china by 92 183 108 and 158 respectively based on the cmip6 model simulations we further evaluate the risk of cdhes for both the historical period 1967 2014 and future period 2053 2100 the agricultural risk of cdhes in china only considering future hazards for the two periods and relative changes are shown in fig 7 the exposure is based on cropland fraction in 2000 and vulnerability irrigation and gdp is based on the average between 1990 and 2015 there is a remarkable increase in the risk of cdhes for the future period 2053 2100 compared with the historical period 1967 2014 as shown in fig 7 a b note that with constant indicators of exposure and vulnerability in both historical and future periods the increase in risk here is dominated by an increase in hazards large regions such as northeast china north china east china show higher risk in the future fig 7 c shows the future changes in risk relative to the historical period highlighting a larger increase in southeastern china on average the agricultural risk of cdhes in the future period would increase by a factor of around 1 3 this highlights the potentially increased agricultural risk of cdhes in the future which may pose challenges to agricultural water management and food security in china 5 discussions 5 1 past and future risk the risk of cdhes and associated changes for two historical periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 in china were investigated in this study though an overall increase in the hazard was shown across mainland of china the changes in risk differed substantially at the regional scale which is due to the spatial variability of exposure and vulnerability for example in western china a remarkable increase in the hazard is shown however due to the low cropland proportion the exposure of croplands to cdhes is relatively low the vulnerability should also be carefully assessed in understanding the risk of cdhes under a continuously warming climate cdhes likely become more frequent and severe in china in the future as shown in several projection studies chen et al 2019 wu et al 2021 based on cmip6 projections the risk assessments in this study revealed high risks of cdhes across northeastern southwestern china in the future with higher increase in the southeastern regions fig 7 these results highlight the urgency to devise adaptation measures in these areas to reduce negative impacts of cdhes on agriculture in china 5 2 linkages to agricultural water management the risk assessment results in this study can be useful for disaster risk reduction or adaptation strategies based on structural measures e g irrigation infrastructure water supply systems and early warning systems or non structural measures use of fertilizer implementation of crop climate risk insurance changes in farming practices hagenlocher et al 2019 the high and increased risk revealed from this study may pose a challenge to the sustainable development of agriculture which calls for effective agricultural risk management of cdhes it is therefore important to strengthen the resilience e g improved irrigation measures to the increased risk with different adaptation measures depending on regions for example irrigation measures need to be strengthened and evaluated to cope with the impact or damage from concurrences of droughts and hot extremes hao et al 2022 seneviratne et al 2021 however in certain regions such as north china the existing water shortage may limit the suitability of such measures other adaptation strategies such as drought heat tolerant crops and varieties improved agricultural management and crop insurance can be resorted to depending on regions villani et al 2022 5 3 limitation and uncertainty due to the data availability only two vulnerability indicators gdp and irrigated area fraction were included to assess the risk of croplands to cdhes this may limit the accuracy of the vulnerability or risk assessments other physical social or economic indicators guo et al 2022 meza et al 2021 villani et al 2022 zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 can be incorporated to provide a more meaningful risk assessment of cdhes in further research in addition information about crops such as growing seasons and crop varieties e g maize wheat were not considered in the risk assessments the resistance of different crops to cdhes can be different ribeiro et al 2020 which necessitates future efforts to explore the difference of adaptation measures moreover statistical validation of the risk outcomes in this study with observed crop losses or damages was not conducted which limits the evaluation of the reliability and robustness of risk assessments hagenlocher et al 2019 last but not the least the contribution of different components of the hazards e g drought heat stress and interactions and risk e g hazard exposure vulnerability and interaction to risk changes which can be useful for implementing adaptation measures was not quantified for example increased drought impacts and decreased effects of temperature extremes on agricultural risk were found in india sharma et al 2020 which may induce complex patterns of combined impacts risks of droughts and hot extremes on agricultural productivity and associated mitigation measures understanding the relative importance of different influencing factors is needed in future studies for devising adaptation measures to minimize the risk of cdhes in china uncertainties exist in the data products and processing procedures previous studies have shown the uncertainty in the gridded datasets compared with agricultural weather station data allen 1996 blankenau et al 2020 at the local scale with agricultural weather station data the gridded product in this study should be further evaluated for the accurate estimation of the hazards in addition due to the limited availability of irrigation data and gdp we generated these data by resampling the province level records to the gridded level of irrigation data and regridding gdp data based on spatial aggregation which may induce uncertainties in the vulnerability indicator future assessment of agricultural drought risk of cdhes at the regional scale should carefully evaluate the uncertainty associated with the gridded data meteorological variables or exposure vulnerability indicators in addition the changed risk can be induced by changes in hazards exposure and vulnerability along with changed characteristics of hazards of cdhes changes or trends in exposure and vulnerability of the socioeconomics also exist hagenlocher et al 2019 the use of limited periods of exposure and vulnerability indicators may not capture the dynamic changes in them causing uncertainties in the risk assessments thus dynamic risk assessments of cdhes are needed in future studies 6 conclusion in this paper the risk assessments of compound drought and hot events cdhes in china were conducted by incorporating hazards frequency of cdhes based on precipitation and temperature exposure cropland area fraction and vulnerability gdp and irrigated area fraction for two historical periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 and the future period 2053 2100 results show that the hazard of cdhes has increased from 1967 1990 to 1991 2014 with a double increase in recent period along with an increase in the cropland exposure to cdhes vulnerability is shown to decrease in several areas such as northeast north and northwest china the average risk index of china for the two periods 1967 1990 and 1991 2014 shows an increase of 111 with relatively higher increase in northeast china north china east china and northwest china 92 183 108 and 158 respectively the risk of cdhes in the future period 2053 2100 under the ssp585 scenario is projected to increase by a factor of 1 3 compared with the historical period 1967 2014 across china this study provides risk assessments of cdhes for agricultural systems while the risk for other sectors such as water resources is also needed results from this study can be useful for identifying tailored measures to reduce

9138,biochar has been proven to have great potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving crop growth however the effects of biochar addition on yield scaled n2o emissions in a mulched and drip irrigated maize field using different irrigation water qualities and quantities remain unclear a two year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of biochar addition irrigation level and water salinity on soil n2o emissions maize yield and grain n uptake in northwest china eight treatments in total included the combination of two biochar addition rates of 0 t ha b0 and 60 t ha b1 two irrigation levels of full w1 and deficit irrigation w2 w2 1 2 w1 and two water salinity levels of freshwater s0 0 71 g l and brackish water s1 4 g l the soil properties n2o emission fluxes maize yield and grain n uptake along with the abundances of n cycle functional marker genes were measured during the two growing seasons soil water filled pore space wfps soil nh4 n and no3 n contents accounted for the majority of the variation in the dynamic changes of n2o fluxes deficit irrigation had lower n2o emissions compared with full irrigation which was more pronounced in the second year relative to freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation increased n2o emissions under w1 but freshwater and brackish water irrigation had similar n2o emissions under w2 in both years biochar addition effectively mitigated n2o emissions by 29 4 31 0 and 17 9 29 2 under different irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively the continuous drought induced by deficit irrigation weakened the effectiveness of biochar in reducing n2o emissions the differences in n cycle functional marker genes could not reflect the variation in cumulative n2o emissions among treatments under all irrigation treatments excluding w2s1 biochar addition improved the total maize yield and grain n uptake over the two year period by 4 06 10 74 and 5 57 8 63 respectively brackish water and deficit irrigation increased grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions whereas biochar addition reduced both of them overall these findings suggest that biochar addition can effectively reduce n2o emissions and increase yield and grain n uptake under brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching in a maize field system and thus adding biochar can help with achieving the sustainability of agricultural production in areas with limited freshwater resources keywords water saving irrigation soil amendment greenhouse gas emission nitrogen recovery sustainable agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china has 21 of the world s population but only has 6 of the world s freshwater resources and 9 of its arable land meeting the food demand of the nation s large population with its relatively limited water and land resources has always been a challenge for the country to solve the problem the increasing intensification of irrigation and fertilization has caused serious ecological and environmental problems in recent decades ju et al 2009 kang et al 2017 for example the groundwater table and ecological water use are reduced due to the excessive exploitation of groundwater for agricultural water use meanwhile n2o emissions from agriculture accounting for 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions have been increased due to the extensive application of synthetic n fertilizer ipcc 2014 in light of these both saving agricultural water use and reducing n2o emissions are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching are widely used in agricultural production to make up for the shortage of freshwater resources and they have varied effects on crop growth and soil n2o emissions compared with conventional irrigation irrigation using brackish water instead of freshwater is considered to be an effective way of alleviating freshwater resource shortage without causing a significant decrease in crop yields in arid regions where rich brackish water resources are present in the shallow subsurface ahmed et al 2010 chauhan et al 2008 jiang et al 2013 however the long term brackish water irrigation may increase the accumulation of salts in the root zone thus resulting in a substantial reduction in crop yield and n uptake wan et al 2010 wang et al 2016a 2015 at the same time the changed soil moisture and salinity contents that occur with brackish water irrigation can alter the microbial community associated with soil n cycling and thus change n transformation processes in soils irshad et al 2005 ndour et al 2008 tam 1998 no consistent result was found with regard to the effects of brackish water irrigation on n2o emissions largely due to the different experimental conditions used in various studies for example some studies reported that irrigation with brackish water increased maucieri et al 2017 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 decreased zhang et al 2018 or did not affect n2o emissions inubushi et al 1999 kontopoulou et al 2015 compared with freshwater irrigation deficit irrigation at a proper level is an effective water saving technique that increases water use efficiency with minimal impact on crop yields kang et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 2017 however deficit irrigation at a severe level often decreases the crop yield due to the reduced leaf photosynthetic rate resulting from excessive water stress badr et al 2012 kang and zhang 2004 rop et al 2016 similarly severe deficit irrigation inhibited the crop nitrogen uptake badr et al 2012 kang et al 2011 lü et al 2014 wang et al 2021 in addition soil moisture is a critical factor that affects nitrification and denitrification progresses thus the irrigation amount changes the soil n2o emissions some studies have shown that low soil moisture content resulting from deficit irrigation reduced n2o emissions by reducing n cycle related microbial activities bateman and baggs 2005 braker and conrad 2011 furthermore n2o emissions from organic matter mineralization were reduced at a lower soil water content thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 several studies have investigated the effects of deficit irrigation with brackish water on crop yield and soil n2o emission jiang et al 2013 and yuan et al 2019 both found no significant difference in maize yields between freshwater and brackish water of different salinity levels under deficit irrigation maucieri et al 2017 found similar n2o emissions between the deionized water and brackish water 5 ds m 1 under a 50 field capacity fc in addition drip irrigation with film mulching can increase nitrogen uptake and crop yield gao et al 2019 qin et al 2015 xie et al 2005 but it may increase n2o emissions due to soil warming and poor air permeability yu et al 2021 as a carbon rich and stable material biochar is widely used as a soil amendment to increase crop yield and mitigate climate change guo et al 2019 lehmann 2007 subedi et al 2017 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 many studies have shown that biochar addition could increase crop yield dry matter accumulation and n uptake mainly due to the improved soil structure fertility moisture and temperature al wabel et al 2018 ding et al 2019 gaskin et al 2010 haider et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however some studies showed that biochar addition had no significant effect on crop yield and n uptake güereña et al 2013 liao et al 2020 or it even inhibited crop yield and dry matter accumulation brtnicky et al 2021 karer et al 2013 van zwieten et al 2010 crops are often subject to both water and salt stress in arid and salinized regions biochar addition could alleviate water and salt stress by increasing soil water holding salt adsorption and leaching capacity akhtar et al 2015 ali et al 2017 liu et al 2021 yue et al 2016 however the risk of aggravating water and salt stress also exists due to strong water holding capacity and high salt content from adding biochar brtnicky et al 2021 saifullah et al 2018 furthermore although biochar is widely recognized to have great potential for reducing n2o emissions from agricultural fields cayuela et al 2014 liu et al 2018 woolf et al 2010 but its reduction effects and mechanisms are different with various biochar types and soil environments for example adding biochar can mitigate n2o emissions by promoting the immobilization and adsorption of nh4 to reduce the nitrating substrate s availability for microbial organisms fuertes mendizábal et al 2019 liao et al 2021 increasing soil oxygen content to inhibit the denitrification rate niu et al 2017 and increasing the nitrous oxide reductase indicated by a higher nosz genes abundance that further reduced n2o to n2 harter et al 2016 xu et al 2014 on the contrary n2o emissions were enhanced due to the increased availability of nh4 or no3 shen et al 2014 dissolved organic carbon malghani et al 2018 for microbes from the added biochar or increased ammonia oxidizing bacteria via biochar addition lin et al 2017 in rice fields many previous studies focused on the effects of either brackish water irrigation or deficit irrigation or biochar addition on soil physicochemical properties crop growth and n2o emissions few studies have been conducted to investigate whether biochar addition could improve crop growth while reducing n2o emission under deficit irrigation with brackish water given that deficit irrigation with brackish water is widely used in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china it is particularly important to understand whether adding biochar can increase or maintain crop yield and n uptake while reducing n2o emissions under deficit drip irrigation with marginal water quality in mulched fields our aims were 1 to investigate the potential effects and associated mechanisms of biochar addition on n2o emission as well as any interactive effects between biochar addition and deficit irrigation with brackish water 2 to determine whether biochar addition can improve maize yield and grain n uptake by alleviating the water and salt stress resulting from deficit and brackish water irrigation in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this field experiment was conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on efficient water use of oasis agriculture in wuwei of gansu province of northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e 1581 m altitude in 2020 and 2021 the experimental site is located in an arid inland region where the mean annual temperature is 8 c and the number of frost free days is 150 d the water resources in the region are limited with the mean annual precipitation and pan evaporation being 164 mm and 2000 mm respectively the region has rich light and heat resources with a mean annual sunshine duration of more than 3000 h and an annual accumulated temperature 0 c of 3550 c the average groundwater table is below 30 m ding et al 2013 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in 24 test pits with each test pit of 2 0 m wide 3 3 m long and 3 0 m deep a 20 cm thick concrete layer at the sides separated the neighboring test pits and the bottoms were cemented to prevent hydrological exchanges between them each test pit had a perforated plastic drainpipe at the bottom and there were 20 cm

program spss inc chicago usa 3 results 3 1 soil properties soil properties responded differently to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition during the two maize growing seasons figs 2 6 soil temperature at 10 cm ranged from 13 70 24 84 and 14 82 25 92 in 2020 and 2021 respectively no significant difference was found in soil temperature among different treatments fig 2 in general soil ec1 5 remained stable and had no significant difference among different irrigation amounts and biochar treatments under freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation significantly increased soil ec1 5 with the interaction of irrigation amount and biochar addition affecting the rate of increase under full irrigation with brackish water biochar addition decreased soil ec1 5 relative to b0 on most occasions in the late growing period of 2020 and throughout 2021 on the contrary soil ec1 5 in b1 treatment was higher than that in b0 treatment in both years for deficit irrigation with brackish water overall fig 3 soil wfps fluctuated greatly with irrigation events and was affected by irrigation amount water salinity and biochar treatments fig 4 compared with full irrigation deficit irrigation significantly reduced soil wfps by 9 0 and 13 7 on average for 2020 and 2021 respectively higher water salinity led to a greater soil wfps the average soil wfps under s1 over the growing season were 58 1 and 55 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively they were higher than those under s0 of 56 5 and 50 7 in 2020 and 2021 respectively biochar addition significantly reduced soil wfps due to the much increased tp for all irrigation treatments soil wfps in b1 ranged from 30 5 to 68 2 and 22 5 to 67 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively they were lower than those of b0 ranged from 35 9 to 84 9 and 33 5 to 87 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively soil nh4 n contents at 0 20 cm depth sharply reached peaks after basal and supplemental n fertilizer were applied then quickly decreased to steady low values fig 5 relative to full irrigation deficit irrigation increased the peaks of soil nh4 n contents after supplemental n fertilizer application in both years but it decreased the peaks of soil nh4 n content after the application of basal n fertilizer in 2021 relative to freshwater brackish water irrigation had no obvious effect on soil nh4 n contents the application of biochar mainly reduced relatively high soil nh4 n contents after fertilization events the variations in soil no3 n contents of 0 20 cm were found to be variable for different years irrigation amounts water salinity levels and biochar addition rates fig 6 overall soil no3 n contents were higher in 2020 than in 2021 compared with full irrigation deficit irrigation had higher soil no3 n contents under w1 soil no3 n contents were higher in s1 than that in s0 but no significant difference was found between s0 and s1 under w2 in both 2020 and 2021 overall biochar addition decreased soil no3 n contents before about 71 days and 59 days after sowing in 2020 and 2021 respectively while increasing them afterwards 3 2 abundances of n cycle functional marker genes the treatment effects of irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition on the abundances of n cycle functional marker genes amoa nirk nirs and nosz varied between 2020 and 2021 fig 7 in 2020 no significant differences were found among treatments for the abundances of amoa and nosz although biochar addition only increased the abundance of nirk nirs marginally at each irrigation treatment it did increase the abundance of nirk nirs significantly when all irrigation treatments accounted for a whole p 0 05 in 2021 irrigation amount and water salinity had no significant effect on the abundance of amoa but biochar addition significantly increased its abundance overall p 0 01 a significant interaction was found between irrigation amount and water salinity for the abundance of nirk nirs in 2021 brackish water irrigation increased its abundance of nirk nirs under w1 but decreased it under w2 relative to freshwater irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation also increased the abundance of nosz at both irrigation levels in general biochar addition increased the abundance of nosz in 2021 p 0 01 3 3 nitrous oxide emissions and their responses to soil variables for all treatments soil n2o emission fluxes showed similar temporal characteristics for example they rapidly peaked after the application of basal and supplemental n fertilizer then they decreased to a steady low level until the next fertilization event soil n2o fluxes between different treatments differed mainly in peaks and relatively larger fluxes fig 8 overall deficit irrigation reduced the peaks of n2o fluxes only after supplementary fertilization in 2020 while decreased them on most occasions during the 2021 growing season related to full irrigation brackish water irrigation had higher n2o fluxes than freshwater irrigation under w1 but the difference in n2o fluxes between them was not significant under w2 in both years biochar addition could effectively reduce soil n2o fluxes under different irrigation treatments in both years in general the soil n2o fluxes ranged from 0 016 to 0 845 mg n m 2 h 1and 0 009 to 0 478 mg n m 2 h 1 for b0 and b1 in 2020 and 0 003 to 0 721 mg n m 2 h 1and 0 005 to 0 473 mg n m 2 h 1 for b0 and b1 in 2021 respectively the irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition significantly affected cumulative n2o emissions during the entire growing season and the two way interactive effect of irrigation amount and water salinity was found in both years whereas the interactive effect of irrigation amount and biochar addition was found to be significant only in 2021 fig 9 the effect of deficit irrigation in reducing cumulative n2o emissions was more pronounced in 2021 than that in 2020 on average deficit irrigation reduced cumulative n2o emissions by 13 0 in 2020 and 24 5 in 2021 under full irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions by 20 3 and 21 7 on average in 2020 and 2021 respectively however no difference was found in cumulative n2o emissions between brackish water and freshwater under deficit irrigation in both years biochar addition significantly decreased cumulative n2o emissions by 29 4 31 0 and 17 9 29 2 under different irrigation treatments for 2020 and 2021 respectively water salinity did not affect the effectiveness of biochar in reducing n2o emissions but continuous deficit irrigation weakened it soil n2o fluxes were found to be closely related to soil environmental variables as indicated by a large r2 from the stepwise linear regression equation among them soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps were found to be significant in the regression model and they jointly accounted for 56 84 of the total n2o fluxes variation for b0 b1 or total b0 and b1 in both years p 0 001 the order of the importance of the three soil variables in explaining n2o fluxes variation was nh4 n no3 n wfps table 1 compared with b0 the reduction in soil n2o fluxes had a positive correlation with the reduction in soil wfps p 0 001 and nh4 n p 0 001 by adding biochar for the high flux points after fertilization fig 10 3 4 grain yield n uptake and yield scaled n2o emissions the effects of treatments on yield grain n uptake and grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions varied between the two years table 2 in 2020 irrigation amount was the only factor affecting grain yield significantly with the yield being higher under w1 than under w2 meanwhile in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition and the three way interaction were all found to be significant in affecting grain yield both deficit and brackish water irrigation led to significant yield reduction in 2021 biochar addition reduced yield for the treatment of deficit irrigation with brackish water and it significantly increased yield for the other treatments in 2021 in more detail biochar addition increased grain yield by 5 2 6 9 and 25 0 for w1s0 w1s1 and w2s0 respectively and it reduced the yield by 16 1 under w2s1 in 2020 irrigation amount and biochar addition and the two way interaction between them had significant effects on grain n uptake the grain n uptake was lower under w2 than under w1 biochar addition significantly promoted grain n uptake under w1 but had no significant effect on it under w2 in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition and the three way interaction were all found to be significant in affecting grain n uptake deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation both inhibited grain n uptake except for w2s1 treatment biochar significantly promoted grain n uptake under other water and salinity treatments grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions showed the similar pattern for the different treatments in both years in 2020 water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition were all found to be significant in grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions compared with full irrigation with freshwater deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased both grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions whereas biochar addition significantly reduced them under all water and salinity treatments in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between irrigation amount and water salinity and the three way interaction were found to affect grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions significantly overall compared with full irrigation with freshwater deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions meanwhile biochar effectively reduce them under w1s0 w1s1 and w2s0 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield and nitrogen uptake response to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition our results indicated that the grain yield and n uptake of maize both were reduced under deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation compared with full irrigation with freshwater which was consistent with widely accepted findings in past studies el akhal et al 2013 lü et al 2014 pessarakli and tucker 1988 wang et al 2016a the inhibited crop photosynthetic rate due to water and or salt stress was the most important reason for limiting crop yield and n uptake under deficit irrigation with either freshwater or brackish water biochar addition increased grain nitrogen uptake and yield under full irrigation regardless of water salinity levels w1s0 and w1s1 in both years and also under deficit irrigation with freshwater in 2021 table 2 the result was consistent with the results of some previous studies indicating that biochar could effectively promote nitrogen uptake and yield of various crops liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the improved soil fertility due to biochar addition was the most important factor contributing to the higher maize n uptake and yield liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 similarly the increased no3 n content after the jointing stage was found under biochar addition treatments which was an important factor leading to higher n uptake and yield of maize for the treatments in this study fig 6 with a large amount of organo mineral coatings hydrated nitrate ions and cationic bridging biochar addition enhanced soil s no3 n retention capacity borchard et al 2019 kammann et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2011 sanford et al 2019 therefore biochar addition reduced no3 n leaching under relatively large irrigation amount after jointing stage moreover biochar addition could promote microbial activity by increasing soil organic matter content thus promoting the mineralization of organic matter and the nutrition supply al wabel et al 2018 ameloot et al 2013 in addition biochar addition increased swc under w1s1 and w2s0 data not shown this might have the beneficial effect of alleviating water and salt stresses on crops thus leading to a higher yield and n uptake akhtar et al 2014 2015 ali et al 2017 it is worth noting that biochar addition reduced the grain yield and n uptake under deficit irrigation with brackish water in 2021 table 2 the increased soil ec under w2s1b1 compared with w2s1b0 could be the reason for the reduction fig 3b d although soil ec in w2s1b1 was also higher than that in w2s1b0 in 2020 soil ec in both treatments was relatively low before maturity stage which did not have much effect on maize grain yield and n uptake with continuous brackish water irrigation soil ec became increasingly higher exerting greater stress on maize from the seedling stage in 2021 this eventually led to a reduction in yield and n uptake given that biochar addition increased soil water storage capacity fu et al 2019 mollinedo et al 2015 we reasoned that the larger portion of salts contained in brackish water was kept in the soil layer with the added biochar leading to greater salinity stress for biochar treatment under w2s1 the accumulation of salts from biochar addition could be effectively alleviated with a larger amount of irrigation water such as w1s1 treatment 4 2 n2o emissions response to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition the seasonal dynamic n2o fluxes peaked rapidly after basal and supplemental n fertilizer application in combination with irrigation events and then decreased to low values for all treatments in both years which was consistent with the previous studies kim et al 2017 liao et al 2021 scheer et al 2008 for all treatments n2o fluxes ranged from 0 009 to 0 845 mg n m 2 h 1 and 0 003 to 0 721 mg n m 2 h 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively which was similar to previous findings from maize fields in the arid regions of northern china li et al 2020b liao et al 2021 wei et al 2019 we also found that soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps jointly controlled seasonal dynamic n2o fluxes table 1 which was consistent with previous studies indicating that soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps all had strong correlation with n2o fluxes liao et al 2021 wei et al 2019 deficit irrigation led to lower cumulative soil n2o emissions compared with full irrigation in both years fig 9 soil moisture is widely recognized as a critical factor in controlling soil n2o emissions and soil n2o emissions generally increase with increasing soil wfps lin and hernandez ramirez 2020 roman perez and hernandez ramirez 2021 wang and cai 2008 apparently the lower wfps under w2 versus w1 immediately after an irrigation event in particular was the main factor leading to the lower cumulative n2o emission in both years under w2 in this study soil wfps were 54 6 and 60 0 on average for w2 and w1 in 2020 and they were 49 0 and 56 8 on average for w2 and w1 in 2021 respectively obviously the reduction percentage in soil wfps for w2 compared with w1 was more pronounced in 2021 because the deficit irrigation was exerted during the entire growing season in 2021 whereas in 2020 it was not exerted until jointing stage fig 4 as a result the difference in cumulative n2o emissions between w1 and w2 treatments was greater in 2021 than in 2020 anova showed that irrigation amount and water salinity had a significant interactive effect on n2o emissions and the difference in n2o emissions between brackish water and freshwater was found to be different depending on different irrigation levels fig 9 under w1 brackish water irrigation significantly increased n2o emissions which could be attributed to the mildly increased soil salt and the higher soil wfps relative to freshwater irrigation some studies have shown that soil salinity thresholds may exist based on salinity s effect on nitrification or denitrification for example in previous studies salinity beyond the thresholds inhibited nitrification or denitrification whereas salinity lower than the thresholds increased them inubushi et al 1999 zeng et al 2013 the salinity threshold for nitrification was ec1 5 1000 μs cm 1 in yellow soil and andosol regardless of salt type and swc inubushi et al 1999 zeng et al 2013 also reported that the salinity threshold for both nitrification and denitrification was ec1 5 1130 μs cm 1 in a silty clay loam soil in this study the soil ec in w1s1 treatment ranging from 280 to 737 μs cm 1 in 2020 and 287 to 692 μs cm 1 in 2021 fig 3 which was lower than the salinity thresholds reported in the previous studies therefore a higher ec of w1s1 might lead to greater nitrification and denitrification rates and that in turn resulted in larger n2o emission compared with w1s0 on the other hand the possible inhibition of further reduction of n2o due to a higher salt content might also contribute to the higher n2o emissions under w1s1 menyailo et al 1997 moreover the enhanced soil wfps that occurs with brackish water irrigation could also contribute to the increased n2o emissions maucieri et al 2017 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 as we stated earlier that a greater soil wfps led to larger n2o emissions interestingly no significant difference in cumulative n2o emissions was found between w2s0 and w2s1 treatments in both years this result indicated that soil salinity had little effect on n2o emissions when the swc was somewhat lower which was consistent with the results from previous studies zhang et al 2018 found that n2o emissions were similar between different soil salinity levels 0 5 g kg 1 when swc was relatively low at 40 fc in a maize field saline water and freshwater irrigation had similar n2o emissions under deficit irrigation treatments with 70 full irrigation wei et al 2021 in this study biochar addition significantly reduced cumulative n2o emissions for all irrigation treatments fig 9 the reduction could be attributed to the decrease in both soil wfps and nh4 n through adding biochar especially during the periods with relatively larger n2o fluxes we found that the reduced wfps was strongly and positively correlated with the reduced n2o emissions that occurred with biochar addition fig 10 therefore the reduction in n2o emissions could be partially attributed to the decrease in denitrification rates with the increased soil aeration by adding biochar the finding was consistent with previous studies reporting that biochar addition could reduce n2o emissions due to the reduced soil bulk density bd and increased soil aeration niu et al 2017 yanai et al 2007 in this study biochar addition significantly reduced soil wfps mostly due to the greatly enhanced tp similarly hagemann et al 2016 reported that beech wood biochar applied at 60 t ha 1 significantly reduced wfps because of the increased tp which in turn led to the reduced n2o emissions in addition to the reduced soil wfps the reduced nh4 n also accounted for the reduced n2o emissions resulting from biochar addition fig 10 biochar has strong adsorption capacity due to its huge specific surface area and abundant pores which could lead to the adsorption and immobilization of large amount of nh4 thus reduced the availability of nitrogen sources for microbial activities clough et al 2013 singh et al 2010 taghizadeh toosi et al 2012 cai et al 2016 reported biochar could also adsorb nh4 through its hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction of the carboxyl and ketone groups in addition the interactive effect of irrigation amount and biochar addition on cumulative n2o emissions was insignificant in 2020 but significant in 2021 the discrepancy could be attributed to the soil water status of b1 and b0 for the period with greater n2o emission fluxes were different between the two years as we mentioned earlier biochar addition affected n2o emissions mainly through changing soil wfps in both years the period with relatively greater n2o emissions was mainly during the seedling stage when irrigation treatment had not started as a result the change in average wfps between b1 and b0 was similar under w1 and w2 in 2020 i e about 74 of b0 to 57 of b1 under both w1 and w2 which led to insignificant interaction of biochar and irrigation level in 2020 on the contrary soil wfps under w1 was quite different from that under w2 in 2021 due to the deficit irrigation in the earlier year soil wfps of b0 and b1 under w2 were substantially lower than that under w1 specifically the average soil wfps were 69 and 61 for b0 and 54 and 46 for b1 under w1 and w2 respectively previous studies have revealed that the relationship between soil wfps and n2o emissions is non linear i e soil n2o emissions changed little when soil wfps was lower than 60 but it increased sharply when soil wfps was higher than 60 bateman and baggs 2005 consequently the extent to which n2o emissions were reduced via biochar addition depended not only on the change of wfps but also on the soil wfps level of b1 and b0 soil wfps changed from 69 to 54 by biochar addition under w1 leading to a significant reduction in n2o emissions whereas soil wpfs at both b0 and b1 were roughly lower than 60 under w2 resulting in little difference in n2o emissions between b0 and b1 the results indicated that biochar s effect on reducing n2o emissions depended largely upon soil moisture level especially during the period with larger n2o fluxes for soils under constant drought soil wfps 60 adding biochar would have a relatively small effect on their n2o emissions soil n2o emissions mainly derive from the simultaneous microbial nitrification and denitrification that occurs during the soil n cycle process in agricultural soils braker and conrad 2011 some studies indicated that the abundances of nitrifier and denitrifier could predict soil n2o emissions mostly in the controlled conditions of incubation studies hink et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 however it became difficult to establish a correspondence between nitrifier or denitrifier with soil n2o emissions in field experiments since abiotic factors could be better predictors of n2o emissions hagemann et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in our study the differences in the abundances of amoa nirk nirs and nosz could not explain much of the differences in cumulative n2o emissions between treatments fig 7 first of all whether there exists a strong correlation between the abundances levels of amoa nirk nirs and nosz and n2o emissions has not been clearly established in the complex field environment in addition the time of soil sampling for the abundance of bacteria did not match the time of n2o flux measurements in this study given that microbial communities vary greatly with changing soil environments in different growing stages xu et al 2017 the abundance of bacteria at the end of the growing season did not reflect the abundance at the time of n2o flux measurements resulting in no or a weak correlation between the abundance levels of amoa nirk nirs and nosz and n2o emissions 4 3 yield scaled n2o emissions in the study the grain yield scaled n2o emissions ranged from 0 22 to 0 40 g n kg 1 grain and 0 22 to 0 46 g n kg 1 grain in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 which was similar to the past study conducted in a mulched maize field kim et al 2017 however studies reported much higher and lower values of grain yield scaled n2o emissions than those in this study the obvious differences in grain yield scaled n2o emissions in different experiments are mainly due to the different agronomic practices and experimental conditions for example wang et al 2016b reported that the grain yield scaled n2o emissions were only 0 031 0 038 g n kg 1 grain in a maize field under irrigation and mulching conditions of semiarid loess plateau china which was about 10 times smaller than that in our study the improved soil aeration condition from half film mulching practice might result in lower n2o emissions in their study on the contrary gagnon et al 2011 reported that the average range of grain yield scaled n2o emissions in a three year experiment was from 1 31 to 1 99 g n kg 1 grain in a rain fed maize field in eastern canada which was much higher than our results as the fertilization rates were similar in the two studies the higher n2o emissions in their study might have resulted from the mineralization of perennial grass residues in the first year since the test site was an old grass meadow compared with w1s0 treatment deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain yield scaled n2o emissions due to increased n2o emissions or decreased yield or both therefore global warming could be accelerated as a result of efforts to ensure food security by adopting deficit or brackish water irrigation in arid regions fortunately adding biochar could effectively reduce grain yield scaled n2o emissions by increasing yield or reducing n2o emissions niu et al 2017 li et al 2020a liao et al 2020 in this study the addition of biochar significantly reduced grain yield scaled n2o emissions under different irrigation treatments except for w2s1 treatment in 2021 and the reduction of n2o played a more important role in it than the increased yield the grain n yield scaled n2o emissions ranged from 15 43 to 29 63 g n kg 1 n in 2020 and 14 09 to 26 34 g n kg 1 n in this study table 2 about three times that of the maize cropping system that venterea et al 2011 reported on this discrepancy was mainly due to the lower nitrogen application rate used in their study which induced less n2o emissions compared with w1s0 treatment deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain n yield scaled n2o emissions due to increased n2o emissions or decreased n uptake or both this result highlighted the problem of higher n2o emissions under the same n recovery in arid regions using deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation similarly biochar addition significantly reduced grain n yield scaled n2o emissions due to enhanced n uptake or decreased n2o emissions or both 5 conclusions in the study we explored the responses of maize yield n uptake and soil n2o emissions to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition under a drip irrigated maize field with mulching in an arid region biochar addition could increase maize yield and n uptake to varying degrees under different water and salinity treatments except for w2s1 deficit irrigation reduced soil cumulative n2o emissions relative to full irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation increased soil cumulative n2o emissions under w1 but it had no effect under w2 suggesting that limiting the irrigation amount of brackish water could reduce n2o emissions biochar addition showed great potential for reducing field n2o emissions for different irrigation treatments adding a proper amount of biochar is recommended in arid areas to balance economic yield n recovery and n2o emissions by reducing grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions these findings are of great importance for fostering an understanding of how maize growth and n2o emissions would respond to biochar addition under limited irrigation with marginal quality of water in arid areas however these results were based on a two year study whether the conclusions could hold in the long run and whether the practice of irrigation with brackish water and biochar addition is sustainable remain unclear a long term observation on how maize growth n2o emission and n cycle related bacteria in the special growth stage of maize would respond to biochar addition under various water and salinity conditions is needed in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9138,biochar has been proven to have great potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and improving crop growth however the effects of biochar addition on yield scaled n2o emissions in a mulched and drip irrigated maize field using different irrigation water qualities and quantities remain unclear a two year field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of biochar addition irrigation level and water salinity on soil n2o emissions maize yield and grain n uptake in northwest china eight treatments in total included the combination of two biochar addition rates of 0 t ha b0 and 60 t ha b1 two irrigation levels of full w1 and deficit irrigation w2 w2 1 2 w1 and two water salinity levels of freshwater s0 0 71 g l and brackish water s1 4 g l the soil properties n2o emission fluxes maize yield and grain n uptake along with the abundances of n cycle functional marker genes were measured during the two growing seasons soil water filled pore space wfps soil nh4 n and no3 n contents accounted for the majority of the variation in the dynamic changes of n2o fluxes deficit irrigation had lower n2o emissions compared with full irrigation which was more pronounced in the second year relative to freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation increased n2o emissions under w1 but freshwater and brackish water irrigation had similar n2o emissions under w2 in both years biochar addition effectively mitigated n2o emissions by 29 4 31 0 and 17 9 29 2 under different irrigation treatments in 2020 and 2021 respectively the continuous drought induced by deficit irrigation weakened the effectiveness of biochar in reducing n2o emissions the differences in n cycle functional marker genes could not reflect the variation in cumulative n2o emissions among treatments under all irrigation treatments excluding w2s1 biochar addition improved the total maize yield and grain n uptake over the two year period by 4 06 10 74 and 5 57 8 63 respectively brackish water and deficit irrigation increased grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions whereas biochar addition reduced both of them overall these findings suggest that biochar addition can effectively reduce n2o emissions and increase yield and grain n uptake under brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching in a maize field system and thus adding biochar can help with achieving the sustainability of agricultural production in areas with limited freshwater resources keywords water saving irrigation soil amendment greenhouse gas emission nitrogen recovery sustainable agriculture data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction china has 21 of the world s population but only has 6 of the world s freshwater resources and 9 of its arable land meeting the food demand of the nation s large population with its relatively limited water and land resources has always been a challenge for the country to solve the problem the increasing intensification of irrigation and fertilization has caused serious ecological and environmental problems in recent decades ju et al 2009 kang et al 2017 for example the groundwater table and ecological water use are reduced due to the excessive exploitation of groundwater for agricultural water use meanwhile n2o emissions from agriculture accounting for 8 of total greenhouse gas emissions have been increased due to the extensive application of synthetic n fertilizer ipcc 2014 in light of these both saving agricultural water use and reducing n2o emissions are critical for the sustainable development of agriculture brackish water and deficit drip irrigation with mulching are widely used in agricultural production to make up for the shortage of freshwater resources and they have varied effects on crop growth and soil n2o emissions compared with conventional irrigation irrigation using brackish water instead of freshwater is considered to be an effective way of alleviating freshwater resource shortage without causing a significant decrease in crop yields in arid regions where rich brackish water resources are present in the shallow subsurface ahmed et al 2010 chauhan et al 2008 jiang et al 2013 however the long term brackish water irrigation may increase the accumulation of salts in the root zone thus resulting in a substantial reduction in crop yield and n uptake wan et al 2010 wang et al 2016a 2015 at the same time the changed soil moisture and salinity contents that occur with brackish water irrigation can alter the microbial community associated with soil n cycling and thus change n transformation processes in soils irshad et al 2005 ndour et al 2008 tam 1998 no consistent result was found with regard to the effects of brackish water irrigation on n2o emissions largely due to the different experimental conditions used in various studies for example some studies reported that irrigation with brackish water increased maucieri et al 2017 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 decreased zhang et al 2018 or did not affect n2o emissions inubushi et al 1999 kontopoulou et al 2015 compared with freshwater irrigation deficit irrigation at a proper level is an effective water saving technique that increases water use efficiency with minimal impact on crop yields kang et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 2017 however deficit irrigation at a severe level often decreases the crop yield due to the reduced leaf photosynthetic rate resulting from excessive water stress badr et al 2012 kang and zhang 2004 rop et al 2016 similarly severe deficit irrigation inhibited the crop nitrogen uptake badr et al 2012 kang et al 2011 lü et al 2014 wang et al 2021 in addition soil moisture is a critical factor that affects nitrification and denitrification progresses thus the irrigation amount changes the soil n2o emissions some studies have shown that low soil moisture content resulting from deficit irrigation reduced n2o emissions by reducing n cycle related microbial activities bateman and baggs 2005 braker and conrad 2011 furthermore n2o emissions from organic matter mineralization were reduced at a lower soil water content thilakarathna and hernandez ramirez 2021 several studies have investigated the effects of deficit irrigation with brackish water on crop yield and soil n2o emission jiang et al 2013 and yuan et al 2019 both found no significant difference in maize yields between freshwater and brackish water of different salinity levels under deficit irrigation maucieri et al 2017 found similar n2o emissions between the deionized water and brackish water 5 ds m 1 under a 50 field capacity fc in addition drip irrigation with film mulching can increase nitrogen uptake and crop yield gao et al 2019 qin et al 2015 xie et al 2005 but it may increase n2o emissions due to soil warming and poor air permeability yu et al 2021 as a carbon rich and stable material biochar is widely used as a soil amendment to increase crop yield and mitigate climate change guo et al 2019 lehmann 2007 subedi et al 2017 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 many studies have shown that biochar addition could increase crop yield dry matter accumulation and n uptake mainly due to the improved soil structure fertility moisture and temperature al wabel et al 2018 ding et al 2019 gaskin et al 2010 haider et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however some studies showed that biochar addition had no significant effect on crop yield and n uptake güereña et al 2013 liao et al 2020 or it even inhibited crop yield and dry matter accumulation brtnicky et al 2021 karer et al 2013 van zwieten et al 2010 crops are often subject to both water and salt stress in arid and salinized regions biochar addition could alleviate water and salt stress by increasing soil water holding salt adsorption and leaching capacity akhtar et al 2015 ali et al 2017 liu et al 2021 yue et al 2016 however the risk of aggravating water and salt stress also exists due to strong water holding capacity and high salt content from adding biochar brtnicky et al 2021 saifullah et al 2018 furthermore although biochar is widely recognized to have great potential for reducing n2o emissions from agricultural fields cayuela et al 2014 liu et al 2018 woolf et al 2010 but its reduction effects and mechanisms are different with various biochar types and soil environments for example adding biochar can mitigate n2o emissions by promoting the immobilization and adsorption of nh4 to reduce the nitrating substrate s availability for microbial organisms fuertes mendizábal et al 2019 liao et al 2021 increasing soil oxygen content to inhibit the denitrification rate niu et al 2017 and increasing the nitrous oxide reductase indicated by a higher nosz genes abundance that further reduced n2o to n2 harter et al 2016 xu et al 2014 on the contrary n2o emissions were enhanced due to the increased availability of nh4 or no3 shen et al 2014 dissolved organic carbon malghani et al 2018 for microbes from the added biochar or increased ammonia oxidizing bacteria via biochar addition lin et al 2017 in rice fields many previous studies focused on the effects of either brackish water irrigation or deficit irrigation or biochar addition on soil physicochemical properties crop growth and n2o emissions few studies have been conducted to investigate whether biochar addition could improve crop growth while reducing n2o emission under deficit irrigation with brackish water given that deficit irrigation with brackish water is widely used in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china it is particularly important to understand whether adding biochar can increase or maintain crop yield and n uptake while reducing n2o emissions under deficit drip irrigation with marginal water quality in mulched fields our aims were 1 to investigate the potential effects and associated mechanisms of biochar addition on n2o emission as well as any interactive effects between biochar addition and deficit irrigation with brackish water 2 to determine whether biochar addition can improve maize yield and grain n uptake by alleviating the water and salt stress resulting from deficit and brackish water irrigation in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this field experiment was conducted at the national field scientific observation and research station on

soil temperature at 10 cm ranged from 13 70 24 84 and 14 82 25 92 in 2020 and 2021 respectively no significant difference was found in soil temperature among different treatments fig 2 in general soil ec1 5 remained stable and had no significant difference among different irrigation amounts and biochar treatments under freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation significantly increased soil ec1 5 with the interaction of irrigation amount and biochar addition affecting the rate of increase under full irrigation with brackish water biochar addition decreased soil ec1 5 relative to b0 on most occasions in the late growing period of 2020 and throughout 2021 on the contrary soil ec1 5 in b1 treatment was higher than that in b0 treatment in both years for deficit irrigation with brackish water overall fig 3 soil wfps fluctuated greatly with irrigation events and was affected by irrigation amount water salinity and biochar treatments fig 4 compared with full irrigation deficit irrigation significantly reduced soil wfps by 9 0 and 13 7 on average for 2020 and 2021 respectively higher water salinity led to a greater soil wfps the average soil wfps under s1 over the growing season were 58 1 and 55 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively they were higher than those under s0 of 56 5 and 50 7 in 2020 and 2021 respectively biochar addition significantly reduced soil wfps due to the much increased tp for all irrigation treatments soil wfps in b1 ranged from 30 5 to 68 2 and 22 5 to 67 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively they were lower than those of b0 ranged from 35 9 to 84 9 and 33 5 to 87 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively soil nh4 n contents at 0 20 cm depth sharply reached peaks after basal and supplemental n fertilizer were applied then quickly decreased to steady low values fig 5 relative to full irrigation deficit irrigation increased the peaks of soil nh4 n contents after supplemental n fertilizer application in both years but it decreased the peaks of soil nh4 n content after the application of basal n fertilizer in 2021 relative to freshwater brackish water irrigation had no obvious effect on soil nh4 n contents the application of biochar mainly reduced relatively high soil nh4 n contents after fertilization events the variations in soil no3 n contents of 0 20 cm were found to be variable for different years irrigation amounts water salinity levels and biochar addition rates fig 6 overall soil no3 n contents were higher in 2020 than in 2021 compared with full irrigation deficit irrigation had higher soil no3 n contents under w1 soil no3 n contents were higher in s1 than that in s0 but no significant difference was found between s0 and s1 under w2 in both 2020 and 2021 overall biochar addition decreased soil no3 n contents before about 71 days and 59 days after sowing in 2020 and 2021 respectively while increasing them afterwards 3 2 abundances of n cycle functional marker genes the treatment effects of irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition on the abundances of n cycle functional marker genes amoa nirk nirs and nosz varied between 2020 and 2021 fig 7 in 2020 no significant differences were found among treatments for the abundances of amoa and nosz although biochar addition only increased the abundance of nirk nirs marginally at each irrigation treatment it did increase the abundance of nirk nirs significantly when all irrigation treatments accounted for a whole p 0 05 in 2021 irrigation amount and water salinity had no significant effect on the abundance of amoa but biochar addition significantly increased its abundance overall p 0 01 a significant interaction was found between irrigation amount and water salinity for the abundance of nirk nirs in 2021 brackish water irrigation increased its abundance of nirk nirs under w1 but decreased it under w2 relative to freshwater irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation also increased the abundance of nosz at both irrigation levels in general biochar addition increased the abundance of nosz in 2021 p 0 01 3 3 nitrous oxide emissions and their responses to soil variables for all treatments soil n2o emission fluxes showed similar temporal characteristics for example they rapidly peaked after the application of basal and supplemental n fertilizer then they decreased to a steady low level until the next fertilization event soil n2o fluxes between different treatments differed mainly in peaks and relatively larger fluxes fig 8 overall deficit irrigation reduced the peaks of n2o fluxes only after supplementary fertilization in 2020 while decreased them on most occasions during the 2021 growing season related to full irrigation brackish water irrigation had higher n2o fluxes than freshwater irrigation under w1 but the difference in n2o fluxes between them was not significant under w2 in both years biochar addition could effectively reduce soil n2o fluxes under different irrigation treatments in both years in general the soil n2o fluxes ranged from 0 016 to 0 845 mg n m 2 h 1and 0 009 to 0 478 mg n m 2 h 1 for b0 and b1 in 2020 and 0 003 to 0 721 mg n m 2 h 1and 0 005 to 0 473 mg n m 2 h 1 for b0 and b1 in 2021 respectively the irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition significantly affected cumulative n2o emissions during the entire growing season and the two way interactive effect of irrigation amount and water salinity was found in both years whereas the interactive effect of irrigation amount and biochar addition was found to be significant only in 2021 fig 9 the effect of deficit irrigation in reducing cumulative n2o emissions was more pronounced in 2021 than that in 2020 on average deficit irrigation reduced cumulative n2o emissions by 13 0 in 2020 and 24 5 in 2021 under full irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water significantly increased cumulative n2o emissions by 20 3 and 21 7 on average in 2020 and 2021 respectively however no difference was found in cumulative n2o emissions between brackish water and freshwater under deficit irrigation in both years biochar addition significantly decreased cumulative n2o emissions by 29 4 31 0 and 17 9 29 2 under different irrigation treatments for 2020 and 2021 respectively water salinity did not affect the effectiveness of biochar in reducing n2o emissions but continuous deficit irrigation weakened it soil n2o fluxes were found to be closely related to soil environmental variables as indicated by a large r2 from the stepwise linear regression equation among them soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps were found to be significant in the regression model and they jointly accounted for 56 84 of the total n2o fluxes variation for b0 b1 or total b0 and b1 in both years p 0 001 the order of the importance of the three soil variables in explaining n2o fluxes variation was nh4 n no3 n wfps table 1 compared with b0 the reduction in soil n2o fluxes had a positive correlation with the reduction in soil wfps p 0 001 and nh4 n p 0 001 by adding biochar for the high flux points after fertilization fig 10 3 4 grain yield n uptake and yield scaled n2o emissions the effects of treatments on yield grain n uptake and grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions varied between the two years table 2 in 2020 irrigation amount was the only factor affecting grain yield significantly with the yield being higher under w1 than under w2 meanwhile in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition and the three way interaction were all found to be significant in affecting grain yield both deficit and brackish water irrigation led to significant yield reduction in 2021 biochar addition reduced yield for the treatment of deficit irrigation with brackish water and it significantly increased yield for the other treatments in 2021 in more detail biochar addition increased grain yield by 5 2 6 9 and 25 0 for w1s0 w1s1 and w2s0 respectively and it reduced the yield by 16 1 under w2s1 in 2020 irrigation amount and biochar addition and the two way interaction between them had significant effects on grain n uptake the grain n uptake was lower under w2 than under w1 biochar addition significantly promoted grain n uptake under w1 but had no significant effect on it under w2 in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition and the three way interaction were all found to be significant in affecting grain n uptake deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation both inhibited grain n uptake except for w2s1 treatment biochar significantly promoted grain n uptake under other water and salinity treatments grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions showed the similar pattern for the different treatments in both years in 2020 water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between water salinity and biochar addition were all found to be significant in grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions compared with full irrigation with freshwater deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased both grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions whereas biochar addition significantly reduced them under all water and salinity treatments in 2021 irrigation amount water salinity biochar addition and the two way interaction between irrigation amount and water salinity and the three way interaction were found to affect grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions significantly overall compared with full irrigation with freshwater deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions meanwhile biochar effectively reduce them under w1s0 w1s1 and w2s0 treatments 4 discussion 4 1 grain yield and nitrogen uptake response to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition our results indicated that the grain yield and n uptake of maize both were reduced under deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation compared with full irrigation with freshwater which was consistent with widely accepted findings in past studies el akhal et al 2013 lü et al 2014 pessarakli and tucker 1988 wang et al 2016a the inhibited crop photosynthetic rate due to water and or salt stress was the most important reason for limiting crop yield and n uptake under deficit irrigation with either freshwater or brackish water biochar addition increased grain nitrogen uptake and yield under full irrigation regardless of water salinity levels w1s0 and w1s1 in both years and also under deficit irrigation with freshwater in 2021 table 2 the result was consistent with the results of some previous studies indicating that biochar could effectively promote nitrogen uptake and yield of various crops liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 the improved soil fertility due to biochar addition was the most important factor contributing to the higher maize n uptake and yield liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 zheng et al 2018 similarly the increased no3 n content after the jointing stage was found under biochar addition treatments which was an important factor leading to higher n uptake and yield of maize for the treatments in this study fig 6 with a large amount of organo mineral coatings hydrated nitrate ions and cationic bridging biochar addition enhanced soil s no3 n retention capacity borchard et al 2019 kammann et al 2015 mukherjee et al 2011 sanford et al 2019 therefore biochar addition reduced no3 n leaching under relatively large irrigation amount after jointing stage moreover biochar addition could promote microbial activity by increasing soil organic matter content thus promoting the mineralization of organic matter and the nutrition supply al wabel et al 2018 ameloot et al 2013 in addition biochar addition increased swc under w1s1 and w2s0 data not shown this might have the beneficial effect of alleviating water and salt stresses on crops thus leading to a higher yield and n uptake akhtar et al 2014 2015 ali et al 2017 it is worth noting that biochar addition reduced the grain yield and n uptake under deficit irrigation with brackish water in 2021 table 2 the increased soil ec under w2s1b1 compared with w2s1b0 could be the reason for the reduction fig 3b d although soil ec in w2s1b1 was also higher than that in w2s1b0 in 2020 soil ec in both treatments was relatively low before maturity stage which did not have much effect on maize grain yield and n uptake with continuous brackish water irrigation soil ec became increasingly higher exerting greater stress on maize from the seedling stage in 2021 this eventually led to a reduction in yield and n uptake given that biochar addition increased soil water storage capacity fu et al 2019 mollinedo et al 2015 we reasoned that the larger portion of salts contained in brackish water was kept in the soil layer with the added biochar leading to greater salinity stress for biochar treatment under w2s1 the accumulation of salts from biochar addition could be effectively alleviated with a larger amount of irrigation water such as w1s1 treatment 4 2 n2o emissions response to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition the seasonal dynamic n2o fluxes peaked rapidly after basal and supplemental n fertilizer application in combination with irrigation events and then decreased to low values for all treatments in both years which was consistent with the previous studies kim et al 2017 liao et al 2021 scheer et al 2008 for all treatments n2o fluxes ranged from 0 009 to 0 845 mg n m 2 h 1 and 0 003 to 0 721 mg n m 2 h 1 in 2020 and 2021 respectively which was similar to previous findings from maize fields in the arid regions of northern china li et al 2020b liao et al 2021 wei et al 2019 we also found that soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps jointly controlled seasonal dynamic n2o fluxes table 1 which was consistent with previous studies indicating that soil nh4 n no3 n and wfps all had strong correlation with n2o fluxes liao et al 2021 wei et al 2019 deficit irrigation led to lower cumulative soil n2o emissions compared with full irrigation in both years fig 9 soil moisture is widely recognized as a critical factor in controlling soil n2o emissions and soil n2o emissions generally increase with increasing soil wfps lin and hernandez ramirez 2020 roman perez and hernandez ramirez 2021 wang and cai 2008 apparently the lower wfps under w2 versus w1 immediately after an irrigation event in particular was the main factor leading to the lower cumulative n2o emission in both years under w2 in this study soil wfps were 54 6 and 60 0 on average for w2 and w1 in 2020 and they were 49 0 and 56 8 on average for w2 and w1 in 2021 respectively obviously the reduction percentage in soil wfps for w2 compared with w1 was more pronounced in 2021 because the deficit irrigation was exerted during the entire growing season in 2021 whereas in 2020 it was not exerted until jointing stage fig 4 as a result the difference in cumulative n2o emissions between w1 and w2 treatments was greater in 2021 than in 2020 anova showed that irrigation amount and water salinity had a significant interactive effect on n2o emissions and the difference in n2o emissions between brackish water and freshwater was found to be different depending on different irrigation levels fig 9 under w1 brackish water irrigation significantly increased n2o emissions which could be attributed to the mildly increased soil salt and the higher soil wfps relative to freshwater irrigation some studies have shown that soil salinity thresholds may exist based on salinity s effect on nitrification or denitrification for example in previous studies salinity beyond the thresholds inhibited nitrification or denitrification whereas salinity lower than the thresholds increased them inubushi et al 1999 zeng et al 2013 the salinity threshold for nitrification was ec1 5 1000 μs cm 1 in yellow soil and andosol regardless of salt type and swc inubushi et al 1999 zeng et al 2013 also reported that the salinity threshold for both nitrification and denitrification was ec1 5 1130 μs cm 1 in a silty clay loam soil in this study the soil ec in w1s1 treatment ranging from 280 to 737 μs cm 1 in 2020 and 287 to 692 μs cm 1 in 2021 fig 3 which was lower than the salinity thresholds reported in the previous studies therefore a higher ec of w1s1 might lead to greater nitrification and denitrification rates and that in turn resulted in larger n2o emission compared with w1s0 on the other hand the possible inhibition of further reduction of n2o due to a higher salt content might also contribute to the higher n2o emissions under w1s1 menyailo et al 1997 moreover the enhanced soil wfps that occurs with brackish water irrigation could also contribute to the increased n2o emissions maucieri et al 2017 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 as we stated earlier that a greater soil wfps led to larger n2o emissions interestingly no significant difference in cumulative n2o emissions was found between w2s0 and w2s1 treatments in both years this result indicated that soil salinity had little effect on n2o emissions when the swc was somewhat lower which was consistent with the results from previous studies zhang et al 2018 found that n2o emissions were similar between different soil salinity levels 0 5 g kg 1 when swc was relatively low at 40 fc in a maize field saline water and freshwater irrigation had similar n2o emissions under deficit irrigation treatments with 70 full irrigation wei et al 2021 in this study biochar addition significantly reduced cumulative n2o emissions for all irrigation treatments fig 9 the reduction could be attributed to the decrease in both soil wfps and nh4 n through adding biochar especially during the periods with relatively larger n2o fluxes we found that the reduced wfps was strongly and positively correlated with the reduced n2o emissions that occurred with biochar addition fig 10 therefore the reduction in n2o emissions could be partially attributed to the decrease in denitrification rates with the increased soil aeration by adding biochar the finding was consistent with previous studies reporting that biochar addition could reduce n2o emissions due to the reduced soil bulk density bd and increased soil aeration niu et al 2017 yanai et al 2007 in this study biochar addition significantly reduced soil wfps mostly due to the greatly enhanced tp similarly hagemann et al 2016 reported that beech wood biochar applied at 60 t ha 1 significantly reduced wfps because of the increased tp which in turn led to the reduced n2o emissions in addition to the reduced soil wfps the reduced nh4 n also accounted for the reduced n2o emissions resulting from biochar addition fig 10 biochar has strong adsorption capacity due to its huge specific surface area and abundant pores which could lead to the adsorption and immobilization of large amount of nh4 thus reduced the availability of nitrogen sources for microbial activities clough et al 2013 singh et al 2010 taghizadeh toosi et al 2012 cai et al 2016 reported biochar could also adsorb nh4 through its hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction of the carboxyl and ketone groups in addition the interactive effect of irrigation amount and biochar addition on cumulative n2o emissions was insignificant in 2020 but significant in 2021 the discrepancy could be attributed to the soil water status of b1 and b0 for the period with greater n2o emission fluxes were different between the two years as we mentioned earlier biochar addition affected n2o emissions mainly through changing soil wfps in both years the period with relatively greater n2o emissions was mainly during the seedling stage when irrigation treatment had not started as a result the change in average wfps between b1 and b0 was similar under w1 and w2 in 2020 i e about 74 of b0 to 57 of b1 under both w1 and w2 which led to insignificant interaction of biochar and irrigation level in 2020 on the contrary soil wfps under w1 was quite different from that under w2 in 2021 due to the deficit irrigation in the earlier year soil wfps of b0 and b1 under w2 were substantially lower than that under w1 specifically the average soil wfps were 69 and 61 for b0 and 54 and 46 for b1 under w1 and w2 respectively previous studies have revealed that the relationship between soil wfps and n2o emissions is non linear i e soil n2o emissions changed little when soil wfps was lower than 60 but it increased sharply when soil wfps was higher than 60 bateman and baggs 2005 consequently the extent to which n2o emissions were reduced via biochar addition depended not only on the change of wfps but also on the soil wfps level of b1 and b0 soil wfps changed from 69 to 54 by biochar addition under w1 leading to a significant reduction in n2o emissions whereas soil wpfs at both b0 and b1 were roughly lower than 60 under w2 resulting in little difference in n2o emissions between b0 and b1 the results indicated that biochar s effect on reducing n2o emissions depended largely upon soil moisture level especially during the period with larger n2o fluxes for soils under constant drought soil wfps 60 adding biochar would have a relatively small effect on their n2o emissions soil n2o emissions mainly derive from the simultaneous microbial nitrification and denitrification that occurs during the soil n cycle process in agricultural soils braker and conrad 2011 some studies indicated that the abundances of nitrifier and denitrifier could predict soil n2o emissions mostly in the controlled conditions of incubation studies hink et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 however it became difficult to establish a correspondence between nitrifier or denitrifier with soil n2o emissions in field experiments since abiotic factors could be better predictors of n2o emissions hagemann et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 in our study the differences in the abundances of amoa nirk nirs and nosz could not explain much of the differences in cumulative n2o emissions between treatments fig 7 first of all whether there exists a strong correlation between the abundances levels of amoa nirk nirs and nosz and n2o emissions has not been clearly established in the complex field environment in addition the time of soil sampling for the abundance of bacteria did not match the time of n2o flux measurements in this study given that microbial communities vary greatly with changing soil environments in different growing stages xu et al 2017 the abundance of bacteria at the end of the growing season did not reflect the abundance at the time of n2o flux measurements resulting in no or a weak correlation between the abundance levels of amoa nirk nirs and nosz and n2o emissions 4 3 yield scaled n2o emissions in the study the grain yield scaled n2o emissions ranged from 0 22 to 0 40 g n kg 1 grain and 0 22 to 0 46 g n kg 1 grain in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 2 which was similar to the past study conducted in a mulched maize field kim et al 2017 however studies reported much higher and lower values of grain yield scaled n2o emissions than those in this study the obvious differences in grain yield scaled n2o emissions in different experiments are mainly due to the different agronomic practices and experimental conditions for example wang et al 2016b reported that the grain yield scaled n2o emissions were only 0 031 0 038 g n kg 1 grain in a maize field under irrigation and mulching conditions of semiarid loess plateau china which was about 10 times smaller than that in our study the improved soil aeration condition from half film mulching practice might result in lower n2o emissions in their study on the contrary gagnon et al 2011 reported that the average range of grain yield scaled n2o emissions in a three year experiment was from 1 31 to 1 99 g n kg 1 grain in a rain fed maize field in eastern canada which was much higher than our results as the fertilization rates were similar in the two studies the higher n2o emissions in their study might have resulted from the mineralization of perennial grass residues in the first year since the test site was an old grass meadow compared with w1s0 treatment deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain yield scaled n2o emissions due to increased n2o emissions or decreased yield or both therefore global warming could be accelerated as a result of efforts to ensure food security by adopting deficit or brackish water irrigation in arid regions fortunately adding biochar could effectively reduce grain yield scaled n2o emissions by increasing yield or reducing n2o emissions niu et al 2017 li et al 2020a liao et al 2020 in this study the addition of biochar significantly reduced grain yield scaled n2o emissions under different irrigation treatments except for w2s1 treatment in 2021 and the reduction of n2o played a more important role in it than the increased yield the grain n yield scaled n2o emissions ranged from 15 43 to 29 63 g n kg 1 n in 2020 and 14 09 to 26 34 g n kg 1 n in this study table 2 about three times that of the maize cropping system that venterea et al 2011 reported on this discrepancy was mainly due to the lower nitrogen application rate used in their study which induced less n2o emissions compared with w1s0 treatment deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation increased grain n yield scaled n2o emissions due to increased n2o emissions or decreased n uptake or both this result highlighted the problem of higher n2o emissions under the same n recovery in arid regions using deficit irrigation and brackish water irrigation similarly biochar addition significantly reduced grain n yield scaled n2o emissions due to enhanced n uptake or decreased n2o emissions or both 5 conclusions in the study we explored the responses of maize yield n uptake and soil n2o emissions to irrigation amount water salinity and biochar addition under a drip irrigated maize field with mulching in an arid region biochar addition could increase maize yield and n uptake to varying degrees under different water and salinity treatments except for w2s1 deficit irrigation reduced soil cumulative n2o emissions relative to full irrigation compared with freshwater irrigation brackish water irrigation increased soil cumulative n2o emissions under w1 but it had no effect under w2 suggesting that limiting the irrigation amount of brackish water could reduce n2o emissions biochar addition showed great potential for reducing field n2o emissions for different irrigation treatments adding a proper amount of biochar is recommended in arid areas to balance economic yield n recovery and n2o emissions by reducing grain and grain n yield scaled n2o emissions these findings are of great importance for fostering an understanding of how maize growth and n2o emissions would respond to biochar addition under limited irrigation with marginal quality of water in arid areas however these results were based on a two year study whether the conclusions could hold in the long run and whether the practice of irrigation with brackish water and biochar addition is sustainable remain unclear a long term observation on how maize growth n2o emission and n cycle related bacteria in the special growth stage of maize would respond to biochar addition under various water and salinity conditions is needed in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9139,applying new approaches in the management of water resources is a vital issue especially in arid and semi arid regions the water footprint is a key index in water management therefore it is necessary to predict its changes for future durations the soft computing model is one of the most widely used models in predicting and estimating agroclimatic variables the purpose of this study is to predict the green and blue water footprints of saffron product using the soft computing model in order to select the most effective variables in prediction water footprints the individual input was eliminated one by one and the effect of each on the residual mean square error rmse was measured in the first stage the group method of data handling gmdh and evolutionary algorithms have been applied in the next stage the output of individual models was incorporated into the inclusive multiple model imm as the input variables in order to predict the blue and green water footprints of saffron product in three homogenous agroclimatic regions finally the uncertainty of the model caused by the input and parameters was evaluated the contributions of this research are introducing optimized gmdh and new ensemble models for predicting bwf and gwf uncertainty analysis and investigating effective inputs on the gwf and bwf the results indicated that the most important variables affecting green and blue water footprints are plant transpiration evapotranspiration and yield since removing these variables significantly increased the rmse range 11 25 among the gmdh models the best performance

improvement of living standards and changes in consumption patterns have caused the water demand to be increased siam and eltahir 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020a wang et al 2021 the problem of freshwater shortage may intensify in the future due to the increasing demands and decreasing water availability quantity and quality this issue will cause problems for food security and environmental sustainability rosegrant et al 2009 ercin and hoekstra 2016 almost 85 of global freshwater is consumed in the agricultural sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 bhat et al 2017 elbeltagi et al 2021 therefore water footprint wf could be a useful tool for dealing with water security challenges especially in the agricultural sector hoekstra and hung 2003 hoekstra 2008 bazrafshan et al 2019b the water footprint wf approach was first proposed by hoekstra in 2003 wf describe the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to produce of goods and services hoekstra and hung 2003 zhang et al 2017 2020 zhai et al 2019 wf is a combination of green blue and gray water footprints jamshidi et al 2020 the blue wf bwf involves the volume of surface and underground water consumption hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 sidhu et al 2021 the green wf gwf denotes the volume of rainwater consumed during the growing period of the crop wang et al 2022b sidhu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 the gray wf is the volume of water required to dilute pollutants tolerably hoekstra and chapagain 2006 wang et al 2022a wf is a key index in the management of water resources and agriculture therefore the prediction wf is important due to its dependence on various parameters and its prediction is a complicated issue in this regard the soft computing model is one of the appropriate models for predicting and estimating hydrological and agricultural variables high accuracy fast convergence and high flexibility are the characteristics of soft computing models previous studies have used different soft computing methods for predicting wf elbeltagi et al 2020b applied climatic parameters and artificial neural networks anns model to predict wf they indicated that the ann model accurately predicts the blue and green water footprints using the climatic data preparing the parameters of the ann model and determining the number of hidden layers was a research challenge mokhtar et al 2021 used random forest decision tree and incremental regression algorithm to predict the bwf and gwf they performed their forecast for the future period of 2021 2050 under the conditions of climate change according to their reports the bwf and gwf will increase in future periods collecting data preparing climate scenarios and selecting the best model were their research challenges elbeltagi et al 2021 used climatic parameters such as temperature wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure to predict wf they applied four different kernels in the gaussian model and indicated that the gaussian algorithm is an appropriate model for estimating wf however various models produce different accuracies setting model parameters and collecting required data were the main challenges of their research the main challenges of the previous studies were determining the input predictors selecting the best model and adjusting the parameters past researches have focused more on using individual models rather than using an ensemble approach to predict bwf and gwf integrated models use optimization algorithms for modeling and then the output of these models is used as the input of the final model also in most past researches the analysis of uncertainty caused by model parameters and input data has not been considered the purpose of the present study is to extract the most effective variables on bwf and gwf then their prediction based on the optimized ensemble model and finally to analysis the model uncertainty based on the input data and model parameters the artificial neural network ann is one of the most important soft computing models the ann algorithm is useful for extracting information from imprecise and non linear data adisa et al 2019 the ann algorithms have fewer limitations than the conventional approaches elbeltagi et al 2020b they have various characteristics including high accuracy fast computing and convergence they also have high analytical power to simulate complex and non linear problems by applying different mathematical activation functions zhang et al 1998 group method of data handling gmdh proposed by ivakhnenko 1968 is a multivariate analysis approach developed based on the artificial neural network and applied to identify and model complex systems gmdh model could be used to model complex systems when there is no prior information muller and ivakhnenko 1996 this method provides more accurate results for low samples and dispersed data than physical models ivakhnenko 1968 although the gmdh model is a powerful tool it needs improvements to increase accuracy the accuracy of the gmdh model directly depends on the estimated parameters the optimization algorithms are appropriate methods for improving the accuracy of the gmdh model the gmdh model is an individual model individual models have advantages and disadvantages however previous studies showed that ensemble models composed of several individual models have better accuracy than individual models therefore the current research aims to develop the gmdh model using optimization algorithms then constructs an ensemble model that involves several optimized gmdh models in order to predict the water footprint of the saffron product saffron is one of the most expensive medicinal plants in the world that is called red gold leone et al 2018 and is used to treat diseases this plant is also used as a flavoring coloring and preservative in the food industry fallahi et al 2018 siddique et al 2020 due to its special morphological characteristics resistance to drought and its dormant phase that does not require irrigation saffron needs little water compared to other crops kafi et al 2006 cardone et al 2020 these characteristics allow the plant to grow in arid and semi arid areas alizadeh et al 2009 agayev et al 2006 saffron is one of the native products of iran the importance of saffron can be evaluated from various aspects such as low water requirement job creation preventing the migration of villagers and the livelihood of more than 4 000 000 people rastegaripour and mohammadi 2018 iran with production of 90 of global saffron has the first rank in terms of cultivated area and production rate in the world baghalian et al 2010 cardone et al 2020 bazrafshan et al 2019b mollafilabi et al 2020 according to the ministry of agricultural jihad reports published in 2019 the production of saffron in iran with a cultivated area of 118 372 ha has been 428 19 tons khorasan razavi with 70 of the saffron production and 77 of the saffron cultivation area has the first rank of saffron production and cultivation area in iran after that khorasan jonoobi and khorasan shomali provinces have the second and third ranks of saffron production in iran respectively maj 2019 this study develops the new and optimized gmdh and ensemble models for predicting bwf and gwl in this regard we applied the optimization algorithms to improve the gmdh model and estimate its parameters salgotra and singh 2019 introduced a new optimization algorithm called naked mole rate algorithm nmra to solve optimization problems the characteristics of this algorithm are high accuracy for solving non linear optimization fast convergence and the ability of training soft computing models this study uses nmra optimization algorithm to train gmdh model and estimating parameters for further investigation we also applied the gmdh ba bat algorithm gmdh pso particle swarm optimization and gmdh sa shark smell algorithm optimization algorithms to predict the wf in the second stage the outputs of the mentioned models are used as the inputs of the imm inclusive multiple model model to predict the wf and evaluate the uncertainty of the model using glue the contributions of current study as follows 1 developing a new ensemble method for predicting of bwf and gwf based on optimized gmdh models 2 this research quantifies the uncertainties of model outputs using a new method 2 material and methods 2 1 case study and data set khorasan region in northeastern iran covering an area 313 335 km2 involves three provinces of khorasan shomali khorasan razavi and khorasan jonoobi that covers about one fifth of the iran land area these provinces with almost 96 of saffron production 269 12 tons are the biggest saffron production areas in iran bazrafshan et al 2019b in this research crop data including cultivation area saffron production and the rate of chemical fertilizer consumption in 38 counties are collected from the ministry of agricultural jihad maj 2021 the meteorological data are taken from the meteorological data source of the iran irimo 2021 in this regard the cultivated area production chemical fertilizer consumption irrigation efficiency cultivation date and soil type of each region were selected to determine the homogeneous agroclimatic points of saffron production in khorasan region in this research fuzzy c mean fcm clustering algorithm was used to determine homogeneous points 2 2 fcm clustering methodology the purpose of clustering is to divide the observations into several categories in which the observations of each category are more similar and closer to each other than the observation of other categories fuzzy c means is one of the clustering algorithms that assign observations to separate clusters with a specific degree of membership in these algorithms an objective function is used as the evaluation index that optimally clusters the existing observations the fuzzy clustering algorithm was firstly proposed by ruspini ruspini 1969 in this method the degree of membership or belonging of each observation to each cluster is determined through the membership matrix u u ij c n u 1 u 2 u n where c is the number of clusters and n represent the number of observations two constrains have been considered in fcm clustering method first no cluster should be null j 1 u u ij 0 i 1 c and second the normalization constrains that states the total degree of membership of each observation in all clusters should be equal one j 1 u u ij 0 j 1 n the fcm algorithm attempts to find partitions sets c fuzzy clusters for an observation group through minimizing the following objective function 1 j f x u f c i 1 c j 1 n u ij m d ij 2 where d ij is the distance between jth observation x j and the center of the ith cluster and m 1 denotes the degree of fuzziness usually m 2 therefore if m tends to one m 1 the clustering becomes the crisp method and if m tends to infinity m the clustering becomes a fuzzy clustering however the j f function cannot be minimized directly and the iterative algorithms must be used to solve this problem the optimal steps are as follows 1 choosing appropriate values for m c and selecting a small positive number for ε we also fill the matrix c the center of the clusters randomly and set the value t 0 2 we calculate the membership matrix at t 0 and then update at t 0 then the membership matrix for fixed value of parameters is optimized as follows 2 u ij t 1 d ij 2 m 1 1 1 c d 1 j 2 m 1 1 1 1 c d 1 j d ij 1 1 m for i 1 c and j 1 n in this equation the degree of membership depends on the distance between an observation with the center of its cluster and the distance with the center of other clusters 3 c i t 1 j 1 n u ij t 1 m x j j 1 n u ij t 1 m for i 1 c 3 in the final step we update the membership matrix using the optimized membership degree the updating equation for the cluster centers depends on several parameters such as the location shape and size of the clusters in addition to the mentioned parameters the method of measuring the distance will be very sensitive 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until c t 1 c t ε or u t 1 u t ε are established in practice it has been shown that this method does not fall into local optimization the fcm algorithm has been widely used as a clustering method in many studies fig 1 illustrates the three homogenous regions which was determined based on the fcm algorithm and table 1 represents the crop and climatic information of each cluster located in these homogeneous regions in cluster i the

coefficients kc proposed by shahidi et al 2020 keykhamoghadam et al 2013 was applied and the etc was calibrated for each saffron cultivation area then the net irrigation requirement was calculated from the difference of evapotranspiration with the effective precipitation the water requirement was also calculated using the irrigation efficiency reported by the ministry of agriculture for each region after determining the variables affecting the product the bwf and gwf were calculated green water is a part of effective rainfall that is consumed by plants in an unsaturated soil environment

nadiri 2021 stated that the imm model uses the advantages of multiple models and improves the efficiency of individual models jalil masir et al 2022 applied the imm model as a collaborative model in this study the imm model was used in order to improve the accuracy of the optimized gmdh models as follows the individual gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba and gmdh are applied in order to predict the output

generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue glue is a useful approach for quantifying the uncertainty in the modeling process glue has been applied in various fields such as uncertainty analysis of discharge maghrebi and vatanchi 2021 reservoir operation muronda et al 2021 hydrological model uncertainty zuo et al 2021 uncertainty quantification of eruption constantinescu et al 2022 and urban flood model kobarfard et al 2022 according to the following steps the input and parameter uncertainties are quantified 1 in the first step the prior distribution of input parameters is determined typically the normal distribution is used for input parameters however it cannot be used as a prior distribution for model parameters the parameters fluctuate during the training step which demonstrates the parameter properties in this study 4000 gmdh models are trained to estimate the probability distribution of ann parameters this training number was selected because the parameters remained unchanged between 1000 and 4000 gmdh models 2 the prior distribution using the monte carlo method provides n samples 3 the gmdh models are run using the generated parameters in the previous

to select the best input scenario introduced in table 2 the rmse criterion based on the gmdh nmra algorithm was considered the lowest rmse indicates the best input the input scenarios for gwf and bwf are displayed in table 2 according to the results the lowest rmse and the best results in all three clusters and both predictive variables belongs to the scenario 13 in which all predictors are included into the model in regards with gwf the highest value of rmse belongs to the scenarios 1 and 12 in which the inputs contain all variables except etc and yield therefore the gwf is highly correlated with etc and yield like the gwf the highest rmse in predicting bwf belongs to the scenarios 1 and 12 whose input involves all variables except the yield and etc further in both cases the lowest rmse produced by a scenario that involves all predictors 3 2 determining the sample size determining the sample size for training and testing parts is very important in modeling in this research the rmse was used to determine the appropriate sample size of the data the best sample size is one that minimizes the rmse in both training and testing steps table 3 represents the error rate rmse versus the sample size for the testing and training stages for bwf and gwf in all three clusters according to the results assigning 70 and 30 of observations respectively to the training and testing sets produced the lowest rmse in all three clusters therefore in order to modeling bwf and gwf in all three clusters observations were separated into 70 and 30 for the training and testing purpose respectively fig 3 3 3 selecting appropriate random parameters fig 4 illustrates the rmse versus different population sizes pop for nmra ba sa and pso algorithms in modeling bwf in all three clusters each algorithm involves various random parameters such that the population size is an important random parameter sensitivity analysis means changing the population size versus the objective function in order to achieve the best population size the objective function in the present study is the rmse and the best population size is one that produces the lowest rmse value the objective function in cluster 1 based on the nmr algorithm and for population sizes pop 50 pop 100 pop 200 pop 250 and pop 300 were 16 55 12 23 14 55 15 and 15 5 respectively therefore the best population size for the nmr algorithm is pop 150 with the value 12 23 of objective function the objective function for ba with respect to pop 50 pop 100 pop 200 pop 250 and pop 300 was 16 12 15 54 14 35 14 78 and 15 23 respectively therefore the best population size for ba is pop 200 that produced the lowest rmse 14 35 further analysis indicated that the nmr algorithm has the best performance in cluster i such that it produced the lowest rmse 12 23 for population size pop 150 in clusters ii and iii the best population size was investigated in different algorithms and the nmra algorithm produced the lowest rmse 12 34 for the population size pop 150 table 3 represents large number of iterations for various algorithms in modeling bwf and gwf in all three clusters since the iteration number is another important parameter in evolutionary algorithms sensitivity analysis is performed to calculate the maximum iteration number in order to achieve the best value of the objective function the parameter of maximum iteration such as the population size is changed the best value of maximum iteration number for each algorithm are provided in table 4 3 4 graphical assessment of model accuracy fig 5 illustrates the radar plot of comparing model accuracy based on the fsd nse pbias and mae criteria for modeling bwf fig 5a indicates the radar plot based on the fsd value the training fsd for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh algorithms were 0 76 0 89 1 12 1 23 1 28 and 1 32 respectively fig 6b illustrates the nse values of modeling bwf the testing nse for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh algorithms were 0 95 0 92 0 89 0 86 0 84 and 0 72 respectively the testing pbias for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh algorithms were 8 12 15 18 23 27 respectively fig 6c fig 6d illustrates the radar plot mae criterion the training mae for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh algorithms were 8 9 11 12 14 and 15 respectively according to all assessment criteria the imm algorithm was the best compared to the alternatives results of this section indicate that the evolutionary algorithms increase the accuracy of the gmdh model the hybrid gmdh models have different accuracies in this regard the nmra algorithm had the best and the pso algorithm had the lowest accuracy than the other optimization algorithms since the imm used the outputs of several individual models it had better accuracy than the individual gmdh models therefore using the imm model has improved the results fig 6 represents the radar plots of fsd fig 6c nse fig 6b pbias fig 6a and mae fig 6d criteria for modeling gwf similarly the results of modeling bwf the imm model produced the lowest error rate than the alternatives in modeling gwf so that the optimized gmdh had better performance than the individual gmdh model scatter plot is a useful tool for evaluating the accuracy of predicted models when the data overlaps the heat scatterplot helps to identify the number of observations in a specific area figs 7 and 8 denote the scatter plot of prediction bwf and gwf in cluster i fig 7 a f represents the scatter plot between predicted and observed bwf the estimated r2 for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh models are 0 99 0 98 0 97 0 97 0 96 and 0 95 respectively therefore based on the r2 criterion the imm model is more accurate than the alternatives fig 9 a f denotes the scatter plot of predicted versus the observed gwf as results show the highest r2 was produced by imm model therefore the imm model has higher accuracy in prediction both variables in cluster i fig 9 represents the barplot of r2 value for predicted gwf and bwf in clusters ii and iii according to the results the imm model produced the highest r2 between the estimated and observed bwf and gwf in both clusters therefore due to the use of the outputs of several individual models the imm has the highest accuracy among the alternatives in all three clusters 3 5 graphical assessment of model performance in order to evaluate the performance of the models the boxplot of the estimated and observed gwf and bwf was used fig 10 compares of the boxplot of the predicted and the observed bwf and gwf for saffron in 3 clusters cluster i in this cluster the imm model performed very well in estimating the dispersion indices of observed gwf including median 799 5 maximum 2567 minimum 51 first quartile 660 and third quantile 1900 compared to the other hybrid models the gmdh nmra also estimated the dispersion indices very well however it ranks after the imm in terms of efficiency as figure shows the median the first and the third quartiles of imm boxplot in estimating bwf are 5500 2400 and 7000 ton m3 respectively which completely closed to the observed values the maximum 11 553 and minimum 840 values of the imm boxplot are also closed to the observed bwf values the other models are highly deviated from the observed bwf dispersion indices cluster ii the estimated median 2300 ton m3 and third quantile 3200 ton m3 of the bwf by the imm model is very closed to the observed values further there is the highest agreement between the first quartile 1225 the minimum 537 and the maximum 5956 of observed bwf and the predicted values by the imm model in addition the imm model has performed very well compared to the other hybrid models in estimating the median 1800 maximum 4067 and minimum 172 of the observed gwf this model also estimated the third quartile 3200 of gwf very accurately cluster iii the imm model has the best performance compared to the alternatives with the most similarity of estimated to the observed bwf and gwf this model also estimated the maximum 5999 and minimum 789 of bwf as well as the maximum 2753 and minimum 123 of gwf very accurately the estimated values by the other hybrid models are significantly deviated from the observed bwf and gwf 3 6 uncertainty analysis caused by the parameters and inputs on estimating wf saffron uncertainty in the modeling process is dependent to the inputs and parameters in the present study the uncertainty caused by the parameters and inputs is analyzed separately figs 11a 11b 11c and 11d illustrate the uncertainty due to the inputs and parameters in predicting bwf and gwf variables more observation points within the confidence region indicate the lower uncertainty also the smaller band of the confidence region represents the lower uncertainty according to figs 11a and 11c the uncertainty caused by the inputs is less than the uncertainty caused by the parameters for instance in predicting gwf the p value due to the inputs and parameters uncertainty is 0 98 and 0 95 respectively fig 11a figs 11b and 11d also indicate that the uncertainty caused by inputs is lower than the uncertainty caused by the parameters for gwf prediction fig 12 displays the uncertainty of the models caused by the parameters and inputs according to the results the imm and the gmdh nmra models have the lowest p 0 98 r 0 08 and the second lowest p 0 97 r 0 09 uncertainties compared to the alternatives further investigation indicated that the uncertainty due to the inputs is lower than the parameters the results also denoted that the optimization algorithms have been effective in reducing the uncertainty of the gmdh model given that the gmdh hybrid models have lower uncertainty than the gmdh model 4 discussion in this research in order to measure the effect of inputs on the predicted values and determining the most effective predictors the rmse was used this method has been widely used by researchers in agro climatological and hydrological studies such as the sediment transfer rate modeling jalil masir et al 2022 groundwater level prediction khozani et al 2022 and daily pan evaporation ehteram et al 2022a 2022b therefore regarding the number of input variables 13 scenarios were considered such that in each one input was eliminated and the influence was measured fig 13 represents the effect of removing each predictor on the output of the gmdh nmr model as result shows removing the etc and yield significantly increases the rmse therefore they are evaluated as the most effective inputs in predicting bwf and gwf according to several studies papadavid and toulios 2018 bazrafshan et al 2019b and fao 33 or 56 or 66 equations allen et al 1998 increasing decreasing evapotranspiration directly affects the yield on the other hand the yield directly was included in gwf in the denominator eq 4 therefore removing these variables causes high sensitivity in model prediction the error rate of removing individual variables is lower in gwf than in bwf this indicates that the correlation between input variables in gwf is higher than in bwf fig 14 compares the performance of models based on the taylor diagram taylor diagram is illustrated in two forms half circle denotes negative and positive correlation and quarter circle denotes positive correlation only in both cases the correlation coefficients are the radius of the circle on its arc the standard deviations are the concentric circles with respect to the center and the rmse values are drawn as concentric circles with respect to the reference point on the horizontal axis the closer the location of the models to the reference point black square on the horizontal axis the better the model performance in order to evaluate the performance of imm the taylor diagram was used as shown for bwf in cluster i the location of imm is between the correlation coefficients 0 99 and 0 97 and the crmse is 2 5 in this regard the best performance among various gmdh models belongs to gmdh nmra whose correlation coefficient is 0 97 and its crmse is 3 results of jalil masir et al 2022 also indicates that the imm performed better than the alternatives due to using the outputs of several optimized models ensemble models combine several individual models which have several advantages abbaszadeh et al 2021 the imm is an ensemble model that applies the advantages of multiple individual models therefore the imm improves the performance of individual models with more flexibility ehteram et al 2022a 2022b the gmdh model with correlation coefficient 0 74 and crmes 9 93 has the worst performance in cluster i the reason for the weak performance of gmdh is the training algorithm gradient algorithm and insufficient accuracy in finding the model parameters ehteram et al 2022a 2022b among gmdh models the gmdh nmra has the best performance in cluster i with correlation coefficient 0 96 and crmes 3 0 the same results are obtained in clusters ii and iii according to ehteram et al 2022a 2022b in the nmr algorithm worker and breeder balances the exploration and exploitation due to their large population size workers perform exploration and breeders use more intensive exploitation than workers since they attempt to improve their compatibility in order to mate with queens the nmra algorithm can achieve better results when workers and breeders update themselves therefore these algorithms produce better solutions such that low quality solutions are removed from optimization as breeders update themselves through the updating of nmr solutions the problem space is investigated accurately the imm also had better performance in predicting gwf than the alternatives the noteworthy point is that all models have better performance in predicting gwf than predicting bwf this issue was held in elimination the less effective variables in selecting best inputs which the main reason was the high correlation between input parameters in gwf compared to bwf further analysis of taylor diagram indicated that although the optimization algorithms increase the accuracy of gmdh however the performance of models are different such that the gmdh ba model has a weaker performance than the other gmdh hybrid models this is due to the more ability of nmra and sa than ba and pso optimization algorithms in finding the absolute optimal answer for prediction models salgotra and singh 2019 5 conclusion increasing population and consequently water demand in the agricultural sector and frequent drought events causes water resources management to be very important prediction water footprint is a key issue in the management of water resources and helps decision makers to have a true understanding of the volume of water consumed by the products therefore prediction water footprints play a significant role in irrigation and agriculture management this study constructed a new ensemble model based on the improved gmdh models and investigated the model uncertainty due to the parameters and inputs and provided important step in predicting bwf and gwf indices various climatic and crop inputs have been used to calculate the saffron bwf and gwf indices in major saffron production areas in iran in this regard the fcm clustering method was used to determine the homogeneous agro climatic of saffron cultivation areas in khorasan region then the most effective predictors in prediction bwf and gwf were selected using the step by step elimination and measuring their effect on gmdh nmra output through 13 scenarios the gmdh model and various optimization algorithms such as nmra sa ba pso have been applied to predict the response variables in the next step the output of individual gmdh was included into the ensemble imm model and the uncertainty analysis of the model parameters and input was performed the present study indicated that applying the imm and the optimized gmdh models improved the accuracy of the outputs imm performed better than the alternatives due to using the outputs of several individual models further analysis demonstrated that the uncertainty caused by the inputs was lower than the uncertainty caused by the model parameters selecting the input variables is one of the important challenges in the present study another feature selection methods such as the gamma test wavelet theory principal component analysis and boruta algorithm can be used to select the best input variables in the future studies in this regard collecting climatic and crop dataset was another limitation in modeling bwf and gwf indices although the imm model may increase the accuracy however collecting suitable dataset for training models is a complicated issue the main finding of this research is that the ensemble models can improve the accuracy of optimized soft computing models there are different ensemble models such as bayesian model averaging bma and copula bayesian averaging model cbma the advantage of imm over bma and cbma is that the model does not have complex computations although the optimization algorithms can enhance the performance of soft computing models the optimized models are outperformed by the new ensemble models this study indicated that the accuracy of models was affected by the uncertainty values the model parameters and input parameters were the important uncertainty resources the optimization algorithms can be used to set the model parameters thus these algorithms can reduce the uncertainty values of models because of model parameters the results of study also indicated that the optimization algorithms provided different accuracies because they used different and advanced operators a robust optimization algorithm can decrease the uncertainty of model parameters the models introduced of the current study can be used for different regions of the world these models can be coupled with climate scenarios to predict gwf and bwf under climate change thus we can use the outputs of climate change models under different scenarios for predicting of gwf and bwf in the future periods selecting best optimization algorithm is another issue of the present study choosing an optimization algorithm with fast convergence and high accuracy is very important since a suitable optimization algorithm can reduce the model uncertainty caused by the parameters measuring the model uncertainty caused by the parameters and inputs is another important result of the present study applying the models of the present study is not limited to predicting bwf and gwf but they could also be used to predict the other hydrological hydroclimatic drought and water resources variables the results of the current research can also be extended in future studies to predict the bwf and gwf in various regions and products further in future studies the other ensemble models such as the bayesian and bayesian copula can be used to improve the results the next studies can use the methods such as gamma test and principal component analysis to choose the best inputs declaration of

9139,applying new approaches in the management of water resources is a vital issue especially in arid and semi arid regions the water footprint is a key index in water management therefore it is necessary to predict its changes for future durations the soft computing model is one of the most widely used models in predicting and estimating agroclimatic variables the purpose of this study is to predict the green and blue water footprints of saffron product using the soft computing model in order to select the most effective variables in prediction water footprints the individual input was eliminated one by one and the effect of each on the residual mean square error rmse was measured in the first stage the group method of data handling gmdh and evolutionary algorithms have been applied in the next stage the output of individual models was incorporated into the inclusive multiple model imm as the input variables in order to predict the blue and green water footprints of saffron product in three homogenous agroclimatic regions finally the uncertainty of the model caused by the input and parameters was evaluated the contributions of this research are introducing optimized gmdh

climate variables group method of data handling evolutionary algorithms data availability will be sent upon request 1 introduction population growth agricultural expansion industrial development improvement of living standards and changes in consumption patterns have caused the water demand to be increased siam and eltahir 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020a wang et al 2021 the problem of freshwater shortage may intensify in the future due to the increasing demands and decreasing water availability quantity and quality this issue will cause problems for food security and environmental sustainability rosegrant et al 2009 ercin and hoekstra 2016 almost 85 of global freshwater is consumed in the agricultural sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 bhat et al 2017 elbeltagi et al 2021 therefore water footprint wf could be a useful tool for dealing with water security challenges especially in the agricultural sector hoekstra and hung 2003 hoekstra 2008 bazrafshan et al 2019b the water footprint wf approach was first proposed by hoekstra in 2003 wf describe the total volume of freshwater that is used directly or indirectly to produce of goods and services hoekstra and hung 2003 zhang et al 2017 2020 zhai et al 2019 wf is a combination of green blue and gray water footprints jamshidi et al 2020 the blue wf bwf involves the volume of surface and underground water consumption hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 sidhu et al 2021 the green wf gwf denotes the volume of rainwater consumed during the growing period of the crop wang et al 2022b sidhu et al 2021 zhao et al 2019 the gray wf is the volume of water required to dilute pollutants tolerably hoekstra and chapagain 2006 wang et al 2022a wf is a key index in the management of water resources and agriculture therefore the prediction wf is important due to its dependence on various parameters and its prediction is a complicated issue in this regard the soft computing model is one of the appropriate models for predicting and estimating hydrological and agricultural variables high accuracy fast convergence and high flexibility are the characteristics of soft computing models previous studies have used different soft computing methods for predicting wf elbeltagi et al 2020b applied climatic parameters and artificial neural networks anns model to predict wf they indicated that the ann model accurately predicts the blue and green water footprints using the climatic data preparing the parameters of the ann model and determining the number of hidden layers was a research challenge mokhtar et al 2021 used random forest decision tree and incremental regression algorithm to predict the bwf and gwf they performed their forecast for the future period of 2021 2050 under the conditions of climate change according to their reports the bwf and gwf will increase in future periods collecting data preparing climate scenarios and selecting the best model were their research challenges elbeltagi et al 2021 used climatic parameters such as temperature wind speed solar radiation and vapor pressure to predict wf they applied four different kernels in the gaussian model and indicated that the gaussian algorithm is an appropriate model for estimating wf however various models produce different accuracies setting model parameters and collecting required data were the main challenges of their research the main challenges of the previous studies were determining the input predictors selecting the best model and adjusting the parameters past researches have focused more on using individual models rather than using an ensemble approach to predict bwf and gwf integrated models use optimization algorithms for modeling and then the output of these models is used as the input of the final model also in most past researches the analysis of uncertainty caused by model parameters and input data has not been considered the purpose of the present study is to extract the most effective variables on bwf and gwf then their prediction based on the optimized ensemble model and finally to analysis the model uncertainty based on the input data and model parameters the artificial neural network ann is one of the most important soft computing models the ann algorithm is useful for extracting information from imprecise and non linear data adisa et al 2019 the ann algorithms have fewer limitations than the conventional approaches elbeltagi et al 2020b they have various characteristics including high accuracy fast computing and convergence they also have high analytical power to simulate complex and non linear problems by applying different mathematical activation functions zhang et al 1998 group method of data handling gmdh proposed by ivakhnenko 1968 is a multivariate analysis approach developed based on the artificial neural network and applied to identify and model complex systems gmdh model could be used to model complex systems when there is no prior information muller and ivakhnenko 1996 this method provides more accurate results for low samples and dispersed data than physical models ivakhnenko 1968 although the gmdh model is a powerful tool it needs improvements to increase accuracy the accuracy of the gmdh model directly depends on the estimated parameters the optimization algorithms are appropriate methods for improving the accuracy of the gmdh model the gmdh model is an individual model individual models have advantages and disadvantages however previous studies showed that ensemble models composed of several individual models have better accuracy than individual models therefore the current research aims to develop the gmdh model using optimization algorithms then constructs an ensemble model that involves several optimized gmdh models in order to predict the water footprint of the saffron product saffron is one of the most expensive medicinal plants in the world that is called red gold leone et al 2018 and is used to treat diseases this plant is also used as a flavoring coloring and preservative in the food industry fallahi et al 2018 siddique et al 2020 due to its special morphological characteristics resistance to drought and its dormant phase that does not require irrigation saffron needs little water compared to other crops kafi et al 2006 cardone et al 2020 these characteristics allow the plant to grow in arid and semi arid areas alizadeh et al 2009 agayev et al 2006 saffron is one of the native products of iran the importance of saffron can be evaluated from various aspects such as low water requirement job creation preventing the migration of villagers and the livelihood of more than 4 000 000 people rastegaripour and mohammadi 2018 iran with production of 90 of global saffron has the first rank in terms of cultivated area and production rate in the world baghalian et al 2010 cardone et al 2020 bazrafshan et al 2019b mollafilabi et al 2020 according to the ministry of agricultural jihad reports published in 2019 the production of saffron in iran with a cultivated area of 118 372 ha has been 428 19 tons khorasan razavi with 70 of the saffron production and 77 of the saffron cultivation area has the first rank of saffron production and cultivation area in iran after that khorasan jonoobi and khorasan shomali provinces have the second and third ranks of saffron production in iran respectively maj 2019 this study develops the new and optimized gmdh and ensemble models for predicting bwf and gwl in this regard we applied the optimization algorithms to improve the gmdh model and estimate its parameters salgotra and singh 2019 introduced a new optimization algorithm called naked mole rate algorithm nmra to solve optimization problems the characteristics of this algorithm are high accuracy for solving non linear optimization fast convergence and the ability of training soft computing models this study uses nmra optimization algorithm to train gmdh model and estimating parameters for further investigation we also applied the gmdh ba bat algorithm gmdh pso particle swarm optimization and gmdh sa shark smell algorithm optimization algorithms to predict the wf in the second stage the outputs of the mentioned models are used as the inputs of the imm inclusive multiple model model to predict the wf and evaluate the uncertainty of the model using glue the contributions of current study as follows 1 developing a new ensemble method for predicting of bwf and gwf based on optimized gmdh models 2 this research quantifies the uncertainties of model outputs using a new method 2 material and methods 2 1 case study and data set khorasan region in northeastern iran covering an area 313 335 km2 involves three provinces of khorasan shomali khorasan razavi and khorasan jonoobi that covers about one fifth of the iran land area these provinces with almost 96 of saffron production 269 12 tons are the biggest saffron production areas in iran bazrafshan et al 2019b in this research crop data including cultivation area saffron production and the rate of chemical fertilizer consumption in 38 counties are collected from the ministry of agricultural jihad maj 2021 the meteorological data are taken from the meteorological data source of the iran irimo 2021 in this regard the cultivated area production chemical fertilizer consumption irrigation efficiency cultivation date and soil type of each region were selected to determine the homogeneous agroclimatic points of saffron production in khorasan region in this research fuzzy c mean fcm clustering algorithm was used to determine homogeneous points 2 2 fcm clustering methodology the purpose of clustering is to divide the observations into several categories in which the observations of each category are more similar and closer to each other than the observation of other categories fuzzy c means is one of the clustering algorithms that assign observations to separate clusters with a specific degree of membership in these algorithms an objective function is used as the evaluation index that optimally clusters the existing observations the fuzzy clustering algorithm was firstly proposed by ruspini ruspini 1969 in this method the degree of membership or belonging of each observation to each cluster is determined through the membership matrix u u ij c n u 1 u 2 u n where c is the number of clusters and n represent the number of observations two constrains have been considered in fcm clustering method first no cluster should be null j 1 u u ij 0 i 1 c and second the normalization constrains that states the total degree of membership of each observation in all clusters should be equal one j 1 u u ij 0 j 1 n the fcm algorithm attempts to find partitions sets c fuzzy clusters for an observation group through minimizing the following objective function 1 j f x u f c i 1 c j 1 n u ij m d ij 2 where d ij is the distance between jth observation x j and the center of the ith cluster and m 1 denotes the degree of fuzziness usually m 2 therefore if m tends to one m 1 the clustering becomes the crisp method and if m tends to infinity m the clustering becomes a fuzzy clustering however the j f function cannot be minimized directly and the iterative algorithms must be used to solve this problem the optimal steps are as follows 1 choosing appropriate values for m c and selecting a small positive number for ε we also fill the matrix c the center of the clusters randomly and set the value t 0 2 we calculate the membership matrix at t 0 and then update at t 0 then the membership matrix for fixed value of parameters is optimized as follows 2 u ij t 1 d ij 2 m 1 1 1 c d 1 j 2 m 1 1 1 1 c d 1 j d ij 1 1 m for i 1 c and j 1 n in this equation the degree of membership depends on the distance between an observation with the center of its cluster and the distance with the center of other clusters 3 c i t 1 j 1 n u ij t 1 m x j j 1 n u ij t 1 m for i 1 c 3 in the final step we update the membership matrix using the optimized membership degree the updating equation for the cluster centers depends on several parameters such as the location shape and size of the clusters in addition to the mentioned parameters the method of measuring the distance will be very sensitive 4 repeat steps 2 and 3 until c t 1 c t ε or u t 1 u t ε are established in practice it has been shown that this method does not fall into local optimization the fcm algorithm has been widely used as a clustering method in many studies fig 1 illustrates the three homogenous regions which was determined based on the fcm algorithm and table 1 represents the crop and climatic information of each cluster located in these homogeneous regions in cluster i the climate type is moderate extra arid based on de martonne classification rahimi et al 2013 average temperature is 18 40 degrees celsius average rainfall is 135 9 mm average wind speed is 2 54 m s the

rainfall is 211 09 mm humidity percentage is 43 7 average wind speed is 2 95 m s the sunshine hours is 8 6 and the saffron yield is 3 42 kg ha in cluster iii climate type is cold semi arid average temperature is 15 63 degrees celsius average rainfall is 232 mm average wind speed is 2 90 m s the sunshine hours is 8 2 the average humidity is 49 5 and the saffron yield is 3 67 kg ha 2 3 wf computing in this study the bwf and gwf of the saffron product were calculated using the main framework described by hoekstra and chapagain 2008 in this regards crop evapotranspiration irrigation requirement and effective rainfall were calculated by applying the cropwat model in each plain of the study area the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 has been used to calculate the evapotranspiration and the fao 56 coefficients was considered to calculate crop evapotranspiration for more details one can refer to allen et al 1998 in this study the cropwat tool using the crop coefficients kc proposed by shahidi et al 2020 keykhamoghadam et al 2013 was applied and the etc was calibrated for each saffron cultivation area then the net irrigation requirement was calculated from the difference of evapotranspiration with the effective precipitation the water requirement was also calculated using the irrigation efficiency reported by the ministry of agriculture for each region after determining the variables affecting the product the bwf and gwf were calculated green water is a part of effective rainfall that is consumed by plants in an unsaturated soil environment bazrafshan et al 2019a the green water footprint is computed using the following equation 4 gwf p e 10 y where gwf is green wf in cubic meters per ton p e denotes the total effective rainfall using usda s c method during the plant growth period in millimeters and y is the yield of saffron in ton per hectare blue water involves the underground water and surface runoff from rains and lakes water that collects behind the dams and are used in the irrigation sector bazrafshan et al 2019b the bwf is calculated using the equation 5 b w f e t c p e 10 y where bwf is the blue wf in cubic meters per ton and et c represents the crop evapotranspiration in millimeter 2 4 structure of group method of data handling the group method of data handling gmdh model is a machine learning algorithm proposed

to select the best input scenario introduced in table 2 the rmse criterion based on the gmdh nmra algorithm was considered the lowest rmse indicates the best input the input scenarios for gwf and bwf are displayed in table 2 according to the results the lowest rmse and the best results in all three clusters and both predictive variables belongs to the scenario 13 in which all predictors are included into the model in regards with gwf the highest value of rmse belongs to the scenarios 1 and 12 in which the inputs contain all variables except etc and yield therefore the gwf is highly correlated with etc and yield like the gwf the highest rmse in predicting bwf belongs to the scenarios 1 and 12 whose input involves all variables except the yield and etc further in both cases the lowest rmse produced by a scenario that involves all predictors 3 2 determining the sample size determining the sample size for training and testing parts is very important in modeling in this research the rmse was used to determine the appropriate sample size of the data the best sample size is one that minimizes the rmse in both training and testing steps table 3 represents the error rate rmse versus the sample size for the testing and training stages for bwf and gwf in all three clusters according to the results assigning 70 and 30 of observations respectively to the training and testing sets produced the lowest rmse in all three clusters therefore in order to modeling bwf and gwf in all three clusters observations were separated into 70 and 30 for the training and testing purpose respectively fig 3 3 3 selecting appropriate random parameters fig 4 illustrates the rmse versus different population sizes pop for nmra ba sa and pso algorithms in modeling bwf in all three clusters each algorithm involves various random parameters such that the population size is an important random parameter sensitivity analysis means changing the population size versus the objective function in order to achieve the best population size the objective function in the present study is the rmse and the best population size is one that produces the lowest rmse value the objective function in cluster 1 based on the nmr algorithm and for population sizes pop 50 pop 100 pop 200 pop 250 and pop 300 were 16 55 12 23 14 55 15 and 15 5 respectively therefore the best population size for the nmr algorithm is pop 150 with the value 12 23 of objective function the objective function for ba with respect to pop 50 pop 100 pop 200 pop 250 and pop 300 was 16 12 15 54 14 35 14 78 and 15 23 respectively therefore the best population size for ba is pop 200 that produced the lowest rmse 14 35 further analysis indicated that the nmr algorithm has the best performance in cluster i such that it produced the lowest rmse 12 23 for population size pop 150 in clusters ii and iii the best population size was investigated in different algorithms and the nmra algorithm produced the lowest rmse 12 34 for the population size pop 150 table 3 represents large number of iterations for various algorithms in modeling bwf and gwf in all three clusters since the iteration number is another important parameter in evolutionary algorithms sensitivity analysis is performed to calculate the maximum iteration number in order to achieve the best value of the objective function the parameter of maximum iteration such as the population size is changed the best value of maximum iteration number for each algorithm are provided in table 4 3 4 graphical assessment of model accuracy fig 5

fig 6c fig 6d illustrates the radar plot mae criterion the training mae for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh algorithms were 8 9 11 12 14 and 15 respectively according to all assessment criteria the imm algorithm was the best compared to the alternatives results of this section indicate that the evolutionary algorithms increase the accuracy of the gmdh model the hybrid gmdh models have different accuracies in this regard the nmra algorithm had the best and the pso algorithm had the lowest accuracy than the other optimization algorithms since the imm used the outputs of several individual models it had better accuracy than the individual gmdh models therefore using the imm model has improved the results fig 6 represents the radar plots of fsd fig 6c nse fig 6b pbias fig 6a and mae fig 6d criteria for modeling gwf similarly the results of modeling bwf the imm model produced the lowest error rate than the alternatives in modeling gwf so that the optimized gmdh had better performance than the individual gmdh model scatter plot is a useful tool for evaluating the accuracy of predicted models when the data overlaps the heat scatterplot helps to identify the number of observations in a specific area figs 7 and 8 denote the scatter plot of prediction bwf and gwf in cluster i fig 7 a f represents the scatter plot between predicted and observed bwf the estimated r2 for imm gmdh nmra gmdh sa gmdh ba gmdh pso and gmdh models are 0 99 0 98 0 97 0 97 0 96 and 0 95 respectively therefore based on the r2 criterion the imm model is more accurate than the alternatives fig 9 a f denotes the scatter plot of predicted versus the observed gwf as results show the highest r2 was produced by imm model therefore the imm model has higher accuracy in prediction both variables in cluster i fig 9 represents the barplot of r2 value for predicted gwf and bwf in clusters ii and iii according to the results the imm model produced the highest r2 between the estimated and observed bwf and gwf in both clusters therefore due to the use of the outputs of several individual models the imm has the highest accuracy among the alternatives in all three clusters 3 5 graphical assessment of model performance in order to evaluate the performance of the models the boxplot of the estimated and observed gwf and bwf was used fig 10 compares of the boxplot of the predicted and the observed bwf and gwf for saffron in 3 clusters cluster i in this cluster the imm model performed very well in estimating the dispersion indices of observed gwf including median 799 5 maximum 2567 minimum 51 first quartile 660 and third quantile 1900 compared to the other hybrid models the gmdh nmra also estimated the dispersion indices very well however it ranks after the imm in terms of efficiency as figure shows the median the first and the third quartiles of imm boxplot in estimating bwf are 5500 2400 and 7000 ton m3 respectively which completely closed to the observed values the maximum 11 553 and minimum 840 values of the imm boxplot are also closed to the observed bwf values the other models are highly deviated from the observed bwf dispersion indices cluster ii the estimated median 2300 ton m3 and third quantile 3200 ton m3 of the bwf by the imm model is very closed to the observed values further there is the highest agreement between the first quartile 1225 the minimum 537 and the maximum 5956 of observed bwf and the predicted values by the imm model in addition the imm model has performed very well compared to the other hybrid models in estimating the median 1800 maximum 4067 and minimum 172 of the observed gwf this model also estimated the third quartile 3200 of gwf very accurately cluster iii the imm model has the best performance compared to the alternatives with the most similarity of estimated to the observed bwf and gwf this model also estimated the maximum 5999 and minimum 789 of bwf as well as the maximum 2753 and minimum 123 of gwf very accurately the estimated values by the other hybrid models are significantly deviated from the observed bwf and gwf 3 6 uncertainty analysis caused by the parameters and inputs on estimating wf saffron uncertainty in the modeling process is dependent to the inputs and parameters in the present study the uncertainty caused by the parameters and inputs is analyzed separately figs 11a 11b 11c and 11d illustrate the uncertainty due to the inputs and parameters in predicting bwf and gwf variables more observation points within the confidence region indicate the lower uncertainty also the smaller band of the confidence region represents the lower uncertainty according to figs 11a and 11c the uncertainty caused by the inputs is less than the uncertainty caused by the parameters for instance in predicting gwf the p value due to the inputs and parameters uncertainty is 0 98 and 0 95 respectively fig 11a figs 11b and 11d also indicate that the uncertainty caused by inputs is lower than the uncertainty caused by the parameters for gwf prediction fig 12 displays the uncertainty of the models caused by the parameters and inputs according to the results the imm and the gmdh nmra models have the lowest p 0 98 r 0 08 and the second lowest p 0 97 r 0 09 uncertainties compared to the alternatives further investigation indicated that the uncertainty due to the inputs is lower than the parameters the results also denoted that the optimization algorithms have been effective in reducing the uncertainty of the gmdh model given that the gmdh hybrid models have lower uncertainty than the gmdh model 4 discussion in this research in order to measure the effect of inputs on the predicted values and determining the most effective predictors the rmse was used this method has been widely used by researchers in agro climatological and hydrological studies such as the sediment transfer rate modeling jalil masir et al 2022 groundwater level prediction khozani et al 2022 and daily pan evaporation ehteram et al 2022a 2022b therefore regarding the number of input variables 13 scenarios were considered such that in each one input was eliminated and the influence was measured fig 13 represents the effect of removing each predictor on the output of the gmdh nmr model as result shows removing the etc and yield significantly increases the rmse therefore they are evaluated as the most effective inputs in predicting bwf and gwf according to several studies papadavid and toulios 2018 bazrafshan et al 2019b and fao 33 or 56 or 66 equations allen et al 1998 increasing decreasing evapotranspiration directly affects the yield on the other hand the yield directly was included in gwf in the denominator eq 4 therefore removing these variables causes high sensitivity in model prediction the error rate of removing individual variables is lower in gwf than in bwf this indicates that the correlation between input variables in gwf is higher than in bwf fig 14 compares the performance of models based on the taylor diagram taylor diagram is illustrated in two forms half circle denotes negative and positive correlation and quarter circle denotes positive correlation only in both cases the correlation coefficients are the radius of the circle on its arc the standard deviations are the concentric circles with respect to the center and the rmse values are drawn as concentric circles with respect to the reference point on the horizontal axis the closer the location of the models to the reference point black square on the horizontal axis the better the model performance in order to evaluate the performance of imm the taylor diagram was used as shown for bwf in cluster i the location of imm is between the correlation coefficients 0 99 and 0 97 and the crmse is 2 5 in this regard the best performance among various gmdh models belongs to gmdh nmra whose correlation coefficient is 0 97 and its crmse is 3 results of jalil masir et al 2022 also indicates that the imm performed better than the alternatives due to using the outputs of several optimized models ensemble models combine several individual models which have several advantages abbaszadeh et al 2021 the imm is an ensemble model that applies the advantages of multiple individual models therefore the imm improves the performance of individual models with more flexibility ehteram et al 2022a 2022b the gmdh model with correlation coefficient 0 74 and crmes 9 93 has the worst performance in cluster i the reason for the weak performance of gmdh is the training algorithm gradient algorithm and insufficient accuracy in finding the model parameters ehteram et al 2022a 2022b among gmdh models the gmdh nmra has the best performance in cluster i with correlation coefficient 0 96 and crmes 3 0 the same results are obtained in clusters ii and iii according to ehteram et al 2022a 2022b in the nmr algorithm worker and breeder balances the exploration and exploitation due to their large population size workers perform exploration and breeders use more intensive exploitation than workers since they attempt to improve their compatibility in order to mate with queens the nmra algorithm can achieve better results when workers and breeders update themselves therefore these algorithms produce better solutions such that low quality solutions are removed from optimization as breeders update themselves through the updating of nmr solutions the problem space is investigated accurately the imm also had better performance in predicting gwf than the alternatives the noteworthy point is that all models have better performance in predicting gwf than predicting bwf this issue was held in elimination the less effective variables in selecting best inputs which the main reason was the high correlation between input parameters in gwf compared to bwf further analysis of taylor diagram indicated that although the optimization algorithms increase the accuracy of gmdh however the performance of models are different such that the gmdh ba model has a weaker performance than the other gmdh hybrid models this is due to the more ability of nmra and sa than ba and pso optimization algorithms in finding the absolute optimal answer for prediction models salgotra and singh 2019 5 conclusion increasing population and consequently water demand in the agricultural sector and frequent drought events causes water resources management to be very important prediction water footprint is a key issue in the management of water resources and helps decision makers to have a true understanding of the volume of water consumed by the products therefore prediction water footprints play a significant role in irrigation and agriculture management this study constructed a new ensemble model based on the improved gmdh models and investigated the model uncertainty due to the parameters and inputs and provided important step in predicting bwf and gwf indices various climatic and crop inputs have been used to calculate the saffron bwf and gwf indices in major saffron production areas in iran in this regard the fcm clustering method was used to determine the homogeneous agro climatic of saffron cultivation areas in khorasan region then the most effective predictors in prediction bwf and gwf were selected using the step by step elimination and measuring their effect on gmdh nmra output through 13 scenarios the gmdh model and various optimization algorithms such as nmra sa ba pso have been applied to predict the response variables in the next step the output of individual gmdh was included into the ensemble imm model and the uncertainty analysis of the model parameters and input was performed the present study indicated that applying the imm and the optimized gmdh models improved the accuracy of the outputs imm performed better than the alternatives due to using the outputs of several individual models further analysis demonstrated that the uncertainty caused by the inputs was lower than the uncertainty caused by the model parameters selecting the input variables is one of the important challenges in the present study another feature selection methods such as the gamma test wavelet theory principal component analysis and boruta algorithm can be used to select the best input variables in the future studies in this regard collecting climatic and crop dataset was another limitation in modeling bwf and gwf indices although the imm model may increase the accuracy however collecting suitable dataset for training models is a complicated issue the main finding of this research is that the ensemble models can improve the accuracy of optimized soft computing models there are different ensemble models such as bayesian model averaging bma and copula bayesian averaging model cbma the advantage of imm over bma and cbma is that the model does not have complex computations although the optimization algorithms can enhance the performance of soft computing models the optimized models are outperformed by the new ensemble models this study indicated that the accuracy of models was affected by the uncertainty values the model parameters and input parameters were the important uncertainty resources the optimization algorithms can be used to set the model parameters thus these algorithms can reduce the uncertainty values of models because of model parameters the results of study also indicated that the optimization algorithms provided different accuracies because they used different and advanced operators a robust optimization algorithm can decrease the uncertainty of model parameters the models introduced of the current study can be used for different regions of the world these models can be coupled with climate scenarios to predict gwf and bwf under climate change thus we can use the outputs of climate change models under different scenarios for predicting of gwf and bwf in the future periods selecting best optimization algorithm is another issue of the present study choosing an optimization algorithm with fast convergence and high accuracy is very important since a suitable optimization algorithm can reduce the model uncertainty caused by the parameters measuring the model uncertainty caused by the parameters and inputs is another important result of the present study applying the models of the present study is not limited to predicting bwf and gwf but they could also be used to predict the other hydrological hydroclimatic drought and water resources variables the results of the current research can also be extended in future studies to predict the bwf and gwf in various regions and products further in future studies the other ensemble models such as the bayesian and bayesian copula can be used to improve the results the next studies can use the methods such as gamma test and principal component analysis to choose the best inputs declaration of
