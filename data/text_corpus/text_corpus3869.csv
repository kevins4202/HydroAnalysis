19345,high silica zeolites have been found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of organic micro pollutants omps from impaired water including various pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals etc in this review the properties and fundamentals of high silica zeolites are summarised recent research on mechanisms and efficiencies of omp adsorption by high silica zeolites are reviewed to assess the potential opportunities and challenges for the application of high silica zeolites for omp adsorption in water treatment it is concluded that the adsorption capacities are well related to surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and structural features e g micropore volume and pore size of high silica zeolites as well as the properties of omps by using high silica zeolites the undesired competitive adsorption of background organic matter bom in natural water could potentially be prevented in addition oxidative regeneration could be applied on site to restore the adsorption capacity of zeolites for omps and prevent the toxic residues from re entering the environment keywords high silica zeolites adsorption organic micro pollutants water treatment 1 introduction organic micro pollutants omps have become a worldwide issue of increasing environmental concern petrie et al 2015 schwarzenbach et al 2006 in the aquatic environment including drinking water sources and water bodies omps are widely present at trace concentrations ranging from several ng l 1 to a few μg l 1 gracia lor et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 joss et al 2008 the discharge of omps can be attributed to the diffuse sources of pesticides used in agriculture industrial wastewater effluent municipal wastewater effluent etc eggen et al 2014 gerecke et al 2002 lefebvre and moletta 2006 michael et al 2013 the occurrence of omps does not only raise toxicological concerns in the aquatic environment alan et al 2008 santos et al 2010 but also threatens public health if present in drinking water kolpin et al 2002 pal et al 2010 reemtsma et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2004 adsorption of omps by porous materials typically activated carbon is known as one of the most effective processes for omp removal and is thus widely deployed ahmaruzzaman 2010 alsbaiee et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2007 activated carbon adsorbs a broad spectrum of omps delgado et al 2012 karanfil and kilduff 1999 rossner et al 2009 snyder et al 2007 due to the well developed pore structure large surface area and high degree of surface reactivity dias et al 2007 marsh et al 1997 moreno castilla 2004 however used adsorbents with their resultant toxic residues need to be either decomposed or disposed omorogie et al 2016 to restore the adsorption capacity of used activated carbon and prevent the toxic residues from re entering the environment thermal regeneration of activated carbon has been a common practice during the thermal regeneration process omps that are adsorbed by activated carbon are eliminated by vaporization pyrolysis and gasification sabio et al 2004 suzuki et al 1978 van vliet 1991 nevertheless the regeneration processes considerably influence the pore structure and chemical functional groups in the activated carbon which then deteriorates their omp adsorption performance cooney et al 1983 martin and ng 1984 thermal regeneration of activated carbon could also cause carbon loss of up to 10 in mass hutchins 1973 tipnis and harriott 1986 new activated carbon has to be purchased and added into the process moreover the omp adsorption efficiency of activated carbon might be lowered by the co existence of background organic matter bom with omps which will reduce the operational period between activated carbon regeneration events narbaitz and cen 1997 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 schork and fair 1988 zietzschmann et al 2014 as a feasible alternative zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with orderly distributed and uniformly sized micropores with a pore diameter less than 2 nm li and yu 2014 owing to the featured porous properties and chemical composition table 1 zeolites can act as molecular sieves and catalysts which are used in the fields of air pollution remediation removal of volatile organic compounds gas separation and catalytic conversion of biomass etc alonso et al 2017 ennaert et al 2016 li et al 2017 perego et al 2017 shi et al 2017 sun and wang 2014 zhang et al 2016a based on the unique structural characteristics framework types of zeolites are defined refer to section 2 to date 235 zeolite frameworks have been assigned at the structure commission of the international zeolite association iza sc baerlocher and mccusker 2017 the properties of zeolites vary by the proportion of silica and aluminium content namely the silica to aluminium ratio si al ratio low silica zeolites with a si al ratio less than 2 have excellent ion exchange capacity in the field of water treatment low silica zeolites can therefore be applied for softening wajima 2012 table 1 removal of ammonium burgess et al 2004 farkas et al 2005 kwakye awuah et al 2014 and removal of heavy metals e g zinc cerjan stefanović et al 2007 katsou et al 2010a purna chandra rao et al 2006 nickel álvarez ayuso et al 2003 çoruh and ergun 2009 katsou et al 2010b copper ursini et al 2006 and cadmium terbouche et al 2011 high silica zeolites fig 1 with si al ratios up to several thousands are industrially manufactured by replacing the aluminium contents with silica burton 2018 burton et al 2005 the hydrophobicity of these zeolites provides favourable characteristics for omp adsorption in aqueous solutions maesen 2007 tsitsishvili 1973 currently high silica zeolite powders have been proven to be effective adsorbents for the removal of omps from water including pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial chemicals based on information provided only by batch tests damjanovic et al 2010 rakic et al 2010 rossner et al 2009 however the application of high silica zeolite granules in full scale water treatment has not been realized yet as a type of aluminosilicate crystal zeolites are stable in oxidative conditions which potentially guarantees the regeneration of zeolites by advanced oxidation without compromising their surface properties and pore structure liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 combining zeolite adsorption and oxidation regeneration can restore the adsorption capacity of zeolites in situ and degrade or mineralize omps zhang et al 2016b concentrated toxic residues from the adsorption process will be thus minimized by oxidation therefore effective oxidative regeneration of zeolites without impairing the quality and quantity of adsorbents could be a key advantage over activated carbon as a benchmark technology in this review the literature on high silica zeolites for omp adsorption from water is reviewed including the fundamentals of the zeolite frameworks the physicochemical properties and their relation to omp adsorption the adsorption mechanisms of high silica zeolite powders are elaborated by considering the properties of zeolites and variety of omps examples of the application of high silica zeolite granules are presented finally the potential opportunities and challenges of applying high silica zeolites to water treatment are discussed 2 physicochemical properties of high silica zeolites zeolites have a 3 dimensional structure constructed by to4 tetrahedra where the t atom is either a si4 or al3 atom located in the centre of an oxygen tetrahedron since each al3 atom introduces one negative charge the same number of cations can associate loosely with the tetrahedral coordinated al3 to neutralize the entire framework the ratio of si4 and al3 in the framework known as the silica to alumina ratio is commonly written as either sio2 al2o3 mole ratio or si al mole ratio by different authors in this review the si al ratio is used to describe the hydrophobicity of zeolite surface which is two times of the sio2 al2o3 mole ratio mccusker and baerlocher 2001 the framework of zeolites describes the connectivity of the tetrahedrally coordinated atoms t atoms without reference to elemental composition the framework type exclusively defines the structural properties of zeolites including pore opening cage and channel structure mccusker and baerlocher 2001 the pore opening of zeolites composed by t atoms and the connected oxygen atoms is the entry of a cage or a channel which will decide the entering of omps the pores with more t atoms oxygen atoms have larger sizes the pore opening could be described as an n ring e g 8 10 and 12 rings where n represents the number of t or oxygen atoms see fig 2 the pore space of zeolites is parcelled into cages and or channels cages also called cavities are the polyhedral units in zeolites while channels in zeolites are composed by linked polyhedral units the channels of zeolites vary from straight to sinusoidal forms or from wide to narrow many adsorption related properties of zeolites e g surface area and pore volume are decided by the features of the cages and channels see fig 3 the structural features of high silica zeolites are mostly determined by their framework types a framework type represents a unique structure of channels and cages that will highly affect the adsorption efficiency of omps fau mor mfi and bea types of high silica zeolites were selected for review because they are the most commercially available and have been commonly studied for omp adsorption their structural features are summarised in table 2 all selected framework types contain a high accessible area from 834 to 1220 m2 g 1 in table 2 for the adsorption of both water and organic compounds the framework density is related to the pore volume such that zeolites with a lower framework density have a higher pore volume meier and baerlocher 1999 the pore volume of zeolites would follow the opposite order of framework density namely fau bea mor mfi table 2 the effect of pore volume on omp adsorption will be discussed in section 3 1 the properties of high silica zeolites with the same framework type and si al ratio vary theoretically ideally crystalized zeolites with the same framework type and si al ratio show identical properties however high silica zeolites are synthesised from low silica zeolites by dealuminating which would bring defects to the framework yu et al 2007 therefore the micropore volume of high silica zeolites with the same framework types could vary yonli et al 2012 their actual surface area is usually less than what would be found in the ideal framework dubinin 1967 in addition mesopores in zeolites generated during the dealumination process account for a small portion of the entire surface area of zeolites mainly as external surface area yonli et al 2012 as a result the adsorption efficiency of the same type high silica zeolites is similar but to some extent different due to the variation in properties 3 adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting the adsorption of omps by high silica zeolite powders in aqueous solutions the overall adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolite powders is represented in equation 1 israelachvili 2015 1 w o z w w o z w w w w o w w z w where wij is the work to separate two phases i and j and the subscripts z o and w refer to zeolite omp and water respectively wozw is the work of adhesion of the omp to zeolites in water e g the adsorption energy of the omp by the zeolite in aqueous solution which will decide the adsorption efficiency water cohesion www describes the interaction between water molecules in the discussion water cohesion is regarded as a constant parameter with negligible effect on adsorption efficiency the omp adsorption efficiency by high silica zeolites will depend on the omp zeolite interaction woz zeolite water interactions wzw and omp water interactions wow which will include the effect of structural features surface hydrophobicity and existing adsorption sites of high silica zeolites as well as characteristics of omps 3 1 structural features and framework types of high silica zeolites the adsorption of omps primarily takes place in the micropores of the high silica zeolites in many studies the adsorption saturations were observed and the isotherms were fitted by the langmuir model table 4 which indicate the occurrence of monolayer adsorption in micropores sing 1985 in some cases mesopores could still provide additional accommodation for omps martucci et al 2012 for example when adsorption takes place in the presence of high concentrations of organic solutions g l 1 a strong adsorption driving force at the high equilibrium concentration may lead to pore filling in the mesopores which will increase the adsorption capacity during the pore filling process both adsorption and absorption may occur damjanovic et al 2010 the adsorption capacity of zeolites can thus be well correlated to their microporous volume several studies found that fau and bea zeolites with larger micropore volumes showed a higher adsorption capacity for omps koubaissy et al 2012 reungoat et al 2007 yonli et al 2012 as an example fau zeolite was found to have a higher adsorption capacity for nitrobenzene than bea mfi and mor type zeolites reungoat et al 2007 compared to mfi type zeolites bea also has a higher adsorption capacity for phenol dichlorophenol and nitrobenzene since the bea type framework possesses a higher micropore volume damjanovic et al 2010 koubaissy et al 2008 reungoat et al 2007 the pore opening size of zeolites determines the diffusivity and accessibility of the omps during the adsorption process omps with a molecular size smaller than the pore opening size of zeolites can easily diffuse inside zeolite powders due to negligible steric hindrance roque malherbe et al 1995 rungsirisakun et al 2006 certain omp molecules e g carbamazepine may form molecular chains of enlarged size due to the molecular interactions the molecular chain of carbamazepine could enter the fau zeolite which has a large pore opening size but could not enter the mor and mfi zeolites which have narrow channel openings martucci et al 2012 the adsorption of omps is minimal when the size of omps are larger than the pore opening size of zeolites zeolites would then behave as molecular sieves resulting in the exclusion of omps from the framework of zeolites rouquerol et al 2013 multiple studies showed that omps with environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 were preferably adsorbed by high silica zeolites with pore sizes closely similar to the molecular size of omps so called close fit theory de ridder et al 2012 rossner et al 2009 a common explanation is that the closely fitted pores may lead to strong interactions between omps and high silica zeolites de ridder et al 2012 erdem senatalar et al 2004 rossner et al 2009 giaya and thompson 2002a 2002b also suggested that the structure of water clusters might be disrupted in the well fitted pores which would promote the affinities for omps for example all seven tested n nitrosamine compounds mw 74 158 g mol 1 estimated stokes diameter 2 6 4 0 å with an initial concentration of 15 μg l 1 could not be removed by fau zeolites while mor and mfi with small pore sizes see table 2 removed five n nitrosamines from the seven tested compounds mor and mfi zeolites possessing comparable pore opening and channel sizes as n nitrosamine compounds were thus suitable for their removal at these low concentration ranges de ridder et al 2012 in another study rossner et al 2009 compared the removal of 25 emerging omps mw 151 791 g mol 1 estimated spherical diameter 6 5 9 5 å from lake water with initial concentrations less than 1 μg l 1 by mfi mor and fau zeolites a total of 15 omps were either partially or completely removed by mor zeolites while fau could only remove 3 omps to an acceptable level two types of zeolites with relatively small pore openings mfi zeolites with 10 ring pores and mor zeolites with 12 8 ring pores were proven to be effective for the adsorption of these low molecular weight omps at low concentrations it was found that the molecular size of these omps was similar to the pore opening size or channel size of mfi and mor zeolites 3 2 surface hydrophobicity and si al ratio of high silica zeolites surface hydrophobicity is defined as the absence of strong sorption of polar compounds particularly water olson et al 2000 highly hydrophobic zeolites could prevent water uptake damjanovic et al 2010 de ridder et al 2012 thus the pore blockage by water clusters could be inhibited resulting in more pores of zeolites available for omp diffusion and adsorption de ridder et al 2012 guvenc and ahunbay 2012 the chemical composition of zeolites strongly influences the hydrophobicity and zeolite water interaction bolis et al 2006 proposed that water molecules can interact with al sites of zeolite framework in addition the hydrophobicity can be influenced by a small number of si oh species which are located at the defects in the zeolites since si oh species could adsorb water by forming stable adducts for zeolites with the same framework type the hydrophobicity increases with decreasing aluminium content thus zeolites with higher si al ratios are more hydrophobic chen 1976 eberly et al 1971 nakamoto and takahashi 1982 olson et al 1980 it can be concluded that zeolites with higher si al ratios examples found in table 3 exhibit a higher adsorption capacity than the zeolites of the same framework with a low si al ratio anderson 2000 damjanovic et al 2010 grieco and ramarao 2013 li et al 2003 reungoat et al 2007 yonli et al 2012 in the case of α endosulfan and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate adsorption the zeolites with a higher si al ratio regardless of their slightly lower surface area have a higher adsorption capacity for omps table 3 the adsorption of nicotine using zeolites however is an exception rakic et al 2010 reported a higher adsorption capacity of nicotine on bea zeolite with a lower si al ratio the results were driven by specific adsorption site interactions which will be further explored in section 3 4 when the si al ratio is high enough the hydrophobicity of zeolites is no longer of significant importance because the effect of water competition and water cluster hindering has become negligible gonzalez olmos et al 2013 found that by increasing the si al ratio from 800 to 1366 mfi zeolites did not improve their adsorption capacity of mtbe and even a slight decrease was observed when the surface area of zeolites increased from 265 to 330 m2 g 1 in addition the adsorption capacities for 4 chlorophenol increased by 28 when the si al ratio increased from 504 to 2252 but there was little effect after further increase in the si al ratio shu et al 1997 for nitrobenzene the adsorption capacity of bea and mfi zeolites were also related to its si al ratio for those with a low si al ratio however the adsorption capacity of zeolites became independent of the si al ratio for ratios over 800 in this case reungoat et al 2007 since the hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites is well related to al content the adsorption capacity could be strongly correlated to the al content al khalid et al 2004 which can be expressed by 2 al a l s i a l 100 1 1 s i a l r a t i o 100 for high silica zeolites with the same framework al of high silica zeolites has a negative linear correlation with the adsorption capacity of various omps fig 4 therefore al may serve as an indicator of adsorption capacity in the high si al ratio range in place of si al ratio and al content hydrophobicity index hi was applied to represent hydrophobicity of zeolites by yonli et al 2012 the value of hi could be determined by 3 hi x t o l u e n e x w a t e r where xtoluene represents toluene adsorption capacity g g 1 and xwater represents water adsorption capacity g g 1 for the fau and bea zeolites there was a linear increase of α endosulfan adsorption efficiency with the increase of hi the increased adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolites with the same framework could thus be related to the hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites which in its turn could be predicted by si al ratio al content and hi index however the hydrophobicity of zeolites with different framework types should not be compared only by reference to si al ratio but also by the structural features of the zeolites for example mfi zeolites are more hydrophobic than fau zeolites with the same si al of 80 because the smaller confinement pore space of mfi zeolites disrupts the interactions of water molecules such that water can hardly stay inside the pores damjanovic et al 2010 de ridder et al 2012 giaya and thompson 2002b in this case the adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolites is then better determined by framework type 3 3 characteristics of omps the effects of surface charge and the ionization form of the omps on the adsorption efficiency of high silica zeolites have been studied bautista toledo et al 2005 janos et al 2003 high silica zeolites have a limited number of cations and negative charges around al sites while most of the framework structures remain neutral no ionized sites the preferential adsorption of neutral omp species by high silica zeolites was observed fukahori et al 2011 grieco and ramarao 2013 koubaissy et al 2012 simon et al 2015 tsai et al 2006 for example the neutral aromatic compounds e g nitroaniline and chlorophenol were preferentially adsorbed onto fau zeolite compared to the ionic compounds koubaissy et al 2011 fukahori et al 2011 reported that sulfa drugs in neutral form could be more readily adsorbed onto fau zeolites than those in cationic and anionic forms based on the hydrophobic interactions when omps in anionic forms are dominant under alkaline conditions a reduction of adsorption capacity has been observed chen et al 2015 koubaissy et al 2011 since high silica zeolites employ a large amount of electron rich oxygen sites and very few negative sites repulsion forces between the anionic form of the omps and the zeolite surface arise fukahori et al 2011 koubaissy et al 2011 2012 the removal mechanism of cationic omps by adsorbents has been regarded as ion exchange as high silica zeolites possess few exchangeable ions the removal capacity of cationic omps by high silica zeolites might be less than that of the low silica zeolites e g natural zeolites margeta et al 2013 since the ionization of omps is affected by the relationship between ph value in an aqueous solution and the pka value of omps the ph of the solution should therefore be taken into consideration in the adsorption process previous studies have shown that the decreased interactions between omp and water will enhance omp zeolite interaction and a strong correlation between the adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity of omps has been observed fukahori et al 2011 koubaissy et al 2008 2011 it was found that hydrophilic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and n nitrosomethylethylamine nema were not adsorbed by mfi nor mor zeolites while less hydrophilic n nitrosamines with comparable sizes to ndma and nema were adsorbed to a larger extent de ridder et al 2012 similar results were reported by zhu et al 2001 the interaction between neutral omp molecules and water can be described by the octanol water coefficient kow when the effect of omp charge is considered the interaction could be expressed by the distribution coefficient logd which is calculated from kow pka of omps and ph of the aqueous solution neglecting the interaction between omps and octanol omps with higher kow and logd are more hydrophobic and less soluble in water gschwend 2016 3 4 adsorption forces and possible adsorption sites of high silica zeolites much effort has been dedicated to determining adsorption forces and locations of adsorbed omps which would give further insight into how high silica zeolites interact with omps the adsorption of omps by high silica zeolites is a physical process attributed mainly to van der waals forces blasioli et al 2014 aside from the van der waals forces acid base forces exist between the functional groups of omps and the specific sites of zeolites so called adsorption sites the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites has been indicated from the results of adsorption heats during omp adsorption by high silica zeolites damjanovic et al 2010 rakic et al 2010 from simulation results of a monte carlo study and rietveld s analysis mfi and fer zeolites were proved to employ different types of sites for omps adsorption dejaco et al 2016 two typical adsorption sites of high silica zeolites oxygen and acidic sites have been identified in literature oxygen atoms in the framework of zeolites widely exist as oxygen sites omps with hydrogen on the aromatic ring and amino groups show an acidic character and have an affinity for oxygen sites blasioli et al 2014 koubaissy et al 2011 the results of blasioli et al 2014 indicate that sulfamethoxazole interacts with fau and mor zeolites by weak h bonds a limited number of brønsted and lewis acidic sites in high silica zeolites are known to interact with omps with nucleophilic groups e g sulphur or chlorine atoms bolis et al 2006 damjanovic et al 2010 nikolakis 2005 phung and busca 2015 the specific interaction may lead to chemisorption and higher adsorption energy batonneau gener et al 2010 acidic sites may thus promote the adsorption of certain omps on high silica zeolites rakic et al 2010 reported a higher adsorption capacity of nicotine on bea zeolite with a lower si al ratio and more acidic sites nicotine is an organic base with basic nitrogen atoms acting as an amine de lucas et al 1998 the adsorption mechanism could be explained by the neutralisation of nicotine by the acidic sites on the zeolites 4 potential applications of high silica zeolites for water treatment 4 1 adsorption of omps by high silica zeolites the efficiency of high silica zeolites for omp adsorption and their isotherm fitting constants are summarised in table 4 results are collected from batch scale experiments applying high silica zeolite powders in this section we first discuss the adsorption of specific omps including mtbe nitrosamines phenol and phenolic compounds which were studied at high equilibrium concentrations e g mg l 1 afterwards omp adsorption at environmentally relevant concentrations e g ng l 1 and μg l 1 is discussed in the sub sections omp mixtures and prediction of adsorption on high silica zeolites at environmentally relevant concentrations a few studies on the application of high silica zeolite granules in column scale experiments will be discussed at the end of this section 4 1 1 mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is a widely used fuel additive with a good aqueous solubility 51 000 mg l 1 at 25 c mtbe is frequently found in surface water and groundwater achten et al 2002 squillace et al 1996 various types of zeolites can adsorb mtbe from water e g bea mfi and mor zeolites knappe and campos 2005 li et al 2003 at the equilibrium concentration of 1 mg l 1 mor zeolites with a si al ratio of 180 exhibited an adsorption capacity of 22 mg g 1 while the capacity of carbonaceous resins and activated carbon were 15 6 mg g 1 and 14 0 mg g 1 respectively davis and powers 2000 erdem senatalar et al 2004 melin 1999 bea zeolites had a capacity of 8 mg g 1 and mtbe adsorption was negligible on the fau at the equilibrium concentration of 1 mg l 1 since the pore opening and cage size were much larger than the size of mtbe erdem senatalar et al 2004 high silica zeolites with closely fitted pores for mtbe e g mfi and mor types are more effective adsorbents for mtbe removal than bea and fau zeolites at the equilibrium concentration range 0 1 1000 μg l 1 knappe and campos 2005 4 1 2 nitrosamines nitrosamines are a group of disinfection by products with a molecular weight less than 200 g mol 1 most of them are classified as probable human carcinogens and have been detected in both water sources and drinking water mitch et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 at initial concentrations of 5 mg l 1 the ndma adsorption capacity of mfi zeolites was 0 196 mg g 1 which was 4 7 times greater than the tested fau and mor zeolites he and cheng 2016 mfi and mor zeolites were able to adsorb five species of n nitrosamines namely n nitrosomorpholine nmor n nitrosopiperidine npip n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosodi n propylamine ndpa and n n dibutylnitrosamine ndba at an initial concentration of 15 μg l 1 while activated carbon showed a lower nitrosamine removal de ridder et al 2012 zhu et al 2001 reported that mfi zeolites had an adsorption capacity of 9 2 mg g 1 for ndma and 16 7 mg g 1 for n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr at the equilibrium concentration 480 mg l 1 which was also higher than the capacity of fau zeolites to minimize the formation of n nitrosamines high silica zeolites could also be applied to remove the secondary and tertiary amines which are nitrosamines formation precursors more than 90 of the nitrosamines precursors could be removed by mor zeolites when the dosage of zeolites was 100 mg l 1 in laboratory reagent water to remove n nitrosamine precursors mor zeolites were reported to be more effective than the tested activated carbon wu et al 2015 4 1 3 phenol and phenolic compounds different types of zeolites were applied for adsorption of phenol and phenolic compounds khalid et al 2004 demonstrated that pure silica bea zeolite no al content employed the best performance among all tested zeolites i e mor bea and fau zeolites as well as activated carbons at a phenol equilibrium concentration 1 6 g l 1 the fau zeolites had the fastest kinetics for phenol adsorption among other studied adsorbents activated carbon activated alumina and silica gel roostaei and tezel 2004 from the experimental results of the nitrophenolic compounds adsorption fau type zeolites and pure silica bea zeolites possessed a much higher capacity than mfi the highest capacity for nitrophenolic compounds ortho nitrophenol was 240 mg g 1 at an equilibrium concentration of 50 mg l 1 achieved by fau zeolites koubaissy et al 2008 however zhang et al 2014 studied the adsorption of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp by fau zeolites and found that the adsorption capacity reached 3 06 mg g 1 at an equilibrium concentration of 30 mg l 1 much less than the capacity of granular activated carbon with a capacity of 500 mg g 1 nelson and yang 1995 4 1 4 omp mixtures high silica zeolites were also tested for the adsorption of omp mixtures for example mfi and mor type zeolites were tested for the removal of 16 pharmaceuticals in both demineralised and surface water when the initial concentration of each pharmaceutical was 2 μg l 1 mor zeolites with a si al ratio of 400 either completely or considerably removed 15 species from the mixed solution de ridder et al 2012 rossner et al 2009 investigated the removal of a 25 omp mixture with concentrations between 200 and 900 ng l 1 in lake water by two high silica zeolites i e mor and fau zeolites activated carbon and a carbonaceous resin activated carbon was able to remove most of the tested compounds while only 15 compounds were either completely or partially removed with the mor zeolite and 3 compounds fluoxetine oxybenzone and triclosan with the fau zeolite it was demonstrated that effective adsorbents for the removal of a broad spectrum of omps from water should exhibit heterogeneity in pore size and shape 4 1 5 prediction of adsorption on high silica zeolites at environmentally relevant concentrations the adsorption by high silica zeolites varied with the equilibrium concentration of omps when the concentration of omps in the experiment was high ranges of mg l 1 the adsorption limit could be predicted by the adsorption isotherm models such as langmuir and sips martucci et al 2012 yonli et al 2012 the estimated maximum adsorption capacity of omps by high silica zeolites was then in the range of 16 833 mg g 1 table 4 the adsorption isotherms of omps at environmentally realistic concentration range μg l 1 and ng l 1 follow the freundlich isotherm since no concentration independent plateau is observed from these isotherms the maximum adsorption capacity of zeolites cannot be predicted at these concentrations de ridder et al 2012 gonzalez olmos et al 2013 to compare the adsorption efficiency of omps in various conditions the constants for the freundlich isotherm model were also determined for the high concentration experiments translating them to environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 70 μg l 1 in addition the values of the freundlich isotherm constant kf given with different units were unified since they are unit dependent the recalculated isotherm constants are listed in table 4 including the kf with a unit of μg g 1 l μg 1 n and the n value when n was around 1 the higher adsorption capacity was implied by the higher kf value by referring to the results in table 4 the adsorption isotherms from the one solute solution had in most cases n values of around 1 where the adsorption capacity linearly increased with the increase in equilibrium concentration of omps the n value varied in multi solute solutions with competition adsorption favourable adsorption was indicated by high n value n 1 while the adsorption of omps was unfavoured when n was below 1 freundlich 1906 the recalculated results could be utilized as an overview of omp adsorption efficiency for instance high silica zeolites achieved great adsorption efficiency in the following cases where the k f value exceeded 10 000 μg g 1 l μg 1 n the adsorption of bisphenol a by mor zeolite dimethylamine by mfi zeolite and hydroxycinnamic acids by bea zeolite conversely high silica fau zeolites showed limited adsorption for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp with low value of k f 0 09 μg g 1 l μg 1 n and n 0 43 reference to the recalculated isotherm information can thus guide the selection of suitable high silica zeolites for the adsorption of specific omps at environmentally relevant concentrations moreover high silica zeolites showed possibilities for the adsorption of omps which were hardly adsorbed by activated carbon for example k f for sulfametoxazole adsorption by fau 200 was 423 55 μg g 1 l μg 1 n table 4 n 0 99 fukahori et al 2011 which was much higher than the reported value of k f in literature for powder activated carbon of 1 10 μg g 1 l μg 1 n n 1 nam et al 2014 4 1 6 omp adsorption by high silica zeolite granules in practice adsorbents are frequently used in the form of a column with a packed granular bed in order to eliminate the need for post filtration to remove powder adsorbents the use of columns also allows for easier regeneration the performance of column adsorption can be examined by breakthrough curves which describe the omp concentration in the column effluent changing in time when the adsorbents in the column become saturated a drastic increase of the effluent concentration appears indicating the so called breakthrough high silica mfi zeolite granules with grain sizes 0 5 and 1 0 mm were applied for the adsorption of mtbe rossner and knappe 2008 for mfi zeolite granules co adsorption of bom had a small effect on the mtbe adsorption uptake but a more pronounced effect on mtbe adsorption kinetics the adsorbent usage rate was estimated assuming an influent mtbe concentration of 100 μg l 1 in river water an empty bed contact time ebct of 15min and an effluent mtbe concentration of 10 μg l 1 based on experimental data a coconut shell based gac column was predicted to have a useful life of 33 days while the mfi zeolite column was predicted to have a useful life of 175 days abu lail et al 2010 evaluated the performance of zeolite granules from fau bea mor and mfi types for the removal of mtbe in batch scale experiments compared with other tested zeolite granules mfi zeolite granules si al ratio 280 with the smallest pores had the highest adsorption capacity at an equilibrium concentration range of 0 001 20 mg l 1 in the column scale experiment using a flow rate of 32 5 ml min 1 feeding an mtbe concentration of 50 μg l 1 and an effluent mtbe concentration of 5 μg l 1 mfi zeolite granules granular size 250 425 μm had a later breakthrough than granular activated carbon khalid et al 2004 demonstrated that pure silica bea zeolite no al content granules showed a better adsorption efficiency for phenol than other tested zeolites i e mor bea and fau zeolites and activated carbons in the column scale experiment with an ebct of 1 min and an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 bea zeolite exhibited a breakthrough time 4 5 times longer than granular activated carbon the adsorption competition of aromatic compounds was studied in column scale experiments by koubaissy et al 2011 the equimolar mixture of 2 4 dcp 2 4 dnp and onp ona in distilled water was fed to a column with an ebct of 4 6 7 min and a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the breakthrough curves showed that onp decreased ona adsorption and 2 4 dnp desorbed 2 4 dcp both of which were determined by functional groups 4 2 preventing unfavourable adsorption of background organic matters bom in natural water in practice the omp adsorption performance of adsorbents is affected by bom a mixture of organic molecules that is unique for each water type bom may cover the surface of adsorbents or prevent adsorption of omps e g bom was proven to compete strongly with omps and considerably impair the adsorption capacity of activated carbon de ridder et al 2012 hung and lin 2006 hung et al 2005 however bom competition in natural water was hardly observed during high silica zeolite adsorption of omps such as mtbe abu lail et al 2010 rossner and knappe 2008 sulfonamide antibiotics braschi et al 2010 nitrosamines and various pharmaceuticals de ridder et al 2012 the micropores of zeolites could prevent the entrance of most bom components present in water de ridder et al 2012 ebie et al 2001 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 however slower adsorption kinetics of omps were observed in the presence of bom since bom could block the surface openings and hinder the diffusional paths of omps hung and lin 2006 rossner and knappe 2008 in some cases low molecular weight compounds are also present in natural water as a fraction of bom hem 1959 braschi et al 2016b studied the adsorption efficiency of fau zeolites with a si al ratio of 100 for sulfamethoxazole in the presence of two humic monomers vanillin and caffeic acid with molecular weights of 152 and 180 mol g 1 respectively since humic monomers could enter the pores of zeolites a slightly lower adsorption capacity was observed when sulfamethoxazole was mixed with these humic monomers compared to a single solution meanwhile it was hypothesised that an adduct with sulfamethoxazole and vanillin formed by h bonding could stabilize the adsorbed omps in the pores of high silica zeolites bottero et al 1994 investigated atrazine adsorption by fau and mfi zeolites and observed that atrazine was even better adsorbed in natural water than in pure water this was attributed to the finding that in natural water atrazine has a high affinity for bom compounds e g forming hydroxyaromatics as a result the adsorption of atrazine was enhanced because the hydroxyaromatics were well adsorbed by the zeolites 4 3 possible on site regeneration and recycling of high silica zeolites reuse of adsorbents allows for reduction of both treatment costs and waste generation to regenerate the adsorbents thermal calcination regeneration which employs high temperature is widely used for most adsorbents including activated carbon and zeolites in other cases regeneration using high temperature water is applied to stimulate the desorption of specific strong interactions between zeolites and omps chica et al 2004 2005 garcía and lercher 1992 zhang et al 2008 however energy consumption for the current regeneration approaches is high lee et al 2011 oxidation is another method for the regeneration of high silica zeolites since zeolites are resistant to oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals ozone etc a broad range of omps after accumulating in the micropores of zeolites are found to be oxidised by ozone fenton uv h2o2 and other oxidants sagehashi et al 2005 shahbazi et al 2014 wang et al 2006 2010 by combining high silica zeolite adsorption with oxidation of omps on site regeneration of zeolites could be achieved gonzalez olmos et al 2011 2013 most of these oxidation regeneration processes require a short contact time of less than 30 min while the thermal approaches might take up to several hours fujita et al 2004 sun et al 2010 von gunten 2003 wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 comparably ozonation of activated carbon will change the properties of activated carbon e g surface area pore size distribution and surface functional groups which are well related to the adsorption efficiency chiang et al 2002a 2002b odivan et al 2014 donnet and ehrburger 1970 conducted experiments on the ozonation of activated carbon and reported that at an ozone dosage of 13 mg l 1 for 150 h 66 2 of the activated carbon surface was oxidised to co2 the long term oxidation of activated carbon will thus lead to a high carbon loss different forms of oxidant species may exist in the ozone oxidation process firstly zeolites as catalysts could promote surface reactions between the adsorbed ozone and omps the catalytic ozonation on zeolites then proceeds via direct reaction of molecular ozone with omps ikhlaq et al 2014 second decomposition of ozone molecules may happen at lewis acid sites to generate reactive oxygen species alejandro et al 2014 thus reactive hydroxyl radicals can be generated from ozone decomposition and subsequently react with omps from zeolites legrini et al 1993 leichsenring et al 1996 monneyron et al 2003 reungoat et al 2007 studied the adsorption of nitrobenzene and ozone regeneration of zeolites in a sequential process they found that the initial adsorption capacity of fau zeolites was completely restored by ozone after the adsorption of nitrobenzene the effective adsorption of tcp was maintained for at least 8 cycles of adsorption and regeneration it was also observed that ozonation increased the bet surface area of fau zeolite by over 60 which even enhanced the omp adsorption capacity the changes in bet surface area might be attributed to the additional defects of zeolites generated during the oxidation process which need further investigation however with a further increase in the number of regeneration cycles the ozone regeneration process could lose efficiency the decrease of regeneration efficiency was attributed to the oxidation by products that might accumulate and compete with target omp adsorption it has been confirmed that traces of oxidation by products of toluene such as acetic acid and acetaldehyde were formed and remained adsorbed after the regeneration with ozone alejandro et al 2014 zaitan et al 2016 moreover acid formation during ozonation may have changed the ph of the solution which hindered the decomposition of ozone and the generation of free radicals zhang et al 2014 once hydrogen peroxide is introduced fenton or fenton like systems are developed as an oxidiser for regeneration of high silica zeolites neyens and baeyens 2003 iron either immobilized on the high silica zeolites or dissolved into the solution will catalyse the oxidation process gonzalez olmos et al 2013 shahbazi et al 2014 hydroxyl radicals could be generated to decompose the omps adsorbed on the zeolites gonzalez olmos et al 2013 wang et al 2006 cihanoglu et al 2015 found that the catalytic activities of mfi zeolites increased with iron loading in addition koryabkina et al 2007 applied fe coated fau zeolites for adsorption of disinfection by products chloroform and trichloroacetic acid eight regeneration cycles could be achieved although the adsorption capacity after regeneration decreased because of iron leaching however the regeneration efficiency by both ozone and hydrogen peroxide could be affected by the properties of the zeolites braschi et al 2016a found that adsorbed sulfonamide antibiotics were only partially oxidised suspecting that the diffusion of radical oxygenated species e g hydroxyl radicals in the pores of zeolites was insufficient although the number of brønsted acid sites was found to have a positive relation with the catalytic ability of the tested mfi zeolites cihanoglu et al 2015 moreover the ozonation regeneration efficiency was related to the amount of acid sites as an example a natural zeolite with a si al ratio of 11 which contains a greater number of brønsted acid sites than zeolites with higher si al ratios had a 2 3 times higher activity of hydrogen peroxide decomposition than bea zeolites with a si al ratio of 400 however the regeneration efficiency of the bea zeolites was 2 5 higher than the natural zeolite since more omps were adsorbed by bea zeolites than by the natural zeolite shahbazi et al 2014 tio2 immobilized high silica zeolites combined with uv light was also studied and found to be an effective photo catalytic oxidation process to regenerate zeolites fukahori and fujiwara 2014 mendez arriaga and almanza 2014 neppolian et al 2016 pan et al 2014 perisic et al 2016 wang et al 2010 active free radicals were generated and therefore a fast omp degradation rate was achieved hoffmann et al 1995 due to the limited research on the photo catalytic oxidation process for zeolite regeneration it is yet unclear what will be the long term performance with increasing regeneration cycles plasma technology has recently been proposed as a promising advanced oxidation method since it is able to produce a wide range of reactive species including electrons photons free radicals ions and reactive molecules such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide as such it can be used to decompose organic matters in a gaseous or liquid phase as well as for surface treatment of materials plasma can be generated by a variety of electrical discharges and several lab scale designs of electrical discharge reactors appear to be effective for contaminant degradation in water or wastewater miklos et al 2018 vanraes 2016 kušić et al 2005 and peternel et al 2006 have reported the application of plasma treatment with high voltage electrical discharge reactors using mfi and fau zeolites for degradation of omps i e phenol and dyes in water the oxygen hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals as well as ozone generated from the reactor could promote omp degradation the combination of plasma oxidation and high silica zeolites can potentially be a promising approach for zeolite regeneration however to the authors knowledge no study has been carried out to demonstrate the system s efficiency of regeneration the influence of solution chemistry and plasma reactivity inside the zeolite pores on the regeneration efficiency in addition to the scaling up of the electrical discharge reactors are future research topics worth investigation 5 concluding remarks and prospects the research on omp adsorption by high silica zeolites has been reviewed and the following conclusions can be drawn high silica zeolites have exhibited a good ability to remove target omps from water e g small sized and polar omps that are not effectively removed by other adsorbents a wide range of studies could be found on omp adsorption efficiencies and mechanisms of high silica zeolite powders which were mostly carried out in batch tests high microporous volume closely fitted pores and hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites could promote omp adsorption bom in natural water has a minimal effect on the adsorption capacity of omps onto high silica zeolites which is considered to be an advantage for the application of high silica zeolites in water treatment however small molecules with a similar size relative to omps might be present in water and compete with omp adsorption oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide fenton photo catalytic oxidation and plasma have shown to be effective during the regeneration of high silica zeolites structural modification of high silica zeolites e g the possible generation of additional surface defects by the oxidation needs further investigation acknowledgements this work is financed by the tki project zeotreat 2014tud001 nan jiang acknowledges the china scholarship council for her phd

19345,high silica zeolites have been found to be effective adsorbents for the removal of organic micro pollutants omps from impaired water including various pharmaceuticals personal care products industrial chemicals etc in this review the properties and fundamentals of high silica zeolites are summarised recent research on mechanisms and efficiencies of omp adsorption by high silica zeolites are reviewed to assess the potential opportunities and challenges for the application of high silica zeolites for omp adsorption in water treatment it is concluded that the adsorption capacities are well related to surface hydrophobicity hydrophilicity and structural features e g micropore volume and pore size of high silica zeolites as well as the properties of omps by using high silica zeolites the undesired competitive adsorption of background organic matter bom in natural water could potentially be prevented in addition oxidative regeneration could be applied on site to restore the adsorption capacity of zeolites for omps and prevent the toxic residues from re entering the environment keywords high silica zeolites adsorption organic micro pollutants water treatment 1 introduction organic micro pollutants omps have become a worldwide issue of increasing environmental concern petrie et al 2015 schwarzenbach et al 2006 in the aquatic environment including drinking water sources and water bodies omps are widely present at trace concentrations ranging from several ng l 1 to a few μg l 1 gracia lor et al 2011 hughes et al 2013 joss et al 2008 the discharge of omps can be attributed to the diffuse sources of pesticides used in agriculture industrial wastewater effluent municipal wastewater effluent etc eggen et al 2014 gerecke et al 2002 lefebvre and moletta 2006 michael et al 2013 the occurrence of omps does not only raise toxicological concerns in the aquatic environment alan et al 2008 santos et al 2010 but also threatens public health if present in drinking water kolpin et al 2002 pal et al 2010 reemtsma et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2004 adsorption of omps by porous materials typically activated carbon is known as one of the most effective processes for omp removal and is thus widely deployed ahmaruzzaman 2010 alsbaiee et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2007 activated carbon adsorbs a broad spectrum of omps delgado et al 2012 karanfil and kilduff 1999 rossner et al 2009 snyder et al 2007 due to the well developed pore structure large surface area and high degree of surface reactivity dias et al 2007 marsh et al 1997 moreno castilla 2004 however used adsorbents with their resultant toxic residues need to be either decomposed or disposed omorogie et al 2016 to restore the adsorption capacity of used activated carbon and prevent the toxic residues from re entering the environment thermal regeneration of activated carbon has been a common practice during the thermal regeneration process omps that are adsorbed by activated carbon are eliminated by vaporization pyrolysis and gasification sabio et al 2004 suzuki et al 1978 van vliet 1991 nevertheless the regeneration processes considerably influence the pore structure and chemical functional groups in the activated carbon which then deteriorates their omp adsorption performance cooney et al 1983 martin and ng 1984 thermal regeneration of activated carbon could also cause carbon loss of up to 10 in mass hutchins 1973 tipnis and harriott 1986 new activated carbon has to be purchased and added into the process moreover the omp adsorption efficiency of activated carbon might be lowered by the co existence of background organic matter bom with omps which will reduce the operational period between activated carbon regeneration events narbaitz and cen 1997 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 schork and fair 1988 zietzschmann et al 2014 as a feasible alternative zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with orderly distributed and uniformly sized micropores with a pore diameter less than 2 nm li and yu 2014 owing to the featured porous properties and chemical composition table 1 zeolites can act as molecular sieves and catalysts which are used in the fields of air pollution remediation removal of volatile organic compounds gas separation and catalytic conversion of biomass etc alonso et al 2017 ennaert et al 2016 li et al 2017 perego et al 2017 shi et al 2017 sun and wang 2014 zhang et al 2016a based on the unique structural characteristics framework types of zeolites are defined refer to section 2 to date 235 zeolite frameworks have been assigned at the structure commission of the international zeolite association iza sc baerlocher and mccusker 2017 the properties of zeolites vary by the proportion of silica and aluminium content namely the silica to aluminium ratio si al ratio low silica zeolites with a si al ratio less than 2 have excellent ion exchange capacity in the field of water treatment low silica zeolites can therefore be applied for softening wajima 2012 table 1 removal of ammonium burgess et al 2004 farkas et al 2005 kwakye awuah et al 2014 and removal of heavy metals e g zinc cerjan stefanović et al 2007 katsou et al 2010a purna chandra rao et al 2006 nickel álvarez ayuso et al 2003 çoruh and ergun 2009 katsou et al 2010b copper ursini et al 2006 and cadmium terbouche et al 2011 high silica zeolites fig 1 with si al ratios up to several thousands are industrially manufactured by replacing the aluminium contents with silica burton 2018 burton et al 2005 the hydrophobicity of these zeolites provides favourable characteristics for omp adsorption in aqueous solutions maesen 2007 tsitsishvili 1973 currently high silica zeolite powders have been proven to be effective adsorbents for the removal of omps from water including pharmaceuticals personal care products and industrial chemicals based on information provided only by batch tests damjanovic et al 2010 rakic et al 2010 rossner et al 2009 however the application of high silica zeolite granules in full scale water treatment has not been realized yet as a type of aluminosilicate crystal zeolites are stable in oxidative conditions which potentially guarantees the regeneration of zeolites by advanced oxidation without compromising their surface properties and pore structure liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 combining zeolite adsorption and oxidation regeneration can restore the adsorption capacity of zeolites in situ and degrade or mineralize omps zhang et al 2016b concentrated toxic residues from the adsorption process will be thus minimized by oxidation therefore effective oxidative regeneration of zeolites without impairing the quality and quantity of adsorbents could be a key advantage over activated carbon as a benchmark technology in this review the literature on high silica zeolites for omp adsorption from water is reviewed including the fundamentals of the zeolite frameworks the physicochemical properties and their relation to omp adsorption the adsorption mechanisms of high silica zeolite powders are elaborated by considering the properties of zeolites and variety of omps examples of the application of high silica zeolite granules are presented finally the potential opportunities and challenges of applying high silica zeolites to water treatment are discussed 2 physicochemical properties of high silica zeolites zeolites have a 3 dimensional structure constructed by to4 tetrahedra where the t atom is either a si4 or al3 atom located in the centre of an oxygen tetrahedron since each al3 atom introduces one negative charge the same number of cations can associate loosely with the tetrahedral coordinated al3 to neutralize the entire framework the ratio of si4 and al3 in the framework known as the silica to alumina ratio is commonly written as either sio2 al2o3 mole ratio or si al mole ratio by different authors in this review the si al ratio is used to describe the hydrophobicity of zeolite surface which is two times of the sio2 al2o3 mole ratio mccusker and baerlocher 2001 the framework of zeolites describes the connectivity of the tetrahedrally coordinated atoms t atoms without reference to elemental composition the framework type exclusively defines the structural properties of zeolites including pore opening cage and channel structure mccusker and baerlocher 2001 the pore opening of zeolites composed by t atoms and the connected oxygen atoms is the entry of a cage or a channel which will decide the entering of omps the pores with more t atoms oxygen atoms have larger sizes the pore opening could be described as an n ring e g 8 10 and 12 rings where n represents the number of t or oxygen atoms see fig 2 the pore space of zeolites is parcelled into cages and or channels cages also called cavities are the polyhedral units in zeolites while channels in zeolites are composed by linked polyhedral units the channels of zeolites vary from straight to sinusoidal forms or from wide to narrow many adsorption related properties of zeolites e g surface area and pore volume are decided by the features of the cages and channels see fig 3 the structural features of high silica zeolites are mostly determined by their framework types a framework type represents a unique structure of channels and cages that will highly affect the adsorption efficiency of omps fau mor mfi and bea types of high silica zeolites were selected for review because they are the most commercially available and have been commonly studied for omp adsorption their structural features are summarised in table 2 all selected framework types contain a high accessible area from 834 to 1220 m2 g 1 in table 2 for the adsorption of both water and organic compounds the framework density is related to the pore volume such that zeolites with a lower framework density have a higher pore volume meier and baerlocher 1999 the pore volume of zeolites would follow the opposite order of framework density namely fau bea mor mfi table 2 the effect of pore volume on omp adsorption will be discussed in section 3 1 the properties of high silica zeolites with the same framework type and si al ratio vary theoretically ideally crystalized zeolites with the same framework type and si al ratio show identical properties however high silica zeolites are synthesised from low silica zeolites by dealuminating which would bring defects to the framework yu et al 2007 therefore the micropore volume of high silica zeolites with the same framework types could vary yonli et al 2012 their actual surface area is usually less than what would be found in the ideal framework dubinin 1967 in addition mesopores in zeolites generated during the dealumination process account for a small portion of the entire surface area of zeolites mainly as external surface area yonli et al 2012 as a result the adsorption efficiency of the same type high silica zeolites is similar but to some extent different due to the variation in properties 3 adsorption mechanisms and factors affecting the adsorption of omps by high silica zeolite powders in aqueous solutions the overall adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolite powders is represented in equation 1 israelachvili 2015 1 w o z w w o z w w w w o w w z w where wij is the work to separate two phases i and j and the subscripts z o and w refer to zeolite omp and water respectively wozw is the work of adhesion of the omp to zeolites in water e g the adsorption energy of the omp by the zeolite in aqueous solution which will decide the adsorption efficiency water cohesion www describes the interaction between water molecules in the discussion water cohesion is regarded as a constant parameter with negligible effect on adsorption efficiency the omp adsorption efficiency by high silica zeolites will depend on the omp zeolite interaction woz zeolite water interactions wzw and omp water interactions wow which will include the effect of structural features surface hydrophobicity and existing adsorption sites of high silica zeolites as well as characteristics of omps 3 1 structural features and framework types of high silica zeolites the adsorption of omps primarily takes place in the micropores of the high silica zeolites in many studies the adsorption saturations were observed and the isotherms were fitted by the langmuir model table 4 which indicate the occurrence of monolayer adsorption in micropores sing 1985 in some cases mesopores could still provide additional accommodation for omps martucci et al 2012 for example when adsorption takes place in the presence of high concentrations of organic solutions g l 1 a strong adsorption driving force at the high equilibrium concentration may lead to pore filling in the mesopores which will increase the adsorption capacity during the pore filling process both adsorption and absorption may occur damjanovic et al 2010 the adsorption capacity of zeolites can thus be well correlated to their microporous volume several studies found that fau and bea zeolites with larger micropore volumes showed a higher adsorption capacity for omps koubaissy et al 2012 reungoat et al 2007 yonli et al 2012 as an example fau zeolite was found to have a higher adsorption capacity for nitrobenzene than bea mfi and mor type zeolites reungoat et al 2007 compared to mfi type zeolites bea also has a higher adsorption capacity for phenol dichlorophenol and nitrobenzene since the bea type framework possesses a higher micropore volume damjanovic et al 2010 koubaissy et al 2008 reungoat et al 2007 the pore opening size of zeolites determines the diffusivity and accessibility of the omps during the adsorption process omps with a molecular size smaller than the pore opening size of zeolites can easily diffuse inside zeolite powders due to negligible steric hindrance roque malherbe et al 1995 rungsirisakun et al 2006 certain omp molecules e g carbamazepine may form molecular chains of enlarged size due to the molecular interactions the molecular chain of carbamazepine could enter the fau zeolite which has a large pore opening size but could not enter the mor and mfi zeolites which have narrow channel openings martucci et al 2012 the adsorption of omps is minimal when the size of omps are larger than the pore opening size of zeolites zeolites would then behave as molecular sieves resulting in the exclusion of omps from the framework of zeolites rouquerol et al 2013 multiple studies showed that omps with environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 were preferably adsorbed by high silica zeolites with pore sizes closely similar to the molecular size of omps so called close fit theory de ridder et al 2012 rossner et al 2009 a common explanation is that the closely fitted pores may lead to strong interactions between omps and high silica zeolites de ridder et al 2012 erdem senatalar et al 2004 rossner et al 2009 giaya and thompson 2002a 2002b also suggested that the structure of water clusters might be disrupted in the well fitted pores which would promote the affinities for omps for example all seven tested n nitrosamine compounds mw 74 158 g mol 1 estimated stokes diameter 2 6 4 0 å with an initial concentration of 15 μg l 1 could not be removed by fau zeolites while mor and mfi with small pore sizes see table 2 removed five n nitrosamines from the seven tested compounds mor and mfi zeolites possessing comparable pore opening and channel sizes as n nitrosamine compounds were thus suitable for their removal at these low concentration ranges de ridder et al 2012 in another study rossner et al 2009 compared the removal of 25 emerging omps mw 151 791 g mol 1 estimated spherical diameter 6 5 9 5 å from lake water with initial concentrations less than 1 μg l 1 by mfi mor and fau zeolites a total of 15 omps were either partially or completely removed by mor zeolites while fau could only remove 3 omps to an acceptable level two types of zeolites with relatively small pore openings mfi zeolites with 10 ring pores and mor zeolites with 12 8 ring pores were proven to be effective for the adsorption of these low molecular weight omps at low concentrations it was found that the molecular size of these omps was similar to the pore opening size or channel size of mfi and mor zeolites 3 2 surface hydrophobicity and si al ratio of high silica zeolites surface hydrophobicity is defined as the absence of strong sorption of polar compounds particularly water olson et al 2000 highly hydrophobic zeolites could prevent water uptake damjanovic et al 2010 de ridder et al 2012 thus the pore blockage by water clusters could be inhibited resulting in more pores of zeolites available for omp diffusion and adsorption de ridder et al 2012 guvenc and ahunbay 2012 the chemical composition of zeolites strongly influences the hydrophobicity and zeolite water interaction bolis et al 2006 proposed that water molecules can interact with al sites of zeolite framework in addition the hydrophobicity can be influenced by a small number of si oh species which are located at the defects in the zeolites since si oh species could adsorb water by forming stable adducts for zeolites with the same framework type the hydrophobicity increases with decreasing aluminium content thus zeolites with higher si al ratios are more hydrophobic chen 1976 eberly et al 1971 nakamoto and takahashi 1982 olson et al 1980 it can be concluded that zeolites with higher si al ratios examples found in table 3 exhibit a higher adsorption capacity than the zeolites of the same framework with a low si al ratio anderson 2000 damjanovic et al 2010 grieco and ramarao 2013 li et al 2003 reungoat et al 2007 yonli et al 2012 in the case of α endosulfan and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate adsorption the zeolites with a higher si al ratio regardless of their slightly lower surface area have a higher adsorption capacity for omps table 3 the adsorption of nicotine using zeolites however is an exception rakic et al 2010 reported a higher adsorption capacity of nicotine on bea zeolite with a lower si al ratio the results were driven by specific adsorption site interactions which will be further explored in section 3 4 when the si al ratio is high enough the hydrophobicity of zeolites is no longer of significant importance because the effect of water competition and water cluster hindering has become negligible gonzalez olmos et al 2013 found that by increasing the si al ratio from 800 to 1366 mfi zeolites did not improve their adsorption capacity of mtbe and even a slight decrease was observed when the surface area of zeolites increased from 265 to 330 m2 g 1 in addition the adsorption capacities for 4 chlorophenol increased by 28 when the si al ratio increased from 504 to 2252 but there was little effect after further increase in the si al ratio shu et al 1997 for nitrobenzene the adsorption capacity of bea and mfi zeolites were also related to its si al ratio for those with a low si al ratio however the adsorption capacity of zeolites became independent of the si al ratio for ratios over 800 in this case reungoat et al 2007 since the hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites is well related to al content the adsorption capacity could be strongly correlated to the al content al khalid et al 2004 which can be expressed by 2 al a l s i a l 100 1 1 s i a l r a t i o 100 for high silica zeolites with the same framework al of high silica zeolites has a negative linear correlation with the adsorption capacity of various omps fig 4 therefore al may serve as an indicator of adsorption capacity in the high si al ratio range in place of si al ratio and al content hydrophobicity index hi was applied to represent hydrophobicity of zeolites by yonli et al 2012 the value of hi could be determined by 3 hi x t o l u e n e x w a t e r where xtoluene represents toluene adsorption capacity g g 1 and xwater represents water adsorption capacity g g 1 for the fau and bea zeolites there was a linear increase of α endosulfan adsorption efficiency with the increase of hi the increased adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolites with the same framework could thus be related to the hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites which in its turn could be predicted by si al ratio al content and hi index however the hydrophobicity of zeolites with different framework types should not be compared only by reference to si al ratio but also by the structural features of the zeolites for example mfi zeolites are more hydrophobic than fau zeolites with the same si al of 80 because the smaller confinement pore space of mfi zeolites disrupts the interactions of water molecules such that water can hardly stay inside the pores damjanovic et al 2010 de ridder et al 2012 giaya and thompson 2002b in this case the adsorption efficiency of omps by high silica zeolites is then better determined by framework type 3 3 characteristics of omps the effects of surface charge and the ionization form of the omps on the adsorption efficiency of high silica zeolites have been studied bautista toledo et al 2005 janos et al 2003 high silica zeolites have a limited number of cations and negative charges around al sites while most of the framework structures remain neutral no ionized sites the preferential adsorption of neutral omp species by high silica zeolites was observed fukahori et al 2011 grieco and ramarao 2013 koubaissy et al 2012 simon et al 2015 tsai et al 2006 for example the neutral aromatic compounds e g nitroaniline and chlorophenol were preferentially adsorbed onto fau zeolite compared to the ionic compounds koubaissy et al 2011 fukahori et al 2011 reported that sulfa drugs in neutral form could be more readily adsorbed onto fau zeolites than those in cationic and anionic forms based on the hydrophobic interactions when omps in anionic forms are dominant under alkaline conditions a reduction of adsorption capacity has been observed chen et al 2015 koubaissy et al 2011 since high silica zeolites employ a large amount of electron rich oxygen sites and very few negative sites repulsion forces between the anionic form of the omps and the zeolite surface arise fukahori et al 2011 koubaissy et al 2011 2012 the removal mechanism of cationic omps by adsorbents has been regarded as ion exchange as high silica zeolites possess few exchangeable ions the removal capacity of cationic omps by high silica zeolites might be less than that of the low silica zeolites e g natural zeolites margeta et al 2013 since the ionization of omps is affected by the relationship between ph value in an aqueous solution and the pka value of omps the ph of the solution should therefore be taken into consideration in the adsorption process previous studies have shown that the decreased interactions between omp and water will enhance omp zeolite interaction and a strong correlation between the adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity of omps has been observed fukahori et al 2011 koubaissy et al 2008 2011 it was found that hydrophilic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and n nitrosomethylethylamine nema were not adsorbed by mfi nor mor zeolites while less hydrophilic n nitrosamines with comparable sizes to ndma and nema were adsorbed to a larger extent de ridder et al 2012 similar results were reported by zhu et al 2001 the interaction between neutral omp molecules and water can be described by the octanol water coefficient kow when the effect of omp charge is considered the interaction could be expressed by the distribution coefficient logd which is calculated from kow pka of omps and ph of the aqueous solution neglecting the interaction between omps and octanol omps with higher kow and logd are more hydrophobic and less soluble in water gschwend 2016 3 4 adsorption forces and possible adsorption sites of high silica zeolites much effort has been dedicated to determining adsorption forces and locations of adsorbed omps which would give further insight into how high silica zeolites interact with omps the adsorption of omps by high silica zeolites is a physical process attributed mainly to van der waals forces blasioli et al 2014 aside from the van der waals forces acid base forces exist between the functional groups of omps and the specific sites of zeolites so called adsorption sites the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites has been indicated from the results of adsorption heats during omp adsorption by high silica zeolites damjanovic et al 2010 rakic et al 2010 from simulation results of a monte carlo study and rietveld s analysis mfi and fer zeolites were proved to employ different types of sites for omps adsorption dejaco et al 2016 two typical adsorption sites of high silica zeolites oxygen and acidic sites have been identified in literature oxygen atoms in the framework of zeolites widely exist as oxygen sites omps with hydrogen on the aromatic ring and amino groups show an acidic character and have an affinity for oxygen sites blasioli et al 2014 koubaissy et al 2011 the results of blasioli et al 2014 indicate that sulfamethoxazole interacts with fau and mor zeolites by weak h bonds a limited number of brønsted and lewis acidic sites in high silica zeolites are known to interact with omps with nucleophilic groups e g sulphur or chlorine atoms bolis et al 2006 damjanovic et al 2010 nikolakis 2005 phung and busca 2015 the specific interaction may lead to chemisorption and higher adsorption energy batonneau gener et al 2010 acidic sites may thus promote the adsorption of certain omps on high silica zeolites rakic et al 2010 reported a higher adsorption capacity of nicotine on bea zeolite with a lower si al ratio and more acidic sites nicotine is an organic base with basic nitrogen atoms acting as an amine de lucas et al 1998 the adsorption mechanism could be explained by the neutralisation of nicotine by the acidic sites on the zeolites 4 potential applications of high silica zeolites for water treatment 4 1 adsorption of omps by high silica zeolites the efficiency of high silica zeolites for omp adsorption and their isotherm fitting constants are summarised in table 4 results are collected from batch scale experiments applying high silica zeolite powders in this section we first discuss the adsorption of specific omps including mtbe nitrosamines phenol and phenolic compounds which were studied at high equilibrium concentrations e g mg l 1 afterwards omp adsorption at environmentally relevant concentrations e g ng l 1 and μg l 1 is discussed in the sub sections omp mixtures and prediction of adsorption on high silica zeolites at environmentally relevant concentrations a few studies on the application of high silica zeolite granules in column scale experiments will be discussed at the end of this section 4 1 1 mtbe methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe is a widely used fuel additive with a good aqueous solubility 51 000 mg l 1 at 25 c mtbe is frequently found in surface water and groundwater achten et al 2002 squillace et al 1996 various types of zeolites can adsorb mtbe from water e g bea mfi and mor zeolites knappe and campos 2005 li et al 2003 at the equilibrium concentration of 1 mg l 1 mor zeolites with a si al ratio of 180 exhibited an adsorption capacity of 22 mg g 1 while the capacity of carbonaceous resins and activated carbon were 15 6 mg g 1 and 14 0 mg g 1 respectively davis and powers 2000 erdem senatalar et al 2004 melin 1999 bea zeolites had a capacity of 8 mg g 1 and mtbe adsorption was negligible on the fau at the equilibrium concentration of 1 mg l 1 since the pore opening and cage size were much larger than the size of mtbe erdem senatalar et al 2004 high silica zeolites with closely fitted pores for mtbe e g mfi and mor types are more effective adsorbents for mtbe removal than bea and fau zeolites at the equilibrium concentration range 0 1 1000 μg l 1 knappe and campos 2005 4 1 2 nitrosamines nitrosamines are a group of disinfection by products with a molecular weight less than 200 g mol 1 most of them are classified as probable human carcinogens and have been detected in both water sources and drinking water mitch et al 2003 zhao et al 2008 at initial concentrations of 5 mg l 1 the ndma adsorption capacity of mfi zeolites was 0 196 mg g 1 which was 4 7 times greater than the tested fau and mor zeolites he and cheng 2016 mfi and mor zeolites were able to adsorb five species of n nitrosamines namely n nitrosomorpholine nmor n nitrosopiperidine npip n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrosodi n propylamine ndpa and n n dibutylnitrosamine ndba at an initial concentration of 15 μg l 1 while activated carbon showed a lower nitrosamine removal de ridder et al 2012 zhu et al 2001 reported that mfi zeolites had an adsorption capacity of 9 2 mg g 1 for ndma and 16 7 mg g 1 for n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr at the equilibrium concentration 480 mg l 1 which was also higher than the capacity of fau zeolites to minimize the formation of n nitrosamines high silica zeolites could also be applied to remove the secondary and tertiary amines which are nitrosamines formation precursors more than 90 of the nitrosamines precursors could be removed by mor zeolites when the dosage of zeolites was 100 mg l 1 in laboratory reagent water to remove n nitrosamine precursors mor zeolites were reported to be more effective than the tested activated carbon wu et al 2015 4 1 3 phenol and phenolic compounds different types of zeolites were applied for adsorption of phenol and phenolic compounds khalid et al 2004 demonstrated that pure silica bea zeolite no al content employed the best performance among all tested zeolites i e mor bea and fau zeolites as well as activated carbons at a phenol equilibrium concentration 1 6 g l 1 the fau zeolites had the fastest kinetics for phenol adsorption among other studied adsorbents activated carbon activated alumina and silica gel roostaei and tezel 2004 from the experimental results of the nitrophenolic compounds adsorption fau type zeolites and pure silica bea zeolites possessed a much higher capacity than mfi the highest capacity for nitrophenolic compounds ortho nitrophenol was 240 mg g 1 at an equilibrium concentration of 50 mg l 1 achieved by fau zeolites koubaissy et al 2008 however zhang et al 2014 studied the adsorption of 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp by fau zeolites and found that the adsorption capacity reached 3 06 mg g 1 at an equilibrium concentration of 30 mg l 1 much less than the capacity of granular activated carbon with a capacity of 500 mg g 1 nelson and yang 1995 4 1 4 omp mixtures high silica zeolites were also tested for the adsorption of omp mixtures for example mfi and mor type zeolites were tested for the removal of 16 pharmaceuticals in both demineralised and surface water when the initial concentration of each pharmaceutical was 2 μg l 1 mor zeolites with a si al ratio of 400 either completely or considerably removed 15 species from the mixed solution de ridder et al 2012 rossner et al 2009 investigated the removal of a 25 omp mixture with concentrations between 200 and 900 ng l 1 in lake water by two high silica zeolites i e mor and fau zeolites activated carbon and a carbonaceous resin activated carbon was able to remove most of the tested compounds while only 15 compounds were either completely or partially removed with the mor zeolite and 3 compounds fluoxetine oxybenzone and triclosan with the fau zeolite it was demonstrated that effective adsorbents for the removal of a broad spectrum of omps from water should exhibit heterogeneity in pore size and shape 4 1 5 prediction of adsorption on high silica zeolites at environmentally relevant concentrations the adsorption by high silica zeolites varied with the equilibrium concentration of omps when the concentration of omps in the experiment was high ranges of mg l 1 the adsorption limit could be predicted by the adsorption isotherm models such as langmuir and sips martucci et al 2012 yonli et al 2012 the estimated maximum adsorption capacity of omps by high silica zeolites was then in the range of 16 833 mg g 1 table 4 the adsorption isotherms of omps at environmentally realistic concentration range μg l 1 and ng l 1 follow the freundlich isotherm since no concentration independent plateau is observed from these isotherms the maximum adsorption capacity of zeolites cannot be predicted at these concentrations de ridder et al 2012 gonzalez olmos et al 2013 to compare the adsorption efficiency of omps in various conditions the constants for the freundlich isotherm model were also determined for the high concentration experiments translating them to environmentally relevant concentrations ranging from 0 01 to 70 μg l 1 in addition the values of the freundlich isotherm constant kf given with different units were unified since they are unit dependent the recalculated isotherm constants are listed in table 4 including the kf with a unit of μg g 1 l μg 1 n and the n value when n was around 1 the higher adsorption capacity was implied by the higher kf value by referring to the results in table 4 the adsorption isotherms from the one solute solution had in most cases n values of around 1 where the adsorption capacity linearly increased with the increase in equilibrium concentration of omps the n value varied in multi solute solutions with competition adsorption favourable adsorption was indicated by high n value n 1 while the adsorption of omps was unfavoured when n was below 1 freundlich 1906 the recalculated results could be utilized as an overview of omp adsorption efficiency for instance high silica zeolites achieved great adsorption efficiency in the following cases where the k f value exceeded 10 000 μg g 1 l μg 1 n the adsorption of bisphenol a by mor zeolite dimethylamine by mfi zeolite and hydroxycinnamic acids by bea zeolite conversely high silica fau zeolites showed limited adsorption for 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp with low value of k f 0 09 μg g 1 l μg 1 n and n 0 43 reference to the recalculated isotherm information can thus guide the selection of suitable high silica zeolites for the adsorption of specific omps at environmentally relevant concentrations moreover high silica zeolites showed possibilities for the adsorption of omps which were hardly adsorbed by activated carbon for example k f for sulfametoxazole adsorption by fau 200 was 423 55 μg g 1 l μg 1 n table 4 n 0 99 fukahori et al 2011 which was much higher than the reported value of k f in literature for powder activated carbon of 1 10 μg g 1 l μg 1 n n 1 nam et al 2014 4 1 6 omp adsorption by high silica zeolite granules in practice adsorbents are frequently used in the form of a column with a packed granular bed in order to eliminate the need for post filtration to remove powder adsorbents the use of columns also allows for easier regeneration the performance of column adsorption can be examined by breakthrough curves which describe the omp concentration in the column effluent changing in time when the adsorbents in the column become saturated a drastic increase of the effluent concentration appears indicating the so called breakthrough high silica mfi zeolite granules with grain sizes 0 5 and 1 0 mm were applied for the adsorption of mtbe rossner and knappe 2008 for mfi zeolite granules co adsorption of bom had a small effect on the mtbe adsorption uptake but a more pronounced effect on mtbe adsorption kinetics the adsorbent usage rate was estimated assuming an influent mtbe concentration of 100 μg l 1 in river water an empty bed contact time ebct of 15min and an effluent mtbe concentration of 10 μg l 1 based on experimental data a coconut shell based gac column was predicted to have a useful life of 33 days while the mfi zeolite column was predicted to have a useful life of 175 days abu lail et al 2010 evaluated the performance of zeolite granules from fau bea mor and mfi types for the removal of mtbe in batch scale experiments compared with other tested zeolite granules mfi zeolite granules si al ratio 280 with the smallest pores had the highest adsorption capacity at an equilibrium concentration range of 0 001 20 mg l 1 in the column scale experiment using a flow rate of 32 5 ml min 1 feeding an mtbe concentration of 50 μg l 1 and an effluent mtbe concentration of 5 μg l 1 mfi zeolite granules granular size 250 425 μm had a later breakthrough than granular activated carbon khalid et al 2004 demonstrated that pure silica bea zeolite no al content granules showed a better adsorption efficiency for phenol than other tested zeolites i e mor bea and fau zeolites and activated carbons in the column scale experiment with an ebct of 1 min and an influent concentration of 100 mg l 1 bea zeolite exhibited a breakthrough time 4 5 times longer than granular activated carbon the adsorption competition of aromatic compounds was studied in column scale experiments by koubaissy et al 2011 the equimolar mixture of 2 4 dcp 2 4 dnp and onp ona in distilled water was fed to a column with an ebct of 4 6 7 min and a flow rate of 2 ml min 1 the breakthrough curves showed that onp decreased ona adsorption and 2 4 dnp desorbed 2 4 dcp both of which were determined by functional groups 4 2 preventing unfavourable adsorption of background organic matters bom in natural water in practice the omp adsorption performance of adsorbents is affected by bom a mixture of organic molecules that is unique for each water type bom may cover the surface of adsorbents or prevent adsorption of omps e g bom was proven to compete strongly with omps and considerably impair the adsorption capacity of activated carbon de ridder et al 2012 hung and lin 2006 hung et al 2005 however bom competition in natural water was hardly observed during high silica zeolite adsorption of omps such as mtbe abu lail et al 2010 rossner and knappe 2008 sulfonamide antibiotics braschi et al 2010 nitrosamines and various pharmaceuticals de ridder et al 2012 the micropores of zeolites could prevent the entrance of most bom components present in water de ridder et al 2012 ebie et al 2001 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 however slower adsorption kinetics of omps were observed in the presence of bom since bom could block the surface openings and hinder the diffusional paths of omps hung and lin 2006 rossner and knappe 2008 in some cases low molecular weight compounds are also present in natural water as a fraction of bom hem 1959 braschi et al 2016b studied the adsorption efficiency of fau zeolites with a si al ratio of 100 for sulfamethoxazole in the presence of two humic monomers vanillin and caffeic acid with molecular weights of 152 and 180 mol g 1 respectively since humic monomers could enter the pores of zeolites a slightly lower adsorption capacity was observed when sulfamethoxazole was mixed with these humic monomers compared to a single solution meanwhile it was hypothesised that an adduct with sulfamethoxazole and vanillin formed by h bonding could stabilize the adsorbed omps in the pores of high silica zeolites bottero et al 1994 investigated atrazine adsorption by fau and mfi zeolites and observed that atrazine was even better adsorbed in natural water than in pure water this was attributed to the finding that in natural water atrazine has a high affinity for bom compounds e g forming hydroxyaromatics as a result the adsorption of atrazine was enhanced because the hydroxyaromatics were well adsorbed by the zeolites 4 3 possible on site regeneration and recycling of high silica zeolites reuse of adsorbents allows for reduction of both treatment costs and waste generation to regenerate the adsorbents thermal calcination regeneration which employs high temperature is widely used for most adsorbents including activated carbon and zeolites in other cases regeneration using high temperature water is applied to stimulate the desorption of specific strong interactions between zeolites and omps chica et al 2004 2005 garcía and lercher 1992 zhang et al 2008 however energy consumption for the current regeneration approaches is high lee et al 2011 oxidation is another method for the regeneration of high silica zeolites since zeolites are resistant to oxidants e g hydroxyl radicals ozone etc a broad range of omps after accumulating in the micropores of zeolites are found to be oxidised by ozone fenton uv h2o2 and other oxidants sagehashi et al 2005 shahbazi et al 2014 wang et al 2006 2010 by combining high silica zeolite adsorption with oxidation of omps on site regeneration of zeolites could be achieved gonzalez olmos et al 2011 2013 most of these oxidation regeneration processes require a short contact time of less than 30 min while the thermal approaches might take up to several hours fujita et al 2004 sun et al 2010 von gunten 2003 wang et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 comparably ozonation of activated carbon will change the properties of activated carbon e g surface area pore size distribution and surface functional groups which are well related to the adsorption efficiency chiang et al 2002a 2002b odivan et al 2014 donnet and ehrburger 1970 conducted experiments on the ozonation of activated carbon and reported that at an ozone dosage of 13 mg l 1 for 150 h 66 2 of the activated carbon surface was oxidised to co2 the long term oxidation of activated carbon will thus lead to a high carbon loss different forms of oxidant species may exist in the ozone oxidation process firstly zeolites as catalysts could promote surface reactions between the adsorbed ozone and omps the catalytic ozonation on zeolites then proceeds via direct reaction of molecular ozone with omps ikhlaq et al 2014 second decomposition of ozone molecules may happen at lewis acid sites to generate reactive oxygen species alejandro et al 2014 thus reactive hydroxyl radicals can be generated from ozone decomposition and subsequently react with omps from zeolites legrini et al 1993 leichsenring et al 1996 monneyron et al 2003 reungoat et al 2007 studied the adsorption of nitrobenzene and ozone regeneration of zeolites in a sequential process they found that the initial adsorption capacity of fau zeolites was completely restored by ozone after the adsorption of nitrobenzene the effective adsorption of tcp was maintained for at least 8 cycles of adsorption and regeneration it was also observed that ozonation increased the bet surface area of fau zeolite by over 60 which even enhanced the omp adsorption capacity the changes in bet surface area might be attributed to the additional defects of zeolites generated during the oxidation process which need further investigation however with a further increase in the number of regeneration cycles the ozone regeneration process could lose efficiency the decrease of regeneration efficiency was attributed to the oxidation by products that might accumulate and compete with target omp adsorption it has been confirmed that traces of oxidation by products of toluene such as acetic acid and acetaldehyde were formed and remained adsorbed after the regeneration with ozone alejandro et al 2014 zaitan et al 2016 moreover acid formation during ozonation may have changed the ph of the solution which hindered the decomposition of ozone and the generation of free radicals zhang et al 2014 once hydrogen peroxide is introduced fenton or fenton like systems are developed as an oxidiser for regeneration of high silica zeolites neyens and baeyens 2003 iron either immobilized on the high silica zeolites or dissolved into the solution will catalyse the oxidation process gonzalez olmos et al 2013 shahbazi et al 2014 hydroxyl radicals could be generated to decompose the omps adsorbed on the zeolites gonzalez olmos et al 2013 wang et al 2006 cihanoglu et al 2015 found that the catalytic activities of mfi zeolites increased with iron loading in addition koryabkina et al 2007 applied fe coated fau zeolites for adsorption of disinfection by products chloroform and trichloroacetic acid eight regeneration cycles could be achieved although the adsorption capacity after regeneration decreased because of iron leaching however the regeneration efficiency by both ozone and hydrogen peroxide could be affected by the properties of the zeolites braschi et al 2016a found that adsorbed sulfonamide antibiotics were only partially oxidised suspecting that the diffusion of radical oxygenated species e g hydroxyl radicals in the pores of zeolites was insufficient although the number of brønsted acid sites was found to have a positive relation with the catalytic ability of the tested mfi zeolites cihanoglu et al 2015 moreover the ozonation regeneration efficiency was related to the amount of acid sites as an example a natural zeolite with a si al ratio of 11 which contains a greater number of brønsted acid sites than zeolites with higher si al ratios had a 2 3 times higher activity of hydrogen peroxide decomposition than bea zeolites with a si al ratio of 400 however the regeneration efficiency of the bea zeolites was 2 5 higher than the natural zeolite since more omps were adsorbed by bea zeolites than by the natural zeolite shahbazi et al 2014 tio2 immobilized high silica zeolites combined with uv light was also studied and found to be an effective photo catalytic oxidation process to regenerate zeolites fukahori and fujiwara 2014 mendez arriaga and almanza 2014 neppolian et al 2016 pan et al 2014 perisic et al 2016 wang et al 2010 active free radicals were generated and therefore a fast omp degradation rate was achieved hoffmann et al 1995 due to the limited research on the photo catalytic oxidation process for zeolite regeneration it is yet unclear what will be the long term performance with increasing regeneration cycles plasma technology has recently been proposed as a promising advanced oxidation method since it is able to produce a wide range of reactive species including electrons photons free radicals ions and reactive molecules such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide as such it can be used to decompose organic matters in a gaseous or liquid phase as well as for surface treatment of materials plasma can be generated by a variety of electrical discharges and several lab scale designs of electrical discharge reactors appear to be effective for contaminant degradation in water or wastewater miklos et al 2018 vanraes 2016 kušić et al 2005 and peternel et al 2006 have reported the application of plasma treatment with high voltage electrical discharge reactors using mfi and fau zeolites for degradation of omps i e phenol and dyes in water the oxygen hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals as well as ozone generated from the reactor could promote omp degradation the combination of plasma oxidation and high silica zeolites can potentially be a promising approach for zeolite regeneration however to the authors knowledge no study has been carried out to demonstrate the system s efficiency of regeneration the influence of solution chemistry and plasma reactivity inside the zeolite pores on the regeneration efficiency in addition to the scaling up of the electrical discharge reactors are future research topics worth investigation 5 concluding remarks and prospects the research on omp adsorption by high silica zeolites has been reviewed and the following conclusions can be drawn high silica zeolites have exhibited a good ability to remove target omps from water e g small sized and polar omps that are not effectively removed by other adsorbents a wide range of studies could be found on omp adsorption efficiencies and mechanisms of high silica zeolite powders which were mostly carried out in batch tests high microporous volume closely fitted pores and hydrophobicity of high silica zeolites could promote omp adsorption bom in natural water has a minimal effect on the adsorption capacity of omps onto high silica zeolites which is considered to be an advantage for the application of high silica zeolites in water treatment however small molecules with a similar size relative to omps might be present in water and compete with omp adsorption oxidants such as ozone hydrogen peroxide fenton photo catalytic oxidation and plasma have shown to be effective during the regeneration of high silica zeolites structural modification of high silica zeolites e g the possible generation of additional surface defects by the oxidation needs further investigation acknowledgements this work is financed by the tki project zeotreat 2014tud001 nan jiang acknowledges the china scholarship council for her phd

19346,the aim of this study was to investigate the reactivity of intracellular algogenic organic matter iom with hydroxyl radicals oh a key reaction species in advanced oxidation processes iom was extracted from two green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus sp and two blue green algae anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa using a freeze thaw method the second order rate constants of the extracted iom with oh were determined as 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 chlamydomonas reinhardtii 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 scenedesmus sp 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 anabaena sp and 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 microcystis aeruginosa these rate constants were significantly higher than values reported for dissolved organic matter in various water sources this implies that iom formation during algal bloom season could change the oh water matrix demand and adversely affect the performance of advanced oxidation processes to investigate the physical and chemical composition characteristics of iom and their relationship to the rate constants determined for the reaction between iom and oh liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis feem parafac were used the iom mainly consisted of low molecular weight lmw matter and protein related compounds as evidenced lmw neutrals 38 65 biopolymers 7 19 and tryptophan like compounds 74 94 based on the composition characteristics of iom it was concluded that the molecular weight and the presence of nitrogen containing compounds are influential parameters for determining the reactivity of iom with oh keywords advanced oxidation processes algae fluorescence excitation emission matrix liquid chromatography organic carbon detection parallel factor analysis radical scavenger 1 introduction problems associated with algal blooms are becoming more significant because of increasing frequency and quantity owing to anthropogenic activities and climate change effects heisler et al 2008 paerl and paul 2012 algal blooms have adverse effects such as depletion of oxygen aesthetic problems and impacts on water quality villacorte et al 2015 the effects of algal blooms on water quality are associated with algogenic organic matter aom released from algal species aom mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids and nucleic acids and it has a different composition than natural organic matter nom which predominantly contains humic substances hajibabania et al 2011 henderson et al 2008 myklestad 1995 aom can be categorized into extracellular algogenic organic matter eom and intracellular algogenic organic matter iom eom is produced by the excretion of algal metabolic products iom is released via autolysis of dead algae cells and reported to account for 80 of total aom henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 some studies have reported that aom can adversely affect water treatment processes by increasing the coagulant demand causing membrane fouling releasing taste and odor compounds and producing disinfection by products dbps bar zeev et al 2015 chen et al 2008 fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2010 her et al 2004 li et al 2012 2014 pivokonsky et al 2006 wert et al 2014 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 however no studies have investigated the effect of aom on advanced oxidation processes aops which are usually installed after the filtration step in drinking water treatment processes for removal of micropollutants and metabolites from algae such as geosmin 2 methylisoborneol and algal toxins peter and von gunten 2007 rosenfeldt et al 2005 westerhoff et al 2006 as previous studies reported that aom could pass through prior processes such as coagulation and filtration to aops henderson et al 2010 her et al 2004 li et al 2014 the impact of aom on the performance of aops merits investigation the hydroxyl radical oh which has strong oxidizing potential and non selectivity is a key oxidation species in aops glaze et al 1987 kwon et al 2014 von gunten 2003 because of the highly reactive and non selective characteristics of oh background water constituents compete with target micropollutants for the oh reaction therefore determination of the oh water matrix demand is very important for predicting the performance of aops in the removal of target micropollutants hoigné and bader 1979 kwon et al 2014 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 the major water constituents known to scavenge oh are dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic species such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrite and bromide ions keen et al 2014 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 the oh water matrix demand is commonly calculated based on the measured concentrations of these compounds and the respective second order rate constants k oh si m 1 s 1 for their reaction with oh the second order rate constants for the reaction between oh and dom are vary depending on the origin nature and composition of the dom and have been reported as 1 0 4 5 108 mc 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 during algal bloom season dom could be partly composed of aom and the reactivity of dom with oh might be changed depending on the reactivity of aom with oh however no values have been reported for the second order rate constants between aom and oh in this study we determined the second order rate constants for the reaction between iom and oh the former of which comprises 80 of aom henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 for four different algal species from two groups the green algal group chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus sp and the blue green algal group anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa those are dominant species in rivers and lakes in south korea choi et al 2007 ha et al 2002 park et al 2006 with respect to eom the oh reactivity test could not be conducted owing to the limitation in separating the eom from the ions in the culture media

ferris and hirsch 1991 savchenko et al 2017 the algae were harvested during the exponential growth phase 20 28 days huang et al 2009 wert et al 2014 and iom of the algae were extracted using a freeze thaw method li et al 2012 2014 the algal suspension was centrifuged three times at 9500 g for 10 min using 18 mω cm deionized distilled water ddw to minimize the effects of the media this was the washing step the washed cells underwent three freeze thaw cycles 70 25 c to induce cell lysis and then were centrifuged again the supernatant obtained from the centrifugation was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane filter hyundai micro ltd south korea and referred as the iom stock solution for each algal species the iom stock solutions were diluted to obtain 2 9 4 3 mg c l 1 of doc using ph 7 phosphate buffer after dilution the samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed within 7 days the basic water parameters of the diluted iom solutions are listed in table 1 the suva values of the tested iom solutions 1 09 2 60 mg m 1 were generally low which is in agreement with values reported in previous studies henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2014 and can be explained by the hydrophilic characteristic of algae driven organic matter concentrations of anions such as cl no2 no3 and so4 2 were below 0 05 mg l 1 after the washing process conductivities of the iom stock solutions were less than 60 μs cm 1 which increased up to 850 μs cm 1 after dilution of the stock solutions with 5 mm phosphate buffer the phosphate buffer concentration 5 mm was selected after considering the buffer capacity to fix ph during the kinetic experiments and the minimization of the effect of phosphate ions on the oh reactions because of the low reactivity and

ana and ma had a bright blue color whereas the iom solutions from chr and sce were colorless fig s1 the blue color is due to a high concentration of phycocyanin which is a constituent of blue green algae ernst et al 1992 2 3 hydroxyl radical reaction study the rate constant for the reaction between iom and oh was determined via competition kinetics in a uv h2o2 system the experiments were conducted in a bench scale quasi collimated beam apparatus bolton and linden 2003 equipped with three 15 w low pressure lamps bestec co taiwan which primarily emitted uv light at 253 7 nm a 100 ml

repeated at least four times 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd lc ocd is an analytical technique for identification and quantification of nom constituents based on molecular weight mw in aquatic environments lc ocd consists of size exclusion chromatography sec with an organic carbon detector ocd based on a gräntzel thin film reactor 2000 v 40 ma and a uv detector measuring at 254 nm it divides the components of organic matter into six fractions hydrophobic organic carbons hoc biopolymers humic substances hs building blocks low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals biopolymers have the highest mw followed by hs building blocks and lmw acids and neutrals bosire et al 2016 gonzález et al 2013 huber et al 2011 this separation occurs by means of porous particles included in the size exclusion column the smaller substances can be easily captured by pores than the larger substances therefore they flow out and reach the ocd later than the larger substances do meanwhile the large substances can readily pass through the chromatographic column and be detected earlier measured chromatograms from the ocd were fractionated using the fiffikus program doc labor germany a phosphate buffer with ph 6 85 at a flow rate of 1 4 ml min 1 was used as the mobile phase more detailed information on the fundamental scheme of lc ocd is described by huber et al 2011 2 4 2 fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factors analysis feem parafac feem spectra for the iom solutions were scanned over excitation ranges of 230

each and the photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was 600 v the scanning speed was 1200 nm min 1 to minimize the background effect of the spectra feem spectra for 5 mm phosphate buffer a blank of the diluted iom solution were subtracted from the feem spectra of each iom sample bahram et al 2006 these pretreated feem spectra were imported into the domfluor v 1 7 toolbox using matlab mathworks natick ma usa to perform parafac modeling the missing values had a value of 23 via elimination of rayleigh and raman scatter peaks several diagnostic methods such as matching contours examining

and loading values from the parafac analysis were plotted in filled contour form in the sigma plot 10 0 program spss inc finally the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 was used to compare the parafac components in the current study with previously reported data to gather specific information regarding the components 2 4 3 additional analyses organic matter concentration was determined

matter with hydroxyl radicals to investigate the impact of iom on the oh reaction reaction kinetics of ohs with organic matter were evaluated using the uv h2o2 system which could generate oh through the photolytic decomposition of h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 glaze et al 1987 fig 1 shows the degradation of pcba as a function of uv dose in the presence of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 and different kinds of dom i e sce iom 4 25 mg c l 1 ana iom 3 20 mg c l 1 and srha 4 50 mg c l 1 pcba is commonly used as a oh probe compound in the uv h2o2 system because it has high reactivity with oh k oh p cba 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 neta and dorfman 1968 but low photolytic reactivity rosenfeldt and linden 2007 the degradation rates of pcba varied considerably with the type of organic matter fig 1 the higher degradation rate of pcba indicates a lower oh scavenging rate by organic matter because pcba competes with organic matter for the reaction with oh for the srha solution the removal rate of pcba in the srha solution was notably higher than that in other solutions even though the doc of the srha solution was higher than those of the others were this is primarily because dom reactivity toward oh is highly dependent on the origin nature and composition of the dom to compare the degradation rates of pcba for each condition uv fluence based rate constants cm2 mj 1 were determined fig s2 shows a good linear relationship between ln pcba pcba 0 and uv dose indicating that the reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics the fluence based determined rate constant for the srha 0 0196 cm2 mj 1 was 5 4 times higher than that for the sce iom 0 0036 cm2 mj 1 with similar doc concentrations 4 5 mg c l 1 srha and 4 3 mg c l 1 sce iom the fluence based rate constant for the ana iom 0 0102 cm2 mj 1 was lower than that for the srha despite the lower concentration of ana iom 3 2 mg c l 1 than of srha 4 5 mg c l 1 these results indicate that the sce iom and ana iom had higher radical scavenging rates than srha did because of the higher reactivity of sce iom and ana iom with oh the chr iom and ma iom data are available in fig s2 to compare the oh reactivity of the iom samples with that of previously studied dom brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 the second order rate constants between oh and the iom were determined based on the competition kinetics method using pcba and t buoh in the uv h2o2 system the initial concentration of t buoh was varied from 0 mm to 0 20 mm and the initial concentrations of pcba and h2o2 were fixed at 1 μm and 20 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 shows the experimental results of the competition kinetics for the calculation of the second order rate constants using the following

plotting 1 k p cba a p p as a function of the concentration of the competitive scavenger t buoh eq 2 and fig 2 with slope a and intercept b respectively to verify the method and rate constants determined in this study the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and a well characterized organic matter i e srha was also measured the determined rate constant in this study k oh s r h a 1 45 108 mc 1 s 1 was very similar to the reported value reported by donham et al 2014 1 37 108 mc 1 s 1 indicating the reliability of the measurement method table 2 lists the determined second order rate constants for the reactions between iom and oh interestingly the rate constants for the reactions of oh with iom 4 0 8 0 108 mc 1 s 1 were about 2 6 times higher than that with srha as well as those with dom reported for rivers and lakes of 1 0 3 5 108 mc 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 this implies that the formation of iom during algal bloom season could adversely affect the removal of target pollutants because iom and target compounds compete for the oh radical reactions although the number of tested algal species was limited the rate constants determined for the iom of the tested algal species tended to differ depending on the algal group the rate constants of the green algae iom k oh chr iom 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 and k oh sce iom 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 were approximately two times higher than the rate constants of the blue green algae iom k oh ana iom 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 and k oh ma iom 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 to interpret the different oh reactivity of the four iom the characteristics of each iom were investigated as described in the next section the data reported in this section emphasize that 1 iom has higher reactivity with oh than dom species reported in the literature and 2 the performance of aops could be degraded by the influence of iom during algal bloom season therefore the specific oh kinetic parameters for each process e g scavenging factor r ct and r oh o3 elovitz and von gunten 1999 kwon et al 2017 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 yong and lin 2012 should be monitored during algal bloom season for safe and efficient operation involving aops 3 2 characteristics of intracellular algogenic organic matter feem parafac and lc ocd techniques were applied to investigate the characteristics of iom and their relationships with the second order rate constants determined iom solution conditions for this characterization were the same as those used in the oh reaction kinetic study analyses were conducted at least three times for each algal species 3 2 1 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd to identify and quantify iom constituents the extracted iom solutions from four different algal species were analyzed using the lc ocd technique fig 3 shows the analysis results for the six different fractions i e biopolymers hs building blocks lmw acids lmw neutrals and hoc which were determined from raw ocd chromatograms fig s3 the low proportion of hoc less than 20 in all the iom solutions represents the hydrophilic properties of iom ghernaout 2014 which is consistent with the results of the suva values table 1 and the previous studies henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2014 concerning all the iom samples the highest proportion of constituents was analyzed to be lmw neutrals fig 3 which indicated that the iom samples mainly contained small mw compounds 350 g mol 1 including amino acids alcohols and aldehydes it was notably different from the results reported for srha 80 hs and other dom ahn et al 2017 hajibabania et al 2011 maeng et al 2012 vera et al 2017b the proportion of lmw neutrals varied in the following order chr iom 65 sce iom 53 ana iom 48 ma iom 38 the next common constituents were building blocks which are known to have mw from 300 to 500 g mol 1 the order of the highest to lowest proportion of building blocks was the opposite of that for lmw neutrals ma iom 29 ana iom 20 sce iom 18 chr iom 15 interestingly only ana iom 22 and ma iom 16 which are blue green algal species contained hs which has humic acids like and fulvic acids like in varying amounts with a relatively high mws range 100 100 000 g mol 1 bosire et al 2016 gonzález et al 2013 huber et al 2011 one of the plausible reasons for the presence of hs in the ana iom and ma iom is the phycocyanin in blue green algae phycocyanin is a pigment protein complex reported to have a broad mw range i e 15 000 to 130 000 g mol 1 berns et al 1963 patel et al 2005 scott and berns 1965 containing cyanotoxins is also characteristic of blue green algae and it may contribute to the hs fraction the proportions of biopolymers 20 000 g mol 1 and lmw acids 350 g mol 1 were less than 7 for all the tested iom samples these results show that the ana iom and ma iom had higher mw organic compounds than the chr iom and sce iom did 3 2 2 fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis feem parafac feem was applied to characterize the iom based on physico chemical characteristics fig 4 shows the feem contours of the iom for the four algal species iom commonly contained feem peaks at ex em 230 240 290 390 nm and 260 290 290 390 nm representing soluble microbial like and aromatic protein like regions chen et al 2003 hudson et al 2007 the presence of dominant protein like fluorophores in iom was expected because protein like fluorophores usually originate in the cells of organism hudson et al 2007 this result was in agreement with those of previous feem studies on algal derived organic matter henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 2014 wang et al 2014 interestingly a notable difference between the green algae iom and blue green algae iom used in this study was observed at ex em 230 240 420 490 nm 250 270 420 490 nm and 330 390 420 490 nm these fluorescence peaks have been reported to be humic or fulvic acid like fluorophores chen et al 2003 that are classified as humic substances derived from breakdown products of plants or soil materials in terrestrial or aquatic conditions the tested green algal species chr iom and sce iom had no humic and fulvic acid like peaks in the feem contours but the blue green algal species ana iom and ma iom did this result is accordance with the hs fraction results from the lc ocd analysis parafac modeling was conducted to interpret the underlying feem spectra a total of 61 feem data points were used for the parafac analysis with four components acquired as the best fit result of the modeling fig 5 and s4 fig 6 shows the fraction of components in the chr sce ana and ma iom component 1 c1 which was indicated as tryptophan like compounds in table 3 constitutes more than 70 of the parafac components for all the iom samples component 4 c4 accounted for 5 16 of the iom s component fraction c4 is expected to be protein like compounds tyrosine like based on its maximum loading spectra and fluorescence peak regions chen et al 2003 even though it was not found in previous studies table 3 and fig s5 this previously unreported component possibly will be reported to the public domain i e openfluor database as an inherent characteristic of iom component 2 and 3 c2 and c3 respectively which were indicated as humic like materials in table 3 comprised a low proportion of the iom s components this iom composition based on parafac analysis was notably different than those of nom in rivers and lakes as nom usually originates in soil leaves and plants as opposed to iom s origination in cells ahn et al 2017 aryal et al 2016 fellman et al 2008 hiriart baer et al 2013 peleato et al 2016 among the iom samples chr iom 88 and sce iom 94 contained larger c1 fractions than ana iom 79 and ma iom 74 did regarding the humic like materials ma iom contained a relatively higher proportion of c2 20 than chr iom sce iom and ana iom did below 4 comparing the blue green algae iom the difference found in c2 between ana iom and ma iom possibly suggests that they have different hs compositions ana iom contained a significantly lower c2 fraction than ma iom did in contrast to their similarity in hs fraction based on the lc ocd analysis this means that most of the hs composition for the ana iom did not show fluorescence properties in contrast to what the ma iom showed leading to an inconsistency between the lc ocd and fluorescence analyses results based on the fluorescence analysis iom was found to mainly consist of protein related fluorophores c1 and c4 which contrasts the composition of typical nom and chr iom and sce iom contained more protein related fluorophores than ana iom and ma iom did 3 3 influential factors on the hydroxyl radical reactivity of iom for interpretation of the different oh reactivity between the iom the relationships between iom characteristics and rate constants were investigated one of the possible factors influencing oh reactivity is the presence of the nitrogen containing compounds in iom based on the results of the lc ocd and fluorescent analyses the iom was found to consist of a high proportion of these nitrogen containing compounds via lmw neutrals protein like regions and c1 the lmw neutrals that comprised the largest fraction of all the iom samples are considered amino acids because the iom originated inside organisms the dominant proportion of c1 tryptophan like an aromatic amino acid containing two fused rings with nh in the iom also supports amino acids as a main constituent of the lmw neutrals in contrast the characteristics of nom show a low proportion of protein like components and lmw neutrals and a rather high proportion of humic related components or ha fractions as reported in many studies ahn et al 2017 hajibabania et al 2011 maeng et al 2012 the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan like and tyrosine like have been reported to have high rate constants with oh 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 under pathways of h abstraction stadtman 1993 and oh addition mujika et al 2013 in addition mangalgiri et al 2017 reported that nitrogen containing compounds tryptophan like had greater reactivity with oh than other humic like materials did owing to the high reactivity of nitrogen containing compounds with oh the high proportion of those compounds in iom may be considered an important factor in the determination of the rate constant for the reaction between iom and oh this assumption could explain not only the higher rate constant for the reaction of iom with oh than that with commonly studied dom but also the difference in rate constants for each iom reacting with oh however it is difficult to affirm that individual chemical characteristic factors exclusively influenced the reactivity with oh in practice the correlation results of the nitrogen containing fraction or component were only partially valid fig 7 a c this is because bulk organic matter comprises complex molecules with diverse compounds therefore it is difficult for individual chemical parameters to exclusively dominate the rate constant for the reactions with oh donham et al 2014 mckay et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2007 the iom mw also can be considered a possible factor that considerably affects reactivity with oh from this study the iom had higher rate constants in their reactions with oh in accordance with the lower percentage of high mw fractions biopolymers and humic substances and the higher percentage of low mw fractions 350 g mol 1 the chr iom and sce iom high mw fractions 2 and 7 respectively low mw fractions 66 and 57 respectively had two times higher rate constants in their reactions with oh than the ana iom and ma iom did high mw fractions 25 and 20 respectively low mw fractions 47 and 38 respectively one of the many studies on the reactivity of organic matter with oh suggested a similar tendency for effluent organic matter efom dong et al 2010 reported that the 1 kda fraction of efom the smallest apparent mw fraction in that study had the highest rate constants for reactions with oh followed by the 3 5 and 10 kda fractions with the bulk solution coming in last they concluded that a higher percentage of large molecules in organic matter lowered the reactivity with oh the plausible reason for this was that the three dimensional structure of organic matter becomes more complex and aggregative with increasing mw leading to a decline in the likelihood of oh accessing each of the carbon entities similar to that of dwindling surface area the limitation on access to some carbon entities reduces the rate constant for oh reactions as oh does diffusion controlled reaction therefore the higher percentage of high mw fractions in organic matter may reduce the rate constant for oh reactions conversely the larger portion of low mw fractions in organic matter likely leads to an increase in the rate constant for oh reactions fig 7 shows a good inversely proportional correlation between the percentage of high mw fractions and the rate constants and partial correlation between the percentage of the low mw fractions and the rate constants therefore this consideration is acceptable however owing to the complexity of the characteristics and structures of organic matter a detailed study should be conducted in the future to determine the cause of the influence on the rate of oh reactions the difference in the hs composition did not play a significant role in the determination of the reaction rate between iom and oh as the ana iom and ma iom were suspected of having different humic matter characteristics but were similarly reactive with oh the other characterization factors such as the suva values and the fraction of hoc table 1 and fig 3 and s6 could not explain why the iom samples reacted differently with oh although limited the results in this section emphasize that the characteristics of low mw and nitrogen containing compounds of iom could lead to high oh reactivity further research is needed on the various iom contents of different algal species in order to perform statistical analysis 4 conclusions in this study iom was extracted from four algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus sp anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa and the characteristics of the iom and its reactivity with oh were investigated based on the characterization using lc ocd and feem parafac analyses an attempt was made to determine the factors responsible for the difference in the rate constants for the reactions between the iom of the four algal species and oh the conclusions are presented as follows the determined second order rate constants of iom with oh varied in the following order chr iom 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 sce iom 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 ma iom 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 ana iom 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 the determined rate constants of iom with oh were approximately 2 6 times higher than the reported rate constant with dom in surface water from the lc ocd analysis all tested iom samples mainly comprised low mw component fractions lmw neutrals with hydrophilic characteristics among the iom samples the ana iom and ma iom blue green algal species had higher mw compounds than the chr iom and sce iom did green algal species feem parafac results showed that the iom mainly consisted of tryptophan like fluorophores which are protein like compounds the ma iom contained a higher amount of humic acid like materials than the other iom samples tested did the presence of nitrogen containing compounds in iom could be an influential factor in determining the reactivity of the iom with oh owing to their high reactivity with oh mw is also an important factor in the reactivity with oh because the possibility of oh reaching each carbon entity is likely to decrease with increasing mw owing to the complex and aggregated three dimensional structure of large molecules when aops are applied to treat micropollutants in the presence of iom the high reactivity of iom with oh can negatively influence the removal rate of the target pollutants because the iom and target compounds compete for the oh reactions in contrast if aops are applied for mineralization the presence of iom could improve the performance because of the high reactivity of iom with oh acknowledgements this research was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msip nrf 2016r1a2b4015598 appendix a supplementary data the

19346,the aim of this study was to investigate the reactivity of intracellular algogenic organic matter iom with hydroxyl radicals oh a key reaction species in advanced oxidation processes iom was extracted from two green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus sp and two blue green algae anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa using a freeze thaw method the second order rate constants of the extracted iom with oh were determined as 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 chlamydomonas reinhardtii 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 scenedesmus sp 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 anabaena sp and 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 microcystis aeruginosa these rate constants were significantly higher than values reported for dissolved organic matter in various water sources this implies that iom formation during algal bloom season could change the oh water matrix demand and adversely affect the performance of advanced oxidation processes to investigate the physical and chemical composition characteristics of iom and their relationship to the rate constants determined for the reaction between iom and oh liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd and fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis feem parafac were used the iom mainly consisted of low molecular weight lmw matter and protein related compounds as evidenced lmw neutrals 38 65 biopolymers 7 19 and tryptophan like compounds 74 94 based on the composition characteristics of iom it was concluded that the molecular weight and the presence of nitrogen containing compounds are influential parameters for determining the reactivity of iom with oh

2012 algal blooms have adverse effects such as depletion of oxygen aesthetic problems and impacts on water quality villacorte et al 2015 the effects of algal blooms on water quality are associated with algogenic organic matter aom released from algal species aom mainly consists of polysaccharides proteins lipids and nucleic acids and it has a different composition than natural organic matter nom which predominantly contains humic substances hajibabania et al 2011 henderson et al 2008 myklestad 1995 aom can be categorized into extracellular algogenic organic matter eom and intracellular algogenic organic matter iom eom is produced by the excretion of algal metabolic products iom is released via autolysis of dead algae cells and reported to account for 80 of total aom henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 some studies have reported that aom can adversely affect water treatment processes by increasing the coagulant demand causing membrane fouling releasing taste and odor compounds and producing disinfection by products dbps bar zeev et al 2015 chen et al 2008 fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2010 her et al 2004 li et al 2012 2014 pivokonsky et al 2006 wert et al 2014 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 however no studies have investigated the effect of aom on advanced oxidation processes aops which are usually installed after the filtration step in drinking water treatment processes for removal of micropollutants and metabolites from algae such as geosmin 2 methylisoborneol and algal toxins peter and von gunten 2007 rosenfeldt et al 2005 westerhoff et al 2006 as previous studies reported that aom could pass through prior processes such as coagulation and filtration to aops henderson et al 2010 her et al 2004 li et al 2014 the impact of aom on the performance of aops merits investigation the hydroxyl radical oh which has strong oxidizing potential and non selectivity is a key oxidation species in aops glaze et al 1987 kwon et al 2014 von gunten 2003 because of the highly reactive and non selective characteristics of oh background water constituents compete with target micropollutants for the oh reaction therefore determination of the oh water matrix demand is very important for predicting the performance of aops in the removal of target micropollutants hoigné and bader 1979 kwon et al 2014 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 the major water constituents known to scavenge oh are dissolved organic matter dom and inorganic species such as carbonate bicarbonate nitrite and bromide ions keen et al 2014 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 the oh water matrix demand is commonly calculated based on the measured concentrations of these compounds and the respective second order rate constants k oh si m 1 s 1 for their reaction with oh the second order rate constants for the reaction between oh and dom are vary depending on the origin nature and composition of the dom and have been reported as 1 0 4 5 108 mc 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 during algal bloom season dom could be partly composed of aom and the reactivity of dom with oh might be changed depending on the reactivity of aom with oh however no values have been reported for the second order rate constants between aom and oh in this study we determined the second order rate constants for the reaction between iom and oh the former of which comprises 80 of aom henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 for four different algal species from two groups the green algal group chlamydomonas reinhardtii and scenedesmus sp and the blue green algal group anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa those are dominant species in rivers and lakes in south korea choi et al 2007 ha et al 2002 park et al 2006 with respect to eom the oh reactivity test could not be conducted owing to the limitation in separating the eom from the ions in the culture media which could have a significant effect on the oh reaction the characteristics of the iom from each algal species were also investigated using liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd

cyanobacteria bg 11 media sigma aldrich usa in an incubator at 25 c and 150 rpm with cycles of 12 hours of light 60 μmol photons m 2 s 1 then 12 hours of darkness cobos et al 2017 dang et al 2012 ferris and hirsch 1991 savchenko et al 2017 the algae were harvested during the exponential growth phase 20 28 days huang et al 2009 wert et al 2014 and iom of the algae were extracted using a freeze thaw method li et al 2012 2014 the algal suspension was centrifuged three times at 9500 g for 10 min using 18 mω cm deionized distilled water ddw to minimize the effects of the media this was the washing step the washed cells underwent three freeze thaw cycles 70 25 c to induce cell lysis and then were centrifuged again the supernatant obtained from the centrifugation was filtered through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane filter hyundai micro ltd south korea and referred as the iom stock solution for each algal species the iom stock solutions were diluted to obtain 2 9 4 3 mg c l 1 of doc using ph 7 phosphate buffer after dilution the samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and analyzed within 7 days the basic water parameters of the diluted iom solutions are listed in table 1 the suva values of the tested iom solutions 1 09 2 60 mg m 1 were generally low which is in agreement with values reported in previous studies henderson et al 2008 pivokonsky et al 2014 and can be explained by the hydrophilic characteristic of algae driven organic matter concentrations of anions such as cl no2 no3 and so4 2 were below 0 05 mg l 1 after the washing process conductivities of the iom stock solutions were less than 60 μs cm 1 which increased up to 850 μs cm 1 after dilution of the stock solutions with 5 mm phosphate buffer the phosphate buffer concentration 5 mm was selected after considering the buffer capacity to fix ph during the kinetic experiments and the minimization of the effect of phosphate ions on the oh reactions because of the low reactivity and

ana and ma had a bright blue color whereas the iom solutions from chr and sce were colorless fig s1 the blue color is due to a high concentration of phycocyanin which is a constituent of blue green algae ernst et al 1992 2 3 hydroxyl radical reaction study the rate constant for the reaction between iom and oh was determined via competition kinetics in a uv h2o2 system the experiments were conducted in a bench scale quasi collimated beam apparatus bolton and linden 2003 equipped with three 15 w low pressure lamps bestec co taiwan which primarily emitted uv light at 253 7 nm a 100 ml aliquot of experimental solution was placed in capped rectangular quartz reactor which was quasi parallel irradiated the reactor was 5 cm in length 3 cm in width and 10 5 cm in height a stir bar 0 5

uvx radiometer uvp co usa the average incident uv irradiance was determined as 1 07 mw cm 2 room temperature 23 2 c was maintained during the experiment the experiments for rate constants were repeated at least four times 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd lc ocd is an analytical technique for identification and quantification of nom constituents based on molecular weight mw in aquatic environments lc ocd consists of size exclusion chromatography sec with an organic carbon detector ocd based on a gräntzel thin film reactor 2000 v 40 ma and a uv detector measuring at 254 nm it divides the components of organic matter into six fractions hydrophobic organic carbons hoc biopolymers humic substances hs building blocks low molecular weight lmw acids and lmw neutrals biopolymers have the highest mw followed by hs building blocks and lmw acids and neutrals bosire et al 2016 gonzález et al 2013 huber et al 2011 this separation occurs by means of porous particles included in the size exclusion column the smaller substances can be easily captured by pores than the larger substances therefore they flow out and reach the ocd later than the larger substances do meanwhile the large substances can readily pass through the chromatographic column and be detected earlier measured chromatograms from the ocd were fractionated using the fiffikus program doc labor germany a phosphate buffer with ph 6 85 at a flow rate of 1 4 ml min 1 was used as the mobile phase more detailed information on the fundamental scheme of lc ocd is described by huber et al 2011 2 4 2 fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factors analysis feem parafac feem spectra for the iom solutions were scanned over excitation ranges of 230 550 nm by 5 nm intervals and emission ranges of 250 600 nm by 2 nm intervals using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi high technologies japan the excitation and emission slits were 10 nm each and the photomultiplier tube pmt voltage was 600 v the scanning speed was 1200 nm min 1 to minimize the background effect of the spectra feem spectra for 5 mm phosphate buffer a blank of the diluted iom solution were subtracted from the feem spectra of each iom sample bahram et al 2006 these pretreated feem spectra were imported into the domfluor v 1 7 toolbox using matlab mathworks natick ma usa to perform parafac modeling the missing values had a value of 23 via elimination of rayleigh and raman scatter peaks several diagnostic methods such as matching contours examining spectral loadings and inspecting residual spectra were performed to find an appropriate model parafac models with two to seven components were generated and split half validation explained variation

and loading values from the parafac analysis were plotted in filled contour form in the sigma plot 10 0 program spss inc finally the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 was used to compare the parafac components in the current study with previously reported data to gather specific information regarding the components 2 4 3 additional analyses organic matter concentration was determined

matter with hydroxyl radicals to investigate the impact of iom on the oh reaction reaction kinetics of ohs with organic matter were evaluated using the uv h2o2 system which could generate oh through the photolytic decomposition of h2o2 baxendale and wilson 1957 glaze et al 1987 fig 1 shows the degradation of pcba as a function of uv dose in the presence of 20 mg l 1 of h2o2 and different kinds of dom i e sce iom 4 25 mg c l 1 ana iom 3 20 mg c l 1 and srha 4 50 mg c l 1 pcba is commonly used as a oh probe compound in the uv h2o2 system because it has high reactivity with oh k oh p cba 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 neta and dorfman 1968 but low photolytic reactivity rosenfeldt and linden 2007 the degradation rates of pcba varied considerably with the type of organic matter fig 1 the higher degradation rate of pcba indicates a lower oh scavenging rate by organic matter because pcba competes with organic matter for the reaction with oh for the srha solution the removal rate of pcba in the srha solution was notably higher than that in other solutions even though the doc of the srha solution was higher than those of the others were this is primarily because dom reactivity toward oh is highly dependent on the origin nature and composition of the dom to compare the degradation rates of pcba for each condition uv fluence based rate constants cm2 mj 1 were determined fig s2 shows a good linear relationship between ln pcba pcba 0 and uv dose indicating that the reaction followed pseudo first order kinetics the fluence based determined rate constant for the srha 0 0196 cm2 mj 1 was 5 4 times higher than that for the sce iom 0 0036 cm2 mj 1 with similar doc concentrations 4 5 mg c l 1 srha and 4 3 mg c l 1 sce iom the fluence based rate constant for the ana iom 0 0102 cm2 mj 1 was lower than that for the srha despite the lower concentration of ana iom 3 2 mg c l 1 than of srha 4 5 mg c l 1 these results indicate that the sce iom and ana iom had higher radical scavenging rates than srha did because of the higher reactivity of sce iom and ana iom with oh the chr iom and ma iom data are available in fig s2 to compare the oh reactivity of the iom samples with that of previously studied dom brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 1999 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 the second order rate constants between oh and the iom were determined based on the competition kinetics method using pcba and t buoh in the uv h2o2 system the initial concentration of t buoh was varied from 0 mm to 0 20 mm and the initial concentrations of pcba and h2o2 were fixed at 1 μm and 20 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 shows the experimental results of the competition kinetics for the calculation of the second order rate constants using the following equations katsoyiannis et al 2011 1 k p cba a p p k oh p cba oh ss k oh p cba α oh k oh iom iom k oh t buoh t buoh k oh p cba p cba k oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 2 1 k p cba a p p k oh t buoh k oh p cba α oh t

constant of pcba s 1 and k oh m is the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and compound m k oh p cba 5 0 109 m 1 s 1 neta and dorfman 1968 k oh t buoh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1998 and k oh h 2 o 2 2 7 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 oh ss is the steady state concentration of oh m and α oh is the formation rate of oh m s 1 the factors a and b in eq 3 could be determined by plotting 1 k p cba a p p as a function of the concentration of the competitive scavenger t buoh eq 2 and fig 2 with slope a and intercept b respectively to verify the method and rate constants determined in this study the second order rate constant for the reaction between oh and a well characterized organic matter i e srha was also measured the determined rate constant in this study k oh s r h a 1 45 108 mc 1 s 1 was very similar to the reported value reported by donham et al 2014 1 37 108 mc 1 s 1 indicating the reliability of the measurement method table 2 lists the determined second order rate constants for the reactions between iom and oh interestingly the rate constants for the reactions of oh with iom 4 0 8 0 108 mc 1 s 1 were about 2 6 times higher than that with srha as well as those with dom reported for rivers and lakes of 1 0 3 5 108 mc 1 s 1 brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 donham et al 2014 reisz et al 2003 westerhoff et al 2007 wols and hofman caris 2012 this implies that the formation of iom during algal bloom season could adversely affect the removal of target pollutants because iom and target compounds compete for the oh radical reactions although the number of tested algal species was limited the rate constants determined for the iom of the tested algal species tended to differ depending on the algal group the rate constants of the green algae iom k oh chr iom 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 and k oh sce iom 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 were approximately two times higher than the rate constants of the blue green algae iom k oh ana iom 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 and k oh ma iom 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 to interpret the different oh reactivity of the four iom the characteristics of each iom were investigated as described in the next section the data reported in this section emphasize that 1 iom has higher reactivity with oh than dom species reported in the literature and 2 the performance of aops could be degraded by the influence of iom during algal bloom season therefore the specific oh kinetic parameters for each process e g scavenging factor r ct and r oh o3 elovitz and von gunten 1999 kwon et al 2017 rosenfeldt and linden 2007 yong and lin 2012 should be monitored during algal bloom season for safe and efficient operation involving aops 3 2 characteristics of intracellular algogenic organic matter feem parafac and lc ocd techniques were applied to investigate the characteristics of iom and their relationships with the second order rate constants determined iom solution conditions for this characterization were the same as those used in the oh reaction kinetic study analyses were conducted at least three times for each algal species 3 2 1 liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd to identify and quantify iom constituents the extracted iom solutions from four different algal species were analyzed using the lc ocd technique fig 3 shows the analysis results for the six different fractions i e biopolymers hs building blocks lmw acids lmw neutrals and hoc which were determined from raw ocd chromatograms fig s3 the low proportion of hoc less than 20 in all the iom solutions represents the hydrophilic properties of iom ghernaout 2014 which is consistent with the results of the suva values table 1 and the previous studies henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 pivokonsky et al 2014 concerning all the iom samples the highest proportion of constituents was analyzed to be lmw neutrals fig 3 which indicated that the iom samples mainly contained small mw compounds 350 g mol 1 including amino acids alcohols and aldehydes it was notably different from the results reported for srha 80 hs and other dom ahn et al 2017 hajibabania et al 2011 maeng et al 2012 vera et al 2017b the proportion of lmw neutrals varied in the following order chr iom 65 sce iom 53 ana iom 48 ma iom 38 the next common constituents were building blocks which are known to have mw from 300 to 500 g mol 1 the order of the highest to lowest proportion of building blocks was the opposite of that for lmw neutrals ma iom 29 ana iom 20 sce iom 18 chr iom 15 interestingly only ana iom 22 and ma iom 16 which are blue green algal species contained hs which has humic acids like and fulvic acids like in varying amounts with a relatively high mws range 100 100 000 g mol 1 bosire et al 2016 gonzález et al 2013 huber et al 2011 one of the plausible reasons for the presence of hs in the ana iom and ma iom is the phycocyanin in blue green algae phycocyanin is a pigment protein complex reported to have a broad mw range i e 15 000 to 130 000 g mol 1 berns et al 1963 patel et al 2005 scott and berns 1965 containing cyanotoxins is also characteristic of blue green algae and it may contribute to the hs fraction the proportions of biopolymers 20 000 g mol 1 and lmw acids 350 g mol 1 were less than 7 for all the tested iom samples these results show that the ana iom and ma iom had higher mw organic compounds than the chr iom and sce iom did 3 2 2 fluorescence excitation emission matrix and parallel factor analysis feem parafac feem was applied to characterize the iom based on physico chemical characteristics fig 4 shows the feem contours of the iom for the four algal species iom commonly contained feem peaks at ex em 230 240 290 390 nm and 260 290 290 390 nm representing soluble microbial like and aromatic protein like regions chen et al 2003 hudson et al 2007 the presence of dominant protein like fluorophores in iom was expected because protein like fluorophores usually originate in the cells of organism hudson et al 2007 this result was in agreement with those of previous feem studies on algal derived organic matter henderson et al 2008 li et al 2012 2014 wang et al 2014 interestingly a notable difference between the green algae iom and blue green algae iom used in this study was observed at ex em 230 240 420 490 nm 250 270 420 490 nm and 330 390 420 490 nm these fluorescence peaks have been reported to be humic or fulvic acid like fluorophores chen et al 2003 that are classified as humic substances derived from breakdown products of plants or soil materials in terrestrial or aquatic conditions the tested green algal species chr iom and sce iom had no humic and fulvic acid like peaks in the feem contours but the blue green algal species ana iom and ma iom did this result is accordance with the hs fraction results from the lc ocd analysis parafac modeling was conducted to interpret the underlying feem spectra a total of 61 feem data points were used for the parafac analysis with four components acquired as the best fit result of the modeling fig 5 and s4 fig 6 shows the fraction of components in the chr sce ana and ma iom component 1 c1 which was indicated as tryptophan like compounds in table 3 constitutes more than 70 of the parafac components for all the iom samples component 4 c4 accounted for 5 16 of the iom s component fraction c4 is expected to be protein like compounds tyrosine like based on its maximum loading spectra and fluorescence peak regions chen et al 2003 even though it was not found in previous studies table 3 and fig s5 this previously unreported component possibly will be reported to the public domain i e openfluor database as an inherent characteristic of iom component 2 and 3 c2 and c3 respectively which were indicated as humic like materials in table 3 comprised a low proportion of the iom s components this iom composition based on parafac analysis was notably different than those of nom in rivers and lakes as nom usually originates in soil leaves and plants as opposed to iom s origination in cells ahn et al 2017 aryal et al 2016 fellman et al 2008 hiriart baer et al 2013 peleato et al 2016 among the iom samples chr iom 88 and sce iom 94 contained larger c1 fractions than ana iom 79 and ma iom 74 did regarding the humic like materials ma iom contained a relatively higher proportion of c2 20 than chr iom sce iom and ana iom did below 4 comparing the blue green algae iom the difference found in c2 between ana iom and ma iom possibly suggests that they have different hs compositions ana iom contained a significantly lower c2 fraction than ma iom did in contrast to their similarity in hs fraction based on the lc ocd analysis this means that most of the hs composition for the ana iom did not show fluorescence properties in contrast to what the ma iom showed leading to an inconsistency between the lc ocd and fluorescence analyses results based on the fluorescence analysis iom was found to mainly consist of protein related fluorophores c1 and c4 which contrasts the composition of typical nom and chr iom and sce iom contained more protein related fluorophores than ana iom and ma iom did 3 3 influential factors on the hydroxyl radical reactivity of iom for interpretation of the different oh reactivity between the iom the relationships between iom characteristics and rate constants were investigated one of the possible factors influencing oh reactivity is the presence of the nitrogen containing compounds in iom based on the results of the lc ocd and fluorescent analyses the iom was found to consist of a high proportion of these nitrogen containing compounds via lmw neutrals protein like regions and c1 the lmw neutrals that comprised the largest fraction of all the iom samples are considered amino acids because the iom originated inside organisms the dominant proportion of c1 tryptophan like an aromatic amino acid containing two fused rings with nh in the iom also supports amino acids as a main constituent of the lmw neutrals in contrast the characteristics of nom show a low proportion of protein like components and lmw neutrals and a rather high proportion of humic related components or ha fractions as reported in many studies ahn et al 2017 hajibabania et al 2011 maeng et al 2012 the aromatic amino acids including tryptophan like and tyrosine like have been reported to have high rate constants with oh 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 under pathways of h abstraction stadtman 1993 and oh addition mujika et al 2013 in addition mangalgiri et al 2017 reported that nitrogen containing compounds tryptophan like had greater reactivity with oh than other humic like materials did owing to the high reactivity of nitrogen containing compounds with oh the high proportion of those compounds in iom may be considered an important factor in the determination of the rate constant for the reaction between iom and oh this assumption could explain not only the higher rate constant for the reaction of iom with oh than that with commonly studied dom but also the difference in rate constants for each iom reacting with oh however it is difficult to affirm that individual chemical characteristic factors exclusively influenced the reactivity with oh in practice the correlation results of the nitrogen containing fraction or component were only partially valid fig 7 a c this is because bulk organic matter comprises complex molecules with diverse compounds therefore it is difficult for individual chemical parameters to exclusively dominate the rate constant for the reactions with oh donham et al 2014 mckay et al 2014 westerhoff et al 2007 the iom mw also can be considered a possible factor that considerably affects reactivity with oh from this study the iom had higher rate constants in their reactions with oh in accordance with the lower percentage of high mw fractions biopolymers and humic substances and the higher percentage of low mw fractions 350 g mol 1 the chr iom and sce iom high mw fractions 2 and 7 respectively low mw fractions 66 and 57 respectively had two times higher rate constants in their reactions with oh than the ana iom and ma iom did high mw fractions 25 and 20 respectively low mw fractions 47 and 38 respectively one of the many studies on the reactivity of organic matter with oh suggested a similar tendency for effluent organic matter efom dong et al 2010 reported that the 1 kda fraction of efom the smallest apparent mw fraction in that study had the highest rate constants for reactions with oh followed by the 3 5 and 10 kda fractions with the bulk solution coming in last they concluded that a higher percentage of large molecules in organic matter lowered the reactivity with oh the plausible reason for this was that the three dimensional structure of organic matter becomes more complex and aggregative with increasing mw leading to a decline in the likelihood of oh accessing each of the carbon entities similar to that of dwindling surface area the limitation on access to some carbon entities reduces the rate constant for oh reactions as oh does diffusion controlled reaction therefore the higher percentage of high mw fractions in organic matter may reduce the rate constant for oh reactions conversely the larger portion of low mw fractions in organic matter likely leads to an increase in the rate constant for oh reactions fig 7 shows a good inversely proportional correlation between the percentage of high mw fractions and the rate constants and partial correlation between the percentage of the low mw fractions and the rate constants therefore this consideration is acceptable however owing to the complexity of the characteristics and structures of organic matter a detailed study should be conducted in the future to determine the cause of the influence on the rate of oh reactions the difference in the hs composition did not play a significant role in the determination of the reaction rate between iom and oh as the ana iom and ma iom were suspected of having different humic matter characteristics but were similarly reactive with oh the other characterization factors such as the suva values and the fraction of hoc table 1 and fig 3 and s6 could not explain why the iom samples reacted differently with oh although limited the results in this section emphasize that the characteristics of low mw and nitrogen containing compounds of iom could lead to high oh reactivity further research is needed on the various iom contents of different algal species in order to perform statistical analysis 4 conclusions in this study iom was extracted from four algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus sp anabaena sp and microcystis aeruginosa and the characteristics of the iom and its reactivity with oh were investigated based on the characterization using lc ocd and feem parafac analyses an attempt was made to determine the factors responsible for the difference in the rate constants for the reactions between the iom of the four algal species and oh the conclusions are presented as follows the determined second order rate constants of iom with oh varied in the following order chr iom 7 95 108 mc 1 s 1 sce iom 6 71 108 mc 1 s 1 ma iom 4 45 108 mc 1 s 1 ana iom 4 02 108 mc 1 s 1 the determined rate constants of iom with oh were approximately 2 6 times higher than the reported rate constant with dom in surface water from the lc ocd analysis all tested iom samples mainly comprised low mw component fractions lmw neutrals with hydrophilic characteristics among the iom samples the ana iom and ma iom blue green algal species had higher mw compounds than the chr iom and sce iom did green algal species feem parafac results showed that the iom mainly consisted of tryptophan like fluorophores which are protein like compounds the ma iom contained a higher amount of humic acid like materials than the other iom samples tested did the presence of nitrogen containing compounds in iom could be an influential factor in determining the reactivity of the iom with oh owing to their high reactivity with oh mw is also an important factor in the reactivity with oh because the possibility of oh reaching each carbon entity is likely to decrease with increasing mw owing to the complex and aggregated three dimensional structure of large molecules when aops are applied to treat micropollutants in the presence of iom the high reactivity of iom with oh can negatively influence the removal rate of the target pollutants because the iom and target compounds compete for the oh reactions in contrast if aops are applied for mineralization the presence of iom could improve the performance because of the high reactivity of iom with oh acknowledgements this research was supported by a national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msip nrf 2016r1a2b4015598 appendix a supplementary data the

19347,two column pairs filled with 3 05 m of a sandy soil from the upper san gabriel valley were operated for a period of four and ½ years on municipal effluent from the san jose creek water reclamation plant operated by the sanitation districts of los angeles county lacsd one column pair was fed filtered chlorinated effluent tertiary effluent for the entire period the other pair was fed ozonated secondary effluent for 8 mo ozonated secondary effluent filtered through biological activated carbon o3 bac for 7 mo and tertiary effluent for 38 mo each column pair was operated in series where the first column was operated for a shorter residence time and the second column for a longer residence time residence times tested were 5 d 28 d 30 d 58 d 60 d 150 d and 180 d for the last 38 mo both pairs of columns had a residence time of 30 d in the first column and the total residence time of the two pairs was 150 and 180 d respectively testing showed both of these pairs had the same long term performance the column pairs with a 150 to 180 d residence time which were both fed tertiary effluent reached an effluent total organic carbon toc of 1 8 mg l column pairs with a 28 to 30 d residence time which were fed tertiary ozonated and o3 bac effluent reached effluent tocs of 2 3 2 1 and 1 8 mg l respectively in the latter some toc removal was shifted from the soil columns to the bac during the last 38 months of testing using tertiary effluent as the source water a series of sampling events was performed throughout the soil column system for n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and chemicals of emerging concern cecs ndma was substantially reduced in all the columns with a median value of 3 ng l after 30 d and 2 ng l after both 150 and 180 d twenty one cecs were found in the majority of tertiary effluent samples twelve of which were attenuated by the soil columns and the remaining were not chemicals found to be recalcitrant were 4 nonylphenol acesulfame k carbamazepine

introduction in 2009 the california state water board established a mandate to increase the use of recycled water in the state by one million acre feet year afy 1 2 109 m3 y by 2020 and by two million afy 2 5 109 m3 y by 2030 caswrcb 2009 in support of this mandate the state promulgated regulations governing the use of recycled municipal wastewater for groundwater replenishment ddw 2015a under these regulations replenishment can be accomplished either by surface spreading or by subsurface injection treatment with reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation is required preceding subsurface injection in the case of surface spreading wastewater from a conventional biological treatment plant must undergo media filtration and disinfection and significant blending is also required this study was done in support of a groundwater replenishment project proposed in the upper san gabriel valley in southern california that will employ surface spreading of effluent from the san jose creek water reclamation plant sjcwrp operated by the los angeles county sanitation districts lacsd surface spreading relies on soil aquifer treatment sat a managed aquifer recharge mar strategy which takes advantage of natural biological and physicochemical processes to remove organic contaminants and pathogens from the water as it passes through the soil bouwer and rice 1984 the treated effluent is spread onto the surface and percolates into the aquifer through the vadose zone until it reaches the saturated zone and comingles with groundwater the aquifer materials in the zones affected by the augmentation behave as a support media for natural biofilms that remove contaminants and pathogens improving the water quality fox et al 2001 under some circumstances they can also support adsorption liu et al 2017 the california regulations for surface spreading require that projects be managed so that no drinking water that is withdrawn from an aquifer augmented by recycled water contains more than 0 5 mg l of total organic carbon toc of wastewater origin this requirement is met through a combination of treatment and dilution well treated municipal effluents often have a toc ten to fifteen times higher than the 0 5 mg l requirement and most projects have limited water available for dilution so this regulation makes establishing the toc removal which can be achieved by this type of managed aquifer recharge an important issue ddw 2015a surface spreading has been used for sewage disposal for centuries but efforts to study and understand the spreading of highly treated municipal effluent to recharge groundwater aquifers began in the latter half of the twentieth century in 1962 the lacsd began the whittier narrows reclamation project one of the most notable surface spreading operations for potable reuse in the world parkhurst and garrison 1963 in 1967 agricultural research service u s department of agriculture in cooperation with the salt river project began the flushing meadows project which studied the reclamation of secondary effluent by infiltration into the sands of the riverbed of the salt river near phoenix az bouwer et al 1974 shortly afterward faculty at stanford university formalized the idea of groundwater recharge as part of managing the water cycle tchobanoglous and eliassen 1969 in 1975 authorities in israel began the dan region project which recharged a regional groundwater aquifer with oxidation pond effluent from the tel aviv metropolitan area after it had received physicochemical treatment idelovitch 1978 based on the pattern of removal for bulk organic matter with time idelovitch 1978 concluded that the soil aquifer treatment system operated as a biological process as it was shown that it could provide considerable reduction of organic content for an indefinite period then in 1984 both bouwer and rice and idelovitch and michail independently formally introduced the term soil aquifer treatment sat to characterize the process bouwer and rice 1984 idelovitch and michail 1984 since that time there have been numerous studies both at field sites and in pilot and bench scale soil columns which have set out to improve our understanding of the sat process how it works what it can do studies in tucson showed bulk organics removal is primarily biological in nature quanrad et al 1996 studies in berlin showed adsorption does not play a significant role in dissolved organic carbon doc removal and that the removal of poorly degradable organics continues to improve over a 400 d period drewes and jekel 1998 results from four field sites in two states showed that a doc levels after sat were similar regardless of the pretreatment provided b that rapid removal of hydrophilic organic matter occurs in early stage of sat whereas in the later stage both hydrophobic and hydrophilic matter are removed but at a much slower rate and toc removal is sustainable does not diminish over time fox et al 2001 characterization of effluent organic matter efom before and after sat showed that efom is transformed to closely resemble background natural organic matter nom drewes et al 2006 finally several studies have shown that preozonation removes several chemicals of emerging concern cecs which are refractory to sat while also accelerating the rate and perhaps the overall extent of toc removal in the sat process itself drewes and jekel 1998 trussell et al 2015 zucker et al 2015 the toc removal results from several bench pilot and field studies are summarized in the supplementary information text s1 reported removals range from 27 to 90 depending on many variables the quality of the water fed to the sat process the time of operation the time of exposure the quality of the soil etc one of the principal purposes of this study is through simulation with test columns to estimate the long term toc removal that might occur with the sat process in the coarse sandy soils like those found in the upper san gabriel valley aquifer work in previous studies has shown that performance in removal of bulk organics toc gradually improves as the residence time in the aquifer grows longer and as the operation of the sat system continues drewes and jekel 1998 prior to this work most controlled column studies operated for a shorter period in this study the soil columns were operated under controlled conditions with the effluent of the same wastewater treatment plant for a period of 53 months and for the last 38 months at very long hydraulic residence times 150 180 d n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is also an important issue where sat is concerned as ndma is usually present in both chloraminated and ozonated secondary effluents najm and trussell 2001 mitch et al 2003 serna et al 2014 ndma is a probable carcinogen us epa 2014 and even though there are no current regulations establishing a maximum contaminant level mcl for ndma california has a notification level nl of 10 ng l for ndma ddw 2015b and australia and canada have guidelines of 10 and 40 ng l respectively ephc 2008 health canada 2011 in many circumstances ndma destruction is accomplished with high uv doses sharpless and linden 2003 but uv can be costly in wastewater effluents where the transmittance is low gerrity et al 2014 so there is a continuing interest in alternative methods of attenuation some time ago ndma degradation was demonstrated in aqueous soil systems kaplan and kaplan 1985 but biodegradation was not consistently observed in the field mitch et al 2003 later sharp et al 2005 showed that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes have the capability to degrade ndma under aerobic conditions specifically those produced during the aerobic degradation of methane or propane five years later benchtop studies demonstrated an aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr seeded with an organism known to express monooxygenase enzymes sharp et al 2010 and supplemented with propane could degrade ndma from 7400 to 3 0 ng l in 28 5 h hartzinger et al 2010 finally at low ndma levels found in wastewater effluents it is unlikely that organisms would be able to sustain growth on ndma as primary substrate hence cometabolic rather than metabolic degradation is likely to be the dominant mechanism sharp et al 2005 thus whether this cometabolism of ndma will occur in the soil system at a particular sat project may depend on the presence of suitable substrates as a result another purpose of this study is to confirm the degree to which ndma removal might be expected to procede under the conditions of the upper san gabriel valley project the removal of cecs in mar is also a complex process as cecs are unregulated safe levels are not formally established analytical methods are rapidly developing a different list of cecs are targeted from one project to the next and many of the cecs targeted for analysis are found to be below detection limits in the secondary effluent itself some compounds like atenolol iopromide fluoxetine and gemfibrozil are usually removed while others like primidone carbamazepine meprobamate and tcep are rarely removed laws et al 2011 as pointed out in a review by hiscock and grischek 2002 the removal of cecs in a mar system can occur via various mechanisms including biodegradation adsorption chemical oxidation and precipitation adsorption can be important for some cecs notably sulfamethoxazole liu et al 2017 but for many soluble cecs the most sustainable mechanism over the long term is biodegradation nevertheless california regulations require that indicators be selected from among the cecs in the wastewater and that the removal of selected indicators be demonstrated ddw 2015a thus another aim of this work is to establish the sustainable cec attenuation that can be expected with these same columns while operating on filtered chlorinated effluent tertiary effluent 2 methods soil columns 2 1 design and construction of soil columns two pairs of polyvinyl chloride pvc soil columns were used all four columns were 3 66 m in height and each was filled with 3 05 m of soil coarse to medium sand with little silt or clay obtained from an upper san gabriel valley quarry and sieved to remove particles greater than 2 mm the upper san gabriel valley quarry was used for source material as the experiments were to simulate soil aquifer treatment through spreading grounds located in the immediate vicinity two columns had inside diameters of 152 mm and two 202 mm the system was configured so that each pair of soil columns named g and y column pairs consisted of a 202 mm inner diameter column to receive the influent water g1 and y1 and a 152 mm inner diameter column connected in series with those columns g2 and y2 operating on the effluent from the first column the columns were clear pvc wrapped with a black polyethylene film peristaltic pumps were used to achieve a precise flowrate corresponding to the targeted hydraulic retention times hrts for each column in each phase of the testing the hrt was originally set based on soil porosities measured on the bench and further adjusted following the results of tracer studies trussell et al 2015 the porosity of the soil was determined to be 33 fig 1 shows the soil columns during operation more detail on the configuration of the soil columns the material source and tracer studies are described in the supplementary information texts s2 s3 and s4 2 2 influent water the influent water to the soil columns is the effluent from the west side of the sjcwrp operated by lacsd which treats up to 142 ml d of municipal wastewater the plant configuration consists of primary settling tanks followed by activated sludge process in nitrification and denitrification mode using a modified ludzack ettinger process tang et al 2007 secondary settling tanks sand anthracite filters and chloramination as disinfection at the full scale plant dechlorination with sulfur dioxide is achieved prior to reuse discharge for the first 15 months of testing a pilot plant was operated that treated secondary effluent from the plant with ozonation o3 toc 0 7 followed by biological activated carbon bac filtration ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent were being considered as a means of improving sat performance the tertiary effluent ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent were transported in nalgene vessels 31 km each week from whittier to a climate controlled workshop 20 c in pasadena housing the soil columns the volume of effluent transported to the workshop varied from 20 to 150 l per week depending on the hrt of the soil columns at the workshop the water was stored under refrigeration until it was fed to the columns further detail about sjcwrp can be found in the supplementary information text s5

analyses were collected regularly in rounds these rounds were timed to follow the fate of the same water throughout the columns effluent samples were collected in an autoclaved amber bottle placed inside the sampling fridge with effluent tubing from the desired column inside the bottle until the necessary sample volume had been collected typical times required to collect a sample ranged from 5 h for a column running at a 5 d hrt to 8 days for a column running at a 180 d hrt the sample was then transferred to individual sample bottles provided by the lab samples for ndma analysis were collected in amber bottles containing sodium azide and sodium thiosulfate to prevent microbial activity and stored at 4 c until the delivery to eurofins eaton analytical laboratory monrovia ca and weck laboratories hacienda heights ca eurofins laboratories uses the epa 521 method while weck laboratories uses a modification of the epa 1625 method the eem samples and blanks were placed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette corrected for raman scattering and for any other interferences by subtracting the ultrapure water eem the range of wavelengths in the excitation emission data acquisition was from 200 nm to 470 nm with a 1 nm increment inner and masking filters from the aqualog software were used to further treat the results to generate the matrices used for the plots a matlab mathworks usa code was used to create the plots the method used was previously described in gerrity et al 2011 modified from chen et al 2003 cecs were analyzed by eurofins using a unique lc ms ms method with on line extraction and analysis that detects 98 cecs at low ng l levels in one run vanderford et al 2014 this analysis package has been optimized to target compounds observed in wastewaters throughout the united states and is widely used eaton and hagani 2016 additional detail can be found in supplementary information text s6 2 4 testing periods this discussion draws on the results of four testing periods sponsored by four sequential studies during which the same four columns containing the same soil were operated on effluent from the same source the studies are referred to as 1 wrrf 12 12 2 mwd faf 3 interim testing and 4 extended testing a summary of the periods with the corresponding influent waters to the columns is illustrated in table 1 while the hrt of each one is reported in table 2 a brief description of each phase is introduced below and further information can be found in the supplementary information text s7 2 4 1 wrrf 12 12 the first period funded by the water reuse research foundation project 12 12 enhancing the soil aquifer treatment process for potable reuse established an active acclimated biofilm in the soil columns and examined their side by side performance treating secondary effluent after filtration chlorination and dechlorination tertiary effluent and the same secondary effluent after ozonation at a dose of approximately 0 7 mgo3 mgtoc ozonated effluent the ozone process is further described in the supplementary information text s7 during acclimation the g columns were fed tertiary effluent and the y columns were fed ozonated effluent in both cases the first columns g1 and y1 represented the vadose zone and were operated downflow at an hrt of 5 days while the second columns g2 and y2 operated in series with the first columns represented the saturated zone and were operated upflow at an hrt of 25 days these travel times were selected as five days was the estimated travel time in the vadose zone for the full scale project and 30 days is the location for the first monitoring well for projects in california ddw 2015a the wrrf 12 12 project operated the columns in this fashion for 8 months 2 4 2 mwd faf the second period of testing was funded by the metropolitan water district of southern california through its foundational actions funding program mwd faf this project was a 9 month program with some overlap with the last 90 days of wrrf 12 12 the purpose of the mwd faf program was to examine the benefit of adding bac to the ozone treatment train as a result during mwd faf the influent water to the y columns was changed from ozonated effluent to o3 bac effluent the empty bed contact time ebct of the bac filter was 19 min the o3 bac system is described in more detail in the supplementary information text s7 also during this period both y columns were operated upflow at an hrt of 28 days the filtrate from column y1 being used as the feed for column y2 so that the two columns together achieved an hrt of 56 days this testing lasted for approximately 7 months throughout mwd faf the g columns were fed tertiary effluent and operated in parallel in the upflow mode with an hrt of 30 days but water quality was not monitored 2 4 2 1 interim testing the third period of testing included in this discussion followed the mwd faf project occurred for an 11 month period from november 2014 to october 2015 and is referred to as interim testing during this period both the g columns and the y columns were fed dechlorinated tertiary effluent the g1 and y1 were operated upflow with an hrt of 30 days g2 was operated on g1 filtrate upflow at an hrt of 120 days 150 days total and y2 operated on y1 filtrate at an hrt of 150 days 180 days total during this phase of the study both sets of columns were monitored for toc and other basic water quality parameters with the exception of the final 3 months of the test period where neither column was monitored but operations were maintained g columns also had ndma concentrations monitored in this monitoring the influent was collected on specific days so that based on tracer results the effluent and influent water samples would correspond to one another 2 4 2 2 extended testing the fourth and last period of testing included in this discussion followed the interim testing and is referred to as extended testing this testing continued with the same operating conditions as in the interim testing from october 2015 through february 2018 during this period ndma concentrations were monitored in both column systems in the last year two different laboratories conducted the ndma analyses both the interim testing and the extended testing were funded by the upper san gabriel valley municipal water district 3 results and discussion 3 1 total organic carbon with the exception of the g columns during the mwd faf period and a 3 month period at the end of interim testing for both columns influent and effluent samples from each column were collected weekly since the beginning of the study and toc concentrations were recorded over time and are displayed in fig 2 performance through the interim testing period is summarized in table 3 with the average percentage removal after each column in each phase as well as the average effluent concentrations the removal shown is the overall removal starting with the toc of the water entering the first column the results for toc removal for each study period are discussed below 3 1 1 wrrf 12 12 after an acclimation period of 4 months reliable and consistent removal seemed to be achieved 40 toc removal and data started being collected the y columns fed with ozonated effluent outperformed the g columns fed with dechlorinated tertiary effluent for toc removal 62 vs 44 removal ozone is known to break down the unsaturated bonds in nom and efom increasing the fraction of the toc which is assimilable by bacteria often referred to as the biodegradable organic carbon bdoc improved performance in toc removal by biologically active filters fed with ozonated water was demonstrated in drinking water decades ago sontheimer et al 1978 and has recently been confirmed in recycled water as well trussell et al 2013 2016 halle et al 2015 ozonation also increases the do levels in the effluent which serves as an electron acceptor to the aerobic microbiota colonizing the sand columns these conditions have also been shown to be important for ndma degradation sharp et al 2010 columns g2 and y2 represent a longer contact time 30 days in total and higher removal was accomplished once the columns had reached quasi steady state operation during this period they were able to reduce the toc of the tertiary effluent from 5 9 to 3 3 mg l and the toc of the ozonated effluent from 5 5 to 2 1 mg l 3 1 2 mwd faf the y columns had a change in the influent water type as well as a change in contact time using o3 bac effluent instead of ozonated effluent during this study period the same ozonated secondary effluent used in the y columns in wrrf 12 12 underwent biological filtration on activated carbon with an ebct of 15 min o3 bac this additional filtration step decreased the average influent toc concentration to the soil columns significantly 3 9 mg l after o3 bac vs 5 5 mg l prior p 0 05 and reduced the bdoc available for the microbial community in the soil columns therefore the average toc removal in the soil columns during this period was lower than in the previous one 54 vs 62 even though the average toc removal during this phase was significant the final effluent toc concentration was only modestly reduced from the previous period 1 8 mg l vs 2 1 mg l considering that there was an additional filtration step and that the hrt was almost twice that used earlier 56 days vs 30 days these results could imply that a bac step might not enhance overall removal significantly if toc removal is the primary objective 3 1 3 interim testing during this operating period the influent to the y columns was changed once again from o3 bac effluent to the same tertiary effluent now both column systems were operating on tertiary effluent at the beginning of this period the g columns performed modestly better than they had at the end of wrrf 12 12 when they were last monitored perhaps due to an increase in overall hrt from 30 to 150 days during interim testing the columns were operated for a period of nearly 300 days but monitoring ceased after 177 days because of funding limitations the y columns began interim testing showing distinctly higher toc removal than the g columns but this enhanced performance dissipated over time what appeared to be enhanced performance was likely due to the 150 days it took to displace the residual o3 bac effluent remaining in the column this is confirmed by the fact that the enhanced performance continued only 22 days beyond the hrt of the y column nevertheless toc seemed to gradually not suddenly increase in the y columns during the test and even at the end the y columns retain a modest but discernible advantage 3 1 4 extended testing during this last period in the study the g columns and y columns continued to operate at a cumulative hrt of 150 days and 180 days respectively and all the columns appeared to be operating in a steady state condition although the y columns were fed ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent in the early periods of the study dechlorinated tertiary effluent was fed to them from the beginning of interim testing a total exposure of 38 months 11 months prior to extended testing and it appears these column were also well adapted to tertiary effluent by the end of the interim testing period fig 2 displays the results of 27 months of monitoring during this period which is 4 5 hrts for the column pair with the longest retention time and table 4 displays the statistics on toc for the 27 mo extended testing period as there are a large number of samples application of the student t test 2 tails 2 samples unequal variance suggests that the differences in the mean toc from each of the columns is statistically significant p 0 05 but even if these differences are real the additional improvement between 150 and 180 d has little practical benefit the results in both fig 2 and table 4 do show a meaningful difference between y1 g1 hrt 30 d and y2 g2 hrt 180 150 d the 30 d columns y1 g1 achieve a removal of 57 59 and a final toc of 2 3 2 4 mg l whereas the long hrt columns y2 g2 achieve a removal of 67 68 and a final toc of 1 8 mg l 3 1 5 characterizing the organic matter in this study the character of the dissolved organic matter dom was examined in a preliminary way using the pattern of absorbance and fluorescence in the uv spectrum or the eem gerrity et al 2011 classified eem in three regions 1 soluble microbial products ex 300 em 380 nm 2 fulvic acids em 300 nm ex 380 nm and 3 humic acids em 300 the first of these regions soluble microbial products smp is the principal distinction between efom and nom as observed by others baker 2001 westerhoff et al 2001 ning et al 2012 typical eem results taken during extended testing are displayed in fig 3 the figure demonstrates that during soil column treatment the fluorophores responsible for excitation emission intensity dissipate in all three of these regions the tertiary effluent exhibits a clear smp peak 270 290 320 370 characteristic of efom and this peak completely dissipates during soil column treatment it is almost completely gone in the 30 d column but clearly absent in both the 150 and 180 d columns an indication that not only is a substantial portion of the toc being degraded as was shown earlier but from the standpoint of the eem measurement the dom that remains is becoming less like efom and more like nom results consistent with those of xue et al 2009 see text s8 for more details 3 1 6 overall results from the mwd faf period suggested the use of o3 bac as a pretreatment can allow the achievement of toc degradation in soil columns in 56 days that is equivalent to what can be achieved at much longer hrts with tertiary effluent as demonstrated during extended testing see fig 2 and table 4 where tertiary effluent was concerned the final effluent toc concentrations in both sets of columns decreased since the beginning of the study certainly until july 2016 about 34 months of operation this study s data showed that when the columns had been in service for longer periods toc removal was enhanced and lower toc levels were achieved the improvement in effluent quality with time of operation has been observed in other studies and was attributed to the further acclimation of the microbial community in the soil columns drewes and jekel 1998 fox et al 2001 even though the effluent toc concentrations were dropping through most of the four and a half years of this study it is likely that there was a practical limit to this improvement and it appears to have reached a point of diminishing returns in this study fig 2 shows no consistent improvement after july 2016 34 months into the study the results shown here suggest that long term studies 30 months or more may be necessary in order fully assess the potential for toc removal by microbial degradation in tertiary effluents for projects using recycled municipal wastewater for groundwater recharge this study demonstrates that the tertiary effluent of the sjcwrp after going through 150 d of treatment in soil columns can reduce the toc of the tertiary effluent from 5 57 to 1 82 mg l or an overall toc reduction of 67 the study also demonstrates that the same removal can be achieved in 150 days as in 180 days although the bulk of the removal 58 takes place in the first 30 days based on this work for the circumstances of the upper san gabriel valley project an effluent receiving 30 days of sat would result in a toc between 2 3 and 2 4 mg l 3 2 n nitrosodimethylamine samples were collected throughout all the periods of testing for ndma analysis in the latter periods of testing where both the y and g columns were operated in a similar way ndma testing focused more on the g columns in order to control costs table 5 summarizes the average ndma concentrations in the different columns during the first three test periods as well as its removal for this table values of 2 ng l were counted as equal to 2 ng l for purposes of calculating the average although this is a conservative calculation it does not meet strict statistical standards fig 4 displays the levels of ndma in the influent and in each of the column effluents through thirteen rounds of testing conducted during interim testing and extended testing where tertiary effluent was the feed supply table 6 summarizes the statistics for ndma during the last 27 mo of testing to avoid misrepresenting the influence of less than values in this table median values are shown and to provide perspective on variance the range of results and the number of samples above and below the detection limit are also shown the median ndma reduction in the 30 d columns was from 901 to 3 ng l or 99 7 and the highest effluent measurement was 23 ng l where seven of the ten measurements found ndma above the detection limit for the 150 and 180 d columns the median value was 2 ng l the highest measurement was 7 6 ng l and 5 of the 15 samples were above the detection limit 3 3 chemicals of emerging concern cecs during the last two periods of testing while operating conditions remained unchanged five rounds of sampling were conducted for 98 cecs in the tertiary effluent in the effluent from g1 30 d in the effluent from g2 150 d and in the effluent from y2 180 d a complete list of the cecs sampled along with their

tertiary samples but occasionally appeared in soil column effluents some of these like 4 t octylphenol may be byproducts of biodegradation others may be non biodegradable compounds present at levels near the detection limit throughout the process e g atrazine polyparabin or warfarin but most of them are thought to be due to cross contamination or analytical error e g amoxicillin and estriol which

carbamazepine lidocaine primidone simazine sucralose sulfamethoxazole and tcep as mentioned earlier there are a number of possible mechanisms for organics removal in soil columns no special tests were conducted as part of this study to prove the mechanism of removal but the removal observed is thought to be largely biological for the following reasons first a consistent level of removal has been sustained for a long time second the soil in these columns was coarse to medium sand with little silt or clay and as a result the potential for adsorption is limited third others have demonstrated that bulk organic removal is largely biological see introduction and finally sulfamethoxazole which is known to be removed by adsorption more than biodegradation liu et al 2016 was not removed 4 conclusions the results of these studies suggest that the sat process simulated in these test soil columns 150 to 180 d of residence time in the sandy alluvium of the upper san gabriel valley aquifer can be expected to reduce the average toc of the tertiary effluent from the sjcwrp w from 5 5 to 1 8 mg l to reduce ndma in the tertiary effluent from as high as 1000 ng l to below the limits of detection testing also showed that 12 of the 21 cecs which were found in the majority of tertiary effluent samples will be attenuated but several may not be recalcitrant compounds identified were

19347,two column pairs filled with 3 05 m of a sandy soil from the upper san gabriel valley were operated for a period of four and ½ years on municipal effluent from the san jose creek water reclamation plant operated by the sanitation districts of los angeles county lacsd one column pair was fed filtered chlorinated effluent tertiary effluent for the entire period the other pair was fed ozonated secondary effluent for 8 mo ozonated secondary effluent filtered through biological activated carbon o3 bac for 7 mo and tertiary effluent for 38 mo each column pair was operated in series

mo both pairs of columns had a residence time of 30 d in the first column and the total residence time of the two pairs was 150 and 180 d respectively testing showed both of these pairs had the same long term performance the column pairs with a 150 to 180 d residence time which were both fed tertiary effluent reached an effluent total organic carbon toc of 1 8 mg l column pairs with a 28 to 30 d residence time which were fed tertiary ozonated and o3 bac effluent reached effluent tocs of 2 3 2 1 and 1 8 mg l respectively in the latter some toc removal was shifted from the soil columns to the

introduction in 2009 the california state water board established a mandate to increase the use of recycled water in the state by one million acre feet year afy 1 2 109 m3 y by 2020 and by two million afy 2 5 109 m3 y by 2030 caswrcb 2009 in support of this mandate the state promulgated regulations governing the use of recycled municipal wastewater for groundwater replenishment ddw 2015a under these regulations replenishment can be accomplished either by surface spreading or by subsurface injection treatment with reverse osmosis and advanced oxidation is required preceding subsurface injection in the case of surface spreading wastewater from a conventional biological treatment plant must undergo media filtration and disinfection and significant blending is also required this study was done in support of a groundwater replenishment project proposed in the upper san gabriel valley in southern california that will employ surface spreading of effluent from the san jose creek water reclamation plant sjcwrp operated by the los angeles county sanitation districts lacsd surface spreading relies on soil aquifer treatment sat a managed aquifer recharge mar strategy which takes advantage of natural biological and physicochemical processes to remove organic contaminants and pathogens from the water as it passes through the soil bouwer and rice 1984 the treated effluent is spread onto the surface and percolates into the aquifer through the vadose zone until it reaches the saturated zone and comingles with groundwater the aquifer materials in the zones affected by the augmentation behave as a support media for natural biofilms that remove contaminants and pathogens improving the water quality fox et al 2001 under some circumstances they can also support adsorption liu et al 2017 the california regulations for surface spreading require that projects be managed so that no drinking water that is withdrawn from an aquifer augmented by recycled water contains more than 0 5 mg l of total organic carbon toc of wastewater origin this requirement is met through a combination of treatment and dilution well treated municipal effluents often have a toc ten to fifteen times higher than the 0 5 mg l requirement and most projects have limited water available for dilution so this regulation makes establishing the toc removal which can be achieved by this type of managed aquifer recharge an important issue ddw 2015a surface spreading has been used for sewage disposal for centuries but efforts to study and understand the spreading of highly treated municipal effluent to recharge groundwater aquifers began in the latter half of the twentieth century in 1962 the lacsd began the whittier narrows reclamation project one of the most notable surface spreading operations for potable reuse in the world parkhurst and garrison 1963 in 1967 agricultural research service u s department of agriculture in cooperation with the salt river project began the flushing meadows project which studied the reclamation of secondary effluent by infiltration into the sands of the riverbed of the salt river near phoenix az bouwer et al 1974 shortly afterward faculty at stanford university formalized the idea of groundwater recharge as part of managing the water cycle tchobanoglous and eliassen 1969 in 1975 authorities in israel began the dan region project which recharged a regional groundwater aquifer with oxidation pond effluent from the tel aviv metropolitan area after it had received physicochemical treatment idelovitch 1978 based on the pattern of removal for bulk organic matter with time idelovitch 1978 concluded that the soil aquifer treatment system operated as a biological process as it was shown that it could provide considerable reduction of organic content for an indefinite period then in 1984 both bouwer and rice and idelovitch and michail independently formally introduced the term soil aquifer treatment sat to characterize the process bouwer and rice 1984 idelovitch and michail 1984 since that time there have been numerous studies both at field sites and in pilot and bench scale soil columns which have set out to improve our understanding of the sat process how it works what it can do studies in tucson showed bulk organics removal is primarily biological in nature quanrad et al 1996 studies in berlin showed adsorption does not play a significant role in dissolved organic carbon doc removal and that the removal of poorly degradable organics continues to improve over a 400 d period drewes and jekel 1998 results from four field sites in two states showed that a doc levels after sat were similar regardless of the pretreatment provided b that rapid removal of hydrophilic organic matter occurs in early stage of sat whereas in the later stage both hydrophobic and hydrophilic matter are removed but at a much slower rate and toc removal is sustainable does not diminish over time fox et al 2001 characterization of effluent organic matter efom before and after sat showed that efom is transformed to closely resemble background natural organic matter nom drewes et al 2006 finally several studies have shown that preozonation removes several chemicals of emerging concern cecs which are refractory to sat while also accelerating the rate and perhaps the overall extent of toc removal in the sat process itself drewes and jekel 1998 trussell et al 2015 zucker et al 2015 the toc removal results from several bench pilot and field studies are summarized in the supplementary information text s1 reported removals range from 27 to 90 depending on many variables the quality of the water fed to the sat process the time of operation the time of exposure the quality of the soil etc one of the principal purposes of this study is through simulation with test columns to estimate the long term toc removal that might occur with the sat process in the coarse sandy soils like those found in the upper san gabriel valley aquifer work in previous studies has shown that performance in removal of bulk organics toc gradually improves as the residence time in the aquifer grows longer and as the operation of the sat system continues drewes and jekel 1998 prior to this work most controlled column studies operated for a shorter period in this study the soil columns were operated under controlled conditions with the effluent of the same wastewater treatment plant for a period of 53 months and for the last 38 months at very long hydraulic residence times 150 180 d n nitrosodimethylamine ndma is also an important issue where sat is concerned as ndma is usually present in both chloraminated and ozonated secondary effluents najm and trussell 2001 mitch et al 2003 serna et al 2014 ndma is a probable carcinogen us epa 2014 and even though there are no current regulations establishing a maximum contaminant level mcl for ndma california has a notification level nl of 10 ng l for ndma ddw 2015b and australia and canada have guidelines of 10 and 40 ng l respectively ephc 2008 health canada 2011 in many circumstances ndma destruction is accomplished with high uv doses sharpless and linden 2003 but uv can be costly in wastewater effluents where the transmittance is low gerrity et al 2014 so there is a continuing interest in alternative methods of attenuation some time ago ndma degradation was demonstrated in aqueous soil systems kaplan and kaplan 1985 but biodegradation was not consistently observed in the field mitch et al 2003 later sharp et al 2005 showed that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes have the capability to degrade ndma under aerobic conditions specifically those produced during the aerobic degradation of methane or propane five years later benchtop studies demonstrated an aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr seeded with an organism known to express monooxygenase enzymes sharp et al 2010 and supplemented with propane could degrade ndma from 7400 to 3 0 ng l in 28 5 h hartzinger et al 2010 finally at low ndma levels found in wastewater effluents it is unlikely that organisms would be able to sustain growth on ndma as primary substrate hence cometabolic rather than metabolic degradation is likely to be the dominant mechanism sharp et al 2005 thus whether this cometabolism of ndma will occur in the soil system at a particular sat project may depend on the presence of suitable substrates as a result another purpose of this study is to confirm the degree to which ndma removal might be expected to procede under the conditions of the upper san gabriel valley project the removal of cecs in mar is also a complex process as cecs are unregulated safe levels are not formally established analytical methods are rapidly developing a different list of cecs are targeted from one project to the next and many of the cecs targeted for analysis are found to be below detection limits in the secondary effluent itself some compounds like atenolol iopromide fluoxetine and gemfibrozil are usually removed while others like primidone carbamazepine meprobamate and tcep are rarely removed laws et al 2011 as pointed out in a review by hiscock and grischek 2002 the removal of cecs in a mar system can occur via various mechanisms including biodegradation adsorption chemical oxidation and precipitation adsorption can be important for some cecs notably sulfamethoxazole liu et al 2017 but for many soluble cecs the most sustainable mechanism over the long term is biodegradation nevertheless california regulations require that indicators be selected from among the cecs in the wastewater and that the removal of selected indicators be demonstrated ddw 2015a thus another aim of this work is to establish the sustainable cec attenuation that can be expected with these same columns while operating on filtered chlorinated effluent tertiary effluent 2 methods soil columns 2 1 design and construction of soil columns two pairs of polyvinyl chloride pvc soil columns were used all four columns were 3 66 m in height and each was filled with 3 05 m of soil coarse to medium sand with little silt or clay obtained from an upper san gabriel valley quarry and sieved to remove particles greater than 2 mm the upper san gabriel valley quarry was used for source material as the experiments were to simulate soil aquifer treatment through spreading grounds located in the immediate vicinity two columns had inside diameters of 152 mm and two 202 mm the system was configured so that each pair of soil columns named g and y column pairs consisted of a 202 mm inner diameter column to receive the influent water g1 and y1 and a 152 mm inner diameter column connected in series with those columns g2 and y2 operating on the effluent from the first column the columns were clear pvc wrapped with a black polyethylene film peristaltic pumps were used to achieve a precise flowrate corresponding to the targeted hydraulic retention times hrts for each column in each phase of the testing the hrt was originally set based on soil porosities measured on the bench and further adjusted following the results of tracer studies trussell et al 2015 the porosity of the soil was determined to be 33 fig 1 shows the soil columns during operation more detail on the configuration of the soil columns the material source and tracer studies are described in the supplementary information texts s2 s3 and s4 2 2 influent water the influent water to the soil columns is the effluent from the west side of the sjcwrp operated by lacsd which treats up to 142 ml d of municipal wastewater the plant configuration consists of primary settling tanks followed by activated sludge process in nitrification and denitrification mode using a modified ludzack ettinger process tang et al 2007 secondary settling tanks sand anthracite filters and chloramination as disinfection at the full scale plant dechlorination with sulfur dioxide is achieved prior to reuse discharge for the first 15 months of testing a pilot plant was operated that treated secondary effluent from the plant with ozonation o3 toc 0 7 followed by biological activated carbon bac filtration ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent were being considered as a means of improving sat performance the tertiary effluent ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent were transported in nalgene vessels 31 km each week from whittier to a climate controlled workshop 20 c in pasadena housing the soil columns the volume of effluent transported to the workshop varied from 20 to 150 l per week depending on the hrt of the soil columns at the workshop the water was stored under refrigeration until it was fed to the columns further detail about sjcwrp can be found in the supplementary information text s5

analyses were collected regularly in rounds these rounds were timed to follow the fate of the same water throughout the columns effluent samples were collected in an autoclaved amber bottle placed inside the sampling fridge with effluent tubing from the desired column inside the bottle until the necessary sample volume had been collected typical times required to collect a sample ranged from 5 h for a column running at a 5 d hrt to 8 days for a column running at a 180 d hrt the sample was then transferred to individual sample bottles provided by the lab samples for ndma analysis were collected in amber bottles containing sodium azide and sodium thiosulfate to prevent microbial activity and stored at 4 c until the delivery to eurofins eaton analytical laboratory monrovia ca and weck laboratories hacienda heights ca eurofins laboratories uses the epa 521 method while weck laboratories uses a modification of the epa 1625 method the eem samples and blanks were placed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette corrected for raman scattering and for any other interferences by subtracting the ultrapure water eem the range of wavelengths in the excitation emission data acquisition was from 200 nm to 470 nm with a 1 nm increment inner and masking filters from the aqualog software were used to further treat the results to generate the matrices used for the plots a matlab mathworks usa code was used to create the plots the method used was previously described in gerrity et al 2011 modified from chen et al 2003 cecs were analyzed by eurofins using a unique lc ms ms method with on line extraction and analysis that detects 98 cecs at low ng l levels in one run vanderford et al 2014 this analysis package has been optimized to target compounds observed in wastewaters throughout the united states and is widely used eaton and hagani 2016 additional detail can be found in supplementary information text s6 2 4 testing periods this discussion draws on the results of four testing periods sponsored by four sequential studies during which the same four columns containing the same soil were operated on effluent from the same source the studies are referred to as 1 wrrf 12 12 2 mwd faf 3 interim testing and 4 extended testing a summary of the periods with the corresponding influent waters to the columns is illustrated in table 1 while the hrt of each one is reported in table 2 a brief description of each phase is introduced below and further information can be found in the supplementary information text s7 2 4 1 wrrf 12 12 the first period funded by the water reuse research foundation project 12 12 enhancing the soil aquifer treatment process for potable reuse established an active acclimated biofilm in the soil columns and examined their side by side performance treating secondary effluent after filtration chlorination and dechlorination tertiary effluent and the same secondary effluent after ozonation at a dose of approximately 0 7 mgo3 mgtoc ozonated effluent the ozone process is further described in the supplementary information text s7 during acclimation the g columns were fed tertiary effluent and the y columns were fed ozonated effluent in both cases the first columns g1 and y1 represented the vadose zone and were operated downflow at an hrt of 5 days while the second columns g2 and y2 operated in series with the first columns represented the saturated zone and were operated upflow at an hrt of 25 days these travel times were selected as five days was the estimated travel time in the vadose zone for the full scale project and 30 days is the location for the first monitoring well for projects in california ddw 2015a the wrrf 12 12 project operated the columns in this fashion for 8 months 2 4 2 mwd faf the second period of testing was funded by the metropolitan water district of southern california through its foundational actions funding program mwd faf this project was a 9 month program with some overlap with the last 90 days of wrrf 12 12 the purpose of the mwd faf program was to examine the benefit of adding bac to the ozone treatment train as a result during mwd faf the influent water to the y columns was changed from ozonated effluent to o3 bac effluent the empty bed contact time ebct of the bac filter was 19 min the o3 bac system is described in more detail in the supplementary information text s7 also during this period both y columns were operated upflow at an hrt of 28 days the filtrate from column y1 being used as the feed for column y2 so that the two columns together achieved an hrt of 56 days this testing lasted for approximately 7 months throughout mwd faf the g columns were fed tertiary effluent and operated in parallel in the upflow mode with an hrt of 30 days but water quality was not monitored 2 4 2 1 interim testing the third period of testing included in this discussion followed the mwd faf project occurred for an 11 month period from november 2014 to october 2015 and is referred to as interim testing during this period both the g columns and the y columns were fed dechlorinated tertiary effluent the g1 and y1 were operated upflow with an hrt of 30 days g2 was operated on g1 filtrate upflow at an hrt of 120 days 150 days total and y2 operated on y1 filtrate at an hrt of 150 days 180 days total during this phase of the study both sets of columns were monitored for toc and other basic water quality parameters with the exception of the final 3 months of the test period where neither column was monitored but operations were maintained g columns also had ndma concentrations monitored in this monitoring the influent was collected on specific days so that based on tracer results the effluent and influent water samples would correspond to one another 2 4 2 2 extended testing the fourth and last period of testing included in this discussion followed the interim testing and is referred to as extended testing this testing continued with the same operating conditions as in the interim testing from october 2015 through february 2018 during this period ndma concentrations were monitored in both column systems in the last year two different laboratories conducted the ndma analyses both the interim testing and the extended testing were funded by the upper san gabriel valley municipal water district 3 results and discussion 3 1 total organic carbon with the exception of the g columns during the mwd faf period and a 3 month period at the end of interim testing for both columns influent and effluent samples from each column were collected weekly since the beginning of the study and toc concentrations were recorded over time and are displayed in fig 2 performance through the interim testing period is summarized in table 3 with the average percentage removal after each column in each phase as well as the average effluent concentrations the removal shown is the overall removal starting with the toc of the water entering the first column the results for toc removal for each study period are discussed below 3 1 1 wrrf 12 12 after an acclimation period of 4 months reliable and consistent removal seemed to be achieved 40 toc removal and data started being collected the y columns fed with ozonated effluent outperformed the g columns fed with dechlorinated tertiary effluent for toc removal 62 vs 44 removal ozone is known to break down the unsaturated bonds in nom and efom increasing the fraction of the toc which is assimilable by bacteria often referred to as the biodegradable organic carbon bdoc improved performance in toc removal by biologically active filters fed with ozonated water was demonstrated in drinking water decades ago sontheimer et al 1978 and has recently been confirmed in recycled water as well trussell et al 2013 2016 halle et al 2015 ozonation also increases the do levels in the effluent which serves as an electron acceptor to the aerobic microbiota colonizing the sand columns these conditions have also been shown to be important for ndma degradation sharp et al 2010 columns g2 and y2 represent a longer contact time 30 days in total and higher removal was accomplished once the columns had reached quasi steady state operation during this period they were able to reduce the toc of the tertiary effluent from 5 9 to 3 3 mg l and the toc of the ozonated effluent from 5 5 to 2 1 mg l 3 1 2 mwd faf the y columns had a change in the influent water type as well as a change in contact time using o3 bac effluent instead of ozonated effluent during this study period the same ozonated secondary effluent used in the y columns in wrrf 12 12 underwent biological filtration on activated carbon with an ebct of 15 min o3 bac this additional filtration step decreased the average influent toc concentration to the soil columns significantly 3 9 mg l after o3 bac vs 5 5 mg l prior p 0 05 and reduced the bdoc available for the microbial community in the soil columns therefore the average toc removal in the soil columns during this period was lower than in the previous one 54 vs 62 even though the average toc removal during this phase was significant the final effluent toc concentration was only modestly reduced from the previous period 1 8 mg l vs 2 1 mg l considering that there was an additional filtration step and that the hrt was almost twice that used earlier 56 days vs 30 days these results could imply that a bac step might not enhance overall removal significantly if toc removal is the primary objective 3 1 3 interim testing during this operating period the influent to the y columns was changed once again from o3 bac effluent to the same tertiary effluent now both column systems were operating on tertiary effluent at the beginning of this period the g columns performed modestly better than they had at the end of wrrf 12 12 when they were last monitored perhaps due to an increase in overall hrt from 30 to 150 days during interim testing the columns were operated for a period of nearly 300 days but monitoring ceased after 177 days because of funding limitations the y columns began interim testing showing distinctly higher toc removal than the g columns but this enhanced performance dissipated over time what appeared to be enhanced performance was likely due to the 150 days it took to displace the residual o3 bac effluent remaining in the column this is confirmed by the fact that the enhanced performance continued only 22 days beyond the hrt of the y column nevertheless toc seemed to gradually not suddenly increase in the y columns during the test and even at the end the y columns retain a modest but discernible advantage 3 1 4 extended testing during this last period in the study the g columns and y columns continued to operate at a cumulative hrt of 150 days and 180 days respectively and all the columns appeared to be operating in a steady state condition although the y columns were fed ozonated effluent and o3 bac effluent in the early periods of the study dechlorinated tertiary effluent was fed to them from the beginning of interim testing a total exposure of 38 months 11 months prior to extended testing and it appears these column were also well adapted to tertiary effluent by the end of the interim testing period fig 2 displays the results of 27 months of monitoring during this period which is 4 5 hrts for the column pair with the longest retention time and table 4 displays the statistics on toc for the 27 mo extended testing period as there are a large number of samples application of the student t test 2 tails 2 samples unequal variance suggests that the differences in the mean toc from each of the columns is statistically significant p 0 05 but even if these differences are real the additional improvement between 150 and 180 d has little practical benefit the results in both fig 2 and table 4 do show a meaningful difference between y1 g1 hrt 30 d and y2 g2 hrt 180 150 d the 30 d columns y1 g1 achieve a removal of 57 59 and a final toc of 2 3 2 4 mg l whereas the long hrt columns y2 g2 achieve a removal of 67 68 and a final toc of 1 8 mg l 3 1 5 characterizing the organic matter in this study the character of the dissolved organic matter dom was examined in a preliminary way using the pattern of absorbance and fluorescence in the uv spectrum or the eem gerrity et al 2011 classified eem in three regions 1 soluble microbial products ex 300 em 380 nm 2 fulvic acids em 300 nm ex 380 nm and 3 humic acids em 300 the first of these regions soluble microbial products smp is the principal distinction between efom and nom as observed by others baker 2001 westerhoff et al 2001 ning et al 2012 typical eem results taken during extended testing are displayed in fig 3 the figure demonstrates that during soil column treatment the fluorophores responsible for excitation emission intensity dissipate in all three of these regions the tertiary effluent exhibits a clear smp peak 270 290 320 370 characteristic of efom and this peak completely dissipates during soil column treatment it is almost completely gone in the 30 d column but clearly absent in both the 150 and 180 d columns an indication that not only is a substantial portion of the toc being degraded as was shown earlier but from the standpoint of the eem measurement the dom that remains is becoming less like efom and more like nom results consistent with those of xue et al 2009 see text s8 for more details 3 1 6 overall results from the mwd faf period suggested the use of o3 bac as a pretreatment can allow the achievement of toc degradation in soil columns in 56 days that is equivalent to what can be achieved at much longer hrts with tertiary effluent as demonstrated during extended testing see fig 2 and table 4 where tertiary effluent was concerned the final effluent toc concentrations in both sets of columns decreased since the beginning of the study certainly until july 2016 about 34 months of operation this study s data showed that when the columns had been in service for longer periods toc removal was enhanced and lower toc levels were achieved the improvement in effluent quality with time of operation has been observed in other studies and was attributed to the further acclimation of the microbial community in the soil columns drewes and jekel 1998 fox et al 2001 even though the effluent toc concentrations were dropping through most of the four and a half years of this study it is likely that there was a practical limit to this improvement and it appears to have reached a point of diminishing returns in this study fig 2 shows no consistent improvement after july 2016 34 months into the study the results shown here suggest that long term studies 30 months or more may be necessary in order fully assess the potential for toc removal by microbial degradation in tertiary effluents for projects using recycled municipal wastewater for groundwater recharge this study demonstrates that the tertiary effluent of the sjcwrp after going through 150 d of treatment in soil columns can reduce the toc of the tertiary effluent from 5 57 to 1 82 mg l or an overall toc reduction of 67 the study also demonstrates that the same removal can be achieved in 150 days as in 180 days although the bulk of the removal 58 takes place in the first 30 days based on this work for the circumstances of the upper san gabriel valley project an effluent receiving 30 days of sat would result in a toc between 2 3 and 2 4 mg l 3 2 n nitrosodimethylamine samples were collected throughout all the periods of testing for ndma analysis in the latter periods of testing where both the y and g columns were operated in a similar way ndma testing focused more on the g columns in order to control costs table 5 summarizes the average ndma concentrations in the different columns during the first three test periods as well as its removal for this table values of 2 ng l were counted as equal to 2 ng l for purposes of calculating the average although this is a conservative calculation it does not meet strict statistical standards fig 4 displays the levels of ndma in the influent and in each of the column effluents through thirteen rounds of testing conducted during interim testing and extended testing where tertiary effluent was the feed supply table 6 summarizes the statistics for ndma during the last 27 mo of testing to avoid misrepresenting the influence of less than values in this table median values are shown and to provide perspective on variance the range of results and the number of samples above and below the detection limit are also shown the median ndma reduction in the 30 d columns was from 901 to 3 ng l or 99 7 and the highest effluent measurement was 23 ng l where seven of the ten measurements found ndma above the detection limit for the 150 and 180 d columns the median value was 2 ng l the highest measurement was 7 6 ng l and 5 of the 15 samples were above the detection limit 3 3 chemicals of emerging concern cecs during the last two periods of testing while operating conditions remained unchanged five rounds of sampling were conducted for 98 cecs in the tertiary effluent in the effluent from g1 30 d in the effluent from g2 150 d and in the effluent from y2 180 d a complete list of the cecs sampled along with their detection limits and a summary of the results is included in the supplemental information text s9 of these 98 cecs 34 were never detected in any sample and an additional 13 cecs were absent in the tertiary samples but occasionally appeared in soil column effluents some of these like 4 t octylphenol may be byproducts of biodegradation others may be non biodegradable compounds present at levels near the detection limit throughout the process e g atrazine polyparabin or warfarin but most of them are thought to be due to cross contamination or analytical error e g amoxicillin and estriol which were found only after the 180 d column eleven cecs were occasionally found in the tertiary samples but nowhere else table 7 summarizes the results for the twenty one compounds that were found in five

effluents of the 150 and 180 d columns where the majority of the samples were below the mdl the median is shown as nd after careful examination of these results it was concluded that twelve of these cecs were well removed atenolol bisphenol a carisprodol cotinine deet fluoxetine gemfibrozil iohexol iopromide meprobamate tcpp and tdcpp and the remainder were recalcitrant 4 nonylphenol acesulfame k carbamazepine lidocaine primidone simazine sucralose sulfamethoxazole and tcep as mentioned earlier there are a number of possible mechanisms for organics removal in soil columns no special tests were conducted as part of this study to prove the mechanism of removal but the removal observed is thought to be largely biological for the following reasons first a consistent level of removal has been sustained for a long time second the soil in these columns was coarse to medium sand with little silt or clay and as a result the potential for adsorption is limited third others have demonstrated that bulk organic removal is largely biological see introduction and finally sulfamethoxazole which is known to be removed by adsorption more than biodegradation liu et al 2016 was not removed 4 conclusions the results of these studies suggest that the sat process simulated in these test soil columns 150 to 180 d of residence time in the sandy alluvium of the upper san gabriel valley aquifer can be expected to reduce the average toc of the tertiary effluent from the sjcwrp w from 5 5 to 1 8 mg l to reduce ndma in the tertiary effluent from as high as 1000 ng l to below the limits of detection testing also showed that 12 of the 21 cecs which were found in the majority of tertiary effluent samples will be attenuated but several may not be recalcitrant compounds identified were

19348,biofilm formation on membrane surfaces causes many operational problems such as a decrease in permeate flux and an increase in hydraulic resistance in this study the ability of bacteria to pass through microfiltration mf membranes and the growth potential of microfilterable bacteria were investigated in order to understand biofouling in mf reverse osmosis ro integrated membrane systems growth of microfilterable bacteria in mf permeate was observed indicating that not all mf membranes can guarantee the total rejection of bacteria changes in natural organic matter nom characteristics and growth potential of bacteria during the treatment process are important factors in the occurrence of biofilm development in water treatment systems analysis of protein like and humic like substances in nom of two successive ro stages revealed an increase in the concentrations of both biopolymers and humic substances of ro concentrates unexpectedly the use of antiscalants was seen to enhance the growth of bacteria in the ro feed water in this study bacterial 16s rrna pyrosequencing revealed that passing source water through the mf membranes dramatically changed bacterial community structure the bacterial communities that passed through the mf steps primarily belonged to the family comamonadaceae however several bacteria groups including flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae selectively composed the biofilm community formed on the ro membranes thus understanding the selectivity and filterability of mf towards microorganisms involved in biofouling on ro membrane surfaces is crucial for the improvement of membrane related operational processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofouling filterable bacteria microfiltration nom reverse osmosis 1 introduction during biofouling microbial biofilms are formed by the initial attachment of planktonic bacteria to the conditioning layer on membrane surfaces i e seeding effect followed by the growth of sessile bacteria and the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances eps such as polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids li et al 2016 prest et al 2016 therefore the abundance of planktonic bacteria in the source water should be minimized via pretreatment prior to membrane filtration to prevent the formation of biological fouling microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf units that are located prior to ro membranes in an integrated membrane system often play a pretreatment role in separating bacteria and suspended solids from the ro feed water thus integrated membrane systems are often referred to as synergistic techniques because they combine different membrane treatment units the growth of microfilterable bacteria i e bacteria that pass through micro scale filters can initiate the development of biofilm on subsequent ro membranes bacterial communities developed on an ro membrane surface were not affected by mf pretreatment of the ro feed water herzberg et al 2010 despite previous laboratory scale mf experiments observed bacterial log removal values lrvs ranging above 5 as determined by plate counting the bacterial load in the water before entering the ro membranes was unacceptable high 103 105 cells ml 1 as determined by microscopic counting ghayeni et al 1999 considering that cultivation based methods for detecting microorganisms in water samples typically recover less than 1 of the actual bacterial diversity in the environment the bacteria that pass through mf in full scale integrated membrane plants has been traditionally underestimated bacteria are generally reported to be physically larger range in width from 0 2 to 2 μm than mf pores typically from 0 1 to 1 μm yet the ability of bacteria to pass through mf can be surprisingly high filterable bacteria are defined as small cellular forms 0 1 0 3 μm of bacteria capable of penetrating through sub micron sized membrane pores wang et al 2008 previous studies have verified the presence of 0 1 and 0 2 μm filterable bacteria in various aquatic environments e g seawater freshwater and groundwater lillis and bissonnette 2001 wang et al 2008 typically the filterable subfraction of bacteria in oligotrophic freshwater and groundwater consists of less than 10 of total bacteria lillis and bissonnette 2001 wang et al 2009 several mechanisms of bacterial penetration of an mf membrane pretreatment have been suggested 1 bacterial motility 2 bacterial growth and division and 3 shape dependent filterability according to männik et al 2009 bacteria can swim through micron channels e g 1 2 μm using their own motility moreover bacteria can penetrate sub micron width channels by cell shrinkage or division but not motility wang et al 2008 and onyango et al 2010 reported that the bacterial morphologies e g spiral and spherical shaped respectively of specific taxa influenced their filterability through submicron filters in addition low nutrient conditions also could reduce bacterial sizes lee et al 2010 fedotova et al 2012 owing to the ability to pass through mf membranes microfilterable bacteria are often highlighted when testing standard porosity membrane filters wang et al 2008 but are rarely dealt with in industrial applications ghayeni et al 1999 wang et al 2008 therefore it is important to investigate the growth ability of microfilterable bacteria which play a crucial role in bacterial passage through mf and in the subsequent development of biofouling on ro membranes in addition to the presence of bacteria biodegradable natural organic matter nom in feed water can also be a precursor to biofilm development on ro membranes among the nom components assimilable organic carbon aoc generally represents the easily biodegradable subfractions of nom that can be readily assimilated into biomass i e cells aoc measurement is widely used for predicting the bacterial regrowth and or potential for biofilm development on the water contacting surfaces of a variety of materials e g membranes and pipelines hijnen et al 2009 nguyen et al 2012 prest et al 2016 low molecular weight mw aoc cannot be completely removed by membrane filtration techniques e g mf and uf escobar and randall 2001 prest et al 2016 hijnen et al 2009 suggested that aoc concentrations in feed water should be lower than 1 μg l 1 to prevent biofouling in spiral wound membranes this threshold however is difficult to achieve via pretreatments such as membrane filtration escobar and randall 2001 prest et al 2016 considering that reported aoc concentrations in seawater and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent have been detected at concentrations up to 360 and 420 μg l 1 respectively weinrich et al 2011 vital et al 2010 it was recently revealed that the contribution of high mw aoc to bacterial growth is also significant hence the characterization of various nom components including biopolymers is important for estimating aoc sack et al 2014 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 the main objective of this study was to investigate the growth potential of filterable bacteria in the integrated membrane system and to characterize the nom present with this aim the effects of integrated membrane system on nom characteristics total cell counts bacterial adenosine triphosphate atp growth potentials and bacterial community composition were determined to overcome the limitations of culturing based methods a culture independent flow cytometry fcm application was used to understand bacterial changes e g cell count membrane permeability and filterability during the integrated membrane treatment in addition the seeding effect of filterable bacteria on ro membrane biofilms was understood for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale industrial water treatment plant a full scale industrial water treatment plant in chungcheong province korea was monitored weekly over the course of two months the surface water was pre treated via coagulation and sedimentation treatment processes in the asan drinking water treatment plant chungcheong province korea and delivered to the integrated membrane treatment plant fig 1 source water

carbon doc and 1 6 0 3 l mg 1 m 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 in brief the integrated membrane system consisted of a source water basin mf ro feed water basin and 1st and 2nd ro membrane treatment stages fig 1 to control bacteria 1 5 mg l 1 of sodium hypochlorite was added to the source water the mf process consisted of 10 pressurized hollow fiber mf units polyvinylidene

feed water the mf permeate was delivered to the ro feed water basin volume 1285 m3 the residual free chlorine was quenched by the addition of sodium bisulfate approximately 2 4 mg l 1 chemicals including 1 mg l 1 of antiscalant phosphoric acid and organic polymer based and 0 5 mg l 1 of 3 1 mixture of 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one cmit and 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one mit i e cmit mit a nonoxidizing biocide were used to prevent the development of fouling on the polyamide brackish water ro bwro membranes espa2 ld hydranautics usa operational details of ro membrane processes are listed in supplementary information table s1 finally the ph of the ro permeate was adjusted to neutral level and then the permeate was supplied to local industrial plants at a volume of approximately 119 000 m3 per day 2 2 sample collection from a full scale treatment plant we have monitored the full scale integrated membrane treatment system source water and the full scale treatment plant effluents were collected weekly from the industrial water treatment plant in total samples were collected 7 times during the study period n 7 the samples were analyzed within 5 h of collection for dissolved nom characterization all samples were filtered with a 0 1 μm syringe filter sartorius germany and analyzed thereafter also we used both unfiltered and filtered samples to analyze the flow cytometric cell counts and atp 2 3 bacterial passage and growth potentials in laboratory test integrated membrane system may use various water sources e g wastewater reuse since the bacterial properties from surface water and wwtp effluent are significantly different we simulated the bacterial passage from two water sources filterable bacteria samples were separated using a 0 1 μm sterile syringe driven filter sartorius germany from the source water of the full scale plant and tahnchon wwtp seoul korea effluent respectively two indigenous bacteria samples passed through 0 1 μm filters were cultivated at 30 c for 7 days or more with no nutritional amendment wang et al 2009 we checked the total cell counts and atp concentrations over the course of 72 h using flow cytometry and atp assaying respectively the growth phases of the bacteria in the mf filtrates were observed over 72 h of cultivation two enriched bacteria samples served as inocula for testing the growth potentials of the microfilterable bacteria moreover their bacterial communities were compared to that of the full scale effluents 2 4 analysis of nom characteristics nom characteristics were determined through liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 8 system doc labor germany and an excitation emission matrix eem lc ocd analysis was used to group doc into five subfractions namely biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 500 da low mw acids and low mw neutrals 350 da arranged in descending order by mw information on these subfractions has been described in more detail elsewhere huber et al 2011 the change in fluorescent properties of the doc was obtained via a 3d excitation emission matrix eem using a spectrofluorophotometer rf 5301pc shimadzu japan fluorescence intensities were recorded in a range of excitation ex wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm 10 nm intervals and emission em wavelengths from 280 to 600 nm 1 nm intervals the fluorescence profiles monitored in this study were t1 tryptophan like ex 220 240 nm and em 330 360 nm t2 tyrosine like ex 270 280 nm and em 330 360 nm a fulvic like ex 230 260 nm and em 400 450 nm and c humic like ex 300 340 nm and em 400 450 nm park et al 2016 2 5 flow cytometry and atp measurement bacterial abundance and viability were measured using sybr green i propidium iodide pi staining protocols and a luciferase atp assay vital et al 2012 park et al 2016 the stained cells were recorded using a partec cube 6 flow cytometer partec gmbh germany the electronic gating and cell count calculation were performed via fcs express 4 software de novo software ca usa intact damaged cell cytograms were electronically gated for cell enumeration according to the method from previous studies berney et al 2008 park et al 2016 intact cell counts were electronically gated into two representative bacterial domains low nucleic acid content lna and high nucleic acid content hna for each sample intact lna and hna bacteria were separated based on their gaps of green fluorescence signals 530 nm lna bacteria primarily consist of relatively small less active and filterable bacteria in environmental water samples gasol et al 1999 wang et al 2009 whereas hna bacteria represent a relatively large and active bacterial subfraction gasol et al 1999 park et al 2016 the growth potentials of microfilterable bacteria were determined via the method presented by vital et al 2010 all treatment effluents from the full scale plant were pasteurized at 70 c for 30 min and filtered with 0 1 μm syringe filters sartorius germany then 1 0 104 cells ml 1 of each inoculum was introduced to pasteurized water samples the inoculated samples were cultivated for 48 h at 30 c in the dark and then the growth potentials were evaluated the total cell concentration of the inoculum and grown cell count were obtained using the sybr green i staining protocol vital et al 2010 park et al 2016 bacterial atp was quantified in brief water samples were first filtered with 0 1 μm syringe filters sartorius germany then 100 μl of each atp reagent bactiter glo promega usa was added to 100 μl of the filtered free atp and unfiltered total atp water samples mixed gently incubated at 36 c for 1 min and measured via a glomax 20 20 luminometer turner biosystems usa bacterial atp was determined by subtracting the free atp from the total atp park et al 2016 2 6 bacterial community analysis the bacterial communities of the syringe filtered mf permeates and full scale water samples as well as the ro membrane biofilms were investigated by sequencing the 16s rrna gene to reveal the fate of the filterable bacteria dna was extracted from source water mf permeate ro concentrate ro biofilm filterable bacteria cultivated from the source water and wwtp effluent samples using a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usa a detailed description of rna gene sequence is given in the supplemental information taxonomical assignment were acquired in family level e g relative abundance and principal component analysis pca we have also calculated the shannon index h to compare the changes of bacterial diversity of samples in species level shannon 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of nom characteristics in a full scale integrated membrane system changes in nom characteristics during a treatment process provide crucial information for understanding the rejection efficacy in membrane water systems as well as the growth potential of indigenous bacteria park et al 2016 previously only low mw nom compounds were highlighted as major aoc components when pseudomonas fluorescens p 17 and spirillum sp strain nox were used however recent studies reported that high mw organics including biopolymers cannot be underestimated when indigenous bacteria are used for aoc assay sack et al 2014 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 in addition bacteria utilized high mw doc such as aromatic proteins and or biopolymers to a greater extent than that of low mw doc nguyen et al 2012 in order to fully understand the changes in nom profile during water treatment within a full scale integrated membrane system this study has determined the concentrations of each type of nom sub component at different stages of the purification process in the source water of the full scale integrated membrane system the doc concentration was 3 8 0 5 mg l 1 consisting of 2 biopolymers 33 humic substances 20 building blocks 7 low mw acids and 38 low mw neutrals fig 2 low mw organic matter fractions 500 da were 65 of the total doc composition eem fluorescence intensities in the t1 t2 a and c peak regions were 482 30 245 14 684 41 and 466 28 a u respectively fig s1 the doc constituents of the source water were predominated by fulvic like substances which occur naturally in soils and are relatively hydrophilic in addition suva 254 was 1 5 l mg 1 m 1 data not shown which is corresponded to a relatively hydrophilic nom characteristic in freshwater according to our previous study nom characteristics were affected by pretreatment using coagulation sedimentation park et al 2016 due to its effectiveness in the removal of hydrophobic and humic like substances integrated membrane systems often use mf units prior to ro as a pretreatment to remove particles and bacteria after mf the concentrations of doc humic substances building blocks low mw acids and neutrals did not change significantly p 0 05 the greatest significant reduction 51 was observed in biopolymers p 0 05 which mainly consisted of high mw organic matter such as polysaccharides and macromolecular proteins biopolymers are also known to include extracellular polymers and soluble microbial products which are major foulants of low pressure membranes e g mf and uf nguyen et al 2012 therefore pretreatments such as coagulation sedimentation can be effective in minimizing membrane fouling precursors however none of the eem profiles including the protein like peak regions t1 and t2 changed significantly after mf p 0 05 fig s1 this result suggest that the biopolymers rejected via mf were likely non fluorescent polysaccharides since these do not contribute to uv absorbance in the lc ocd chromatogram retention time between 20 and 40 min see fig s2 the integrated membrane treatment plant introduces sodium bisulfate phosphorus antiscalant and cmit mit to the stage 1 ro feed water basin fig 1 the treatment caused only negligible changes in doc composition and eem intensities between the mf permeate and the stage 1 ro feed p 0 05 although the changes in nom profiles were not significant the average concentration of low mw neutrals decreased by 12 and that of biopolymers increased by 30 in the stage 1 ro feed basin the low mw neutrals could have been reduced via microbial utilization since low mw neutrals are known as a major source of aoc in membrane permeates meylan et al 2007 this reduction was likely promoted by the phosphorus added as an antiscalant since phosphorus can serve as an additional source of nutrients for the indigenous bacteria sweity et al 2013 we can then suggest that observed increase in biopolymers may be related to the addition of antiscalants of which a major component is organic polymers or microbial products such as polysaccharides ro membrane treatment rejects most of the nom but also generates waste concentrates that are rich in organics and inorganics ryu et al 2016 in this study the doc concentration in the stage 1 ro concentrate increased to 20 mg l 1 which was 6 fold higher than that of the feed water the stage 1 ro concentrate consists of 2 38 26 7 and 27 of biopolymers humic substances building blocks low mw acids and low mw neutrals respectively fig 2 the rates of increase of all eem profiles were similar to that of the doc concentration 5 or 6 fold increase fig s1 because of the rejection of dissolved nom fluorophores and doc as the stage 1 ro concentrate was sequentially fed to the stage 2 ro membranes the doc in the stage 2 ro concentrate increased significantly from 20 to 59 mg l 1 p 0 05 while each of the eem profiles also increased 3 fold interestingly the relative abundances of low mw acids and neutrals slightly decreased from 7 to 4 and from 26 to 23 respectively in stage 2 ro concentrate eventually humic substances became predominant in the ro concentrates 39 in contrast ryu et al 2016 reported that the ro concentrate derived from wwtp effluent consisted mainly of building blocks followed by low mw neutrals and acids therefore characteristics of ro membrane concentrates could differ per water sources and experimental conditions in the ro permeate most of the doc and the eem intensities were significantly reduced p 0 05 but 0 2 mg l 1 of low mw neutrals was still detected fig 2 low mw neutrals and acids unexpectedly passed through the ro membranes and the low mw neutrals were prevalent 81 in doc composition of the stage 2 ro permeate according to zhang et al 2014 the doc concentration of ro permeate depends on that of the feed water used moreover low mw organics could effectively pass through seawater ro membranes alshahri et al 2017 shan et al 2009 reported that low mw neutrals could adsorb onto polyamide ro membranes and eventually pass through them generally the industrial plants need ultrapure water which is often produced by ro process therefore remaining low mw organics can be a problem 3 2 bacteriological characteristics in a full scale integrated membrane system intact damaged cell counts and bacterial atp assays were carried out to determine the change of bacterial abundance and viability respectively in a full scale integrated membrane system n 7 fig 3 intact and damaged cell counts in the source water accounted for 37 and 63 of the total cell counts 9 6 2 5 105 cells ml 1 respectively bacterial atp concentration of the source water was 266 94 ng l 1 the cell counts and bacterial atp in the source water were relatively low compared with those of freshwater as reported in our previous study 2 106 total cells ml 1 and 600 ng l 1 bacterial atp park et al 2016 likely owing to pretreatment of the source water in the mf permeate 85 of the total cell count and 63 of bacterial atp were dramatically excluded from the source water p 0 05 however bacterial passage through mf resulted in a relatively high residual cell count in the mf permeate of 1 5 1 0 105 cells ml 1 ghayeni et al 1999 has reported that the bacterial log removal via lab scale mf membranes i e using 0 05 0 2 and 0 1 μm polycarbonate and 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes was considerably higher i e up to 4 than that observed in our results from a full scale mf lrv 0 8 the observed bacterial passage through full scale mf membranes indicated that either the occurrence of membrane damage or the presence of the microfilterable form of bacteria in the feed water external pressure also influences a reduction in bacterial cell volume this volume reduction comes with the cell deformation the magnitude of this process is determined by cell mechanical properties such as cell wall flexibility thus operational pressure can select for certain type of bacteria depending on their characteristics such as size shape surface charge but also the cell wall structure and flexibility lebleu et al 2009 according to fcm measurement the relative composition of hna cells which are relatively large and active wang et al 2009 hammes and egli 2010 was increased in full scale mf permeate fig s3 we initially expected that lna bacteria which have smaller biovolume would be predominant in all the mf permeates but hna bacteria were more abundant than lna bacteria in the full scale mf permeate considering that full scale systems have many operational and environmental variables the mf membrane units may have been damaged and thus allowed the passage of relatively large bacteria unexpectedly hence we suggest that fcm can be applied as a tool to detect failures in mf based water treatment systems the stage 1 ro feed water contained sodium bisulfate phosphorus antiscalant and cmit mit interestingly the intact cell counts was not seen to differ significantly p 0 05 in the stage 1 ro feed in addition no significant change in bacterial atp was observed between the mf permeate and ro feed p 0 05 this results suggest that the 0 5 ppm of cmit mit did not effectively reduce the microbial activity different factors can be associated with the unexpectedly boost of bacterial growth in the ro feed water basin including the insufficient biocide addition of phosphorus antiscalant and the natural water constituents i e bacterial abundance their activity and nom substrates all these factors could induce the development of biofilms or biofouling in the subsequent ro membranes and negatively influence their performance the total cell intact damaged cells count in the stage 1 ro concentrate was 73 of that detected in the source water a turnover of intact damaged cells was also observed between the stage 1 ro feed and concentrates the relative abundance of intact cells increased from 54 to 76 bacterial atp increased to 9 times that of the stage 1 ro feed water total cell counts and bacterial atp in the stage 2 ro concentrate were 1 5 0 8 106 cells ml 1 and 884 344 ng l 1 respectively bacteria separated via ro membranes were still biologically active with respect to intact cell abundance 75 and bacterial atp fig 3 cmit mit biocides are often used to inhibit the atp synthesis of microorganisms in various industrial applications williams 2007 but the atp detected in the ro concentrates showed that the biocide dosage used in this study was not effective in controlling biological growth the use of biocides to control biological growth on membranes often results in biofilm formation and subsequent after growth activity al amoudi et al 2007 biofilms formed on membranes can be resistant to biocides and disinfectants and the production of eps extracellular polymeric matrix acts as a reactive transport barrier to biocides matin et al 2011 in the stage 2 ro permeate the total cell count and bacterial atp were present at levels near the detection limit indicating that most of the bacteria had been rejected 3 3 passage of bacteria through a syringe mf filter and their growth potential after observing the bacterial passage through full scale mf units we conducted lab scale mf experiments in order to isolate microfilterable bacteria and compare the full vs lab scale mf with the new and sterile membranes e g syringe driven filter because wwtp effluent is occasionally reused in ro membrane filtration we also carried out the isolation of microfilterable bacteria derived from wwtp secondary effluent source water and wwtp effluent were filtered with a 0 1 μm syringe driven filter and the indigenous bacteria in the mf permeates were cultivated as described in wang et al 2009 prior to filtration the source water and wwtp effluent contained 0 9 106 and 4 0 106 cells ml 1 per total cell counts the hna lna bacterial compositions in the raw samples differed substantially the bacterial abundance in the wwtp effluent mainly consisted of lna bacteria up to 75 fig 4 compared to that of source water up to 33 bacterial abundance was relatively low in source water due to coagulation sedimentation as a pretreatment lna bacteria richness in secondary effluent may be due to the morphology and activity of the microbiota in activated sludge in this regard wastewater reuse via membrane treatment may allow increased bacterial passage through mf owing to lna bacteria richness in the wwtp effluent initially 3 9 104 and 2 3 104 cells ml 1 were detected in the mf permeates from the source water and wwtp effluent respectively as a result of bacterial passage through a syringe filter fig 5 the number of lna bacteria that were able to pass through the filters was higher 72 and 92 for the isolates derived from source water and wwtp effluent respectively than that of hna bacteria possibly owing to their relatively small size and lower biovolume wang et al 2008 the filterable bacteria were cultivated at 30 c for several days and periodic samples were removed and analyzed to identify the bacterial composition during regrowth hna bacteria first increased and became predominant over lna bacteria within 72 h in both samples fig 5a and b the changes in total atp concentration correlated more closely to the growth of hna bacteria r 2 0 66 than to that of lna bacteria r 2 0 27 most of the hna bacteria can be efficiently rejected via mf but they rapidly increased thereafter owing to their relatively higher biological activity e g productivity esterase activity and atp per cell count vital et al 2012 park et al 2016 regardless of their initial cell density fig 5 3 4 growth potentials of filterable bacteria in a full scale integrated membrane system bacterial growth is often limited by assimilable organic substrate and available nutrients in a water sample prest et al 2016 to determine the growth ability of filterable bacteria in water samples we performed a growth potential assay modified from vital et al 2010 that simulated bacterial growth of specific inocula e g pathogenic bacteria interacting with aoc in a full scale water treatment process therefore bacteria isolated from lab scale mf permeates were used as inocula to simulate the growth potential of filterable bacteria in a full scale membrane system fig 6 shows the changes in growth potentials for filterable bacteria derived from two different origins i e source water and wwtp effluent in the source water the growth potentials of filterable bacteria derived from the source water sw and wwtp effluent ww were 7 2 2 7 105 and 5 4 2 0 105 cells ml 1 respectively fig 6 in the mf permeate the grown cell counts of filterable bacteria sw and ww significantly decreased by 64 and 48 respectively p 0 05 since no significant change was observed in mf permeate nom composition except for biopolymers p 0 05 fig 2 this decrease in mf permeate growth potential is likely due to mf mediated removal of approximately half of the aoc which consists of high mw fractions such as biopolymers from the source water elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 in the stage 1 ro feed water the growth potential increased by 2 3 times compared to that of the mf permeate despite their similar doc compositions fig 2 this difference could be due to the introduction of chemicals such as the phosphorus based antiscalant and sodium bisulfate in the stage 1 ro feed water several studies have reported that phosphorus antiscalants can increase nutrients and substrates in ro feed water sweity et al 2013 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 therefore non phosphorus antiscalants have recently been increasingly applied hence we conducted an additional test on the effects of the phosphorus antiscalant at the same time as the growth potential test addition of 1 ppm of phosphorus antiscalant equal to the amount used in the full scale system promoted a 10 increase in bacterial growth compared to a full scale mf permeate with no antiscalant for control fig s4 in addition chlorination is used after pretreatment in the source water but the subsequent dichlorination can also cause rapid microbial growth and biofilm development on ro membranes saeed et al 2000 therefore replacing the chemicals used can reduce the increase in bacterial growth potential of the ro feed water in the ro concentrates the growth potentials increased in association with the accumulation of doc figs 2 and 6 the growth potentials in the stage 1 ro concentrates of filterable bacteria collected from source water and wwtp effluent increased by 2 2 and 1 5 times respectively and those of the stage 2 ro concentrates by 1 4 and 1 9 times respectively despite the high nom concentrations doc 20 mg l 1 of the ro concentrates the aoc concentrations in both ro concentrates were relatively low i e equivalent to 3 6 μg mg 1 aoc doc per sample compared to reported assimilable organic compositions in natural freshwaters i e higher than 16 μg mg 1 aoc doc gasol et al 1999 volk and lechevallier 2000 the growth potential in the ro permeate was very low corresponding to the negligible doc concentration in this water sample fig 2 we can conclude that the stage 2 ro permeate water may be more biologically stable in comparison with other samples because most of the available organics and nutrients will be removed after ro membrane filtration biological stability refers to the concept that water preserves the same microbial quality and normally to achieve this limit bacterial growth occurs during transport and treatments prest et al 2016 thus it is possible to hypothesise that if the available organics and nutrients are removed bacterial growth will be limited and controlled 3 5 changes in bacterial communities via mf and ro the bacterial community structures of the source water membrane permeates and an autopsied ro biofilm was investigated in order to determine the bacterial taxa that can pass through the lab and full scale mf membranes we collected the mature biofilm formed on the surface of an end of life ro membrane fig s5 in order to understand the effect of mf bacterial passage on resultant ro biofilm community structures the 16s rrna sequencing technique was used to reveal the bacteria community structures from each origin i e source water and wwtp effluent that was applied to the growth potential tests as well as in the different treatment effluents and the eventual ro biofilm sequencing results shown that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were the most predominant phyla in all the samples analyzed 92 99 per sample data not shown proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples 57 98 per sample except for the ro biofilm where bacteroidetes represented 50 of the total microbial community structure in the source water the bacteria mainly belonged to the class alphaproteobacteria 42 followed by flavobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteria and actinobacteria at the family level sphingomonadaceae 27 was followed by flavobacteriaceae 15 chitinophagaceae 12 fig 7 notably the bacterial communities changed dramatically in the mf permeate betaproteobacteria became the predominant class in the total bacterial populations of the mf permeate 65 within betaproteobacteria comamonadaceae followed by sphingomonadaceae and oxalobacteraceae were the main represented subdivisions fig 7 interestingly the laboratory bacterial samples we isolated via syringe driven filtration i e filterable bacteria derived from the source water and wwtp effluent also consisted mainly of comamonadaceae overall comamonadaceae accounted for approximately half of the sequences in the microbial communities of the full scale mf permeate ro concentrate and two laboratory bacterial isolates filterable bacteria sw and ww fig 7 comamonaceae are common inhabitants of oligotrophic environments and have been observed as important components of the microbial community structure also in sand filters in drinking water plants vandermaesen et al 2017 and in sediments of drinking water storage tanks qin et al 2017 in contrast comamonadaceae accounted for only 1 of the ro biofilm community the sphingobacteriaceae subdivision was the most prevalent in the ro biofilm community 28 followed by flavobacteriaceae 19 sphingomonadaceae 14 and mycobacteriaceae 6 fig 7 microbial diversity at the species level in the ro biofilm was relatively high h 4 3 compared to that of the mf treated water h range 2 2 3 8 per sample but it was equivalent to that of the source water h 4 1 pca analysis of the bacterial community structure at family level fig 8 shows relative distances between environmental samples with respect to water constituents such as organics inorganics and the microbiome according to the pca plotting the bacterial community of the ro biofilm was relatively similar to that of the source water and was associated to the presence of sphingomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingobacteriaceae the mf treated water and filterable bacteria samples tended to group together with the family comamonadaceae but not a clear relationship was observed between the filterable bacteria and ro biofilm community accordingly most of the comamonadaceae that passed through mf did not take part in the ro biofilm community but the filterable forms of flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae did contribute to the ro biofilm these results confirm that comamonadaceae were the main bacterial group determining the community structure of filterable bacteria while ro biofilms were selective habitats where other microbial families tended to accumulate comamonadaceae are often associated with biological instability of treated water that has readily available substrates to induce unexpected biofilm formation gao et al 2013 proctor et al 2016 therefore the richness in comamonadaceae can be related to the bacterial regrowth in the mf treated effluents previous studies also reported that filterable microbes e g hydrogenophaga hylemonella curvibacter and others often belonged to the family comamonadaceae wang et al 2008 lee et al 2010 fedotova et al 2012 these studies interestingly pointed out that the filterable comamonadaceae had short and narrow cells 0 1 0 3 μm width curved rod or spirilla moreover bacteria living under oligotrophic conditions could be observed to reduce their size compared to that in richer growth medium conditions 0 3 0 5 μm width in the present study the filterable comamonadaceae sequences mainly belonged to the genera hydrogenophaga curvibacter and limnohabitans often found in oligotrophic environments vandermaesen et al 2017 therefore bacterial passage observed in both lab and full scale mf tests in this study can be related with their cell shape and nutrient conditions in source water the families flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae have often been found in mature ro biofilm communities bereschenko et al 2007 2008 2010 barnes et al 2015 but other studies have reported that betaproteobacteria can also be found in young biofilms bereschenko et al 2010 barnes et al 2015 therefore the filterable bacteria may play a role in seeding the initial ro biofilm development in addition bereschenko et al 2010 revealed that betaproteobacteria can often colonize the outer layers of mature biofilms forming an outer microbial community that can be vulnerable to membrane cleaning schemes bereschenko et al 2011 barnes et al 2015 therefore how ro membranes are managed may also affect the specific bacterial composition of a ro biofilm in summary whereas the bacterial taxa that passed through mf likely played a role in seeding the ro biofilm several key biofouling players such as flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae can be selectively incorporated into the final mature ro biofilm community structure 4 conclusions this study provides a better understanding of microfilterable bacteria in integrated membrane treatment systems where biofouling is a critical problem our results revealed the effects of bacterial passage through mf versus ro membranes in a full scale industrial water treatment plant the bacterial removal rates via mf reported in previous studies may have been underestimated compared to that of full scale study our extensive analysis revealed that bacterial passage occurs in all mf permeates regardless of full and lab scale mf treatments because the complete rejection of environmental bacteria and biodegradable nom cannot be guaranteed through the use of mf membranes bacteria that passes through mf are able to continuously utilize substrates and reproduce thereafter in integrated membrane systems with ro membranes changes in nom composition during the course of water treatment resulted in variation in the growth potentials of filterable bacteria which are important factors in the occurrence of biofilms on ro membranes chemicals used in integrated membrane systems were also seen to affect the growth potentials of bacteria the use of phosphorus ro membrane antiscalants can boost bacterial growth if the raw water contains microfilterable bacteria notably the taxa of filterable bacteria which mainly consists of the family comamonadaceae may act as the initial seeds of ro biofilms however mature ro biofilms are often colonized by several biofouling players including flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae therefore biofilm monitoring and control strategies should target these specific microbial members to avoid adverse biofouling processes that can affect the final quality of the

19348,biofilm formation on membrane surfaces causes many operational problems such as a decrease in permeate flux and an increase in hydraulic resistance in this study the ability of bacteria to pass through microfiltration mf membranes and the growth potential of microfilterable bacteria were investigated in order to understand biofouling in mf reverse osmosis ro integrated membrane systems growth of microfilterable bacteria in mf permeate was observed indicating that not all mf membranes can guarantee the total rejection of bacteria changes in natural organic matter nom characteristics and growth potential of bacteria during the treatment process are important factors in the occurrence of biofilm development in water treatment systems analysis of protein like and humic like substances in nom of two successive ro stages revealed an increase in the concentrations of both biopolymers and humic substances of ro concentrates unexpectedly the use of antiscalants was seen to enhance the growth of bacteria in the ro feed water in this study bacterial 16s rrna pyrosequencing revealed that passing source water through the mf membranes dramatically changed bacterial community structure the bacterial communities that passed through the mf steps primarily belonged to the family comamonadaceae however several bacteria groups including flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae selectively composed the biofilm community formed on the ro membranes thus understanding the selectivity and filterability of mf towards microorganisms involved in biofouling on ro membrane surfaces is crucial for the improvement of membrane related operational processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords biofouling filterable bacteria microfiltration nom reverse osmosis 1 introduction during biofouling microbial biofilms are formed by the initial attachment of planktonic bacteria to the conditioning layer on membrane surfaces i e seeding effect followed by the growth of sessile bacteria and the accumulation of extracellular polymeric substances eps such as polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids li et al 2016 prest et al 2016 therefore the abundance of planktonic bacteria in the source water should be minimized via pretreatment prior to membrane filtration to prevent the formation of biological fouling microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf units that are located prior to ro membranes in an integrated membrane system often play a pretreatment role in separating bacteria and suspended solids from the ro feed water thus integrated membrane systems are often referred to as synergistic techniques because they combine different membrane treatment units the growth of microfilterable bacteria i e bacteria that pass through micro scale filters can initiate the development of biofilm on subsequent ro membranes bacterial communities developed on an ro membrane surface were not affected by mf pretreatment of the ro feed water herzberg et al 2010 despite previous laboratory scale mf experiments observed bacterial log removal values lrvs ranging above 5 as determined by plate counting the bacterial load in the water before entering the ro membranes was unacceptable high 103 105 cells ml 1 as determined by microscopic counting ghayeni et al 1999 considering that cultivation based methods for detecting microorganisms in water samples typically recover less than 1 of the actual bacterial diversity in the environment the bacteria that pass through mf in full scale integrated membrane plants has been traditionally underestimated bacteria are generally reported to be physically larger range in width from 0 2 to 2 μm than mf pores typically from 0 1 to 1 μm yet the ability of bacteria to pass through mf can be surprisingly high filterable bacteria are defined as small cellular forms 0 1 0 3 μm of bacteria capable of penetrating through sub micron sized membrane pores wang et al 2008 previous studies have verified the presence of 0 1 and 0 2 μm filterable bacteria in various aquatic environments e g seawater freshwater and groundwater lillis and bissonnette 2001 wang et al 2008 typically the filterable subfraction of bacteria in oligotrophic freshwater and groundwater consists of less than 10 of total bacteria lillis and bissonnette 2001 wang et al 2009 several mechanisms of bacterial penetration of an mf membrane pretreatment have been suggested 1 bacterial motility 2 bacterial growth and division and 3 shape dependent filterability according to männik et al 2009 bacteria can swim through micron channels e g 1 2 μm using their own motility moreover bacteria can penetrate sub micron width channels by cell shrinkage or division but not motility wang et al 2008 and onyango et al 2010 reported that the bacterial morphologies e g spiral and spherical shaped respectively of specific taxa influenced their filterability through submicron filters in addition low nutrient conditions also could reduce bacterial sizes lee et al 2010 fedotova et al 2012 owing to the ability to pass through mf membranes microfilterable bacteria are often highlighted when testing standard porosity membrane filters wang et al 2008 but are rarely dealt with in industrial applications ghayeni et al 1999 wang et al 2008 therefore it is important to investigate the growth ability of microfilterable bacteria which play a crucial role in bacterial passage through mf and in the subsequent development of biofouling on ro membranes in addition to the presence of bacteria biodegradable natural organic matter nom in feed water can also be a precursor to biofilm development on ro membranes among the nom components assimilable organic carbon aoc generally represents the easily biodegradable subfractions of nom that can be readily assimilated into biomass i e cells aoc measurement is widely used for predicting the bacterial regrowth and or potential for biofilm development on the water contacting surfaces of a variety of materials e g membranes and pipelines hijnen et al 2009 nguyen et al 2012 prest et al 2016 low molecular weight mw aoc cannot be completely removed by membrane filtration techniques e g mf and uf escobar and randall 2001 prest et al 2016 hijnen et al 2009 suggested that aoc concentrations in feed water should be lower than 1 μg l 1 to prevent biofouling in spiral wound membranes this threshold however is difficult to achieve via pretreatments such as membrane filtration escobar and randall 2001 prest et al 2016 considering that reported aoc concentrations in seawater and wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent have been detected at concentrations up to 360 and 420 μg l 1 respectively weinrich et al 2011 vital et al 2010 it was recently revealed that the contribution of high mw aoc to bacterial growth is also significant hence the characterization of various nom components including biopolymers is important for estimating aoc sack et al 2014 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 the main objective of this study was to investigate the growth potential of filterable bacteria in the integrated membrane system and to characterize the nom present with this aim the effects of integrated membrane system on nom characteristics total cell counts bacterial adenosine triphosphate atp growth potentials and bacterial community composition were determined to overcome the limitations of culturing based methods a culture independent flow cytometry fcm application was used to understand bacterial changes e g cell count membrane permeability and filterability during the integrated membrane treatment in addition the seeding effect of filterable bacteria on ro membrane biofilms was understood for the first time 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale industrial water treatment plant a full scale industrial water treatment plant in chungcheong province korea was monitored weekly over the course of two months the surface water was pre treated via coagulation and sedimentation treatment processes in the asan drinking water treatment plant chungcheong province korea and delivered to the integrated membrane treatment plant fig 1 source water

carbon doc and 1 6 0 3 l mg 1 m 1 specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva 254 in brief the integrated membrane system consisted of a source water basin mf ro feed water basin and 1st and 2nd ro membrane treatment stages fig 1 to control bacteria 1 5 mg l 1 of sodium hypochlorite was added to the source water the mf process consisted of 10 pressurized hollow fiber mf units polyvinylidene

feed water the mf permeate was delivered to the ro feed water basin volume 1285 m3 the residual free chlorine was quenched by the addition of sodium bisulfate approximately 2 4 mg l 1 chemicals including 1 mg l 1 of antiscalant phosphoric acid and organic polymer based and 0 5 mg l 1 of 3 1 mixture of 5 chloro 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one cmit and 2 methyl 4 isothiazoline 3 one mit i e cmit mit a nonoxidizing biocide were used to prevent the development of fouling on the polyamide brackish water ro bwro membranes espa2 ld hydranautics usa operational details of ro membrane processes are listed in supplementary information table s1 finally the ph of the ro permeate was adjusted to neutral level and then the permeate was supplied to local industrial plants at a volume of approximately 119 000 m3 per day 2 2 sample collection from a full scale treatment plant we have monitored the full scale integrated membrane treatment system source water and the full scale treatment plant effluents were collected weekly from the industrial water treatment plant in total samples were collected 7 times during the study period n 7 the samples were analyzed within 5 h of collection for dissolved nom characterization all samples were filtered with a 0 1 μm syringe filter sartorius germany and analyzed thereafter also we used both unfiltered and filtered samples to analyze the flow cytometric cell counts and atp 2 3 bacterial passage and growth potentials in laboratory test integrated membrane system may use various water sources e g wastewater reuse since the bacterial properties from surface water and wwtp effluent are significantly different we simulated the bacterial passage from two water sources filterable bacteria samples were separated using a 0 1 μm sterile syringe driven filter sartorius germany from the source water of the full scale plant and tahnchon wwtp seoul korea effluent respectively two indigenous bacteria samples passed through 0 1 μm filters were cultivated at 30 c for 7 days or more with no nutritional amendment wang et al 2009 we checked the total cell counts and atp concentrations over the course of 72 h using flow cytometry and atp assaying respectively the growth phases of the bacteria in the mf filtrates were observed over 72 h of cultivation two enriched bacteria samples served as inocula for testing the growth potentials of the microfilterable bacteria moreover their bacterial communities were compared to that of the full scale effluents 2 4 analysis of nom characteristics nom characteristics were determined through liquid chromatography organic carbon detection lc ocd model 8 system doc labor germany and an excitation emission matrix eem lc ocd analysis was used to group doc into five subfractions namely biopolymers 20 kda humic substances 1 20 kda building blocks 500 da low mw acids and low mw neutrals 350 da arranged in descending order by mw information on these subfractions has been described in more detail elsewhere huber et al 2011 the change in fluorescent properties of the doc was obtained via a 3d excitation emission matrix eem using a spectrofluorophotometer rf 5301pc shimadzu japan fluorescence intensities were recorded in a range of excitation ex wavelengths from 220 to 400 nm 10 nm intervals and emission em wavelengths from 280 to 600 nm 1 nm intervals the fluorescence profiles monitored in this study were t1 tryptophan like ex 220 240 nm and em 330 360 nm t2 tyrosine like ex 270 280 nm and em 330 360 nm a fulvic like ex 230 260 nm and em 400 450 nm and c humic like ex 300 340 nm and em 400 450 nm park et al 2016 2 5 flow cytometry and atp measurement bacterial abundance and viability were measured using sybr green i propidium iodide pi staining protocols and a luciferase atp assay vital et al 2012 park et al 2016 the stained cells were recorded using a partec cube 6 flow cytometer partec gmbh germany the electronic gating and cell count calculation were performed via fcs express 4 software de novo software ca usa intact damaged cell cytograms were electronically gated for cell enumeration according to the method from previous studies berney et al 2008 park et al 2016 intact cell counts were electronically gated into two representative bacterial domains low nucleic acid content lna and high nucleic acid content hna for each sample intact lna and hna bacteria were separated based on their gaps of green fluorescence signals 530 nm lna bacteria primarily consist of relatively small less active and filterable bacteria in environmental water samples gasol et al 1999 wang et al 2009 whereas hna bacteria represent a relatively large and active bacterial subfraction gasol et al 1999 park et al 2016 the growth potentials of microfilterable bacteria were determined via the method presented by vital et al 2010 all treatment effluents from the full scale plant were pasteurized at 70 c for 30 min and filtered with 0 1 μm syringe filters sartorius germany then 1 0 104 cells ml 1 of each inoculum was introduced to pasteurized water samples the inoculated samples were cultivated for 48 h at 30 c in the dark and then the growth potentials were evaluated the total cell concentration of the inoculum and grown cell count were obtained using the sybr green i staining protocol vital et al 2010 park et al 2016 bacterial atp was quantified in brief water samples were first filtered with 0 1 μm syringe filters sartorius germany then 100 μl of each atp reagent bactiter glo promega usa was added to 100 μl of the filtered free atp and unfiltered total atp water samples mixed gently incubated at 36 c for 1 min and measured via a glomax 20 20 luminometer turner biosystems usa bacterial atp was determined by subtracting the free atp from the total atp park et al 2016 2 6 bacterial community analysis the bacterial communities of the syringe filtered mf permeates and full scale water samples as well as the ro membrane biofilms were investigated by sequencing the 16s rrna gene to reveal the fate of the filterable bacteria dna was extracted from source water mf permeate ro concentrate ro biofilm filterable bacteria cultivated from the source water and wwtp effluent samples using a fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals usa a detailed description of rna gene sequence is given in the supplemental information taxonomical assignment were acquired in family level e g relative abundance and principal component analysis pca we have also calculated the shannon index h to compare the changes of bacterial diversity of samples in species level shannon 1997 3 results and discussion 3 1 fate of nom characteristics in a full scale integrated membrane system changes in nom characteristics during a treatment process provide crucial information for understanding the rejection efficacy in membrane water systems as well as the growth potential of indigenous bacteria park et al 2016 previously only low mw nom compounds were highlighted as major aoc components when pseudomonas fluorescens p 17 and spirillum sp strain nox were used however recent studies reported that high mw organics including biopolymers cannot be underestimated when indigenous bacteria are used for aoc assay sack et al 2014 elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 in addition bacteria utilized high mw doc such as aromatic proteins and or biopolymers to a greater extent than that of low mw doc nguyen et al 2012 in order to fully understand the changes in nom profile during water treatment within a full scale integrated membrane system this study has determined the concentrations of each type of nom sub component at different stages of the purification process in the source water of the full scale integrated membrane system the doc concentration was 3 8 0 5 mg l 1 consisting of 2 biopolymers 33 humic substances 20 building blocks 7 low mw acids and 38 low mw neutrals fig 2 low mw organic matter fractions 500 da were 65 of the total doc composition eem fluorescence intensities in the t1 t2 a and c peak regions were 482 30 245 14 684 41 and 466 28 a u respectively fig s1 the doc constituents of the source water were predominated by fulvic like substances which occur naturally in soils and are relatively hydrophilic in addition suva 254 was 1 5 l mg 1 m 1 data not shown which is corresponded to a relatively hydrophilic nom characteristic in freshwater according to our previous study nom characteristics were affected by pretreatment using coagulation sedimentation park et al 2016 due to its effectiveness in the removal of hydrophobic and humic like substances integrated membrane systems often use mf units prior to ro as a pretreatment to remove particles and bacteria after mf the concentrations of doc humic substances building blocks low mw acids and neutrals did not change significantly p 0 05 the greatest significant reduction 51 was observed in biopolymers p 0 05 which mainly consisted of high mw organic matter such as polysaccharides and macromolecular proteins biopolymers are also known to include extracellular polymers and soluble microbial products which are major foulants of low pressure membranes e g mf and uf nguyen et al 2012 therefore pretreatments such as coagulation sedimentation can be effective in minimizing membrane fouling precursors however none of the eem profiles including the protein like peak regions t1 and t2 changed significantly after mf p 0 05 fig s1 this result suggest that the biopolymers rejected via mf were likely non fluorescent polysaccharides since these do not contribute to uv absorbance in the lc ocd chromatogram retention time between 20 and 40 min see fig s2 the integrated membrane treatment plant introduces sodium bisulfate phosphorus antiscalant and cmit mit to the stage 1 ro feed water basin fig 1 the treatment caused only negligible changes in doc composition and eem intensities between the mf permeate and the stage 1 ro feed p 0 05 although the changes in nom profiles were not significant the average concentration of low mw neutrals decreased by 12 and that of biopolymers increased by 30 in the stage 1 ro feed basin the low mw neutrals could have been reduced via microbial utilization since low mw neutrals are known as a major source of aoc in membrane permeates meylan et al 2007 this reduction was likely promoted by the phosphorus added as an antiscalant since phosphorus can serve as an additional source of nutrients for the indigenous bacteria sweity et al 2013 we can then suggest that observed increase in biopolymers may be related to the addition of antiscalants of which a major component is organic polymers or microbial products such as polysaccharides ro membrane treatment rejects most of the nom but also generates waste concentrates that are rich in organics and inorganics ryu et al 2016 in this study the doc concentration in the stage 1 ro concentrate increased to 20 mg l 1 which was 6 fold higher than that of the feed water the stage 1 ro concentrate consists of 2 38 26 7 and 27 of biopolymers humic substances building blocks low mw acids and low mw neutrals respectively fig 2 the rates of increase of all eem profiles were similar to that of the doc concentration 5 or 6 fold increase fig s1 because of the rejection of dissolved nom fluorophores and doc as the stage 1 ro concentrate was sequentially fed to the stage 2 ro membranes the doc in the stage 2 ro concentrate increased significantly from 20 to 59 mg l 1 p 0 05 while each of the eem profiles also increased 3 fold interestingly the relative abundances of low mw acids and neutrals slightly decreased from 7 to 4 and from 26 to 23 respectively in stage 2 ro concentrate eventually humic substances became predominant in the ro concentrates 39 in contrast ryu et al 2016 reported that the ro concentrate derived from wwtp effluent consisted mainly of building blocks followed by low mw neutrals and acids therefore characteristics of ro membrane concentrates could differ per water sources and experimental conditions in the ro permeate most of the doc and the eem intensities were significantly reduced p 0 05 but 0 2 mg l 1 of low mw neutrals was still detected fig 2 low mw neutrals and acids unexpectedly passed through the ro membranes and the low mw neutrals were prevalent 81 in doc composition of the stage 2 ro permeate according to zhang et al 2014 the doc concentration of ro permeate depends on that of the feed water used moreover low mw organics could effectively pass through seawater ro membranes alshahri et al 2017 shan et al 2009 reported that low mw neutrals could adsorb onto polyamide ro membranes and eventually pass through them generally the industrial plants need ultrapure water which is often produced by ro process therefore remaining low mw organics can be a problem 3 2 bacteriological characteristics in a full scale integrated membrane system intact damaged cell counts and bacterial atp assays were carried out to determine the change of bacterial abundance and viability respectively in a full scale integrated membrane system n 7 fig 3 intact and damaged cell counts in the source water accounted for 37 and 63 of the total cell counts 9 6 2 5 105 cells ml 1 respectively bacterial atp concentration of the source water was 266 94 ng l 1 the cell counts and bacterial atp in the source water were relatively low compared with those of freshwater as reported in our previous study 2 106 total cells ml 1 and 600 ng l 1 bacterial atp park et al 2016 likely owing to pretreatment of the source water in the mf permeate 85 of the total cell count and 63 of bacterial atp were dramatically excluded from the source water p 0 05 however bacterial passage through mf resulted in a relatively high residual cell count in the mf permeate of 1 5 1 0 105 cells ml 1 ghayeni et al 1999 has reported that the bacterial log removal via lab scale mf membranes i e using 0 05 0 2 and 0 1 μm polycarbonate and 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes was considerably higher i e up to 4 than that observed in our results from a full scale mf lrv 0 8 the observed bacterial passage through full scale mf membranes indicated that either the occurrence of membrane damage or the presence of the microfilterable form of bacteria in the feed water external pressure also influences a reduction in bacterial cell volume this volume reduction comes with the cell deformation the magnitude of this process is determined by cell mechanical properties such as cell wall flexibility thus operational pressure can select for certain type of bacteria depending on their characteristics such as size shape surface charge but also the cell wall structure and flexibility lebleu et al 2009 according to fcm measurement the relative composition of hna cells which are relatively large and active wang et al 2009 hammes and egli 2010 was increased in full scale mf permeate fig s3 we initially expected that lna bacteria which have smaller biovolume would be predominant in all the mf permeates but hna bacteria were more abundant than lna bacteria in the full scale mf permeate considering that full scale systems have many operational and environmental variables the mf membrane units may have been damaged and thus allowed the passage of relatively large bacteria unexpectedly hence we suggest that fcm can be applied as a tool to detect failures in mf based water treatment systems the stage 1 ro feed water contained sodium bisulfate phosphorus antiscalant and cmit mit interestingly the intact cell counts was not seen to differ significantly p 0 05 in the stage 1 ro feed in addition no significant change in bacterial atp was observed between the mf permeate and ro feed p 0 05 this results suggest that the 0 5 ppm of cmit mit did not effectively reduce the microbial activity different factors can be associated with the unexpectedly boost of bacterial growth in the ro feed water basin including the insufficient biocide addition of phosphorus antiscalant and the natural water constituents i e bacterial abundance their activity and nom substrates all these factors could induce the development of biofilms or biofouling in the subsequent ro membranes and negatively influence their performance the total cell intact damaged cells count in the stage 1 ro concentrate was 73 of that detected in the source water a turnover of intact damaged cells was also observed between the stage 1 ro feed and concentrates the relative abundance of intact cells increased from 54 to 76 bacterial atp increased to 9 times that of the stage 1 ro feed water total cell counts and bacterial atp in the stage 2 ro concentrate were 1 5 0 8 106 cells ml 1 and 884 344 ng l 1 respectively bacteria separated via ro membranes were still biologically active with respect to intact cell abundance 75 and bacterial atp fig 3 cmit mit biocides are often used to inhibit the atp synthesis of microorganisms in various industrial applications williams 2007 but the atp detected in the ro concentrates showed that the biocide dosage used in this study was not effective in controlling biological growth the use of biocides to control biological growth on membranes often results in biofilm formation and subsequent after growth activity al amoudi et al 2007 biofilms formed on membranes can be resistant to biocides and disinfectants and the production of eps extracellular polymeric matrix acts as a reactive transport barrier to biocides matin et al 2011 in the stage 2 ro permeate the total cell count and bacterial atp were present at levels near the detection limit indicating that most of the bacteria had been rejected 3 3 passage of bacteria through a syringe mf filter and their growth potential after observing the bacterial passage through full scale mf units we conducted lab scale mf experiments in order to isolate microfilterable bacteria and compare the full vs lab scale mf with the new and sterile membranes e g syringe driven filter because wwtp effluent is occasionally reused in ro membrane filtration we also carried out the isolation of microfilterable bacteria derived from wwtp secondary effluent source water and wwtp effluent were filtered with a 0 1 μm syringe driven filter and the indigenous bacteria in the mf permeates were cultivated as described in wang et al 2009 prior to filtration the source water and wwtp effluent contained 0 9 106 and 4 0 106 cells ml 1 per total cell counts the hna lna bacterial compositions in the raw samples differed substantially the bacterial abundance in the wwtp effluent mainly consisted of lna bacteria up to 75 fig 4 compared to that of source water up to 33 bacterial abundance was relatively low in source water due to coagulation sedimentation as a pretreatment lna bacteria richness in secondary effluent may be due to the morphology and activity of the microbiota in activated sludge in this regard wastewater reuse via membrane treatment may allow increased bacterial passage through mf owing to lna bacteria richness in the wwtp effluent initially 3 9 104 and 2 3 104 cells ml 1 were detected in the mf permeates from the source water and wwtp effluent respectively as a result of bacterial passage through a syringe filter fig 5 the number of lna bacteria that were able to pass through the filters was higher 72 and 92 for the isolates derived from source water and wwtp effluent respectively than that of hna bacteria possibly owing to their relatively small size and lower biovolume wang et al 2008 the filterable bacteria were cultivated at 30 c for several days and periodic samples were removed and analyzed to identify the bacterial composition during regrowth hna bacteria first increased and became predominant over lna bacteria within 72 h in both samples fig 5a and b the changes in total atp concentration correlated more closely to the growth of hna bacteria r 2 0 66 than to that of lna bacteria r 2 0 27 most of the hna bacteria can be efficiently rejected via mf but they rapidly increased thereafter owing to their relatively higher biological activity e g productivity esterase activity and atp per cell count vital et al 2012 park et al 2016 regardless of their initial cell density fig 5 3 4 growth potentials of filterable bacteria in a full scale integrated membrane system bacterial growth is often limited by assimilable organic substrate and available nutrients in a water sample prest et al 2016 to determine the growth ability of filterable bacteria in water samples we performed a growth potential assay modified from vital et al 2010 that simulated bacterial growth of specific inocula e g pathogenic bacteria interacting with aoc in a full scale water treatment process therefore bacteria isolated from lab scale mf permeates were used as inocula to simulate the growth potential of filterable bacteria in a full scale membrane system fig 6 shows the changes in growth potentials for filterable bacteria derived from two different origins i e source water and wwtp effluent in the source water the growth potentials of filterable bacteria derived from the source water sw and wwtp effluent ww were 7 2 2 7 105 and 5 4 2 0 105 cells ml 1 respectively fig 6 in the mf permeate the grown cell counts of filterable bacteria sw and ww significantly decreased by 64 and 48 respectively p 0 05 since no significant change was observed in mf permeate nom composition except for biopolymers p 0 05 fig 2 this decrease in mf permeate growth potential is likely due to mf mediated removal of approximately half of the aoc which consists of high mw fractions such as biopolymers from the source water elhadidy et al 2016 park et al 2016 in the stage 1 ro feed water the growth potential increased by 2 3 times compared to that of the mf permeate despite their similar doc compositions fig 2 this difference could be due to the introduction of chemicals such as the phosphorus based antiscalant and sodium bisulfate in the stage 1 ro feed water several studies have reported that phosphorus antiscalants can increase nutrients and substrates in ro feed water sweity et al 2013 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 therefore non phosphorus antiscalants have recently been increasingly applied hence we conducted an additional test on the effects of the phosphorus antiscalant at the same time as the growth potential test addition of 1 ppm of phosphorus antiscalant equal to the amount used in the full scale system promoted a 10 increase in bacterial growth compared to a full scale mf permeate with no antiscalant for control fig s4 in addition chlorination is used after pretreatment in the source water but the subsequent dichlorination can also cause rapid microbial growth and biofilm development on ro membranes saeed et al 2000 therefore replacing the chemicals used can reduce the increase in bacterial growth potential of the ro feed water in the ro concentrates the growth potentials increased in association with the accumulation of doc figs 2 and 6 the growth potentials in the stage 1 ro concentrates of filterable bacteria collected from source water and wwtp effluent increased by 2 2 and 1 5 times respectively and those of the stage 2 ro concentrates by 1 4 and 1 9 times respectively despite the high nom concentrations doc 20 mg l 1 of the ro concentrates the aoc concentrations in both ro concentrates were relatively low i e equivalent to 3 6 μg mg 1 aoc doc per sample compared to reported assimilable organic compositions in natural freshwaters i e higher than 16 μg mg 1 aoc doc gasol et al 1999 volk and lechevallier 2000 the growth potential in the ro permeate was very low corresponding to the negligible doc concentration in this water sample fig 2 we can conclude that the stage 2 ro permeate water may be more biologically stable in comparison with other samples because most of the available organics and nutrients will be removed after ro membrane filtration biological stability refers to the concept that water preserves the same microbial quality and normally to achieve this limit bacterial growth occurs during transport and treatments prest et al 2016 thus it is possible to hypothesise that if the available organics and nutrients are removed bacterial growth will be limited and controlled 3 5 changes in bacterial communities via mf and ro the bacterial community structures of the source water membrane permeates and an autopsied ro biofilm was investigated in order to determine the bacterial taxa that can pass through the lab and full scale mf membranes we collected the mature biofilm formed on the surface of an end of life ro membrane fig s5 in order to understand the effect of mf bacterial passage on resultant ro biofilm community structures the 16s rrna sequencing technique was used to reveal the bacteria community structures from each origin i e source water and wwtp effluent that was applied to the growth potential tests as well as in the different treatment effluents and the eventual ro biofilm sequencing results shown that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were the most predominant phyla in all the samples analyzed 92 99 per sample data not shown proteobacteria was the dominant phylum in all samples 57 98 per sample except for the ro biofilm where bacteroidetes represented 50 of the total microbial community structure in the source water the bacteria mainly belonged to the class alphaproteobacteria 42 followed by flavobacteria betaproteobacteria sphingobacteria and actinobacteria at the family level sphingomonadaceae 27 was followed by flavobacteriaceae 15 chitinophagaceae 12 fig 7 notably the bacterial communities changed dramatically in the mf permeate betaproteobacteria became the predominant class in the total bacterial populations of the mf permeate 65 within betaproteobacteria comamonadaceae followed by sphingomonadaceae and oxalobacteraceae were the main represented subdivisions fig 7 interestingly the laboratory bacterial samples we isolated via syringe driven filtration i e filterable bacteria derived from the source water and wwtp effluent also consisted mainly of comamonadaceae overall comamonadaceae accounted for approximately half of the sequences in the microbial communities of the full scale mf permeate ro concentrate and two laboratory bacterial isolates filterable bacteria sw and ww fig 7 comamonaceae are common inhabitants of oligotrophic environments and have been observed as important components of the microbial community structure also in sand filters in drinking water plants vandermaesen et al 2017 and in sediments of drinking water storage tanks qin et al 2017 in contrast comamonadaceae accounted for only 1 of the ro biofilm community the sphingobacteriaceae subdivision was the most prevalent in the ro biofilm community 28 followed by flavobacteriaceae 19 sphingomonadaceae 14 and mycobacteriaceae 6 fig 7 microbial diversity at the species level in the ro biofilm was relatively high h 4 3 compared to that of the mf treated water h range 2 2 3 8 per sample but it was equivalent to that of the source water h 4 1 pca analysis of the bacterial community structure at family level fig 8 shows relative distances between environmental samples with respect to water constituents such as organics inorganics and the microbiome according to the pca plotting the bacterial community of the ro biofilm was relatively similar to that of the source water and was associated to the presence of sphingomonadaceae flavobacteriaceae and sphingobacteriaceae the mf treated water and filterable bacteria samples tended to group together with the family comamonadaceae but not a clear relationship was observed between the filterable bacteria and ro biofilm community accordingly most of the comamonadaceae that passed through mf did not take part in the ro biofilm community but the filterable forms of flavobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae did contribute to the ro biofilm these results confirm that comamonadaceae were the main bacterial group determining the community structure of filterable bacteria while ro biofilms were selective habitats where other microbial families tended to accumulate comamonadaceae are often associated with biological instability of treated water that has readily available substrates to induce unexpected biofilm formation gao et al 2013 proctor et al 2016 therefore the richness in comamonadaceae can be related to the bacterial regrowth in the mf treated effluents previous studies also reported that filterable microbes e g hydrogenophaga hylemonella curvibacter and others often belonged to the family comamonadaceae wang et al 2008 lee et al 2010 fedotova et al 2012 these studies interestingly pointed out that the filterable comamonadaceae had short and narrow cells 0 1 0 3 μm width curved rod or spirilla moreover bacteria living under oligotrophic conditions could be observed to reduce their size compared to that in richer growth medium conditions 0 3 0 5 μm width in the present study the filterable comamonadaceae sequences mainly belonged to the genera hydrogenophaga curvibacter and limnohabitans often found in oligotrophic environments vandermaesen et al 2017 therefore bacterial passage observed in both lab and full scale mf tests in this study can be related with their cell shape and nutrient conditions in source water the families flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae have often been found in mature ro biofilm communities bereschenko et al 2007 2008 2010 barnes et al 2015 but other studies have reported that betaproteobacteria can also be found in young biofilms bereschenko et al 2010 barnes et al 2015 therefore the filterable bacteria may play a role in seeding the initial ro biofilm development in addition bereschenko et al 2010 revealed that betaproteobacteria can often colonize the outer layers of mature biofilms forming an outer microbial community that can be vulnerable to membrane cleaning schemes bereschenko et al 2011 barnes et al 2015 therefore how ro membranes are managed may also affect the specific bacterial composition of a ro biofilm in summary whereas the bacterial taxa that passed through mf likely played a role in seeding the ro biofilm several key biofouling players such as flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae can be selectively incorporated into the final mature ro biofilm community structure 4 conclusions this study provides a better understanding of microfilterable bacteria in integrated membrane treatment systems where biofouling is a critical problem our results revealed the effects of bacterial passage through mf versus ro membranes in a full scale industrial water treatment plant the bacterial removal rates via mf reported in previous studies may have been underestimated compared to that of full scale study our extensive analysis revealed that bacterial passage occurs in all mf permeates regardless of full and lab scale mf treatments because the complete rejection of environmental bacteria and biodegradable nom cannot be guaranteed through the use of mf membranes bacteria that passes through mf are able to continuously utilize substrates and reproduce thereafter in integrated membrane systems with ro membranes changes in nom composition during the course of water treatment resulted in variation in the growth potentials of filterable bacteria which are important factors in the occurrence of biofilms on ro membranes chemicals used in integrated membrane systems were also seen to affect the growth potentials of bacteria the use of phosphorus ro membrane antiscalants can boost bacterial growth if the raw water contains microfilterable bacteria notably the taxa of filterable bacteria which mainly consists of the family comamonadaceae may act as the initial seeds of ro biofilms however mature ro biofilms are often colonized by several biofouling players including flavobacteriaceae sphingobacteriaceae and sphingomonadaceae therefore biofilm monitoring and control strategies should target these specific microbial members to avoid adverse biofouling processes that can affect the final quality of the

19349,identifying freshwater systems that are at risk from anthropogenic stressors is a pressing management problem in particular the detection of metal pollution is often constrained by data availability and resources to address this challenge and develop a tool to identify susceptible systems we tested whether land cover could be predictive of stream sensitivity to metal pollution as determined by the biotic ligand model blm we used water chemistry data from the conterminous united states to estimate metal sensitivity in streams using two blms i e hydoqual bio met subsequently we combined the sensitivity estimates with land cover and physiochemical data from the gages ii database to build predictive models of sensitivity to metals in streams when combined our predictor variables e g land cover mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation generally explained about half of the variation in our dataset in each model the percent of wetlands in a watershed was strongly correlated with reduced sensitivity to metals likely due to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon associated with wetlands to validate the utility of the models we used them to predict metal sensitivity in sites where metal concentrations had been collected but where the full suite of blm parameters were unknown we were able to classify several hundred sites which are likely at risk to metal pollution our work highlights the value in considering metal toxicity at the landscape scale and describes a new approach to estimate metal sensitivity when site specific chemical parameters are unknown graphical abstract image 1 keywords biotic ligand model copper nickel zinc land cover land use watershed landscape landscape ecotoxicology 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is a global and pervasive problem in lotic systems especially in human dominated landscapes das et al 2009 for example in the united states of america usa the environmental protection agency usepa has listed nearly 100 000 miles of streams and rivers as impaired due to metals other than mercury usepa 2014 metal pollution can alter algal morin et al 2008 and microbial community structure ancion et al 2010 duarte et al 2008 which can reduce the rates of essential ecosystem functions like leaf litter decomposition benthic microbial community respiration and benthic algal primary production peters et al 2013 heavy metal contamination is also a concern for human health and has been tied to neurological and developmental irregularities järup 2003 due to their negative effects on the environment the discharge of heavy metals to surface waters is regulated in most countries yet regulation is complicated by the fact that the bioavailability of metals or the mobilization of metals into food webs can vary considerably depending on water chemistry biotic ligand models blms are currently used to forecast the bioavailability of metals in aquatic systems and to estimate the impact of metal pollution on aquatic communities di toro et al 2001 the models estimate metal toxicity as a result of the accumulation of the toxic metal on biological membranes biotic ligands such as gills and they use water chemistry to estimate the availability of metals to bind to the ligand di toro et al 2001 in blms the amount of metal accumulated is assumed to be proportional to the amount of free metal in the water column the models predict metal accumulation will be reduced with increasing ambient concentrations of constituents that bind with metals e g anions or dissolved organic carbon doc or constituents that bind with ligands e g cations such as ca2 na di toro et al 2001 while blms were originally developed for individual species paquin et al 2002 they have now been generalized across organisms to set water quality criteria in watersheds throughout the world bass et al 2008 paquin et al 2002 reiley 2007 generalization of the models relies on standardized toxicity data to scale critical concentrations e g ec50 from model organisms e g daphnia manga and pimephales promelas to entire aquatic communities with the assumption that physiological binding parameters among organisms are fixed traits paquin et al 2002 employing blms as a site assessment tool enables natural resource managers to use water chemistry to estimate the threat of metal toxicity by calculating the equilibrium concentration of dissolved metal that leads to the critical accumulation of biotic ligand bound metal bass et al 2008 while blms are generally implemented to determine whether the levels of dissolved metals exceed toxicity thresholds the models can also be implemented using only ambient water chemistry to predict the maximum safe concentration of metal at a site thus sites where the equilibrium concentration of dissolved metal required to reach this toxic threshold is low are considered more sensitive to metal pollution whereas sites in which greater metal concentrations are required to reach the same threshold are defined as less sensitive to metal pollution because site specific water chemistry is needed to run blms they can only be applied in sites where a suite of water chemistry parameters have been collected this hampers the use of the model across broader landscapes as the time and cost associated with collecting the measurements necessary for accurate blm predictions can be prohibitive careton 2008 to support rapid forecasting of metal sensitivity and proactive management decisions there is a need to develop tools that can predict in stream metal sensitivity from low cost widely available data watershed land cover land use hereafter land cover may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of metal pollution on streams many of the input parameters of blms e g doc and ion concentrations are known to be influenced by watershed land cover johnson et al 1997 williams et al 2005 graeber et al 2012 suggesting that land cover may influence the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution careton 2008 van genderen and klaine 2008 for example it has been widely observed that wetlands in a watershed lead to increased concentrations of doc flint and mcdowell 2015 which may complex metals and consequently reduce sensitivity to metal toxicity similarly increasing urbanization within a watershed has consistently been linked to increases in stream ion concentrations kaushal et al 2018 which may also reduce sensitivity to metals as a result of increasing competition by cations at binding sites and of anions complexing metals and removing them from the free metal pool however several types of land cover i e urban mining and agriculture have also been correlated with elevated concentrations of metals in streams which could counterbalance any reductions in sensitivity das et al 2009 to date only a few studies have used blms to explore potential landscape level patterns of metal toxicity i e careton 2008 and van genderen and klaine 2008 and limited work has been devoted to understanding the spatial heterogeneity in metal sensitivity among watersheds e g prusha and clements 2004 researchers have yet to examine how watershed land cover and other biophysical characteristics such as precipitation and temperature may drive heterogeneity in metal sensitivity over large spatial scales our primary objective was to answer the question do landscape characteristics influence the sensitivity of streams to metals in predictable ways q1 fig 1 because the mechanism by which landscape characteristics could influence metal sensitivity is by altering stream physiochemical parameters interpreting the results of our primary analysis required us to ask two additional questions first we needed to understand how did landscape factors influence the input parameters to the blm q1 1 fig 1 second we asked which physiochemical parameters are most strongly correlated with metal sensitivity as predicted by the blm q1 2 fig 1 to address these questions we input water chemistry data collected between 1998 and 2013 at 446 sites into blms to estimate metal sensitivity in streams across the contiguous usa we then tested whether land cover influenced the sensitivity of streams to metals and whether landscape level factors mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and watershed slope interacted with landscape characteristics and influenced the effects of land cover on stream sensitivity finally we used the models and metal data from additional sites to ask a secondary question q2 can the models we generated be used to assess site specific sensitivity to metal pollution we compared confidence intervals of our predictions with the confidence intervals around the mean of the measured concentrations of metals to assess risk we hypothesized the impacts of land cover on stream water chemistry would alter metal sensitivity because land cover tends to influence a suite of physicochemical characteristics simultaneously williams et al 2005 and the parameters influenced by any given type of land cover may have independently contradictory and or interactive effects on metal sensitivity we did not have formalized predictions about the influence of specific land cover classes on metal sensitivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 geospatial data sources we extracted selected watershed characteristics i e mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation and watershed slope from the gages ii database to be used as predictors in statistical models falcone 2011 watershed slope was extracted from the 100 m resolution national elevation dataset mean annual temperature temperature in the basin was extracted from 1971 to 2000 2000 m data from the prism climate group and mean annual precipitation precipitation in the basin was extracted from 1971 to 2000 800 m resolution prism data we used arcmap version 10 2 2 to obtain the land cover data from the national land cover data nlcd map for each watershed in each corresponding year we used watershed delineations from the gauges ii dataset falcone 2011 and we used 30 m resolution nlcd maps from 2001 2006 and 2011 we reduced the number of land cover classes in our models by combining developed high intensity developed medium intensity developed low intensity and developed open spaces into urban emergent and herbaceous wetlands into wetland cultivated crops and pasture hay into crops and mixed deciduous and evergreen forests into forest we did not consider the land cover categories perennial ice snow barren land shrubland or herbaceous as predictors in our models as there is less evidence that these land cover classes impact the chemical parameters used to populate the biotic ligand models 2 2 water data sources and data selection water chemistry data for this study were downloaded from the national water quality monitoring council for each parameter of interest i e cu2 ni2 zn2 ph doc ca2 k mg2 na cl so4 2 and alkalinity we selected data collected from streams i e the parameter site type was set to stream and sample fraction was set to water we used observations with standard measurement units from and the dissolved sample fraction i e mg or μg l for the trace metals major ions and doc standard units for ph mg l as caco3 for alkalinity and c for temperature we also removed data that were collected during hydrologic events e g storms as others have documented significant variability in doc concentrations produced by different methods sharp et al 1993 we included the method of analysis as a variable in our statistical models appendix s1 when a site had multiple reported values of a parameter we used the median reported value over 2 5 years from the nlcd map year sites where a water chemistry parameter fell outside the calibrated range for a model table s1 were excluded from further analysis 2 3 biotic ligand models we used two blms to predict the maximum safe concentration of metals in this study hydroqual 2007 and bio met bio met 2013 the two models differ in how they estimate the critical concentration of free metals for chronic exposures and we included both models to determine whether the choice of blm altered our conclusions the hydroqual model which has a generalized non species specific version developed for cu2 and is the favored version for regulating copper in the usa epa 2011 is parameterized using acute toxicity data from toxicity tests with fathead minnows pimephales promelas which are converted to chronic values using a fixed acute chronic ratio bass et al 2008 the bio met model which is used in the european union water framework directive bio met 2013 and provides general site specific limits for cu2 ni2 and zn2 is a simplified blm bio met 2013 verschoor et al 2012 parameterized using normalized chronic exposure data that generally come from fish algae and macroinvertebrates bass et al 2008 van regenmortel et al 2015 chronic exposure in the hydroqual model is quantified as criteria continuous concentrations ccc while the bio met model uses environmental quality standards eqs to implement the bio met model bio met version 2 3 2013 we used ph doc and ca2 values to predict local eqs for ni2 cu2 and zn2 cu eqs 2 ni eqs 2 and zn eqs 2 collectively referred to as eqs models we parameterized the hydroqual model by combining temperature ph doc ca2 mg2 na k cl so 4 3 and alkalinity values by site within each temporal bin and used these data to predict the ccc for cu2 cu ccc 2 hydroqual 2007 we did not use measured values of humic acid or sulfur concentration in hydroqual because humic acid is only rarely characterized and the model does not use sulfur in its actual calculations hydroqual 2007 therefore we tested the sensitivity of our results to humic acid by modeling datasets where humic acid was set to the lowest and highest validated values 10 and 60 where humic acid varied randomly and where humic acid was related to wetland area williams et al 2010 thus by predicting the maximum safe concentration of metals at the sites i e eqs or ccc we are able to identify sites as sensitive and less sensitive to metals sites which have a low maximum safe concentration of metal are classified as sensitive while sites with a higher maximum safe concentration of metal are less sensitive to metals 2 4 statistical analysis the primary goal of this analysis was to test the effects of land cover i e agriculture urban open water wetlands and forest on metal sensitivity as predicted by the blms initially we created a full model which included each type of land cover fig 1 we also included interactions between each type of land cover and mean annual temperature as temperature can impact the biotic processes of doc production and degradation stanley et al 2012 and may interact with types of land cover that are closely linked to doc dynamics interactions among land cover mean annual precipitation and watershed slope were also included in the full model because these parameters alter the delivery and dilution of solutes stanley et al 2012 and may amplify or reduce the effects of certain types of land cover in addition because development can influence connectivity between water bodies we tested whether the effects of open water and wetland land cover may be conditional on the dominant land cover in a watershed i e greatest cover among urban crops and forest to facilitate modeling and allow direct comparisons of effect size between continuous and categorical variables all continuous variables were centered to their mean value and divided by twice their standard deviation gelman and hill 2007 to determine the mechanism whereby land cover affected metal sensitivity we calculated pearson s product moment correlations between land cover and the chemical parameters that were inputs to the blms and correlations between the model inputs and outputs to estimate the strength of relationships between landscape level factors and site specific metal sensitivity we used a mixed modeling approach to account for the hierarchical and repeated measures structure of our data zuur et al 2009 in each model we included site as a random effect to account for repeated measurements and a random effect for the method used to measure doc which we consider nuisance variation sharp et al 1993 spatial random effects were tested for inclusion in the model using bayseian information criterion bic as a criterion we evaluated whether the random effects of site should be nested within huc 6 huc 8 or both huc 6 and huc 8 after determining the structure of the random effects we used backwards stepwise regression to eliminate non significant fixed effects while stepwise regression is not guaranteed to select the best possible model whittingham et al 2006 it can be expected to include the strongest predictors from the full model and therefore produce a useful model to control for the multiple comparisons inherent in stepwise regressions fixed effects were eliminated based on an α 0 002 which is equivalent to a bonferroni correction for 24 comparisons which is the number of fixed effects in the full model appendix s2 all analysis was completed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2008 mixed models were fit using restricted maximum likelihood with the lme4 package bates et al 2014 and stepwise regressions were done with the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2017 to assess model fit we calculated both the portion of variance explained by fixed effects marginal r2 and the portion of variance explained by the fixed and random effects conditional r2 using the piecewisesem package lefcheck 2016 finally we used the models selected and parametrized by the above process to predict metal sensitivity at additional sites in the gages ii database to create a new tool that enables users to predict landscape level metal sensitivity we used our models to predict sensitivity at sites where one of the heavy metals i e cu2 ni2 zn2 had been measured at least three times table 3 we used the predictinterval function from the mertools package knowles and frederick 2016 to create 95 confidence intervals around our predictions which accounts for the residual variance the uncertainty around estimates of the fixed effects and the uncertainty of the random effects due to limitations of this prediction function and any available prediction function for mixed models we simplified the random structure to only include the nested effects of site within huc 6 we also limited our predictions to the ccc model with humic acid set to 10 we then compared the predicted metal sensitivities blm estimated maximum safe concentration of each metal in μg l to the measured levels of metal to identify sites which may be at risk which we defined as sites where the lower bound of the 95 percent ci of the measured concentration was higher than the upper bound of the 95 ci for modeled sensitivity conversely sites were classified as safe if the lower bound of the 95 ci for modeled sensitivity was higher than the upper bound of the 95 ci for measured metal when these confidence intervals overlapped sites were categorized as uncertain and were sorted into uncertain risky when the ratio of mean measured metal concentration mean predicted sensitivity 1 and uncertain safe when the ratio was 1 appendix s3 we have included the code needed to make risk predictions and the instructions for users to input site specific data in appendix data 1 3 results 3 1 model parameters our results suggest that wetlands play an important role in mitigating the effects of metal pollution in both the cu eqs 2 and ni eqs 2 models the strongest positive parameter was wetlands fig 2 indicating that watersheds with a greater portion of wetland were less sensitive to these metals wetlands were among the strongest positive predictors in the zn eqs 2 and 3 4 the cu ccc 2 models figs 2 and 3 and these models had strong positive interactions between temperature and wetlands indicating that a given area of wetlands in warm climates reduce metal sensitivity more than in cooler climates figs 2 and 3 however wetlands in wetter climates tended to reduce metal sensitivity less than wetlands in drier climates both the zn eqs 2 and most of the cu ccc 2 models had negative interactions between wetlands and precipitation urban land cover consistently reduced stream sensitivity to metals although to a lesser degree than wetlands in both the zn eqs 2 and most of the cu ccc 2 models urban land cover had a small positive effect on reducing metal sensitivity but a much larger effect in high slope watersheds suggesting that high gradient streams in urban areas may be less sensitive to metals than low gradient streams figs 2 and 3 3 2 inputs to models dissolved organic carbon played the biggest role in determining outputs of the blms in each of the eqs models and in each of the ccc sensitivity calculations doc had the strongest positive correlation with modeled metal sensitivity table 1 indicating that sites with high concentrations of doc were less sensitive to metals moreover when the binding properties of the doc were changed by altering the percent humic acid we observed a shift in the importance of doc to modeled sensitivities table 1 in the sensitivity analysis of humic acid we observed the lowest correlation between doc and sensitivity when humic acid was set to 10 followed closely by random humic acid and a much greater importance when humic acid was set to 60 or was correlated with wetlands table 1 fairly similar models were produced when humic acid was set to 10 60 or correlated with wetlands and with the exception of an interaction between wetlands and dominant land cover in the 60 model these three models all had the same parameters and fairly similar estimates for those parameters fig 3 however when humic acid varied randomly between 10 and 60 the landscape model had a much lower marginal r2 than the other models table 3 and kept fewer terms notably dropping the effect of wetlands fig 3 land cover was significantly related to temperature and the concentrations of chemical inputs to the blms one of the strongest correlations observed between land cover and model inputs was a strong positive correlation between wetlands and doc table 2 indicating that wetlands were associated with streams with higher concentration of doc however wetlands were also linked to reductions in many other parameters including ph and alkalinity table 2 this covariance of doc and ph likely lead to the observed negative relationships between ph and sensitivity for some blms table 1 forested land cover was linked to reductions in all the observed chemical parameters with especially large reductions in base cations and alkalinity table 2 urban land cover did not significantly relate to doc but there were positive correlations with several ions ca2 na2 k and cl and stream temperature table 2 3 3 predicting metal sensitivity we identified 18 of sites as safe and 6 as being at risk for cu using the eqs model and 35 of sites as safe and 7 as at risk using the ccc model the two models identified a slightly different group of sites as at risk but 53 of the sites identified as at risk to cu by the eqs model were also identified by the ccc model figure s1 of the sites modeled 15 of our sites were characterized as at risk and 24 as safe for zn figs 4 and 5 finally for ni we identified 47 of sites as safe and 1 as at risk for some models we observed a threshold relationship between sensitivity and the at risk classification the maximum mean sensitivity of a site classified as at risk was only 36 8 μg l for zn2 fig 3 9 2 μg l for ni2 and 37 5 μg l and 16 3 μg l for cu2 in the ccc and eqs models respectively many sites were identified as at risk to multiple metals for instance more sites were identified as at risk to ni2 and zn2 than ni2 alone figure s1 4 discussion environmental modeling can play an important role in advancing science based policy and management decisions chelgren and dunhan 2015 focks 2014 here we found statistical models using widely available geospatial data could be used to explain 31 52 of the variation in metal sensitivity in our dataset furthermore the large amount of additional variation explained by random effects at the basin and sub basin levels indicates the models perform significantly better in basins where sensitivity has been measured at another site table 3 and table s2 our results documented strong relationships between watershed land cover wetlands in particular and the sensitivity of aquatic systems to metal pollution figs 2 and 3 wetlands were associated with large increases in doc table 2 and doc was strongly associated with decreases in metal sensitivity table 1 this effect was somewhat surprising as wetlands reduce ph and concentrations of most ions factors which typically increase sensitivity to metals di toro et al 2001 through our work we also demonstrated that statistical modeling can be used to effectively to forecast sites at risk to metal pollution we developed a landscape level approach that we used to identify several hundred sites in the us at risk to metal pollution appendix 1 4 1 landscape modeling and the management of flowing waters much of the research in ecotoxicology has been completed in laboratory settings and or with individual or small groups of organisms less often do investigations measure or model sensitivity of systems to contamination across broader landscapes however the pollution of natural systems can occur at broad spatial scales and can be heterogeneous in both space and time our work echoes statements by other researchers and emphasizes the need to include landscape level processes when examining ecotoxicology in running waters cairns and niederlehner 1996 focks 2014 for instance our research suggests that watersheds with certain attributes e g high precipitation may be impacted by lower levels of metal contamination and thus be more sensitive to pollution further our work indicates wetlands can reduce the sensitivity of streams to metal contamination but the degree of this effect can be modified by other factors such as watershed slope precipitation temperature and the dominant type of land cover spatial models of toxicology have the potential to inform policy and influence human activities before environmental damage occurs cairns and niederlehner 1996 in particular the statistical framework we developed to link existing blms with landscape level data can be used to identify sites that are likely at risk from metal pollution and identify general traits of watersheds which may be at risk landscape level models can be used to help prioritize remediation and conservation efforts in our models interactions between land cover and other landscape level factors i e mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation and watershed slope can be interpreted as modifications of the capacity of a land cover to produce solutes i e temperature and transport solutes to the channel i e watershed slope and mean annual precipitation stanley et al 2012 the direction of the interaction terms indicates which watersheds will be most likely to impact stream sensitivities to metals for instance in the zn eqs 2 model there is a positive interaction between wetlands and temperature but a negative interaction between wetlands and precipitation thus we would expect the conservation or remediation of wetlands to have the biggest effects on reducing the sensitivity of streams to zn2 in watersheds that are warmer and drier furthermore our screening suggested if a site was sensitive to pollution from one metal it was frequently at risk to pollution from other metals figure s1 indicating that our tool may be useful for prioritizing sites for conservation and or rehabilitation 4 2 relationships between land cover and metal sensitivity previous research has linked land conversion within watersheds e g mining urbanization and agricultural development to increased concentrations of metals in streams das et al 2009 paul and meyer 2001 turpin nagel and vadas 2016 for instance a synthesis by das et al 2009 found that urbanized watersheds had an average of 750 higher concentrations of cu2 compared to forested watersheds our work demonstrated land cover may also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution a role that can be mediated by physicochemical factors such as precipitation and temperature wetlands play a major role in mitigating the effects of environmental pollutants in aquatic systems mitsch 1992 previous work has demonstrated wetlands can significantly reduce the concentrations of many metals with the notable exception of methylmercury louis et al 1996 through a wide range of biological e g microbial plants and physical e g adsorption precipitation reactions that remove free metal from the water column and store bound metals in wetland sediments marchand et al 2010 our data indicate that wetlands may also indirectly reduce the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution by acting as an important source of doc figs 2 and 3 tables 1 and 2 wetlands have consistently been linked to increases in stream doc concentrations e g dillon and molota 1997 mattsson et al 2005 cool et al 2014 flint and mcdowell 2015 and some empirical work has linked the landscape level production of doc to either reduced body burden of metals in stream organisms prusha and clements 2004 or decreased efficiency of metal uptake by animals chaves ulloa et al 2016 tsui and finlay 2011 our observations which link land cover ambient water chemistry and metal sensitivity across landscapes builds on this work by highlighting the potential influence of doc and thus wetlands in reducing streams sensitivity to metals figs 2 and 3 furthermore our simulations suggest that small increases in wetland cover in a watershed strongly influence the chances of a site being considered at risk for metal pollution extrapolating from our results the odds of a site being classified at risk to cu declined from 10 to 5 when the percent wetlands changed from 0 to 5 using the eqs model similarly the odds of a site being at risk to zn declined from 25 to 12 as wetlands increased from 0 to 7 changes in land cover have had drastic impacts on ecological processes in streams allan 2004 the strong effects of wetlands on metal sensitivity suggest that historical land cover change may also be an important determinant of modern stream metal sensitivity for instance in the usa and globally it has been estimated that 50 of wetlands have been lost dahl 1990 zedler and kercher 2005 changes in land cover may also interact with other long term changes in the environment to influence metal sensitivity in streams for example watershed recovery from mineral acid deposition monteith et al 2007 and increasing global temperatures christ and david 1996 may increase doc concentrations in streams and rivers future research should examine how current and historical changes in land use interact with other anthropogenic activities to influence physiochemical conditions and alter the sensitivity of streams to metals 4 3 challenges in modeling and managing the impacts of metal pollution currently blms cannot be used to predict the effect of metal pollution on aquatic communities in all streams as they are not calibrated to encompass the full range of chemical states encountered in the environment in our study the number of sites that could be incorporated into our calibration dataset was limited to sites where all chemical parameters were within the calibrated range of the blms thus we had to exclude 20 75 of the potential sites for the eqs models and 30 of the potential sites for the ccc models from our analyses because the site specific chemical parameters exceeded the calibration range of the models managing agencies should be tasked to enhance blms so they can make predictions for all streams non randomly collected water chemistry measurements may also skew the results of this type of landscape analysis the sites selected for forecasting sensitivity were selected based on the existence of previous measurements of metals it is possible that these data were collected with a bias towards sites which were likely to have high levels of metal and thus our predicative models may have identified a greater portion of sites as at risk than the true average across the landscape however the relationships documented between landscape factors and sensitivity to contamination were not constrained by the presence of measurements of metal and thus are likely not biased in this way importantly the blms used in this exercise were developed to predict the effects of chronic not acute exposure of organisms to metals it is possible even probable that acute exposures to pulses of higher metal concentrations e g storm runoff turpin nagel and vadas 2016 may play a more important role in governing ecological responses in metal impacted streams while the calibration limits of the blms would likely present an even greater challenge to modeling potential impacts of acute toxicity future work should examine sensitivities to pulses of contaminates by simulating worst case i e min or max values depending on the parameter sensitivities across the landscape 4 4 management implications in the united states the clean water act is currently one of the stronger policies that managers can invoke to preserve ecosystems and ensure that water resources are safe for human consumption united states congress 2002 managing the extent of pollution in streams and reducing pollution loads by setting total maximum daily load tmdl or the total amount of a given contaminant that a given body of water can receive while still meeting minimum water quality standards is an important provision of the statute to set appropriate tmdls natural resource managers must have the appropriate data and models to estimate the impact of a given pollutant on the ecological integrity of flowing waters thus far few if any investigations have sought to understand the role that land cover may play in regulating metal sensitivity in aquatic environments yet the introduction of metals into aquatic systems is often a process that occurs at the landscape level cairns and niederlehner 1996 turpin nagel and vadas 2016 the conclusions drawn from our work highlight improvements needed in the blms to enhance their ability to predict ecological impacts of metal pollution moreover our findings indicate land cover has significant impacts on stream sensitivity to metals and suggests even small increases in wetland cover in catchments sensitive to metal pollution may mitigate the effects of metal pollution by employing the models developed in this study managers can generate estimates of metal sensitivity in data limited sites to enhance environmental decision making 5 conclusion the majority of research in ecotoxicology has been conducted in simplified laboratory conditions with a limited number of model organisms and rarely considers the sensitivity of systems to pollutants at the landscape level these are especially important knowledge gaps to address in order to promote effective and proactive management by developing statistical models using extensive and widely available geospatial data we were able to explain a large proportion 31 52 of the variation of metal sensitivity in streams and identify new sites that may be at risk for metal pollution collectively our work highlights the potential power and utility of integrating landscape level data into ecotoxicological research dissolved organic carbon plays an important in controlling the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution our findings suggested that wetland cover in a watershed mediated in stream metal sensitivity via doc production hence management activities designed to conserve or enhance wetland area and promote doc production in a watershed may be effective management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of metal pollution acknowledgements all authors

19349,identifying freshwater systems that are at risk from anthropogenic stressors is a pressing management problem in particular the detection of metal pollution is often constrained by data availability and resources to address this challenge and develop a tool to identify susceptible systems we tested whether land cover could be predictive of stream sensitivity to metal pollution as determined by the biotic ligand model blm we used water chemistry data from the conterminous united states to estimate metal sensitivity in streams using two blms i e hydoqual bio met subsequently we combined the sensitivity estimates with land cover and physiochemical data from the gages ii database to build predictive models of sensitivity to metals in streams when combined our predictor variables e g land cover mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation generally explained about half of the variation in our dataset in each model the percent of wetlands in a watershed was strongly correlated with reduced sensitivity to metals likely due to increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon associated with wetlands to validate the utility of the models we used them to predict metal sensitivity in sites where metal concentrations had been collected but where the full suite of blm parameters were unknown we were able to classify several hundred sites which are likely at risk to metal pollution our work highlights the value in considering metal toxicity at the landscape scale and describes a new approach to estimate metal sensitivity when site specific chemical parameters are unknown graphical abstract image 1 keywords biotic ligand model copper nickel zinc land cover land use watershed landscape landscape ecotoxicology 1 introduction heavy metal pollution is a global and pervasive problem in lotic systems especially in human dominated landscapes das et al 2009 for example in the united states of america usa the environmental protection agency usepa has listed nearly 100 000 miles of streams and rivers as impaired due to metals other than mercury usepa 2014 metal pollution can alter algal morin et al 2008 and microbial community structure ancion et al 2010 duarte et al 2008 which can reduce the rates of essential ecosystem functions like leaf litter decomposition benthic microbial community respiration and benthic algal primary production peters et al 2013 heavy metal contamination is also a concern for human health and has been tied to neurological and developmental irregularities järup 2003 due to their negative effects on the environment the discharge of heavy metals to surface waters is regulated in most countries yet regulation is complicated by the fact that the bioavailability of metals or the mobilization of metals into food webs can vary considerably depending on water chemistry biotic ligand models blms are currently used to forecast the bioavailability of metals in aquatic systems and to estimate the impact of metal pollution on aquatic communities di toro et al 2001 the models estimate metal toxicity as a result of the accumulation of the toxic metal on biological membranes biotic ligands such as gills and they use water chemistry to estimate the availability of metals to bind to the ligand di toro et al 2001 in blms the amount of metal accumulated is assumed to be proportional to the amount of free metal in the water column the models predict metal accumulation will be reduced with increasing ambient concentrations of constituents that bind with metals e g anions or dissolved organic carbon doc or constituents that bind with ligands e g cations such as ca2 na di toro et al 2001 while blms were originally developed for individual species paquin et al 2002 they have now been generalized across organisms to set water quality criteria in watersheds throughout the world bass et al 2008 paquin et al 2002 reiley 2007 generalization of the models relies on standardized toxicity data to scale critical concentrations e g ec50 from model organisms e g daphnia manga and pimephales promelas to entire aquatic communities with the assumption that physiological binding parameters among organisms are fixed traits paquin et al 2002 employing blms as a site assessment tool enables natural resource managers to use water chemistry to estimate the threat of metal toxicity by calculating the equilibrium concentration of dissolved metal that leads to the critical accumulation of biotic ligand bound metal bass et al 2008 while blms are generally implemented to determine whether the levels of dissolved metals exceed toxicity thresholds the models can also be implemented using only ambient water chemistry to predict the maximum safe concentration of metal at a site thus sites where the equilibrium concentration of dissolved metal required to reach this toxic threshold is low are considered more sensitive to metal pollution whereas sites in which greater metal concentrations are required to reach the same threshold are defined as less sensitive to metal pollution because site specific water chemistry is needed to run blms they can only be applied in sites where a suite of water chemistry parameters have been collected this hampers the use of the model across broader landscapes as the time and cost associated with collecting the measurements necessary for accurate blm predictions can be prohibitive careton 2008 to support rapid forecasting of metal sensitivity and proactive management decisions there is a need to develop tools that can predict in stream metal sensitivity from low cost widely available data watershed land cover land use hereafter land cover may mitigate or exacerbate the effects of metal pollution on streams many of the input parameters of blms e g doc and ion concentrations are known to be influenced by watershed land cover johnson et al 1997 williams et al 2005 graeber et al 2012 suggesting that land cover may influence the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution careton 2008 van genderen and klaine 2008 for example it has been widely observed that wetlands in a watershed lead to increased concentrations of doc flint and mcdowell 2015 which may complex metals and consequently reduce sensitivity to metal toxicity similarly increasing urbanization within a watershed has consistently been linked to increases in stream ion concentrations kaushal et al 2018 which may also reduce sensitivity to metals as a result of increasing competition by cations at binding sites and of anions complexing metals and removing them from the free metal pool however several types of land cover i e urban mining and agriculture have also been correlated with elevated concentrations of metals in streams which could counterbalance any reductions in sensitivity das et al 2009 to date only a few studies have used blms to explore potential landscape level patterns of metal toxicity i e careton 2008 and van genderen and klaine 2008 and limited work has been devoted to understanding the spatial heterogeneity in metal sensitivity among watersheds e g prusha and clements 2004 researchers have yet to examine how watershed land cover and other biophysical characteristics such as precipitation and temperature may drive heterogeneity in metal sensitivity over large spatial scales our primary objective was to answer the question do landscape characteristics influence the sensitivity of streams to metals in predictable ways q1 fig 1 because the mechanism by which landscape characteristics could influence metal sensitivity is by altering stream physiochemical parameters interpreting the results of our primary analysis required us to ask two additional questions first we needed to understand how did landscape factors influence the input parameters to the blm q1 1 fig 1 second we asked which physiochemical parameters are most strongly correlated with metal sensitivity as predicted by the blm q1 2 fig 1 to address these questions we input water chemistry data collected between 1998 and 2013 at 446 sites into blms to estimate metal sensitivity in streams across the contiguous usa we then tested whether land cover influenced the sensitivity of streams to metals and whether landscape level factors mean annual precipitation mean annual temperature and watershed slope interacted with landscape characteristics and influenced the effects of land cover on stream sensitivity finally we used the models and metal data from additional sites to ask a secondary question q2 can the models we generated be used to assess site specific sensitivity to metal pollution we compared confidence intervals of our predictions with the confidence intervals around the mean of the measured concentrations of metals to assess risk we hypothesized the impacts of land cover on stream water chemistry would alter metal sensitivity because land cover tends to influence a suite of physicochemical characteristics simultaneously williams et al 2005 and the parameters influenced by any given type of land cover may have independently contradictory and or interactive effects on metal sensitivity we did not have formalized predictions about the influence of specific land cover classes on metal sensitivity 2 materials and methods 2 1 geospatial data sources we extracted selected watershed characteristics i e mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation and watershed slope from the gages ii database to be used as predictors in statistical models falcone 2011 watershed slope was extracted from the 100 m resolution national elevation dataset mean annual temperature temperature in the basin was extracted from 1971 to 2000 2000 m data from the prism climate group and mean annual precipitation precipitation in the basin was extracted from 1971 to 2000 800 m resolution prism data we used arcmap version 10 2 2 to obtain the land cover data from the national land cover data nlcd map for each watershed in each corresponding year we used watershed delineations from the gauges ii dataset falcone 2011 and we used 30 m resolution nlcd maps from 2001 2006 and 2011 we reduced the number of land cover classes in our models by combining developed high intensity developed medium intensity developed low intensity and developed open spaces into urban emergent and herbaceous wetlands into wetland cultivated crops and pasture hay into crops and mixed deciduous and evergreen forests into forest we did not consider the land cover categories perennial ice snow barren land shrubland or herbaceous as predictors in our models as there is less evidence that these land cover classes impact the chemical parameters used to populate the biotic ligand models 2 2 water data sources and data selection water chemistry data for this study were downloaded from the national water quality monitoring council for each parameter of interest i e cu2 ni2 zn2 ph doc ca2 k mg2 na cl so4 2 and alkalinity we selected data collected from streams i e the parameter site type was set to stream and sample fraction was set to water we used observations with standard measurement units from and the dissolved sample fraction i e mg or μg l for the trace metals major ions and doc standard units for ph mg l as caco3 for alkalinity and c for temperature we also removed data that were collected during hydrologic events e g storms as others have documented significant variability in doc concentrations produced by different methods sharp et al 1993 we included the method of analysis as a variable in our statistical models appendix s1 when a site had multiple reported values of a parameter we used the median reported value over 2 5 years from the nlcd map year sites where a water chemistry parameter fell outside the calibrated range for a model table s1 were excluded from further analysis 2 3 biotic ligand models we used two blms to predict the maximum safe concentration of metals in this study hydroqual 2007 and bio met bio met 2013 the two models differ in how they estimate the critical concentration of free metals for chronic exposures and we included both models to determine whether the choice of blm altered our conclusions the hydroqual model which has a generalized non species specific version developed for cu2 and is the favored version for regulating copper in the usa epa 2011 is parameterized using acute toxicity data from toxicity tests with fathead minnows pimephales promelas which are converted to chronic values using a fixed acute chronic ratio bass et al 2008 the bio met model which is used in the european union water framework directive bio met 2013 and provides general site specific limits for cu2 ni2 and zn2 is a simplified blm bio met 2013 verschoor et al 2012 parameterized using normalized chronic exposure data that generally come from fish algae and macroinvertebrates bass et al 2008 van regenmortel et al 2015 chronic exposure in the hydroqual model is quantified as criteria continuous concentrations ccc while the bio met model uses environmental quality standards eqs to implement the bio met model bio met version 2 3 2013 we used ph doc and ca2 values to predict local eqs for ni2 cu2 and zn2 cu eqs 2 ni eqs 2 and zn eqs 2 collectively referred to as eqs models we parameterized the hydroqual model by combining temperature ph doc ca2 mg2 na k cl so 4 3 and alkalinity values by site within each temporal bin and used these data to predict the ccc for cu2 cu ccc 2 hydroqual 2007 we did not use measured values of humic acid or sulfur concentration in hydroqual because humic acid is only rarely characterized and the model does not use sulfur in its actual calculations hydroqual 2007 therefore we tested the sensitivity of our results to humic acid by modeling datasets where humic acid was set to the lowest and highest validated values 10 and 60 where humic acid varied randomly and where humic acid was related to wetland area williams et al 2010 thus by predicting the maximum safe concentration of metals at the sites i e eqs or ccc we are able to identify sites as sensitive and less sensitive to metals sites which have a low maximum safe concentration of metal are classified as sensitive while sites with a higher maximum safe concentration of metal are less sensitive to metals 2 4 statistical analysis the primary goal of this analysis was to test the effects of land cover i e agriculture urban open water wetlands and forest on metal sensitivity as predicted by the blms initially we created a full model which included each type of land cover fig 1 we also included interactions between each type of land cover and mean annual temperature as temperature can impact the biotic processes of doc production and degradation stanley et al 2012 and may interact with types of land cover that are closely linked to doc dynamics interactions among land cover mean annual precipitation and watershed slope were also included in the full model because these parameters alter the delivery and dilution of solutes stanley et al 2012 and may amplify or reduce the effects of certain types of land cover in addition because development can influence connectivity between water bodies we tested whether the effects of open water and wetland land cover may be conditional on the dominant land cover in a watershed i e greatest cover among urban crops and forest to facilitate modeling and allow direct comparisons of effect size between continuous and categorical variables all continuous variables were centered to their mean value and divided by twice their standard deviation gelman and hill 2007 to determine the mechanism whereby land cover affected metal sensitivity we calculated pearson s product moment correlations between land cover and the chemical parameters that were inputs to the blms and correlations between the model inputs and outputs to estimate the strength of relationships between landscape level factors and site specific metal sensitivity we used a mixed modeling approach to account for the hierarchical and repeated measures structure of our data zuur et al 2009 in each model we included site as a random effect to account for repeated measurements and a random effect for the method used to measure doc which we consider nuisance variation sharp et al 1993 spatial random effects were tested for inclusion in the model using bayseian information criterion bic as a criterion we evaluated whether the random effects of site should be nested within huc 6 huc 8 or both huc 6 and huc 8 after determining the structure of the random effects we used backwards stepwise regression to eliminate non significant fixed effects while stepwise regression is not guaranteed to select the best possible model whittingham et al 2006 it can be expected to include the strongest predictors from the full model and therefore produce a useful model to control for the multiple comparisons inherent in stepwise regressions fixed effects were eliminated based on an α 0 002 which is equivalent to a bonferroni correction for 24 comparisons which is the number of fixed effects in the full model appendix s2 all analysis was completed in r version 3 3 2 r core team 2008 mixed models were fit using restricted maximum likelihood with the lme4 package bates et al 2014 and stepwise regressions were done with the lmertest package kuznetsova et al 2017 to assess model fit we calculated both the portion of variance explained by fixed effects marginal r2 and the portion of variance explained by the fixed and random effects conditional r2 using the piecewisesem package lefcheck 2016 finally we used the models selected and parametrized by the above process to predict metal sensitivity at additional sites in the gages ii database to create a new tool that enables users to predict landscape level metal sensitivity we used our models to predict sensitivity at sites where one of the heavy metals i e cu2 ni2 zn2 had been measured at least three times table 3 we used the predictinterval function from the mertools package knowles and frederick 2016 to create 95 confidence intervals around our predictions which accounts for the residual variance the uncertainty around estimates of the fixed effects and the uncertainty of the random effects due to limitations of this prediction function and any available prediction function for mixed models we simplified the random structure to only include the nested effects of site within huc 6 we also limited our predictions to the ccc model with humic acid set to 10 we then compared the predicted metal sensitivities blm estimated maximum safe concentration of each metal in μg l to the measured levels of metal to identify sites which may be at risk which we defined as sites where the lower bound of the 95 percent ci of the measured concentration was higher than the upper bound of the 95 ci for modeled sensitivity conversely sites were classified as safe if the lower bound of the 95 ci for modeled sensitivity was higher than the upper bound of the 95 ci for measured metal when these confidence intervals overlapped sites were categorized as uncertain and were sorted into uncertain risky when the ratio of mean measured metal concentration mean predicted sensitivity 1 and uncertain safe when the ratio was 1 appendix s3 we have included the code needed to make risk predictions and the instructions for users to input site specific data in appendix data 1 3 results 3 1 model parameters our results suggest that wetlands play an important role in mitigating the effects of metal pollution in both the cu eqs 2 and ni eqs 2 models the strongest positive parameter was wetlands fig 2 indicating that watersheds with a greater portion of wetland were less sensitive to these metals wetlands were among the strongest positive predictors in the zn eqs 2 and 3 4 the cu ccc 2 models figs 2 and 3 and these models had strong positive interactions between temperature and wetlands indicating that a given area of wetlands in warm climates reduce metal sensitivity more than in cooler climates figs 2 and 3 however wetlands in wetter climates tended to reduce metal sensitivity less than wetlands in drier climates both the zn eqs 2 and most of the cu ccc 2 models had negative interactions between wetlands and precipitation urban land cover consistently reduced stream sensitivity to metals although to a lesser degree than wetlands in both the zn eqs 2 and most of the cu ccc 2 models urban land cover had a small positive effect on reducing metal sensitivity but a much larger effect in high slope watersheds suggesting that high gradient streams in urban areas may be less sensitive to metals than low gradient streams figs 2 and 3 3 2 inputs to models dissolved organic carbon played the biggest role in determining outputs of the blms in each of the eqs models and in each of the ccc sensitivity calculations doc had the strongest positive correlation with modeled metal sensitivity table 1 indicating that sites with high concentrations of doc were less sensitive to metals moreover when the binding properties of the doc were changed by altering the percent humic acid we observed a shift in the importance of doc to modeled sensitivities table 1 in the sensitivity analysis of humic acid we observed the lowest correlation between doc and sensitivity when humic acid was set to 10 followed closely by random humic acid and a much greater importance when humic acid was set to 60 or was correlated with wetlands table 1 fairly similar models were produced when humic acid was set to 10 60 or correlated with wetlands and with the exception of an interaction between wetlands and dominant land cover in the 60 model these three models all had the same parameters and fairly similar estimates for those parameters fig 3 however when humic acid varied randomly between 10 and 60 the landscape model had a much lower marginal r2 than the other models table 3 and kept fewer terms notably dropping the effect of wetlands fig 3 land cover was significantly related to temperature and the concentrations of chemical inputs to the blms one of the strongest correlations observed between land cover and model inputs was a strong positive correlation between wetlands and doc table 2 indicating that wetlands were associated with streams with higher concentration of doc however wetlands were also linked to reductions in many other parameters including ph and alkalinity table 2 this covariance of doc and ph likely lead to the observed negative relationships between ph and sensitivity for some blms table 1 forested land cover was linked to reductions in all the observed chemical parameters with especially large reductions in base cations and alkalinity table 2 urban land cover did not significantly relate to doc but there were positive correlations with several ions ca2 na2 k and cl and stream temperature table 2 3 3 predicting metal sensitivity we identified 18 of sites as safe and 6 as being at risk for cu using the eqs model and 35 of sites as safe and 7 as at risk using the ccc model the two models identified a slightly different group of sites as at risk but 53 of the sites identified as at risk to cu by the eqs model were also identified by the ccc model figure s1 of the sites modeled 15 of our sites were characterized as at risk and 24 as safe for zn figs 4 and 5 finally for ni we identified 47 of sites as safe and 1 as at risk for some models we observed a threshold relationship between sensitivity and the at risk classification the maximum mean sensitivity of a site classified as at risk was only 36 8 μg l for zn2 fig 3 9 2 μg l for ni2 and 37 5 μg l and 16 3 μg l for cu2 in the ccc and eqs models respectively many sites were identified as at risk to multiple metals for instance more sites were identified as at risk to ni2 and zn2 than ni2 alone figure s1 4 discussion environmental modeling can play an important role in advancing science based policy and management decisions chelgren and dunhan 2015 focks 2014 here we found statistical models using widely available geospatial data could be used to explain 31 52 of the variation in metal sensitivity in our dataset furthermore the large amount of additional variation explained by random effects at the basin and sub basin levels indicates the models perform significantly better in basins where sensitivity has been measured at another site table 3 and table s2 our results documented strong relationships between watershed land cover wetlands in particular and the sensitivity of aquatic systems to metal pollution figs 2 and 3 wetlands were associated with large increases in doc table 2 and doc was strongly associated with decreases in metal sensitivity table 1 this effect was somewhat surprising as wetlands reduce ph and concentrations of most ions factors which typically increase sensitivity to metals di toro et al 2001 through our work we also demonstrated that statistical modeling can be used to effectively to forecast sites at risk to metal pollution we developed a landscape level approach that we used to identify several hundred sites in the us at risk to metal pollution appendix 1 4 1 landscape modeling and the management of flowing waters much of the research in ecotoxicology has been completed in laboratory settings and or with individual or small groups of organisms less often do investigations measure or model sensitivity of systems to contamination across broader landscapes however the pollution of natural systems can occur at broad spatial scales and can be heterogeneous in both space and time our work echoes statements by other researchers and emphasizes the need to include landscape level processes when examining ecotoxicology in running waters cairns and niederlehner 1996 focks 2014 for instance our research suggests that watersheds with certain attributes e g high precipitation may be impacted by lower levels of metal contamination and thus be more sensitive to pollution further our work indicates wetlands can reduce the sensitivity of streams to metal contamination but the degree of this effect can be modified by other factors such as watershed slope precipitation temperature and the dominant type of land cover spatial models of toxicology have the potential to inform policy and influence human activities before environmental damage occurs cairns and niederlehner 1996 in particular the statistical framework we developed to link existing blms with landscape level data can be used to identify sites that are likely at risk from metal pollution and identify general traits of watersheds which may be at risk landscape level models can be used to help prioritize remediation and conservation efforts in our models interactions between land cover and other landscape level factors i e mean annual temperature mean annual precipitation and watershed slope can be interpreted as modifications of the capacity of a land cover to produce solutes i e temperature and transport solutes to the channel i e watershed slope and mean annual precipitation stanley et al 2012 the direction of the interaction terms indicates which watersheds will be most likely to impact stream sensitivities to metals for instance in the zn eqs 2 model there is a positive interaction between wetlands and temperature but a negative interaction between wetlands and precipitation thus we would expect the conservation or remediation of wetlands to have the biggest effects on reducing the sensitivity of streams to zn2 in watersheds that are warmer and drier furthermore our screening suggested if a site was sensitive to pollution from one metal it was frequently at risk to pollution from other metals figure s1 indicating that our tool may be useful for prioritizing sites for conservation and or rehabilitation 4 2 relationships between land cover and metal sensitivity previous research has linked land conversion within watersheds e g mining urbanization and agricultural development to increased concentrations of metals in streams das et al 2009 paul and meyer 2001 turpin nagel and vadas 2016 for instance a synthesis by das et al 2009 found that urbanized watersheds had an average of 750 higher concentrations of cu2 compared to forested watersheds our work demonstrated land cover may also play an important role in mediating the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution a role that can be mediated by physicochemical factors such as precipitation and temperature wetlands play a major role in mitigating the effects of environmental pollutants in aquatic systems mitsch 1992 previous work has demonstrated wetlands can significantly reduce the concentrations of many metals with the notable exception of methylmercury louis et al 1996 through a wide range of biological e g microbial plants and physical e g adsorption precipitation reactions that remove free metal from the water column and store bound metals in wetland sediments marchand et al 2010 our data indicate that wetlands may also indirectly reduce the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution by acting as an important source of doc figs 2 and 3 tables 1 and 2 wetlands have consistently been linked to increases in stream doc concentrations e g dillon and molota 1997 mattsson et al 2005 cool et al 2014 flint and mcdowell 2015 and some empirical work has linked the landscape level production of doc to either reduced body burden of metals in stream organisms prusha and clements 2004 or decreased efficiency of metal uptake by animals chaves ulloa et al 2016 tsui and finlay 2011 our observations which link land cover ambient water chemistry and metal sensitivity across landscapes builds on this work by highlighting the potential influence of doc and thus wetlands in reducing streams sensitivity to metals figs 2 and 3 furthermore our simulations suggest that small increases in wetland cover in a watershed strongly influence the chances of a site being considered at risk for metal pollution extrapolating from our results the odds of a site being classified at risk to cu declined from 10 to 5 when the percent wetlands changed from 0 to 5 using the eqs model similarly the odds of a site being at risk to zn declined from 25 to 12 as wetlands increased from 0 to 7 changes in land cover have had drastic impacts on ecological processes in streams allan 2004 the strong effects of wetlands on metal sensitivity suggest that historical land cover change may also be an important determinant of modern stream metal sensitivity for instance in the usa and globally it has been estimated that 50 of wetlands have been lost dahl 1990 zedler and kercher 2005 changes in land cover may also interact with other long term changes in the environment to influence metal sensitivity in streams for example watershed recovery from mineral acid deposition monteith et al 2007 and increasing global temperatures christ and david 1996 may increase doc concentrations in streams and rivers future research should examine how current and historical changes in land use interact with other anthropogenic activities to influence physiochemical conditions and alter the sensitivity of streams to metals 4 3 challenges in modeling and managing the impacts of metal pollution currently blms cannot be used to predict the effect of metal pollution on aquatic communities in all streams as they are not calibrated to encompass the full range of chemical states encountered in the environment in our study the number of sites that could be incorporated into our calibration dataset was limited to sites where all chemical parameters were within the calibrated range of the blms thus we had to exclude 20 75 of the potential sites for the eqs models and 30 of the potential sites for the ccc models from our analyses because the site specific chemical parameters exceeded the calibration range of the models managing agencies should be tasked to enhance blms so they can make predictions for all streams non randomly collected water chemistry measurements may also skew the results of this type of landscape analysis the sites selected for forecasting sensitivity were selected based on the existence of previous measurements of metals it is possible that these data were collected with a bias towards sites which were likely to have high levels of metal and thus our predicative models may have identified a greater portion of sites as at risk than the true average across the landscape however the relationships documented between landscape factors and sensitivity to contamination were not constrained by the presence of measurements of metal and thus are likely not biased in this way importantly the blms used in this exercise were developed to predict the effects of chronic not acute exposure of organisms to metals it is possible even probable that acute exposures to pulses of higher metal concentrations e g storm runoff turpin nagel and vadas 2016 may play a more important role in governing ecological responses in metal impacted streams while the calibration limits of the blms would likely present an even greater challenge to modeling potential impacts of acute toxicity future work should examine sensitivities to pulses of contaminates by simulating worst case i e min or max values depending on the parameter sensitivities across the landscape 4 4 management implications in the united states the clean water act is currently one of the stronger policies that managers can invoke to preserve ecosystems and ensure that water resources are safe for human consumption united states congress 2002 managing the extent of pollution in streams and reducing pollution loads by setting total maximum daily load tmdl or the total amount of a given contaminant that a given body of water can receive while still meeting minimum water quality standards is an important provision of the statute to set appropriate tmdls natural resource managers must have the appropriate data and models to estimate the impact of a given pollutant on the ecological integrity of flowing waters thus far few if any investigations have sought to understand the role that land cover may play in regulating metal sensitivity in aquatic environments yet the introduction of metals into aquatic systems is often a process that occurs at the landscape level cairns and niederlehner 1996 turpin nagel and vadas 2016 the conclusions drawn from our work highlight improvements needed in the blms to enhance their ability to predict ecological impacts of metal pollution moreover our findings indicate land cover has significant impacts on stream sensitivity to metals and suggests even small increases in wetland cover in catchments sensitive to metal pollution may mitigate the effects of metal pollution by employing the models developed in this study managers can generate estimates of metal sensitivity in data limited sites to enhance environmental decision making 5 conclusion the majority of research in ecotoxicology has been conducted in simplified laboratory conditions with a limited number of model organisms and rarely considers the sensitivity of systems to pollutants at the landscape level these are especially important knowledge gaps to address in order to promote effective and proactive management by developing statistical models using extensive and widely available geospatial data we were able to explain a large proportion 31 52 of the variation of metal sensitivity in streams and identify new sites that may be at risk for metal pollution collectively our work highlights the potential power and utility of integrating landscape level data into ecotoxicological research dissolved organic carbon plays an important in controlling the sensitivity of streams to metal pollution our findings suggested that wetland cover in a watershed mediated in stream metal sensitivity via doc production hence management activities designed to conserve or enhance wetland area and promote doc production in a watershed may be effective management strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of metal pollution acknowledgements all authors
