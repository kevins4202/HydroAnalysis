18795,aqueous aggregation kinetics of manganese oxides the solid products formed during water treatment and subsurface remediation with permanganate are crucial for its application in this study manganese oxides nanoparticles were in situ formed in a permanganate bi sulfite system which was found to have excellent oxidation ability aggregation kinetics of such manganese oxides i e mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 the number represents the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate were evaluated by employing time resolved dynamic light scattering under various aquatic conditions in nano3 solution the stability of manganese oxides decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 indicated by their critical coagulation concentrations cccs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential measurements indicated that mnii iii were responsible for the decreased stability due to their charge neutralization effects however in ca no3 2 solution three manganese oxides had similar cccs probably due to the relatively great charge neutralization ability of ca2 suwannee river fulvic acid srfa through electrosteric interaction suppressed the aggregation of mnox 1 5 in ca no3 2 solution but had no such effect in nano3 solution comparatively the stability of mnox 5 was markedly enhanced with srfa in nano3 solutions it was proposed that ca2 and mnii iii could increase the adsorption of srfa through charge neutralization and cation bridging this study highlights the dual role dependent on either presence or absence of srfa of ca2 and mnii iii in controlling the aggregation of manganese oxides nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles aggregation cation bridging 1 introduction manganese oxides are common solid products from permanganate oxidation reaction which has been widely used for remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater petri et al 2011 and for treatment of surface water hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 2014 the generated in situ manganese oxides are excellent water treatment materials because of their oxidation adsorption and catalysis abilities jiang et al 2015 wang and stone 2006 zhu et al 2010 also in situ manganese oxides can cause some problems such as pore plugging and lowering the efficiency of the remediation scheme in groundwater treatment or leaching from the filter in water treatment plants as secondary contaminants petri et al 2011 all these issues largely depend on the particle size which is directly related with the aggregation behavior of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles the aggregation behavior of in situ manganese oxides is vital to both the application of permanganate in water treatments and their transports and fates in the natural environment huangfu et al 2013 examined the aggregation kinetic of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles the aggregation kinetic of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles was in agreement with the traditional derjaguin landau verwey overbeek type dlvo type aggregation behavior in salts solutions in the presence of macromolecules e g humic acid protein polysaccharide the stability of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles was highly enhanced such enhancement was due to the steric repulsion resulting from the adsorption of macromolecules on the surface of mno2 the stability of in situ manganese oxides was also studied but the aggregation kinetic was not explored most research mainly focused on finding out the chemicals that could stabilize the in situ manganese oxides crimi et al 2009 li and schwartz 2005 li and hanlie 2008 these chemicals like phosphate hexametaphosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds crimi et al 2009 li and schwartz 2005 li and hanlie 2008 could modify the surface properties of both manganese oxides and subsurface thus avoiding pore plugging in groundwater remediation compared with ex situ nanoparticles the in situ nanoparticles may have different stability properties for instance zheng and deng 2016 found that ferrate vi induced in situ feiii particles were more stable in natural water than ex situ feiii particles such difference in stability might be due to the dissimilar chemical compositions and structures between in situ feiii particles and ex situ feiii particles goodwill et al 2015 zheng and deng 2016 therefore the aggregation kinetic of manganese oxides in situ generated from permanganate reduction needs further investigations redox transformation of nanoparticles e g multiwalled carbon nanotubes oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles fullerene c60 nanoparticles which have redox sensitive elements in their structures or coatings can change their surface potentials composites and structures thus influencing their stability in aqueous solutions li et al 2016 qu et al 2010 yi and chen 2011 as strong oxidizing agents manganese oxides once formed in aquatic environments are exposed to surface reduction with some naturally occurring reductants e g reduced humic acid feii sulfide and sulfite surface reduction will modify the surface chemistry of manganese oxides and thus change their stability in aquatic environments for example reduction with some model organic matter e g 4 methylphenol catechol and guaiacol could induce the aggregation of mno2 nanoparticles huangfu et al 2015a 2015b this phenomenon was due to the surface charge neutralization resulted from generated mn2 from mno2 reduction the modified surface chemistry can also change the interaction types between nanoparticles and the constituents in aquatic systems and therefore influence the stability of nanoparticles for instance in nacl solutions surface oxidation markedly increased the stability of c60 nanoparticles due to the increased negative charge which was attributed to oxygen containing functional groups qu et al 2010 in contrast oxidation reduced the stability of c60 nanoparticles in cacl2 solutions due to specific interactions between ca2 and oxygen containing functional groups qu et al 2010 therefore the surface transformation induced by redox reaction plays a critical role in the stability of some nanoparticles sun et al 2015 reported a novel oxidation process in which permanganate activated by excess bi sulfite could oxidize some organic contaminants with rates that were several orders of magnitude faster than those measured with permanganate alone this process has drawn much attention in water treatments gao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2017 the limited knowledge suggests that mniii may be a main precursor of manganese oxides in permanganate bi sulfite system and the likely reaction routine is shown in eq 1 and eq 2 1 2 hso 3 mno 4 mn iii 2 oh 2 so 4 2 2 2 mn iii 2 h 2 o mn 2 mno 2 4 h initially permanganate is reduced to mniii by bi sulfite to form mniii then mniii is rapidly transformed to mn2 and mno2 through disproportionation reactions or competitively oxidize reductants however the aggregation kinetic of manganese oxides in this novel oxidation process has not been studied particularly bi sulfite is in excess therefore the influence of its redox reaction with in situ manganese oxides needs to be evaluated in this study the manganese oxides nanoparticles were in situ formed in a novel permanganate bi sulfite system which is promising in water remediation like polluted river water and groundwater moreover by changing the ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate we could examine the influence of the surface redox modification on the stability of manganese oxides the aggregation kinetics of the nanoparticles were derived by employing time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls over a range of electrolyte concentrations the electrolytes nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 provided monovalent na and divalent mg2 and ca2 cations which were largely spread in natural water and were the main cations destabilizing nanoparticles the effect of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa as a model of natural organic matter nom on the aggregation kinetics was investigated in addition the aggregation kinetics of in situ mnox nanoparticles in two kinds of natural river water samples were also determined to test if the conclusion we got were suitable in natural water 2 materials and methods materials kmno4 gr grade was purchased from the tianjin chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china hno3 was purchased from tianjin chemical reagent na2so3 naoh nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 were all ar grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 3 nmorpholino propanesulfonic acid mops 99 was purchased from sigma aldrich company srfa was obtained from international humic substances society all the stock solutions were prepared in deionized di water 18 2 mω cm and filtered through a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size before use the concentration of permanganate stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 525 nm the stock solution of bi sulfite 61 as hso3 and 39 as so3 2 at ph 7 was freshly prepared to avoid oxidation by oxygen synthesis and characterization of in situ manganese oxides the manganese oxides which were used for characterization were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of permanganate and bi sulfite stock solutions at ph 7 adjusted with hno3 or naoh the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate was set to 1 5 2 5 and 5 and correspondingly the generated manganese oxides were named mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 the initial permanganate concentration was controlled at 40 μm transmission electron microscope tem was used to determine the morphology of manganese oxides in the absence of salts in addition the influence of salts srfa and natural river water samples on the morphology of aggregated mnox nanoparticles was also studied the preparation method of mnox nanoparticles was same as that used for aggregation experiments the 200 mesh copper grid was first oxidized with ozone water 30 mg o3 l to increase the hydrophilicity of the coated carbon film which could decrease the aggregation of mnox nanoparticles after 30 min of oxidation the ozone water was removed with filter papers and tem samples were prepared by depositing several drops of the mnox suspension on the pretreated copper grid the excess solution was then removed with filter papers and the grids were air dried the nanoparticles were then observed under a jeol 1200 ex tem jeol inc operated at 120 kv the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds elemental mapping analysis was performed using scanning tem tecnai g2 f30 powder x ray diffraction xrd was performed on a θ θ bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer to determine the mineralogy of manganese oxides to prepare manganese oxides powders in situ manganese oxides suspensions were destabilized by a certain amount of nano3 and rapid magnetic stirring the precipitates from the solution were washed ten times with di water and finally the precipitates were freeze dried and sealed in a plastic bag that was filled with argon the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were obtained on a phi 5700 esca system using al ka radiation 1486 6 ev to determine the oxidation state distribution of surface manganese of manganese oxides manganese oxides powders used for xps measurement were prepared as that for xrd measurements the bulk average oxidation state i e the average oxidation state concerning both the surface and the inside of mnox of manganese for in situ manganese oxides were determined following pérez benito s method perez benito et al 1996 with iodometric techniques and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer corp for total manganese measurement the detailed description is provided in text s1 of the supporting information si the particle size and zeta potential of in situ manganese oxides were carried out on a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk operating with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm freshly prepared in situ manganese oxides solutions were used for the measurements under different water chemistry conditions determination of dissolved mn ii the dissolved mnii concentrations in manganese oxides solutions were determined using icp ms after removing manganese oxides particles by centrifugal ultrafiltration amiconultra 15 10 kda millipore ma centrifugal force 2680 g aggregation experiments the increase of in situ manganese oxides intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter with time was measured by tr dls the in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles solutions were prepared in the dls cuvette a premeasured amount of bi sulfite stock solution was added to the cuvette containing 1 mm mops buffer ph was pre adjusted to 7 which had been added a designed amount of permanganate electrolyte salts and srfa if necessary immediately the cuvette was briefly vortexed and placed into zetasizer for diameter measurements the initial concentration of permanganate was controlled at 40 μm the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate was set to 1 5 2 5 and 5 dls measurements were conducted at a scattering angle of 90 and each autocorrelation function was accumulated for 15 s the initial ph was 7 and ph drift less than 0 1 was negligible throughout the experiments the aggregation measurements were performed for 10 20 min to ensure an at least 20 increase of the intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameter determination of aggregation kinetics eq 3 and eq 4 have been widely used in the aggregation kinetics studies of various colloids and nanoparticles chen and elimelech 2006 the initial aggregation rate constants k are proportional to dd h t dt as described in eq 3 in which n 0 is the initial particle concentration d h t is the intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter at time t this increase in d h t dd h t dt is linearly at the initial regime and dd h t dt is determined using the slope of such initial regime 3 k 1 n 0 d d h t d t t 0 4 α 1 w k k f a s t d d h t d t t 0 d d h t d t t 0 f a s t the attachment

fast refers to the aggregation rate constant under diffusion limited conditions and is determined by calculating the slope dd h t dt at the initial aggregation regime aggregation kinetics in natural water samples in water treatment mnox nanoparticles were usually in situ formed in the remediation of polluted natural water with permanganate therefore two natural river water samples were used to test the aggregation of in situ manganese oxides in natural waters songhua river samples were collected from songhua river of harbin china yichun river samples were collected from yichun river yichun heilongjiang province china all the natural river water samples were collected in december 2018 and filtered through 1 2 μm glass fiber membranes gf f waterman maidstone uk the properties of natural river water samples are listed in si table s1 before experiments a certain amount of mops was added to the samples final mops concentration was 1 mm and ph was pre adjusted to 7 with naoh the in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles solutions were prepared as that described in the front part a premeasured amount of bi sulfite stock solution was added to the cuvette containing natural water samples which has been added a designed amount of permanganate immediately the cuvette was briefly vortexed and placed into zetasizer for diameter measurements 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of manganese oxides the tem image fig 1 a and b and fig s1a of the in situ manganese oxides formed in the absence of salts showed that mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 had similar flocculent morphology which was composed of many smaller flcos without clear boundary 30 nm the morphology of aggregated manganese oxides induced with salt cations in the absence fig 1c and d figs s1b c d e and presence fig 1e and f figs s1f and g of srfa and in natural water samples figs s1h and i was also examined the aggregates of mnox all showed network morphology this might be resulted from the irregular morphology of primary mnox nanoparticles the involved mechanism which was not studied in this work needs further exploration in addition such network structure of mnox aggregates might be relative with the property of mnox in enhancing coagulation efficiency of aluminum coagulants which had been widely reported xie et al 2016 the intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameters of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles lied in the range of 20 150 nm si fig s2 and the initial average diameters were 57 17 3 08 nm 46 67 1 85 nm and 63 67 5 14 nm n 10 for mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 respectively the hydrodynamic diameter was much smaller than the size determined with tem fig 1a b and fig s1a this might be due to the aggregation during tem samples preparation in fig 1b there were some smaller particles which had comparable tem size with the hydrodynamic size therefore in water medium mnox might exist as clusters composed with several primary mnox nanoparticles flocs the aggregation profiles of these three kinds of mnox nanoparticles in the absence of background salts was shown in fig s3 mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were highly stable while mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 nanoparticles slowly increased to about 65 nm and 130 nm in 20 min respectively the xrd spectra fig 1g h i for three in situ manganese oxides showed no prominent peaks indicating that they were not well crystallized the xrd pattern of mnox 1 5 had three broad peaks around 7 3 å 2 4 å and 1 4 å while mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 showed two peaks near 2 4 å and 1 4 å the xrd pattern of mnox 1 5 matched that of birnessite which is characterized by a layered structure comprised of edge sharing mno6 octahedra with an interlayer spacing around 7 å julien et al 2003 this structure has been widely reported in previous studies where manganese oxides were formed in contaminants remediation with permanganate korshin et al 2007 li and schwartz 2004 the xrd patterns of mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 correlated closely with those of vernadite elzinga and kustka 2015 lee et al 2011 similar to birnessite vernadite is also comprised of edge sharing mno6 octahedra but lacks of long range ordered sheet stacking therefore there is no peak near 7 å in xrd spectra elzinga and kustka 2015 xps is a surface sensitive technique and its detective depth is only the uppermost few atomic layers banerjee and nesbitt 1998 therefore here the manganese proportions calculated from xps data were recognized as the surface manganese proportions and correspondingly the average manganese valence was called surface average manganese valence the relative proportions of surface mnii mniii and mniv were calculated by fitting xps mn 2p3 2 spectra with the multiplet split peak envelopes defined in banerjee and nesbitt 1998 peak parameters for mn2p3 2 are presented in si table s2 and mn2p3 2 spectra with the fitting data were presented in si fig s4 the peak fit results summarized in table 1 showed that all three manganese oxides contained mniv mniii and mnii mniv proportions decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 in contrast mnii and mniii proportions of manganese oxides increased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 correspondingly the average surface oxidation states decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 it should be noted that it was hard to get the accurate mnii iii iv fraction due to the broad mn 2p peaks and the small photopeak shifts between mnii mniii and mniv it was interesting to find that stoichiometrically mnox 1 5 should be mno2 in which the manganese valence was 4 however here we found that mnii and mniii especially mniii contributed a very high percentage of surface total manganese moreover the average surface manganese valence of mnox 1 5 was obviously lower than that of birnessite reported in much previous research in which birnessite usually owned an average manganese valence of 3 6 3 8 ching et al 1997 the bulk average manganese valence was also determined for comparison for mnox 1 5 its bulk average manganese valence of 3 8 lied in the range of that reported for birnessite the obvious difference in average manganese valence determined by these two methods illustrated that mnox 1 5 might owning an shell core like structure in which the shell was composed of more mnii iii especially mniii than the core containing such high mniii proportion in the surface of mnox 1 5 might be because of the bisulfite which was recently recognized as a mn3 stabilizer gao et al 2017 bisulfite could increase the steady state concentration of aqueous mn3 in the form of mn3 bisulfite complex therefore in the presence of bisulfite more aqueous mn3 might cooperate into structure or precipitated on the surface of manganese oxides the dissolution of in situ manganese was also examined and shown in fig s5 no dissolved mn2 was detected for mnox 1 5 nanoparticles for mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 dissolved mn2 gradually increased with the increase of reaction time in addition the dissolved mn2 for mnox 2 5 was less than that for mnox 5 over the reaction time this indicated that the residual bi sulfite continually reacted with mnox 3 2 aggregation kinetics in electrolyte solutions 1 mnox 1 5 fig 2 a presents the attachment efficiency α of mnox 1 5 as a function of electrolyte i e nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 concentration the aggregation behavior of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was consistent with the classic dlvo theory of colloidal stability at low electrolyte concentration regime which was defined as reaction limited slow regime α increased with the increase of nano3 concentration once the electrolyte concentration reached the critical coagulation concentration ccc α attained its maximum value and did not increase with the increase of electrolyte concentration this range is recognized as the diffusion limited fast regime where energy barrier is eliminated and aggregation kinetics are controlled by diffusion the cccs of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were 22 mm nano3 0 56 mm mg no3 2 and 0 2 mm ca no3 2 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 were much more efficiency in destabilizing mnox 1 5 nanoparticles than nano3 zeta potential measurements fig 2b were conducted to explore the changes of surface charge with nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 zeta potential of mnox 1 5 decreased less negative with the increase of salts concentrations compared with monovalent cation na divalent cations ca2 and mg2 were much more effective in shielding the negative surface charge of mnox 1 5 therefore energy barrier between mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was lower in divalent cation solutions than that in monovalent cation solutions this explained why mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were less stable in divalent cation solutions than that in monovalent cation solutions in addition although both were divalent cations ca2 was more efficient in shielding negative surface charge of mnox 1 5 than mg2 this might be due to that ca2 has higher affinity with mnox 1 5 than mg2 such proposition was agreement with the previous research that much more ca2 adsorbed on birnessite than mg2 murray 1975 webb et al 2005 1 mm ca no3 2 or 10 mm mg no3 2 fig 2b caused a reversal in the sign of the surface charge of mnox 1 5 this implied that ca2 and mg2 both had specific interaction with mnox 1 5 the charge inversion provides a probability for removing negatively charged pollutants like arsenate and fluoride with mnox such charge inversion was also found with ex situ manganese dioxide nanoparticles preparation method seen in text s2 under identical conditions but the concentration at which charge inversion occurred was much higher about 5 mm ca no3 2 or 20 mm mg no3 2 si fig s6 this result indicated that the in situ manganese oxides had stronger affinity towards divalent cations than ex situ manganese oxides this was in accordance with the finding that in situ manganese oxide adsorbed more pbii and cdii than ex situ manganese dioxide qin et al 2011 2 comparing mnox 1 5 nanoparticles aggregation kinetics with dlvo theory the aggregation kinetics data of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were compared with dlvo theory the attachment efficiency of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were calculated by using the following expression which accounts for colloidal and hydrodynamic interactions 5 α 0 β h e x p v a h k b t 2 a h 2 a h 2 d h 0 β h e x p v t h k b t 2 a h 2 a h 2 d h where h is the distance between two particles a is the particle radius the of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles the dls intensity weighted radius were used 28 59 nm k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature 298 15 k the total interaction energy v t h between two particles is the sum energy of the van der waals attraction v a h and electrical double layer interaction v edl h v a h was calculated using the expression proposed by gregory 1981 v edl h was computed by the linear superposition approximation lsa expression gregory 1975 the β h is a dimensionless function which is used to correct for the hydrodynamic interaction between two approaching particles details on the calculation of dlvo interactions are provided in si text s3 we fitted the experimentally derived attachment efficiencies α of mnox 1 5 data in fig 2 over a range of nano3 concentrations with the theoretically predicted α profile using eq 5 in this fitting procedure hamaker constant required in the expression of v a h seen in eq s 3 was evaluated as the only floating parameter the values of other parameters were constant and given in the front part and si text s3 the theoretical attachment efficiencies solid line in fig 2a calculated with eq 5 showed remarkable agreements with experimental data the predicted hamaker constant of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles in aqueous medium was 6 61 10 20 j the hamaker constant was in the same order of magnitude 10 20 j as that of some other kinds of metal oxides gregory 2006 petosa et al 2010 moreover such value was comparable with the hamaker constant 7 84 10 20 j of another manganese oxide huangfu et al 2013 therefore the hamaker constant predicted here seemed reasonable in addition the similar hamaker constant of mnox between this study and previous study huangfu et al 2013 suggests that both mnox particles have similar material properties in some aspects 3 comparison of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 fig 3 a showed attachment efficiencies of three manganese oxides nanoparticles as a function of nano3 concentration three manganese oxides all followed the dlvo type aggregation behavior however the cccs of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 were different and were 22 mm nano3 7 mm nano3 and 5 2 mm nano3 respectively the different cccs indicated that the stability of in situ manganese oxides was in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 this observation was consistent with the results of zeta potential measurements fig 3d which showed that under any given nano3 concentration the zeta potential decreased less negative as follows mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 therefore the electrostatic interaction between nanoparticles was the key repulsion controlling the stability of manganese oxides the amounts of mnii iii might contribute to the different zeta potentials of three manganese oxides in nano3 solutions mnox 5 had more surface mniii than mnox 2 5 and mnox 1 5 in this study surface mniii might exhibit as a new phase it has been found that birnessite can transport to mniii minerals through reductive reaction elzinga and kustka 2015 however mniii mineral evidence was not found in xrd spectra this might be due to that the newly formed mniii minerals were poorly arranged and amorphous the points of zero charge pzcs for different manganite materials were reported in the range of ph 6 8 ramstedt et al 2004 much higher than that for birnessite pzc 3 jones et al 2012 thus mniii minerals at the surface might enhance the pzc of manganese oxides and substantially increased the zeta potential in this experiment mnii could neutralize the negative charge of manganese oxides as counter ions the amounts of both surface mnii table 1 of three manganese oxides and dissolved mnii fig s5 in si decreased in the order of mnox 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 1 5 such amounts of generated mnii were accordance with the stability of three manganese oxides huangfu et al also found that mnii reductive dissolution products of mno2 nanoparticles could decrease less negative the zeta potential thus inducing aggregation huangfu et al 2015a 2015b the influence of mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 on the cccs and zeta potential of three manganese oxides was showed in fig 3b c e f in the presence of mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 the difference of cccs among three manganese oxides was much less obvious than that in nano3 solution in mg no3 2 solution the cccs were 0 56 mm mg no3 2 0 49 mm mg no3 2 and 0 35 mm mg no3 2 for mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 respectively in ca no3 2 solution the cccs were almost the same and were about 0 2 mm ca no3 2 this was consistent with the zeta potential observations in which there was no significant difference in zeta potential among the three manganese oxides in mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 solution this might be due to that the divalent cations mg2 and ca2 especially ca2 and mnii iii had comparable ability to shield the surface charge of manganese oxides in addition added mg2 or ca2 concentrations at least 80 μm mg2 or 60 μm ca2 in the experiment were much higher than mnii iii concentrations thus the promoting effect of mnii iii on aggregation was much less obvious in mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 solution than that in nano3 solution 3 3 effect of nom on the aggregation kinetics to explore the impacts of nom on the aggregation kinetics of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles the attachment efficiencies of mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 in the presence of srfa as a function of nano3 and ca no3 2 were examined fig 4 a and b in the presence of srfa 1 mg l toc the aggregation behavior of both mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 was still consistent with dlvo theory of colloidal stability indicating the important role of electrostatic interaction in the aggregation process gregory 2006 in nano3 solution mnox 1 5 had similar cccs 22 mm nano3 in the absence and presence of srfa however srfa markedly increased the ccc of mnox 1 5 from 0 2 mm ca no3 2 to 0 58 mm ca no3 2 in ca no3 2 solutions such results were consistent with the zeta potential measurements fig 4c and d in which zeta potentials were almost same for mnox 1 5 with or without srfa as a function of nano3 concentration whereas srfa significantly increase more negative the surface charge of mnox 1 5 in ca no3 2 solution khan et al 2013 also found similar electrolyte type dependent phenomenon in which suwannee river humic acid srha enhanced single walled carbon nanotubes swnt stability in cacl2 solution while showed little effects in nacl solution due to the negative charges present in srfa its adsorption onto manganese oxides surfaces could impart more negative charges to the surface therefore the zeta potential measurement results indicated that ca no3 2 increased the adsorption of srfa on the surface of mnox 1 5 while nano3 did not such proposition was confirmed by the srfa adsorption measurements experimental details are provided in si text s4 tables s3 and si fig s7 in which negligible srfa 0 13 0 01 mg c mm manganese was adsorbed onto mnox 1 5 in nano3 solution comparably much more srfa 6 75 0 21 mg c mm manganese was retained on the surface of mnox 1 5 in the presence of ca no3 2 in addition the result of elemental mapping tecnai g2 f30 fig s8 also confirmed the adsorption of srfa on the surface of mnox 1 5 in the presence of 0 3 mm ca2 the distribution of c partly indicating the adsorbed srfa was similar with that of mn detailed discussion seen in si text s5 as showed in the proposed scheme fig 5 ca2 might increase the adsorption of srfa through surface charge neutralization and cation bridging ca2 could simultaneously interact with manganese oxides through complex and or electrostatic interaction and srfa through complexation with the carboxyl group such roles of ca2 have been widely reported in nom adsorption research kim et al 2009 murphy et al 1994 it should be noted that the cation bridging effect of ca2 might play a much more important role in increasing srfa adsorption than its electrostatic screening effect this was indicated by the control experiment in which srfa only slightly enhanced the stability of mnox 1 5 in the presence of mg2 si fig s9 which possessed the same charge as ca2 some studies on nom adsorption also found that cation bridging seemed reserved to ca2 or heavier divalent cations sr2 ba2 while mg2 provided only electrostatic destabilization chen et al 2007 besides increasing the electrostatic repulsion the adsorbed srfa might also result in non electrostatic i e steric repulsive interactions thus increasing the stability of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles in ca no3 2 solution in 0 4 mm ca no3 2 solution the aggregation rate of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was much slower in the presence of 3 mg l srfa than that in the presence of 1 mg l srfa si fig s10 however the zeta potential at these two conditions was similar therefore the enhanced stability of mnox 1 5 in the presence of 3 mg l srfa might be due to the steric repulsion originated from extra amount of adsorbed srfa while the zeta potential was not sensitive to the extra amount of adsorbed srfa previously steric stabilization originating from the adsorbed nom was widely reported e g fullerene nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticles ag nanoparticles and nom mniii colloids chen and elimelech 2007 domingos et al 2009 huynh and chen 2011 li et al 2019 therefore in summary srfa decreased the aggregation of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles through electrosteric effects in ca no3 2 solution in previous study huangfu et al 2013 found that srfa could obviously enhance the stability of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles in nano3 solution such discrepancy between these two studies might be ascribed to different water chemistry the previous study was conducted at a lower ph ph 6 vs ph 7 and higher srfa concentration 2 mg l vs 1 mg l which both preferred the adsorption of srfa on manganese oxides surface luckily the conditions selected in this study supplied an opportunity to find out the role of ca2 in enhancing the stability of manganese oxides in the presence of srfa as we have discussed in the front part in the absence of srfa mnox 5 was less stable than mnox 1 5 in nano3 solution but fig 4a and b showed that in the presence of 1 mg l srfa the cccs of mnox 5 were shifted to 100 mm nano3 and 1 mm ca no3 2 much higher than those of mnox 1 5 22 mm nano3 and 0 58 mm ca no3 2 the enhanced stability of mnox 5 might be attributed to its higher affinity interaction with srfa adsorption experiment si fig s7 showed that compared with mnox 1 5 mnox 5 adsorbed more srfa more surface mnii iii and dissolved mn2 might together contributed to the adsorption of srfa mnox 5 and srfa were both highly negative charged especially at relative low electrolyte concentration therefore the electrostatic repulsion unfavored the adsorption of srfa on mnox 5 as proposed in fig 5 similar to ca2 the surface mnii iii and dissolved mn2 behaved like a bridging between mnox 5 and srfa although the surface mnii and mniii did not reversed the overall negative charge of mno2 they might supplied some sites with relative lower negative or even positive charge therefore srfa could approach to such sites and form interaction like coordinate bonds 3 4 aggregation kinetics in natural water samples the aggregation profiles of in situ manganese oxides mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 in two kinds of natural river water samples were shown in fig 6 in songhua river water samples mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 had similar aggregation kinetics and their initial aggregation rates both closed to the diffusion limited aggregation rate in yichun river water samples mnox 5 showed a much lower aggregation rate than mnox 1 5 and they both did not reach the diffusion limited aggregation rate the constituents in the natural water samples were much more complicated than those in the artificial water used in this study but we could distinguish that ca2 might contribute much more to the instability of manganese oxides than other kinds of cations in songhua river water samples this was due to that ca2 had the highest concentration 24 05 mg l among all the cations see table s1 in si as well as the strong ability in neutralizing the surface charge of manganese oxides it was interesting to find that nom in songhua river water samples did not make mnox 5 obviously more stable than mnox 1 5 this might be due to that the concentration of all the cations was high enough to suppress the steric repulsion of the adsorbed nom yichun river water samples had a higher concentration of nom and lower concentration of cations table s1 in si than songhua river water samples therefore manganese oxides in yichun river water samples were more stable mnox 5 could adsorb more nom through the cation bridging effect of mnii iii so it was more stable than mnox 1 5 the aggregation kinetics tested in natural water samples highlighted the importance of ca2 in controlling the stability of manganese oxides in some cases mnii iii could play an important role in the stability of manganese oxides through its cation bridging effect between nom and manganese oxides 4 conclusion in this work mnox nanoparticles were in situ generated in bi sulfite permanganate systems and their aggregation kinetics were simultaneously studied the following conclusions can be obtained 1 without salts in situ mnox nanoparticles showed flocculent morphology composed of many smaller flcos in the presence of salts the aggregated mnox transformed to network morphology which might be relative with the property of mnox in enhancing coagulation efficiency of aluminum coagulants with the increase of the bi sulfite permanganate molar ratio birnessite type structure mnox 1 5 of mnox changed to vernadite type structure mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 2 the mnii iii generated in the redox reaction influenced the aggregation of mnox nanoparticles by two different mechanisms in the absence of srfa mnii iii decreased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through charge neutralization mechanism while in the presence of srfa mnii iii acted as a bridging between srfa and mnox which were both negatively charged thus the adsorbed srfa increased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through electrosteric repulsion 3 ca2 could also act as both charge neutralization regent and cation bridging agent in the absence of srfa ca2 decreased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through charge neutralization mechanism in the presence of srfa ca2 increased the adsorption of srfa on mnox through cation bridging mechanism therefore the stability of mnox nanoparticles increased concerning the strong charge neutralization ability and relatively high concentration of ca2 in natural water it might be the most important cation in controlling the stability of mnox nanoparticles in natural water the redox reaction between manganese oxides and some naturally occurring reductants e g reduced nom sulfide and sulfite could generate mnii iii according to this study the generated mnii iii could increase the adsorption of nom and thus increase the stability of manganese oxides this study increases the understanding of the transports and fates of mnox nanoparticles in both natural environments and engineering applications conflicts of interest the authors have no competing interests for this work acknowledgments this

18795,aqueous aggregation kinetics of manganese oxides the solid products formed during water treatment and subsurface remediation with permanganate are crucial for its application in this study manganese oxides nanoparticles were in situ formed in a permanganate bi sulfite system which was found to have excellent oxidation ability aggregation kinetics of such manganese oxides i e mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 the number represents the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate were evaluated by employing time resolved dynamic light scattering under various aquatic conditions in nano3 solution the stability of manganese oxides decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 indicated by their critical coagulation concentrations cccs x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential measurements indicated that mnii iii were responsible for the decreased stability due to their charge neutralization effects however in ca no3 2 solution three manganese oxides had similar cccs probably due to the relatively great charge neutralization ability of ca2 suwannee river fulvic acid srfa through electrosteric interaction suppressed the aggregation of mnox 1 5 in ca no3 2 solution but had no such effect in nano3 solution comparatively the stability of mnox 5 was markedly enhanced with srfa in nano3 solutions it was proposed that ca2 and mnii iii could increase the adsorption of srfa through charge neutralization and cation bridging this study highlights the dual role dependent on either presence or absence of srfa of ca2 and mnii iii in controlling the aggregation of manganese oxides nanoparticles graphical abstract image 1 keywords in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles aggregation cation bridging 1 introduction manganese oxides are common solid products from permanganate oxidation reaction which has been widely used for remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater petri et al 2011 and for treatment of surface water hu et al 2010 jiang et al 2012 2014 the generated in situ manganese oxides are excellent water treatment materials because of their oxidation adsorption and catalysis abilities jiang et al 2015 wang and stone 2006 zhu et al 2010 also in situ manganese oxides can cause some problems such as pore plugging and lowering the efficiency of the remediation scheme in groundwater treatment or leaching from the filter in water treatment plants as secondary contaminants petri et al 2011 all these issues largely depend on the particle size which is directly related with the aggregation behavior of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles the aggregation behavior of in situ manganese oxides is vital to both the application of permanganate in water treatments and their transports and fates in the natural environment huangfu et al 2013 examined the aggregation kinetic of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles the aggregation kinetic of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles was in agreement with the traditional derjaguin landau verwey overbeek type dlvo type aggregation behavior in salts solutions in the presence of macromolecules e g humic acid protein polysaccharide the stability of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles was highly enhanced such enhancement was due to the steric repulsion resulting from the adsorption of macromolecules on the surface of mno2 the stability of in situ manganese oxides was also studied but the aggregation kinetic was not explored most research mainly focused on finding out the chemicals that could stabilize the in situ manganese oxides crimi et al 2009 li and schwartz 2005 li and hanlie 2008 these chemicals like phosphate hexametaphosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds crimi et al 2009 li and schwartz 2005 li and hanlie 2008 could modify the surface properties of both manganese oxides and subsurface thus avoiding pore plugging in groundwater remediation compared with ex situ nanoparticles the in situ nanoparticles may have different stability properties for instance zheng and deng 2016 found that ferrate vi induced in situ feiii particles were more stable in natural water than ex situ feiii particles such difference in stability might be due to the dissimilar chemical compositions and structures between in situ feiii particles and ex situ feiii particles goodwill et al 2015 zheng and deng 2016 therefore the aggregation kinetic of manganese oxides in situ generated from permanganate reduction needs further investigations redox transformation of nanoparticles e g multiwalled carbon nanotubes oleic acid coated iron oxide nanoparticles fullerene c60 nanoparticles which have redox sensitive elements in their structures or coatings can change their surface potentials composites and structures thus influencing their stability in aqueous solutions li et al 2016 qu et al 2010 yi and chen 2011 as strong oxidizing agents manganese oxides once formed in aquatic environments are exposed to surface reduction with some naturally occurring reductants e g reduced humic acid feii sulfide and sulfite surface reduction will modify the surface chemistry of manganese oxides and thus change their stability in aquatic environments for example reduction with some model organic matter e g 4 methylphenol catechol and guaiacol could induce the aggregation of mno2 nanoparticles huangfu et al 2015a 2015b this phenomenon was due to the surface charge neutralization resulted from generated mn2 from mno2 reduction the modified surface chemistry can also change the interaction types between nanoparticles and the constituents in aquatic systems and therefore influence the stability of nanoparticles for instance in nacl solutions surface oxidation markedly increased the stability of c60 nanoparticles due to the increased negative charge which was attributed to oxygen containing functional groups qu et al 2010 in contrast oxidation reduced the stability of c60 nanoparticles in cacl2 solutions due to specific interactions between ca2 and oxygen containing functional groups qu et al 2010 therefore the surface transformation induced by redox reaction plays a critical role in the stability of some nanoparticles sun et al 2015 reported a novel oxidation process in which permanganate activated by excess bi sulfite could oxidize some organic contaminants with rates that were several orders of magnitude faster than those measured with permanganate alone this process has drawn much attention in water treatments gao et al 2017 guo et al 2017 hu et al 2017 the limited knowledge suggests that mniii may be a main precursor of manganese oxides in permanganate bi sulfite system and the likely reaction routine is shown in eq 1 and eq 2 1 2 hso 3 mno 4 mn iii 2 oh 2 so 4 2 2 2 mn iii 2 h 2 o mn 2 mno 2 4 h initially permanganate is reduced to mniii by bi sulfite to form mniii then mniii is rapidly transformed to mn2 and mno2 through disproportionation reactions or competitively oxidize reductants however the aggregation kinetic of manganese oxides in this novel oxidation process has not been studied particularly bi sulfite is in excess therefore the influence of its redox reaction with in situ manganese oxides needs to be evaluated in this study the manganese oxides nanoparticles were in situ formed in a novel permanganate bi sulfite system which is promising in water remediation like polluted river water and groundwater moreover by changing the ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate we could examine the influence of the surface redox modification on the stability of manganese oxides the aggregation kinetics of the nanoparticles were derived by employing time resolved dynamic light scattering tr dls over a range of electrolyte concentrations the electrolytes nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 provided monovalent na and divalent mg2 and ca2 cations which were largely spread in natural water and were the main cations destabilizing nanoparticles the effect of suwannee river fulvic acid srfa as a model of natural organic matter nom on the aggregation kinetics was investigated in addition the aggregation kinetics of in situ mnox nanoparticles in two kinds of natural river water samples were also determined to test if the conclusion we got were suitable in natural water 2 materials and methods materials kmno4 gr grade was purchased from the tianjin chemical reagent co ltd tianjin china hno3 was purchased from tianjin chemical reagent na2so3 naoh nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 were all ar grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd 3 nmorpholino propanesulfonic acid mops 99 was purchased from sigma aldrich company srfa was obtained from international humic substances society all the stock solutions were prepared in deionized di water 18 2 mω cm and filtered through a membrane of 0 22 μm pore size before use the concentration of permanganate stock solutions was determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 525 nm the stock solution of bi sulfite 61 as hso3 and 39 as so3 2 at ph 7 was freshly prepared to avoid oxidation by oxygen synthesis and characterization of in situ manganese oxides the manganese oxides which were used for characterization were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of permanganate and bi sulfite stock solutions at ph 7 adjusted with hno3 or naoh the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate was set to 1 5 2 5 and 5 and correspondingly the generated manganese oxides were named mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 the initial permanganate concentration was controlled at 40 μm transmission electron microscope tem was used to determine the morphology of manganese oxides in the absence of salts in addition the influence of salts srfa and natural river water samples on the morphology of aggregated mnox nanoparticles was also studied the preparation method of mnox nanoparticles was same as that used for aggregation experiments the 200 mesh copper grid was first oxidized with ozone water 30 mg o3 l to increase the hydrophilicity of the coated carbon film which could decrease the aggregation of mnox nanoparticles after 30 min of oxidation the ozone water was removed with filter papers and tem samples were prepared by depositing several drops of the mnox suspension on the pretreated copper grid the excess solution was then removed with filter papers and the grids were air dried the nanoparticles were then observed under a jeol 1200 ex tem jeol inc operated at 120 kv the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds elemental mapping analysis was performed using scanning tem tecnai g2 f30 powder x ray diffraction xrd was performed on a θ θ bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer to determine the mineralogy of manganese oxides to prepare manganese oxides powders in situ manganese oxides suspensions were destabilized by a certain amount of nano3 and rapid magnetic stirring the precipitates from the solution were washed ten times with di water and finally the precipitates were freeze dried and sealed in a plastic bag that was filled with argon the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra were obtained on a phi 5700 esca system using al ka radiation 1486 6 ev to determine the oxidation state distribution of surface manganese of manganese oxides manganese oxides powders used for xps measurement were prepared as that for xrd measurements the bulk average oxidation state i e the average oxidation state concerning both the surface and the inside of mnox of manganese for in situ manganese oxides were determined following pérez benito s method perez benito et al 1996 with iodometric techniques and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms nexion300q perkinelmer corp for total manganese measurement the detailed description is provided in text s1 of the supporting information si the particle size and zeta potential of in situ manganese oxides were carried out on a zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk operating with a he ne laser at a wavelength of 633 nm freshly prepared in situ manganese oxides solutions were used for the measurements under different water chemistry conditions determination of dissolved mn ii the dissolved mnii concentrations in manganese oxides solutions were determined using icp ms after removing manganese oxides particles by centrifugal ultrafiltration amiconultra 15 10 kda millipore ma centrifugal force 2680 g aggregation experiments the increase of in situ manganese oxides intensity weighted averaged hydrodynamic diameter with time was measured by tr dls the in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles solutions were prepared in the dls cuvette a premeasured amount of bi sulfite stock solution was added to the cuvette containing 1 mm mops buffer ph was pre adjusted to 7 which had been added a designed amount of permanganate electrolyte salts and srfa if necessary immediately the cuvette was briefly vortexed and placed into zetasizer for diameter measurements the initial concentration of permanganate was controlled at 40 μm the molar ratio of bi sulfite to permanganate was set to 1 5 2 5 and 5 dls measurements were conducted at a scattering angle of 90 and each autocorrelation function was accumulated for 15 s the initial ph was 7 and ph drift less than 0 1 was negligible throughout the experiments the aggregation measurements were performed for 10 20 min to ensure an at least 20 increase of the intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameter determination of aggregation kinetics eq 3 and eq 4 have been widely used in the aggregation kinetics studies of various colloids and nanoparticles chen and elimelech 2006 the initial aggregation rate constants k are proportional to dd h t dt as described in eq 3 in which n 0 is the initial particle concentration d h t is the intensity weighted average hydrodynamic diameter at time t this increase in d h t dd h t dt is

fast refers to the aggregation rate constant under diffusion limited conditions and is determined by calculating the slope dd h t dt at the initial aggregation regime aggregation kinetics in natural water samples in water treatment mnox nanoparticles were usually in situ formed in the remediation of polluted natural water with permanganate therefore two natural river water samples were used to test the aggregation of in situ manganese oxides in natural waters songhua river samples were collected from songhua river of harbin china yichun river samples were collected from yichun river yichun heilongjiang province china all the natural river water samples were collected in december 2018 and filtered through 1 2 μm glass fiber membranes gf f waterman maidstone uk the properties of natural river water samples are listed in si table s1 before experiments a certain amount of mops was added to the samples final mops concentration was 1 mm and ph was pre adjusted to 7 with naoh the in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles solutions were prepared as that described in the front part a premeasured amount of bi sulfite stock solution was added to the cuvette containing natural water samples which has been added a designed amount of permanganate immediately the cuvette was briefly vortexed and placed into zetasizer for diameter measurements 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of manganese oxides the tem image fig 1 a and b and fig s1a of the in situ manganese oxides formed in the absence of salts showed that mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 had similar flocculent morphology which was composed of many smaller flcos without clear boundary 30 nm the morphology of aggregated manganese oxides induced with salt cations in the absence fig 1c and d figs s1b c d e and presence fig 1e and f figs s1f and g of srfa and in natural water samples figs s1h and i was also examined the aggregates of mnox all showed network morphology this might be resulted from the irregular morphology of primary mnox nanoparticles the involved mechanism which was not studied in this work needs further exploration in addition such network structure of mnox aggregates might be relative with the property of mnox in enhancing coagulation efficiency of aluminum coagulants which had been widely reported xie et al 2016 the intensity weighted hydrodynamic diameters of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles lied in the range of 20 150 nm si fig s2 and the initial average diameters were 57 17 3 08 nm 46 67 1 85 nm and 63 67 5 14 nm n 10 for mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 respectively the hydrodynamic diameter was much smaller than the size determined with tem fig 1a b and fig s1a this might be due to the aggregation during tem samples preparation in fig 1b there were some smaller particles which had comparable tem size with the hydrodynamic size therefore in water medium mnox might exist as clusters composed with several primary mnox nanoparticles flocs the aggregation profiles of these three kinds of mnox nanoparticles in the absence of background salts was shown in fig s3 mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were highly stable while mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 nanoparticles slowly increased to about 65 nm and 130 nm in 20 min respectively the xrd spectra fig 1g h i for three in situ manganese oxides showed no prominent peaks indicating that they were not well crystallized the xrd pattern of mnox 1 5 had three broad peaks around 7 3 å 2 4 å and 1 4 å while mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 showed two peaks near 2 4 å and 1 4 å the xrd pattern of mnox 1 5 matched that of birnessite which is characterized by a layered structure comprised of edge sharing mno6 octahedra with an interlayer spacing around 7 å julien et al 2003 this structure has been widely reported in previous studies where manganese oxides were formed in contaminants remediation with permanganate korshin et al 2007 li and schwartz 2004 the xrd patterns of mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 correlated closely with those of vernadite elzinga and kustka 2015 lee et al 2011 similar to birnessite vernadite is also comprised of edge sharing mno6 octahedra but lacks of long range ordered sheet stacking therefore there is no peak near 7 å in xrd spectra elzinga and kustka 2015 xps is a surface sensitive technique and its detective depth is only the uppermost few atomic layers banerjee and nesbitt 1998 therefore here the manganese proportions calculated from xps data were recognized as the surface manganese proportions and correspondingly the average manganese valence was called surface average manganese valence the relative proportions of surface mnii mniii and mniv were calculated by fitting xps mn 2p3 2 spectra with the multiplet split peak envelopes defined in banerjee and nesbitt 1998 peak parameters for mn2p3 2 are presented in si table s2 and mn2p3 2 spectra with the fitting data were presented in si fig s4 the peak fit results summarized in table 1 showed that all three manganese oxides contained mniv mniii and mnii mniv proportions decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 in contrast mnii and mniii proportions of manganese oxides increased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 correspondingly the average surface oxidation states decreased in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 it should be noted that it was hard to get the accurate mnii iii iv fraction due to the broad mn 2p peaks and the small photopeak shifts between mnii mniii and mniv it was interesting to find that stoichiometrically mnox 1 5 should be mno2 in which the manganese valence was 4 however here we found that mnii and mniii especially mniii contributed a very high percentage of surface total manganese moreover the average surface manganese valence of mnox 1 5 was obviously lower than that of birnessite reported in much previous research in which birnessite usually owned an average manganese valence of 3 6 3 8 ching et al 1997 the bulk average manganese valence was also determined for comparison for mnox 1 5 its bulk average manganese valence of 3 8 lied in the range of that reported for birnessite the obvious difference in average manganese valence determined by these two methods illustrated that mnox 1 5 might owning an shell core like structure in which the shell was composed of more mnii iii especially mniii than the core containing such high mniii proportion in the surface of mnox 1 5 might be because of the bisulfite which was recently recognized as a mn3 stabilizer gao et al 2017 bisulfite could increase the steady state concentration of aqueous mn3 in the form of mn3 bisulfite complex therefore in the presence of bisulfite more aqueous mn3 might cooperate into structure or precipitated on the surface of manganese oxides the dissolution of in situ manganese was also examined and shown in fig s5 no dissolved mn2 was detected for mnox 1 5 nanoparticles for mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 dissolved mn2 gradually increased with the increase of reaction time in addition the dissolved mn2 for mnox 2 5 was less than that for mnox 5 over the reaction time this indicated that the residual bi sulfite continually reacted with mnox 3 2 aggregation kinetics in electrolyte solutions 1 mnox 1 5 fig 2 a presents the attachment efficiency α of mnox 1 5 as a function of electrolyte i e nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 concentration the aggregation behavior of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was consistent with the classic dlvo theory of colloidal stability at low electrolyte concentration regime which was defined as reaction limited slow regime α increased with the increase of nano3 concentration once the electrolyte concentration reached the critical coagulation concentration ccc α attained its maximum value and did not increase with the increase of electrolyte concentration this range is recognized as the diffusion limited fast regime where energy barrier is eliminated and aggregation kinetics are controlled by diffusion the cccs of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were 22 mm nano3 0 56 mm mg no3 2 and 0 2 mm ca no3 2 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 were much more efficiency in destabilizing mnox 1 5 nanoparticles than nano3 zeta potential measurements fig 2b were conducted to explore the changes of surface charge with nano3 mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 zeta potential of mnox 1 5 decreased less negative with the increase of salts concentrations compared with monovalent cation na divalent cations ca2 and mg2 were much more effective in shielding the negative surface charge of mnox 1 5 therefore energy barrier between mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was lower in divalent cation solutions than that in monovalent cation solutions this explained why mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were less stable in divalent cation solutions than that in monovalent cation solutions in addition although both were divalent cations ca2 was more efficient in shielding negative surface charge of mnox 1 5 than mg2 this might be due to that ca2 has higher affinity with mnox 1 5 than mg2 such proposition was agreement with the previous research that much more ca2 adsorbed on birnessite than mg2 murray 1975 webb et al 2005 1 mm ca no3 2 or 10 mm mg no3 2 fig 2b caused a reversal in the sign of the surface charge of mnox 1 5 this implied that ca2 and mg2 both had specific interaction with mnox 1 5 the charge inversion provides a probability for removing negatively charged pollutants like arsenate and fluoride with mnox such charge inversion was also found with ex situ manganese dioxide nanoparticles preparation method seen in text s2 under identical conditions but the concentration at which charge inversion occurred was much higher about 5 mm ca no3 2 or 20 mm mg no3 2 si fig s6 this result indicated that the in situ manganese oxides had stronger affinity towards divalent cations than ex situ manganese oxides this was in accordance with the finding that in situ manganese oxide adsorbed more pbii and cdii than ex situ manganese dioxide qin et al 2011 2 comparing mnox 1 5 nanoparticles aggregation kinetics with dlvo theory the aggregation kinetics data of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were compared with dlvo theory the attachment efficiency of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles were calculated by using the following expression which accounts for colloidal and hydrodynamic interactions 5 α 0 β h e x p v a h k b t 2 a h 2 a h 2 d h 0 β h e x p v t h k b t 2 a h 2 a h 2 d h where h is the distance between two particles a is the particle radius the of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles the dls intensity weighted radius were used 28 59 nm k b is the boltzmann constant and t is the absolute temperature 298 15 k the total interaction energy v t h between two particles is the sum energy of the van der waals attraction v a h and electrical double layer interaction v edl h v a h was calculated using the expression proposed by gregory 1981 v edl h was computed by the linear superposition approximation lsa expression gregory 1975 the β h is a dimensionless function which is used to correct for the hydrodynamic interaction between two approaching particles details on the calculation of dlvo interactions are provided in si text s3 we fitted the experimentally derived attachment efficiencies α of mnox 1 5 data in fig 2 over a range of nano3 concentrations with the theoretically predicted α profile using eq 5 in this fitting procedure hamaker constant required in the expression of v a h seen in eq s 3 was evaluated as the only floating parameter the values of other parameters were constant and given in the front part and si text s3 the theoretical attachment efficiencies solid line in fig 2a calculated with eq 5 showed remarkable agreements with experimental data the predicted hamaker constant of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles in aqueous medium was 6 61 10 20 j the hamaker constant was in the same order of magnitude 10 20 j as that of some other kinds of metal oxides gregory 2006 petosa et al 2010 moreover such value was comparable with the hamaker constant 7 84 10 20 j of another manganese oxide huangfu et al 2013 therefore the hamaker constant predicted here seemed reasonable in addition the similar hamaker constant of mnox between this study and previous study huangfu et al 2013 suggests that both mnox particles have similar material properties in some aspects 3 comparison of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 fig 3 a showed attachment efficiencies of three manganese oxides nanoparticles as a function of nano3 concentration three manganese oxides all followed the dlvo type aggregation behavior however the cccs of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 were different and were 22 mm nano3 7 mm nano3 and 5 2 mm nano3 respectively the different cccs indicated that the stability of in situ manganese oxides was in the order of mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 this observation was consistent with the results of zeta potential measurements fig 3d which showed that under any given nano3 concentration the zeta potential decreased less negative as follows mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 5 therefore the electrostatic interaction between nanoparticles was the key repulsion controlling the stability of manganese oxides the amounts of mnii iii might contribute to the different zeta potentials of three manganese oxides in nano3 solutions mnox 5 had more surface mniii than mnox 2 5 and mnox 1 5 in this study surface mniii might exhibit as a new phase it has been found that birnessite can transport to mniii minerals through reductive reaction elzinga and kustka 2015 however mniii mineral evidence was not found in xrd spectra this might be due to that the newly formed mniii minerals were poorly arranged and amorphous the points of zero charge pzcs for different manganite materials were reported in the range of ph 6 8 ramstedt et al 2004 much higher than that for birnessite pzc 3 jones et al 2012 thus mniii minerals at the surface might enhance the pzc of manganese oxides and substantially increased the zeta potential in this experiment mnii could neutralize the negative charge of manganese oxides as counter ions the amounts of both surface mnii table 1 of three manganese oxides and dissolved mnii fig s5 in si decreased in the order of mnox 5 mnox 2 5 mnox 1 5 such amounts of generated mnii were accordance with the stability of three manganese oxides huangfu et al also found that mnii reductive dissolution products of mno2 nanoparticles could decrease less negative the zeta potential thus inducing aggregation huangfu et al 2015a 2015b the influence of mg no3 2 and ca no3 2 on the cccs and zeta potential of three manganese oxides was showed in fig 3b c e f in the presence of mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 the difference of cccs among three manganese oxides was much less obvious than that in nano3 solution in mg no3 2 solution the cccs were 0 56 mm mg no3 2 0 49 mm mg no3 2 and 0 35 mm mg no3 2 for mnox 1 5 mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 respectively in ca no3 2 solution the cccs were almost the same and were about 0 2 mm ca no3 2 this was consistent with the zeta potential observations in which there was no significant difference in zeta potential among the three manganese oxides in mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 solution this might be due to that the divalent cations mg2 and ca2 especially ca2 and mnii iii had comparable ability to shield the surface charge of manganese oxides in addition added mg2 or ca2 concentrations at least 80 μm mg2 or 60 μm ca2 in the experiment were much higher than mnii iii concentrations thus the promoting effect of mnii iii on aggregation was much less obvious in mg no3 2 or ca no3 2 solution than that in nano3 solution 3 3 effect of nom on the aggregation kinetics to explore the impacts of nom on the aggregation kinetics of in situ manganese oxides nanoparticles the attachment efficiencies of mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 in the presence of srfa as a function of nano3 and ca no3 2 were examined fig 4 a and b in the presence of srfa 1 mg l toc the aggregation behavior of both mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 was still consistent with dlvo theory of colloidal stability indicating the important role of electrostatic interaction in the aggregation process gregory 2006 in nano3 solution mnox 1 5 had similar cccs 22 mm nano3 in the absence and presence of srfa however srfa markedly increased the ccc of mnox 1 5 from 0 2 mm ca no3 2 to 0 58 mm ca no3 2 in ca no3 2 solutions such results were consistent with the zeta potential measurements fig 4c and d in which zeta potentials were almost same for mnox 1 5 with or without srfa as a function of nano3 concentration whereas srfa significantly increase more negative the surface charge of mnox 1 5 in ca no3 2 solution khan et al 2013 also found similar electrolyte type dependent phenomenon in which suwannee river humic acid srha enhanced single walled carbon nanotubes swnt stability in cacl2 solution while showed little effects in nacl solution due to the negative charges present in srfa its adsorption onto manganese oxides surfaces could impart more negative charges to the surface therefore the zeta potential measurement results indicated that ca no3 2 increased the adsorption of srfa on the surface of mnox 1 5 while nano3 did not such proposition was confirmed by the srfa adsorption measurements experimental details are provided in si text s4 tables s3 and si fig s7 in which negligible srfa 0 13 0 01 mg c mm manganese was adsorbed onto mnox 1 5 in nano3 solution comparably much more srfa 6 75 0 21 mg c mm manganese was retained on the surface of mnox 1 5 in the presence of ca no3 2 in addition the result of elemental mapping tecnai g2 f30 fig s8 also confirmed the adsorption of srfa on the surface of mnox 1 5 in the presence of 0 3 mm ca2 the distribution of c partly indicating the adsorbed srfa was similar with that of mn detailed discussion seen in si text s5 as showed in the proposed scheme fig 5 ca2 might increase the adsorption of srfa through surface charge neutralization and cation bridging ca2 could simultaneously interact with manganese oxides through complex and or electrostatic interaction and srfa through complexation with the carboxyl group such roles of ca2 have been widely reported in nom adsorption research kim et al 2009 murphy et al 1994 it should be noted that the cation bridging effect of ca2 might play a much more important role in increasing srfa adsorption than its electrostatic screening effect this was indicated by the control experiment in which srfa only slightly enhanced the stability of mnox 1 5 in the presence of mg2 si fig s9 which possessed the same charge as ca2 some studies on nom adsorption also found that cation bridging seemed reserved to ca2 or heavier divalent cations sr2 ba2 while mg2 provided only electrostatic destabilization chen et al 2007 besides increasing the electrostatic repulsion the adsorbed srfa might also result in non electrostatic i e steric repulsive interactions thus increasing the stability of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles in ca no3 2 solution in 0 4 mm ca no3 2 solution the aggregation rate of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles was much slower in the presence of 3 mg l srfa than that in the presence of 1 mg l srfa si fig s10 however the zeta potential at these two conditions was similar therefore the enhanced stability of mnox 1 5 in the presence of 3 mg l srfa might be due to the steric repulsion originated from extra amount of adsorbed srfa while the zeta potential was not sensitive to the extra amount of adsorbed srfa previously steric stabilization originating from the adsorbed nom was widely reported e g fullerene nanoparticles tio2 nanoparticles ag nanoparticles and nom mniii colloids chen and elimelech 2007 domingos et al 2009 huynh and chen 2011 li et al 2019 therefore in summary srfa decreased the aggregation of mnox 1 5 nanoparticles through electrosteric effects in ca no3 2 solution in previous study huangfu et al 2013 found that srfa could obviously enhance the stability of ex situ mno2 nanoparticles in nano3 solution such discrepancy between these two studies might be ascribed to different water chemistry the previous study was conducted at a lower ph ph 6 vs ph 7 and higher srfa concentration 2 mg l vs 1 mg l which both preferred the adsorption of srfa on manganese oxides surface luckily the conditions selected in this study supplied an opportunity to find out the role of ca2 in enhancing the stability of manganese oxides in the presence of srfa as we have discussed in the front part in the absence of srfa mnox 5 was less stable than mnox 1 5 in nano3 solution but fig 4a and b showed that in the presence of 1 mg l srfa the cccs of mnox 5 were shifted to 100 mm nano3 and 1 mm ca no3 2 much higher than those of mnox 1 5 22 mm nano3 and 0 58 mm ca no3 2 the enhanced stability of mnox 5 might be attributed to its higher affinity interaction with srfa adsorption experiment si fig s7 showed that compared with mnox 1 5 mnox 5 adsorbed more srfa more surface mnii iii and dissolved mn2 might together contributed to the adsorption of srfa mnox 5 and srfa were both highly negative charged especially at relative low electrolyte concentration therefore the electrostatic repulsion unfavored the adsorption of srfa on mnox 5 as proposed in fig 5 similar to ca2 the surface mnii iii and dissolved mn2 behaved like a bridging between mnox 5 and srfa although the surface mnii and mniii did not reversed the overall negative charge of mno2 they might supplied some sites with relative lower negative or even positive charge therefore srfa could approach to such sites and form interaction like coordinate bonds 3 4 aggregation kinetics in natural water samples the aggregation profiles of in situ manganese oxides mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 in two kinds of natural river water samples were shown in fig 6 in songhua river water samples mnox 1 5 and mnox 5 had similar aggregation kinetics and their initial aggregation rates both closed to the diffusion limited aggregation rate in yichun river water samples mnox 5 showed a much lower aggregation rate than mnox 1 5 and they both did not reach the diffusion limited aggregation rate the constituents in the natural water samples were much more complicated than those in the artificial water used in this study but we could distinguish that ca2 might contribute much more to the instability of manganese oxides than other kinds of cations in songhua river water samples this was due to that ca2 had the highest concentration 24 05 mg l among all the cations see table s1 in si as well as the strong ability in neutralizing the surface charge of manganese oxides it was interesting to find that nom in songhua river water samples did not make mnox 5 obviously more stable than mnox 1 5 this might be due to that the concentration of all the cations was high enough to suppress the steric repulsion of the adsorbed nom yichun river water samples had a higher concentration of nom and lower concentration of cations table s1 in si than songhua river water samples therefore manganese oxides in yichun river water samples were more stable mnox 5 could adsorb more nom through the cation bridging effect of mnii iii so it was more stable than mnox 1 5 the aggregation kinetics tested in natural water samples highlighted the importance of ca2 in controlling the stability of manganese oxides in some cases mnii iii could play an important role in the stability of manganese oxides through its cation bridging effect between nom and manganese oxides 4 conclusion in this work mnox nanoparticles were in situ generated in bi sulfite permanganate systems and their aggregation kinetics were simultaneously studied the following conclusions can be obtained 1 without salts in situ mnox nanoparticles showed flocculent morphology composed of many smaller flcos in the presence of salts the aggregated mnox transformed to network morphology which might be relative with the property of mnox in enhancing coagulation efficiency of aluminum coagulants with the increase of the bi sulfite permanganate molar ratio birnessite type structure mnox 1 5 of mnox changed to vernadite type structure mnox 2 5 and mnox 5 2 the mnii iii generated in the redox reaction influenced the aggregation of mnox nanoparticles by two different mechanisms in the absence of srfa mnii iii decreased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through charge neutralization mechanism while in the presence of srfa mnii iii acted as a bridging between srfa and mnox which were both negatively charged thus the adsorbed srfa increased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through electrosteric repulsion 3 ca2 could also act as both charge neutralization regent and cation bridging agent in the absence of srfa ca2 decreased the stability of mnox nanoparticles through charge neutralization mechanism in the presence of srfa ca2 increased the adsorption of srfa on mnox through cation bridging mechanism therefore the stability of mnox nanoparticles increased concerning the strong charge neutralization ability and relatively high concentration of ca2 in natural water it might be the most important cation in controlling the stability of mnox nanoparticles in natural water the redox reaction between manganese oxides and some naturally occurring reductants e g reduced nom sulfide and sulfite could generate mnii iii according to this study the generated mnii iii could increase the adsorption of nom and thus increase the stability of manganese oxides this study increases the understanding of the transports and fates of mnox nanoparticles in both natural environments and engineering applications conflicts of interest the authors have no competing interests for this work acknowledgments this

18796,cooling towers for heating ventilation and air conditioning are ubiquitous in the built environment often located on rooftops their semi open water basins provide a suitable environment for microbial growth they are recognized as a potential source of bacterial pathogens and have been associated with disease outbreaks such as legionnaires disease while measures to minimize public health risks are in place the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive in this study we analysed the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater systems yet less diverse than natural environments the most abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water while each cooling tower had a pronounced site specific microbial community taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation we also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens such as legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas species albeit at generally low abundance although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal change protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens co occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba associated bacteria and their hosts and predicted a large number of additional relationships involving ciliates and other protists together this study provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial diversity of cooling tower water basins establishing a framework for investigating and assessing public health risks associated with these man made freshwater environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial diversity legionella mycobacteria chlamydia protists free living amoeba built environment hvac cooling tower 1 introduction most modern commercial industrial and residential buildings rely on cooling towers as cost efficient measures to remove excess heat containing large semi open water volumes at a rather constant temperature cooling towers are suitable environments for microbial growth throughout the year and have been implicated in bacterial outbreaks kurtz et al 1982 pagnier et al 2009 torvinen et al 2013 yamamoto et al 1992 one of the major public health risks associated with cooling towers is legionnaires disease this respiratory tract infection is caused by legionella pneumophila a gammaproteobacterial pathogen acquired through inhalation of aerosols and is potentially fatal for immunocompromised patients hamilton et al 2018 walser et al 2014 other opportunistic bacterial pathogens detected in cooling towers include mycobacterium spp pseudomonas spp burkholderia spp and pantoea spp ceyhan and ozdemir 2008 protists such as free living amoebae are common members of microbial communities in cooling towers barbaree et al 1986 berk et al 2006 delafont et al 2016 pagnier et al 2009 they are predators of other microbes in the system and may also be reservoirs for bacterial pathogens such as legionella and mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa francisella tularensis coxiella burnetii and vibrio cholerae abd et al 2003 la scola and raoult 2001 sandström et al 2010 thomas and mcdonnell 2007 thom et al 1992 van der henst et al 2016 these microbes are able to escape the regular phagolysosomal pathway and transiently replicate within amoeba trophozoites moreover many free living amoebae can form cysts a resistant life stage providing protection from unfavorable environmental conditions including biocides fouque et al 2012 miltner and bermudez 2000 efficient disinfection procedures targeting not only bacteria but also protists have thus been recognized as important in reducing the public health risk associated with cooling towers critchley and bentham 2009 scheikl et al 2016 bacteria protist relationships are manifold cirillo et al 1997 1994 fritsche et al 1998 greub and raoult 2004 hess 2016 hess 2017 molmeret et al 2005 they also include obligate bacterial symbionts such as caedibacter and holospora species in ciliates dziallas 2012 fokin 2004 goertz 2001 or protochlamydia and parachlamydia species also known as environmental chlamydiae horn 2008 taylor brown et al 2015 yet microbial communities and their interactions in cooling tower water are likely far more complex than recognized the presence of specific bacterial pathogens has been investigated inoue et al 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2011 2009 states et al 1987 torvinen et al 2013 ulleryd et al 2012 but surveys on the overall microbial community composition are rare llewellyn et al 2017 wang et al 2013 studies specifically investigating community assembly and dynamics in these systems are largely lacking with currently only one recent report pereira et al 2017 except for a few notable studies llewellyn et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2013 work on the microbial community of water towers has been based on cultivation dependent methods or pcr assays targeting specific microbial groups which are inherently limited in both taxonomic resolution and scope high throughput dna sequencing of 16s 18s ribosomal rna gene pcr products termed amplicon sequencing is able to circumvent these limitations and provides detailed data on both bacterial and protist communities thompson et al 2017 after all it is the wide range of interactions from antagonistic to synergistic that shape microbial assemblages and ultimately determine the chances for pathogen proliferation in this study we used amplicon sequencing to investigate seasonal and geographic variation in the composition of bacterial and protist communities found in three cooling towers over a one year period we focused our analysis on the bulk water in the water basins because it is the source of aerosols formed during cooling tower operation nhu nguyen et al 2005 bacteria protist relationships were inferred from co occurrence network analysis these approaches identified key microbial players and provided detailed insight into the microbial community dynamics in these systems including putative bacteria protist interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description sample collection and processing three different heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac cooling towers located on the rooftop of different buildings in the city of vienna austria were studied two buildings a hospital and a business complex were located near the city center 1 7 km apart from each other whereas a second hospital was located at vienna s periphery 5 km from the other two locations the two hospitals are hereafter referred to as cooling tower 1 ct 1 and ct 2 the business complex as ct 3 for all three sites the water temperature was recorded throughout the sampling campaign the cooling towers were subjected to disinfection with chlorine bromine based disinfectant 1 3 g m3 over an automated dosimeter ct 1 was disinfected three times a week ct 2 every 18 h and ct 3 every four days during the sampling period between september 2013 and september 2014 water samples were taken on a biweekly basis ct 3 was not operating during the winter season resulting in fewer samples from the tank basin 3 l of bulk water was sampled and stored at 4 c for up to a day before further processing the water was stirred first and then 2 l per sample were vacuum filtered onto a cellulose nitrate filter diameter 0 2 μm 12 5 cm2 sartorius stedim in 500 ml steps in case of rapid filter clogging filters with a slightly larger pore size diameter 0 45 μm were used in addition for further filtration of the same sample up to four filters were used per sample all filters were subsequently used for downstream processing 2 2 dna extraction and 16s 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the powerwater dna isolation kit qiagen hilden germany was used for dna extraction from the filters all steps were performed according to the standard centrifuge based protocol recommended by the manufacturer briefly the filters were inserted in a lysis buffer containing bead beating tube where the cells were mechanically and chemically lysed the lysates were transferred to a dna retaining spin column lysates from the same sample were loaded onto the same column to pool the dna after washing dna was eluted in the dna elution buffer and used for pcr a two step barcoded amplicon sequencing approach was used as described previously herbold et al 2015 briefly fragments of the bacterial and eukaryotic small subunit rrna gene were amplified resulting in 26 libraries each for ct 1 and ct 2 and 14 libraries for ct 3 v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified with the primers bakt 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and bakt 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 herlemann et al 2011 archaea were not targeted by this primer set and were not analysed in this study the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene primer pair euk 1391f 5 gtacacaccgcccgtc 3 and euk 1510r 5 ccttcygcaggttcacctac 3 based on the earth microbiome project version 5 2012 amaral zettler et al 2009 gilbert et al 2014 were used to amplify the 18sv9 region for each primer set and sequencing run negative controls without the addition of dna were performed and sequenced each pcr reaction included 1x dreamtaq green buffer fermentas thermo fisher scientific vienna austria 2 mm mgcl2 0 2 mm dntp mix fermentas 0 1 mg ml 1 bovine serum albumin 1 μm of each of the forward

gene 90 s at 72 c and 72 c for 10 min was performed in triplicates pcr products were pooled and served as the template for the second barcoding pcr 95 c for 3 min 10 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 55 c 60 s at 72 c and 72 c for 7 min purification and quantification of pcr products were done as described herbold et al 2015 the truseq nano dna library prep kit illumina was used for adaptor ligation and pcr without the fragmentation step sequencing was performed by microsynth ag balgach switzerland on a miseq system illumina using the miseq reagent kit v3 resulting sequence datasets were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under study accession number prjeb21563 2 3 data compilation filtering clustering and classification paired end reads were demultiplexed and trimmed as described herbold et al 2015 and were assembled using fastq join within qiime caporaso et al 2010 18s rrna reads were forced to be trimmed by at least 88 nucleotides prior to trimming and assembly because the expected amplicon length of 178 bp was shorter than the average read length clustering into operational taxonomic units otus and chimera checking were performed using uparse edgar 2013 using a distance of 0 03 and disallowing singletons to serve as a centroid taxonomic classification of otu centroids was carried out using the bayesian classifier implemented in mothur schloss et al 2009 and the silva ssu database version 132 quast et al 2013 for 16s rrna data sets or the protist ribosomal reference database pr2 version 4 11 1 guillou et al 2013 for 18s rrna data sets otus with a classification confidence score lower than 80 for 16s rrna data sets and 60 for 18s rrna data sets were changed to unclassified the class betaproteobacteria has recently been proposed to be reclassified as the new order betaproteobacteriales within the class gammaproteobacteria parks et al 2018 for clarity and consistency with previous studies the betaproteobacteria were still treated as a separate class but both names are provided 16s rrna otus classified as mitochondria and chloroplasts were omitted from subsequent analysis this did not change the overall estimates of alpha and beta diversity measures 16s rrna otus present only in the negative controls or strongly overrepresented 50 fold in the negative controls compared to all samples were considered to be cross contamination and thus removed from the dataset table s1 all 18s rrna otus only present in the negative control were removed from the dataset otus present in both control and samples were only retained if their sample abundance exceed the control abundance by 1000 fold table s2 taking into account the known relationships between protists and pathogenic bacteria in the water borne environment we restricted our analysis of 18s rrna sequences to the groups amoebozoa lobosa conosa excavata discoba metamonada rhizaria cercozoa foraminifera and alveolata apicomplexa ciliophora dinoflagellata both data sets were rarefied individually to standardize sequence numbers using the rarify even depth function in the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 with replacement option turned off for the 16s rrna data set a minimum of 1713 sequences was used representing the 15 quantile of the data for the 18s rrna data set which had a greater library size variation a cutoff of 59 sequences equivalent to 45 quantile of the data was used samples not fulfilling these criteria were removed from the subsequent analysis 2 4 alpha and beta diversity measures and co occurrence analysis alpha diversity was assessed for both data sets with the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 using the estimators chao1 and the shannon diversity index bacterial community composition was compared by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity for the otu co occurrence analysis only those samples for which both 16s and 18s rrna sequence data were available after rarefying were included in addition only otus present in at least 3 samples for each cooling tower and with a total number of sequences greater than 10 were kept to remove the number of infrequent otus for each cooling tower co occurrence analysis of 16s rrna and 18s rrna otus was performed using conet faust and raes 2016 a plug in of the software cytoscape shannon et al 2003 to calculate consensus networks a combination of different correlation and distance measures including pearson and spearman correlation mutual information kullback leibler divergence and bray curtis dissimilarity was used the maximum lag was set to 1 to include slightly shifted associations distribution of all pair wise scores was generated and the 7 5 top scoring edges supported by at least four out of five positive correlations or three out of five negative correlations measures were kept this process was performed with 1000 renormalized permutations resampling by row shuffling and p value merging with brown s method after applying benjamini hochberg s false discovery rate correction edges with a corrected p value below 0 05 were kept the r package ampvis albertsen et al 2015 was used to generate heatmaps metacoder foster et al 2017 was used to generate heat trees 3 results and discussion in this study we monitored the microbial community in the water basins of three heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac cooling towers in the following referred to as ct 1 ct 2 and ct 3 over the course of one year the temperature in the basins ranged between 20 1 c and 32 3 c for ct 1 99 percentile of all temperature data points and between 19 9 c and 29 c for ct 2 throughout the sampling period the average temperature during the summer months was slightly higher than during winter 27 8 c vs 26 4 c for ct 1 and 26 6 c vs 23 1 c for ct 2 temperature data for ct 3 were only available after mid april 2014 its temperature range was 10 6 27 4 c larger than that of the other two towers elevated temperature in the water basin is a characteristic feature of cooling towers and together with the semi open design of these systems provide good conditions for microbial growth cooling tower water tanks like other freshwater or drinking water systems develop biofilms liu et al 2009 yet for the purpose of this study we focused on the analysis of bulk water for two reasons i bulk water represents the seed community for biofilm formation in the basin and ii it is the source of aerosols formed during cooling tower operation nhu nguyen et al 2005 3 1 complex but reduced bacterial diversity compared to open freshwater environments in total we collected 26 samples each for ct 1 and ct 2 and 14 samples for ct 3 amplicon sequencing of 16s and 18s rrna genes revealed taxonomically diverse bacterial and protist communities for all three cooling towers to study seasonal dynamics of microbial diversity in the three cooling towers we first estimated species level richness and evenness using a threshold of 97 sequence similarity for operational taxonomic unit otu definition good s coverage estimator was 0 984 0 007 mean sem for 16s otus and 0 958 0 018 mean sem for 18s otus indicating that sequencing depth was sufficient for reliable community composition analysis after rarefying our data set included 23 ct 1 samples 21 ct 2 samples and 12 ct 3 samples in total 590 bacterial otus and 321 protist otus were considered for our analysis tables s3 and s4 the three cooling towers showed clear differences in bacterial and protist species richness and evenness fig 1 as a general pattern protist diversity was much lower than bacterial diversity for all samples and sampling sites microbial diversity fluctuated strongly throughout the sampling period and there was no clear common trend observed among the different cooling towers it is interesting that while ct 1 had the highest bacterial diversity values as inferred from chao1 and shannon estimators welch s t test p value 0 0001 it also showed the lowest protist diversity and evenness compared to the other two locations which were also more similar with each other fig 1 this was also reflected in the nmds based beta diversity analysis welch corrected t test of the average bray curtis distance within one sampling site compared to other sites p value 0 0001 revealing clear sample clusters according to sampling site and time point fig 2 at all sampling sites we observed gradual community shifts over time reflecting seasonal changes in bacterial and protist diversity in ct 1 the high similarity between autumn winter and spring samples indicated a gradual rather than sudden change in contrast the community shift in ct 2 was more pronounced fig 2 to better understand community structure we next classified all otus grouped them at the genus level and focused on the 20 most abundant genera fig 3 ct 2 and ct 3 are both dominated by a few abundant genera whereas in ct 1 abundances of the top genera are more evenly distributed this analysis showed that the general bacterial community composition is different between the three cooling towers yet flavobacterium bacteroidetes hyphomicrobium members of the rhizobiales and sphingomonadales alphaproteobacteria pseudomonas gammaproteobacteria and methyloversatilis betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales parks et al 2018 are among the top abundant taxa in all three towers fig 3 the most striking difference between the cooling towers is the extremely high pseudomonas abundance in ct 2 fig 3 which makes up almost 31 8 of all sequence reads compared to up to 3 at the other two sampling sites while other gammaproteobacteria were generally not well represented in our data set our observations are consistent with findings from the only cooling tower for which a similar analysis is available so far pereira et al 2017 in this study members of the rhizobiales burkholderiales methylophilales and cytophagales were also among the most abundant taxa in contrast we didn t detect xanthomonadales among the top taxa but found other groups to be well represented including corynebacteriales rhodocyclales and pseudomonadales fig 3 it is noteworthy that betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales commonly found in freshwater systems newton et al 2011 are with two exceptions absent in the ct 1 top genera list whereas they are abundant in ct 2 and ct 3 two members of the recently identified candidate phyla radiation cpr are among the most abundant taxa in ct 1 parcubacteria formerly od1 and saccharimonadia formerly known as tm7 both now classified within the phylum patescibacteria members of both groups show reduced genomes and only limited metabolic capabilities likely endorsing a parasitic or symbiotic lifestyle he et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 they are known to have small cell sizes and are able to pass through a 0 22 μm filter luef et al 2015 ct 1 also included an unclassified member of the rickettsiales alphaproteobacteria among the top abundant taxa again a group of microbes generally associated with an intracellular lifestyle overall the most abundant bacterial orders identified in the cooling tower samples are well in agreement with other reports on man made water distribution systems where orders belonging to alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria are usually the prevalent taxa berry et al 2006 brown et al 2015 farenhorst et al 2017 kalmbach et al 1997 llewellyn et al 2017 martiny et al 2005 mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 pereira et al 2017 revetta et al 2010 tokajian et al 2005 vaz moreira et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 bacterial communities in more natural settings such as lakes rivers or streams are often dominated by betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales but also include actinobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia and saccharimonadia boucher et al 2006 crump and hobbie 2005 liu et al 2012 lozupone and knight 2005 mueller spitz et al 2009 newton et al 2011 tang et al 2015 zwart et al 2002 the dominance of these groups in the cooling tower microbial community structure is consistent with what has been reported for other freshwater systems this suggests that community structure in cooling towers may be primarily influenced by the seed community in the incoming drinking water and then shaped by the specific conditions in the cooling tower water basin 3 2 seasonal microbial community dynamics to further analyse temporal changes in community structure we examined the relative abundance of phyla over time consistent with our previous analysis we observed pronounced changes in bacterial community composition over time fig 4 the most dramatic seasonal change occurred in cooling tower ct 2 where an abrupt decline of gammaproteobacteria pseudomonas was observed during june 2014 fig 4 pronounced variations were also observed in the more diverse community of ct 1 in ct 3 the overall bacterial community composition was rather stable compared to the other cooling towers fig 4 protistan community members of the rhizaria the excavata the alveolata and the amoebozoa were found at all three sampling sites with the latter two phyla being most abundant and showing pronounced temporal variations notably changes in bacterial and protist diversity do not necessarily follow the same trend indicating complex interactions and differences in response to environmental conditions figs 3 and 4 next we aimed to understand differences and similarities between bacterial and protist community composition and dynamics in the three cooling towers in more detail to this end we focused on various sets of otus we defined a set of persistent otus as taxa that were detected at a given location at nearly all time points taxa were allowed to be missing from only two samples corresponding to at least 90 of all samples for ct 1 and ct 2 and 80 for ct 3 the second set was referred to as site specific otus and included those taxa that were exclusively found at a single location the third set comprised taxa detected at all cooling towers and was referred to as shared otus consistent with our observed seasonal changes there were few persistent otus 13 in ct 1 10 in ct 2 and 18 in ct 3 fig 5 they included actinobacteria mycobacterium sp or members of the microbacteriaceae proteobacteria sphingopyxis methyloversatilis blastomonas defluviimonas porphyrobacter xanthobacteraceae patescibacteria saccharimonadia formerly tm7 albertsen et al 2013 bacteroidetes or acidobacteria interestingly most of the top five abundant taxa in each of the cooling towers also belonged to the set of persistent otus figs 3 and 5 the differences between the cooling towers were further analysed by focusing on the set of site specific taxa consistent with earlier observations fig 1 ct 1 had by far the largest number of site specific bacterial otus 245 53 1 compared to ct 2 66 14 3 and ct 3 9 1 9 fig 6 a it is noteworthy that there is no overlap between the sets of site specific taxa and the persistent otus for any of the cooling towers in direct comparison the site specific taxa comprised a wider range of diverse phyla including members of the patescibacteria chlamydiae chloroflexi planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and depedentiae tm6 delafont et al 2015 table s3 the transient character of the site specific otus was further illustrated by most of them being detected at a maximum of nine time points this indicated that there was a substantial fraction of taxa specific to individual cooling towers that failed to establish long term colonization 3 3 the core bacterial microbiome of cooling towers consists of biofilm forming taxa to better understand the common features of cooling tower microbial communities we next focused on the set of shared otus i e those detected at least once at more than one site this set represents 30 6 of all bacterial otus in this study and the fraction of shared otus varied between the individual cooling towers 28 6 44 9 and 72 6 respectively the majority of shared otus belongs to the alphaproteobacteria sphingomonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales burkholderiaceae actinobacteria bacteroidetes bacteroidia and gammaproteobacteria pseudomonadaceae fig 6b and c from this large set of shared otus only six bacterial taxa were nearly always present i e also belong to the set of persistent otus fig 5 this included members of the genera pseudomonas methyloversatilis blastomonas sphingopyxis and porphyrobacter and the family xanthobacteraceae formerly classified as bradyrhizobiaceae a common feature of these microbes is their ability to form or to be associated with microbial biofilms rickard et al 2004 soto giron et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 pseudomonas species are ubiquitous environmental bacteria well known for their capability to form biofilms costerton 1999 jensen et al 2010 sauer et al 2002 they are considered pioneers specifically facilitating the initiation of biofilm formation douterelo et al 2014 members of the genus methyloversatilis are found in various environments including drinking water and biofilms kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 liu et al 2012 shpigel et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2017 williams et al 2004 blastomonas species have the ability to coaggregate with various bacteria an important feature for biofilm formation katharios lanwermeyer et al 2014 rickard et al 2002 additionally other members of the order sphingomonadales such as sphingopyxis porphyrobacter and the family xanthobacteraceae formerly bradyrhizobiaceae were repeatedly found to be associated with bacterial biofilms and are commonly present in drinking water environments bereschenko et al 2010 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 douterelo et al 2014 hong et al 2010 muchesa et al 2017 revetta et al 2010 rożej et al 2015 singh et al 2003 vaz moreira et al 2011 the occurrence and persistence of these microbes at all cooling towers suggest that biofilm formation is an important process in cooling tower microbial communities likely contributing to maintenance and resistance against disinfection measures cooling tower basins offer a large surface area and are characterized by a slow water flow speed a rather constant and elevated temperature as well as increased concentrations of organic matter compared to closed drinking water systems these conditions are well suited for biofilm formation türetgen and cotuk 2007 zacheus et al 2000 biofilms are preferred niches of protists because of the high density of microbes serving as a potential food source and grazing is a major factor modulating the structure and function of bacterial biofilms flemming et al 2016 matz et al 2005 parry 2004 biofilms are also a known reservoir and potential source for a number of bacterial pathogens delafont et al 2014 garcia et al 2013 greub and raoult 2004 wingender and flemming 2011 3 4 opportunistic bacterial pathogens over the course of our one year sampling campaign we detected few otus classified as genera comprising known opportunistic bacterial pathogens as defined in a previous study pereira et al 2017 table s5 the abundance of these otus ranges from 0 01 to 28 depending on the sampling location but the majority are below 1 we observed a total of 29 otus belonging to three different phyla actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria this includes bosea helicobacter and stenotrophobacter and several arcobacter bacillus sphingomonas legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas species table s5 in comparison to the cooling tower studied earlier the cooling towers investigated here display a less diverse set of genera including potential pathogens pereira et al 2017 of note none of the legionella sequences showed a particularly high similarity to the human pathogen legionella pneumophila this is consistent with no l pneumophila outbreak having been reported in the vicinity of our sampling locations during this study the legionella species detected belong to a group commonly referred to as legionella like amoebal pathogens a large number of species primarily found as parasites in free living amoebae greub and raoult 2004 marrie et al 2001 newsome et al 1988 all legionella otus belong to the set of site specific taxa and their relative abundances were below 0 1 rendering them members of the rare biosphere in these systems we found four otus assigned to the genus mycobacterium two of which occurred in two cooling towers one of those m wolinsky showed a relatively high abundance in ct 1 4 and belonged to the persistent taxa in this cooling tower table s3 fig 5 m wolinsky can cause bacteremia and like the other mycobacteria detected in this study is a member of the nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm group this group includes opportunistic human pathogens found in a variety of habitats ranging from soil water and man made systems to aerosols hilborn et al 2006 parker et al 1983 vaerewijck et al 2005 they are well known colonizers of water distribution systems and due to their unique cell wall composition may be involved in surface colonization and biofilm formation six pseudomonas otus were detected p stutzeri was the most abundant otu in ct 2 28 4 and was also found in the other two cooling towers p toyotomiensis 15 7 represented the second most abundant otu in ct 2 and was among the persistent shared otus table s3 fig 5 additional pseudomonas species were seen but at much lower frequencies not considered to be strict pathogens members of this genus are ubiquitous and metabolically versatile in addition to their prominent role in biofilm formation some are known as opportunistic human pathogens and cause various infections in e g the urinary tract soft tissues or the respiratory tract goetz et al 1983 keys et al 1983 potvliege et al 1987 taken together we couldn t find any evidence for the presence of sensu stricto human pathogens in the cooling tower microbial communities analysed in this study not even among the rare biosphere 3 5 a highly dynamic protist community we detected the presence of four groups of protists the rhizaria the excavata the alveolata and the amoebozoa at all three sampling sites although the top taxa in all cooling towers belonged mainly to the alveolata ciliophora and apicomplexa and amoebozoa lobosa we observed pronounced differences in relative abundances between the cooling towers fig 3 table s4 the most abundant protist groups in cooling tower ct 1 were classified into diverse taxa in the ciliophora like ancistrum 9 3 and vorticella 7 1 and lobosa taxa including vanella 8 1 cochliopodium 7 8 and vexillifera species 7 7 in contrast cooling towers ct 2 and ct 3 were dominated by diverse gregarines these apicomplexan parasites are often associated with small invertebrates although the source of the gregarines in our cooling tower water system remains unknown they were likely introduced together with their potential animal hosts still there were also several well known free living amoebae among the most abundant taxa such as vexillifera stenamoeba vannella hartmannella echinamoebida cochliopodium acanthamoeba and allovahlkampfia fig 3 table s4 taken together the protist community detected in the three cooling towers was dominated by taxa frequently found in diverse freshwater habitats and able to persist in an environment characterized by steady water movement the protist community composition was more variable than the bacterial microbiome no persistent protist taxa were observed and the most frequently recurring otus were detected in less than 50 of the samples table s4 these included stenamoeba ancistrum and vexillifera ct 1 and gregarines ct 2 the repeated occurrence of gregarines often associated with small invertebrates suggests that in addition to bacteria protists interactions small invertebrates though not analysed in this study may also affect the structure of cooling tower microbiomes by far the largest proportion of taxa was site specific fig 7 a table s4 this included representatives of the genera stenamoeba vannella echinamoeba and cochliopodium amoebozoa tetrahymena chilodonella and gregarines alveolata neobodo and vahlkampfiidae excavata and paracercomonas rhizaria more than half of these site specific otus do not occur at more than one time point further indicating that the protist community in the water basin is more variable than the bacterial community possible reasons for this may include i varying protist community composition of the source water ii competition between protists or iii random shearing of protists associated with bacterial biofilms there were few otus found at all three cooling towers 6 corresponding to 1 7 of all protist otus these included a member of the sessilida and free living amoebae such as hartmannella stenamoeba vexillifera and a conosa member fig 7b taken together the protist microbiome of cooling tower water is surprisingly diverse with a species richness lower than the bacterial community but in the same order of magnitude at the same time it is highly dynamic and only showed a small core set of persistent and shared taxa 3 6 bacteria protist interactions uncovered by co occurrence networks to gain insights into putative interactions between bacteria and protists in the cooling tower water microbiomes we constructed and analysed co occurrence networks for each cooling tower using all bacterial and protist otus and a comprehensive approach for sequence abundance based network inference faust and raes 2016 in our analysis we only considered relationships between bacteria and protists fig 8 the resulting co occurrence networks were characterized by a high number of nodes 189 otus for ct 1 61 for ct 2 and correlations 207 edges for ct 1 78 for ct 2 due to the low sample number ct 3 was not included in this analysis the networks are composed of mainly positive correlations in which the abundances of bacterial and protist otus followed the same trend protists in the ct 1 network are mainly ciliates alveolata oligohymenophorea followed by naked amoebae amoebozoa discosea most protists were correlated with a number of bacterial taxa with vorticella and an unclassified sessilida showing highest centrality i e number of edges identifying them as key players fig 8 each protist node had its own individual set of bacterial interaction partners some bacterial nodes were shared between different protists but the majority 73 of bacterial nodes were linked to only one protist suggesting a certain degree of specificity of bacteria protist interactions in comparison the ct 2 network had fewer protist nodes with high centrality however we could detect more bacterial taxa who co occurred with more than one protist 40 the most abundant bacterial otus included in both networks were members of the proteobacteria the planctomycetes and the bacteroidetes remarkably 15 6 of all predicted bacteria protist relationships in the ct 1 network and 24 in the ct 2 network were comprised of bacterial genera with members known to associate with protists fig 8 this included several well known bacterial symbionts of free living amoebae or ciliates such as members of the genera protochlamydia collingro et al 2005 fokin 2004 horn 2008 vannini et al 2004 and the family rickettsiaceae horn et al 1999 bacterial symbionts of protists are ubiquitous in ciliates and amoeba and in some cases represent ancient relationships originating millions of years ago görtz 2001 horn 2008 molmeret et al 2005 these bacteria generally show reduced metabolic capabilities and are thus dependent on their protist hosts klein et al 2012 mccutcheon and moran 2012 schmitz esser et al 2010 some act as defensive symbionts or confer resistance to environmental stress dziallas et al 2012 fujishima et al 2005 grosser et al 2018 hori and fujishima 2003 but the relevance for the protist host is often unclear the networks also included several bacterial groups transiently thriving in protists such as members of the genera legionella mycobacterium pseudomonas nordella variovorax bosea acidovorax cupriavidus brevundimonas and flavobacterium corsaro et al 2010 drancourt 2014 evstigneeva et al 2009 fields et al 2002 greub and raoult 2004 la scola et al 2004 michel et al 1995 thomas et al 2008 zeybek and binay 2014 interestingly our co occurrence analysis also predicted members of the groups parcubacteria od1 corsaro et al 2010 and depedentiae tm6 as interaction partner of protists this observation further supports a symbiotic lifestyle for parcubacteria as suggested by meta genomic analysis gong et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 and provides additional support for the endosymbiotic lifestyle of depedentiae members delafont et al 2015 our analysis underscores the potential of protists in cooling tower water microbiomes as reservoirs for intracellular bacteria including relatives of opportunistic pathogens greub and raoult 2004 of note the protist associated bacteria in our network generally show interactions with several different protist otus this indicates that in a natural setting bacterial symbionts are more promiscuous and thrive in a wide range of different protists among the taxa included in the networks there are several protists recognized previously as hosts for intracellular bacteria the amoeba vexillifera is a known host of the environmental chlamydia candidatus neptunochlamydia vexilliferae pizzetti et al 2016 hartmannella vermamoeba is the natural host of an intranuclear symbiont candidatus nucleicultrix amoebiphila and the environmental chlamydia rubidus massiliensis bou khalil et al 2016 horn 2008 schulz et al 2014 echinamoeba is a known host for pseudomonas aeruginosa michel et al 1995 in addition allovahlkampfia which have been suggested to act as hosts for pathogenic bacteria mohamed and huseein 2016 were also represented in our networks in this respect we have recently isolated from the water sample of the tower ct 1 the first testate amoeba cochliopodium minus containing a bacterial symbiont tsao et al 2017 taken together our co presence network analysis recovered a large number of known bacteria protist interactions and suggested that such relationships are much more diverse than recognized currently 4 conclusions bacterial and protist communities in cooling towers are broadly similar at the class level to those in natural freshwater and drinking water systems although community structure can be highly dynamic the presence of core taxa suggests that cooling tower basins select for biofilm forming and biofilm associated microbes amplicon sequencing techniques that target ribosomal rna genes is a useful tool to study microbial community dynamics in cooling tower water basins longer term longitudinal studies including outbreak situations are required to better understand the role of the microbial community for propagation and spread of opportunistic bacterial pathogens that have been associated with disease outbreaks the implementation of upcoming real time sequencing technologies might facilitate online monitoring of cooling tower communities to predict biofilm formation and colonization with opportunistic pathogens co occurrence network analysis is a helpful approach to predict bacteria protists interactions using amplicon sequencing data the high number of nodes and degree of connectedness in the networks obtained here highlights the importance of inter kingdom relationships in cooling tower water systems a design of cooling tower water basins and other measures that prevent biofilm formation should help to decrease the public health risk of

18796,cooling towers for heating ventilation and air conditioning are ubiquitous in the built environment often located on rooftops their semi open water basins provide a suitable environment for microbial growth they are recognized as a potential source of bacterial pathogens and have been associated with disease outbreaks such as legionnaires disease while measures to minimize public health risks are in place the general microbial and protist community structure and dynamics in these systems remain largely elusive in this study we analysed the microbiome of the bulk water from the basins of three cooling towers by 16s and 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing over the course of one year bacterial diversity in all three towers was broadly comparable to other freshwater systems yet less diverse than natural environments the most abundant taxa are also frequently found in freshwater or drinking water while each cooling tower had a pronounced site specific microbial community taxa shared among all locations mainly included groups generally associated with biofilm formation we also detected several groups related to known opportunistic pathogens such as legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas species albeit at generally low abundance although cooling towers represent a rather stable environment microbial community composition was highly dynamic and subject to seasonal change protists are important members of the cooling tower water microbiome and known reservoirs for bacterial pathogens co occurrence analysis of bacteria and protist taxa successfully captured known interactions between amoeba associated bacteria and their hosts and predicted a large number of additional relationships involving ciliates and other protists together this study provides an unbiased and comprehensive overview of microbial diversity of cooling tower water basins establishing a framework for investigating and assessing public health risks associated with these man made freshwater environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords microbial diversity legionella mycobacteria chlamydia protists free living amoeba built environment hvac cooling tower 1 introduction most modern commercial industrial and residential buildings rely on cooling towers as cost efficient measures to remove excess heat containing large semi open water volumes at a rather constant temperature cooling towers are suitable environments for microbial growth throughout the year and have been implicated in bacterial outbreaks kurtz et al 1982 pagnier et al 2009 torvinen et al 2013 yamamoto et al 1992 one of the major public health risks associated with cooling towers is legionnaires disease this respiratory tract infection is caused by legionella pneumophila a gammaproteobacterial pathogen acquired through inhalation of aerosols and is potentially fatal for immunocompromised patients hamilton et al 2018 walser et al 2014 other opportunistic bacterial pathogens detected in cooling towers include mycobacterium spp pseudomonas spp burkholderia spp and pantoea spp ceyhan and ozdemir 2008 protists such as free living amoebae are common members of microbial communities in cooling towers barbaree et al 1986 berk et al 2006 delafont et al 2016 pagnier et al 2009 they are predators of other microbes in the system and may also be reservoirs for bacterial pathogens such as legionella and mycobacterium spp pseudomonas aeruginosa francisella tularensis coxiella burnetii and vibrio cholerae abd et al 2003 la scola and raoult 2001 sandström et al 2010 thomas and mcdonnell 2007 thom et al 1992 van der henst et al 2016 these microbes are able to escape the regular phagolysosomal pathway and transiently replicate within amoeba trophozoites moreover many free living amoebae can form cysts a resistant life stage providing protection from unfavorable environmental conditions including biocides fouque et al 2012 miltner and bermudez 2000 efficient disinfection procedures targeting not only bacteria but also protists have thus been recognized as important in reducing the public health risk associated with cooling towers critchley and bentham 2009 scheikl et al 2016 bacteria protist relationships are manifold cirillo et al 1997 1994 fritsche et al 1998 greub and raoult 2004 hess 2016 hess 2017 molmeret et al 2005 they also include obligate bacterial symbionts such as caedibacter and holospora species in ciliates dziallas 2012 fokin 2004 goertz 2001 or protochlamydia and parachlamydia species also known as environmental chlamydiae horn 2008 taylor brown et al 2015 yet microbial communities and their interactions in cooling tower water are likely far more complex than recognized the presence of specific bacterial pathogens has been investigated inoue et al 2015 li et al 2015 liu et al 2011 2009 states et al 1987 torvinen et al 2013 ulleryd et al 2012 but surveys on the overall microbial community composition are rare llewellyn et al 2017 wang et al 2013 studies specifically investigating community assembly and dynamics in these systems are largely lacking with currently only one recent report pereira et al 2017 except for a few notable studies llewellyn et al 2017 pereira et al 2017 wang et al 2013 work on the microbial community of water towers has been based on cultivation dependent methods or pcr assays targeting specific microbial groups which are inherently limited in both taxonomic resolution and scope high throughput dna sequencing of 16s 18s ribosomal rna gene pcr products termed amplicon sequencing is able to circumvent these limitations and provides detailed data on both bacterial and protist communities thompson et al 2017 after all it is the wide range of interactions from antagonistic to synergistic that shape microbial assemblages and ultimately determine the chances for pathogen proliferation in this study we used amplicon sequencing to investigate seasonal and geographic variation in the composition of bacterial and protist communities found in three cooling towers over a one year period we focused our analysis on the bulk water in the water basins because it is the source of aerosols formed during cooling tower operation nhu nguyen et al 2005 bacteria protist relationships were inferred from co occurrence network analysis these approaches identified key microbial players and provided detailed insight into the microbial community dynamics in these systems including putative bacteria protist interactions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description sample collection and processing three different heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac cooling towers located on the rooftop of different buildings in the city of vienna austria were studied two buildings a hospital and a business complex were located near the city center 1 7 km apart from each other whereas a second hospital was located at vienna s periphery 5 km from the other two locations the two hospitals are hereafter referred to as cooling tower 1 ct 1 and ct 2 the business complex as ct 3 for all three sites the water temperature was recorded throughout the sampling campaign the cooling towers were subjected to disinfection with chlorine bromine based disinfectant 1 3 g m3 over an automated dosimeter ct 1 was disinfected three times a week ct 2 every 18 h and ct 3 every four days during the sampling period between september 2013 and september 2014 water samples were taken on a biweekly basis ct 3 was not operating during the winter season resulting in fewer samples from the tank basin 3 l of bulk water was sampled and stored at 4 c for up to a day before further processing the water was stirred first and then 2 l per sample were vacuum filtered onto a cellulose nitrate filter diameter 0 2 μm 12 5 cm2 sartorius stedim in 500 ml steps in case of rapid filter clogging filters with a slightly larger pore size diameter 0 45 μm were used in addition for further filtration of the same sample up to four filters were used per sample all filters were subsequently used for downstream processing 2 2 dna extraction and 16s 18s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the powerwater dna isolation kit qiagen hilden germany was used for dna extraction from the filters all steps were performed according to the standard centrifuge based protocol recommended by the manufacturer briefly the filters were inserted in a lysis buffer containing bead beating tube where the cells were mechanically and chemically lysed the lysates were transferred to a dna retaining spin column lysates from the same sample were loaded onto the same column to pool the dna after washing dna was eluted in the dna elution buffer and used for pcr a two step barcoded amplicon sequencing approach was used as described previously herbold et al 2015 briefly fragments of the bacterial and eukaryotic small subunit rrna gene were amplified resulting in 26 libraries each for ct 1 and ct 2 and 14 libraries for ct 3 v3 and v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene were amplified with the primers bakt 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and bakt 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 herlemann et al 2011 archaea were not targeted by this primer set and were not analysed in this study the eukaryotic 18s rrna gene primer pair euk 1391f 5 gtacacaccgcccgtc 3 and euk 1510r 5 ccttcygcaggttcacctac 3 based on the earth microbiome project version 5 2012 amaral zettler et al 2009 gilbert et al 2014 were used to amplify the 18sv9 region for each primer set and sequencing run negative controls without the addition of dna were performed and sequenced each pcr reaction included 1x dreamtaq green buffer fermentas thermo fisher scientific vienna austria 2 mm mgcl2 0 2 mm dntp mix fermentas 0 1 mg ml 1 bovine serum albumin 1 μm of each of the forward and reverse primers 0 025 u dreamtaq polymerase fermentas and 1 μl of dna template this first pcr amplification 94 c for 3 min 25 cycles of 45 s at 94 c 30 s at 52 c 16s rrna gene or 57 c 18s rrna gene 90 s at 72 c and 72 c for 10 min was performed in triplicates pcr products were pooled and served as the template for the second barcoding pcr 95 c for 3 min 10 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 55 c 60 s at 72 c and 72 c for 7 min purification and quantification of pcr products were done as described herbold et al 2015 the truseq nano dna library prep kit illumina was used for adaptor ligation and pcr without the fragmentation step sequencing was performed by microsynth ag balgach switzerland on a miseq system illumina using the miseq reagent kit v3 resulting sequence datasets were deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive under study accession number prjeb21563 2 3 data compilation filtering clustering and classification paired end reads were demultiplexed and trimmed as described herbold et al 2015 and were assembled using fastq join within qiime caporaso et al 2010 18s rrna reads were forced to be trimmed by at least 88 nucleotides prior to trimming and assembly because the expected amplicon length of 178 bp was shorter than the average read length clustering into operational taxonomic units otus and chimera checking were performed using uparse edgar 2013 using a distance of 0 03 and disallowing singletons to serve as a centroid taxonomic classification of otu centroids was carried out using the bayesian classifier implemented in mothur schloss et al 2009 and the silva ssu database version 132 quast et al 2013 for 16s rrna data sets or the protist ribosomal reference database pr2 version 4 11 1 guillou et al 2013 for 18s rrna data sets otus with a classification confidence score lower than 80 for 16s rrna data sets and 60 for 18s rrna data sets were changed to unclassified the class betaproteobacteria has recently been proposed to be reclassified as the new order betaproteobacteriales within the class gammaproteobacteria parks et al 2018 for clarity and consistency with previous studies the betaproteobacteria were still treated as a separate class but both names are provided 16s rrna otus classified as mitochondria and chloroplasts were omitted from subsequent analysis this did not change the overall estimates of alpha and beta diversity measures 16s rrna otus present only in the negative controls or strongly overrepresented 50 fold in the negative controls compared to all samples were considered to be cross contamination and thus removed from the dataset table s1 all 18s rrna otus only present in the negative control were removed from the dataset otus present in both control and samples were only retained if their sample abundance exceed the control abundance by 1000 fold table s2 taking into account the known relationships between protists and pathogenic bacteria in the water borne environment we restricted our analysis of 18s rrna sequences to the groups amoebozoa lobosa conosa excavata discoba metamonada rhizaria cercozoa foraminifera and alveolata apicomplexa ciliophora dinoflagellata both data sets were rarefied individually to standardize sequence numbers using the rarify even depth function in the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 with replacement option turned off for the 16s rrna data set a minimum of 1713 sequences was used representing the 15 quantile of the data for the 18s rrna data set which had a greater library size variation a cutoff of 59 sequences equivalent to 45 quantile of the data was used samples not fulfilling these criteria were removed from the subsequent analysis 2 4 alpha and beta diversity measures and co occurrence analysis alpha diversity was assessed for both data sets with the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 using the estimators chao1 and the shannon diversity index bacterial community composition was compared by non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis based on bray curtis dissimilarity for the otu co occurrence analysis only those samples for which both 16s and 18s rrna sequence data were available after rarefying were included in addition only otus present in at least 3 samples for each cooling tower and with a total number of sequences greater than 10 were kept to remove the number of infrequent otus for each cooling tower co occurrence analysis of 16s rrna and 18s rrna otus was performed using conet faust and raes 2016 a plug in of the software cytoscape shannon et al 2003 to calculate consensus networks a combination of different correlation and distance measures including pearson and spearman correlation mutual information kullback leibler divergence and bray curtis dissimilarity was used the maximum lag was set to 1 to include slightly shifted associations distribution of all pair wise scores was generated and the 7 5 top scoring edges supported by at least four out of five positive correlations or three out of five negative correlations measures were kept this process was performed with 1000 renormalized permutations resampling by row shuffling and p value merging with brown s method after applying benjamini hochberg s false discovery rate correction edges with a corrected p value below 0 05 were kept the r package ampvis albertsen et al 2015 was used to generate heatmaps metacoder foster et al 2017 was used to generate heat trees 3 results and discussion in this study we monitored the microbial community in the water basins of three heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac cooling towers in the following referred to as ct 1 ct 2 and ct 3 over the course of one year the temperature in the basins ranged between 20 1 c and 32 3 c for ct 1 99 percentile of all temperature data points and between 19 9 c and 29 c for ct 2 throughout the sampling period the average temperature during the summer months was slightly higher than during winter 27 8 c vs 26 4 c for ct 1 and 26 6 c vs 23 1 c for ct 2 temperature data for ct 3 were only available after mid april 2014 its temperature range was 10 6 27 4 c larger than that of the other two towers elevated temperature in the water basin is a characteristic feature of cooling towers and together with the semi open design of these systems provide good conditions for microbial growth cooling tower water tanks like other freshwater or drinking water systems develop biofilms liu et al 2009 yet for the purpose of this study we focused on the analysis of bulk water for two reasons i bulk water represents the seed community for biofilm formation in the basin and ii it is the source of aerosols formed during cooling tower operation nhu nguyen et al 2005 3 1 complex but reduced bacterial diversity compared to open freshwater environments in total we collected 26 samples each for ct 1 and ct 2 and 14 samples for ct 3 amplicon sequencing of 16s and 18s rrna genes revealed taxonomically diverse bacterial and protist communities for all three cooling towers to study seasonal dynamics of microbial diversity in the three cooling towers we first estimated species level richness and evenness using a threshold of 97 sequence similarity for operational taxonomic unit otu definition good s coverage estimator was 0 984 0 007 mean sem for 16s otus and 0 958 0 018 mean sem for 18s otus indicating that sequencing depth was sufficient for reliable community composition analysis after rarefying our data set included 23 ct 1 samples 21 ct 2 samples and 12 ct 3 samples in total 590 bacterial otus and 321 protist otus were considered for our analysis tables s3 and s4 the three cooling towers showed clear differences in bacterial and protist species richness and evenness fig 1 as a general pattern protist diversity was much lower than bacterial diversity for all samples and sampling sites microbial diversity fluctuated strongly throughout the sampling period and there was no clear common trend observed among the different cooling towers it is interesting that while ct 1 had the highest bacterial diversity values as inferred from chao1 and shannon estimators welch s t test p value 0 0001 it also showed the lowest protist diversity and evenness compared to the other two locations which were also more similar with each other fig 1 this was also reflected in the nmds based beta diversity analysis welch corrected t test of the average bray curtis distance within one sampling site compared to other sites p value 0 0001 revealing clear sample clusters according to sampling site and time point fig 2 at all sampling sites we observed gradual community shifts over time reflecting seasonal changes in bacterial and protist diversity in ct 1 the high similarity between autumn winter and spring samples indicated a gradual rather than sudden change in contrast the community shift in ct 2 was more pronounced fig 2 to better understand community structure we next classified all otus grouped them at the genus level and focused on the 20 most abundant genera fig 3 ct 2 and ct 3 are both dominated by a few abundant genera whereas in ct 1 abundances of the top genera are more evenly distributed this analysis showed that the general bacterial community composition is different between the three cooling towers yet flavobacterium bacteroidetes hyphomicrobium members of the rhizobiales and sphingomonadales alphaproteobacteria pseudomonas gammaproteobacteria and methyloversatilis betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales parks et al 2018 are among the top abundant taxa in all three towers fig 3 the most striking difference between the cooling towers is the extremely high pseudomonas abundance in ct 2 fig 3 which makes up almost 31 8 of all sequence reads compared to up to 3 at the other two sampling sites while other gammaproteobacteria were generally not well represented in our data set our observations are consistent with findings from the only cooling tower for which a similar analysis is available so far pereira et al 2017 in this study members of the rhizobiales burkholderiales methylophilales and cytophagales were also among the most abundant taxa in contrast we didn t detect xanthomonadales among the top taxa but found other groups to be well represented including corynebacteriales rhodocyclales and pseudomonadales fig 3 it is noteworthy that betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales commonly found in freshwater systems newton et al 2011 are with two exceptions absent in the ct 1 top genera list whereas they are abundant in ct 2 and ct 3 two members of the recently identified candidate phyla radiation cpr are among the most abundant taxa in ct 1 parcubacteria formerly od1 and saccharimonadia formerly known as tm7 both now classified within the phylum patescibacteria members of both groups show reduced genomes and only limited metabolic capabilities likely endorsing a parasitic or symbiotic lifestyle he et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 they are known to have small cell sizes and are able to pass through a 0 22 μm filter luef et al 2015 ct 1 also included an unclassified member of the rickettsiales alphaproteobacteria among the top abundant taxa again a group of microbes generally associated with an intracellular lifestyle overall the most abundant bacterial orders identified in the cooling tower samples are well in agreement with other reports on man made water distribution systems where orders belonging to alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria are usually the prevalent taxa berry et al 2006 brown et al 2015 farenhorst et al 2017 kalmbach et al 1997 llewellyn et al 2017 martiny et al 2005 mccoy and vanbriesen 2012 pereira et al 2017 revetta et al 2010 tokajian et al 2005 vaz moreira et al 2012 wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 bacterial communities in more natural settings such as lakes rivers or streams are often dominated by betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales but also include actinobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria verrucomicrobia and saccharimonadia boucher et al 2006 crump and hobbie 2005 liu et al 2012 lozupone and knight 2005 mueller spitz et al 2009 newton et al 2011 tang et al 2015 zwart et al 2002 the dominance of these groups in the cooling tower microbial community structure is consistent with what has been reported for other freshwater systems this suggests that community structure in cooling towers may be primarily influenced by the seed community in the incoming drinking water and then shaped by the specific conditions in the cooling tower water basin 3 2 seasonal microbial community dynamics to further analyse temporal changes in community structure we examined the relative abundance of phyla over time consistent with our previous analysis we observed pronounced changes in bacterial community composition over time fig 4 the most dramatic seasonal change occurred in cooling tower ct 2 where an abrupt decline of gammaproteobacteria pseudomonas was observed during june 2014 fig 4 pronounced variations were also observed in the more diverse community of ct 1 in ct 3 the overall bacterial community composition was rather stable compared to the other cooling towers fig 4 protistan community members of the rhizaria the excavata the alveolata and the amoebozoa were found at all three sampling sites with the latter two phyla being most abundant and showing pronounced temporal variations notably changes in bacterial and protist diversity do not necessarily follow the same trend indicating complex interactions and differences in response to environmental conditions figs 3 and 4 next we aimed to understand differences and similarities between bacterial and protist community composition and dynamics in the three cooling towers in more detail to this end we focused on various sets of otus we defined a set of persistent otus as taxa that were detected at a given location at nearly all time points taxa were allowed to be missing from only two samples corresponding to at least 90 of all samples for ct 1 and ct 2 and 80 for ct 3 the second set was referred to as site specific otus and included those taxa that were exclusively found at a single location the third set comprised taxa detected at all cooling towers and was referred to as shared otus consistent with our observed seasonal changes there were few persistent otus 13 in ct 1 10 in ct 2 and 18 in ct 3 fig 5 they included actinobacteria mycobacterium sp or members of the microbacteriaceae proteobacteria sphingopyxis methyloversatilis blastomonas defluviimonas porphyrobacter xanthobacteraceae patescibacteria saccharimonadia formerly tm7 albertsen et al 2013 bacteroidetes or acidobacteria interestingly most of the top five abundant taxa in each of the cooling towers also belonged to the set of persistent otus figs 3 and 5 the differences between the cooling towers were further analysed by focusing on the set of site specific taxa consistent with earlier observations fig 1 ct 1 had by far the largest number of site specific bacterial otus 245 53 1 compared to ct 2 66 14 3 and ct 3 9 1 9 fig 6 a it is noteworthy that there is no overlap between the sets of site specific taxa and the persistent otus for any of the cooling towers in direct comparison the site specific taxa comprised a wider range of diverse phyla including members of the patescibacteria chlamydiae chloroflexi planctomycetes verrucomicrobia and depedentiae tm6 delafont et al 2015 table s3 the transient character of the site specific otus was further illustrated by most of them being detected at a maximum of nine time points this indicated that there was a substantial fraction of taxa specific to individual cooling towers that failed to establish long term colonization 3 3 the core bacterial microbiome of cooling towers consists of biofilm forming taxa to better understand the common features of cooling tower microbial communities we next focused on the set of shared otus i e those detected at least once at more than one site this set represents 30 6 of all bacterial otus in this study and the fraction of shared otus varied between the individual cooling towers 28 6 44 9 and 72 6 respectively the majority of shared otus belongs to the alphaproteobacteria sphingomonadaceae and hyphomicrobiaceae betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteriales burkholderiaceae actinobacteria bacteroidetes bacteroidia and gammaproteobacteria pseudomonadaceae fig 6b and c from this large set of shared otus only six bacterial taxa were nearly always present i e also belong to the set of persistent otus fig 5 this included members of the genera pseudomonas methyloversatilis blastomonas sphingopyxis and porphyrobacter and the family xanthobacteraceae formerly classified as bradyrhizobiaceae a common feature of these microbes is their ability to form or to be associated with microbial biofilms rickard et al 2004 soto giron et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 pseudomonas species are ubiquitous environmental bacteria well known for their capability to form biofilms costerton 1999 jensen et al 2010 sauer et al 2002 they are considered pioneers specifically facilitating the initiation of biofilm formation douterelo et al 2014 members of the genus methyloversatilis are found in various environments including drinking water and biofilms kalyuzhnaya et al 2006 liu et al 2012 shpigel et al 2015 van der kooij et al 2017 williams et al 2004 blastomonas species have the ability to coaggregate with various bacteria an important feature for biofilm formation katharios lanwermeyer et al 2014 rickard et al 2002 additionally other members of the order sphingomonadales such as sphingopyxis porphyrobacter and the family xanthobacteraceae formerly bradyrhizobiaceae were repeatedly found to be associated with bacterial biofilms and are commonly present in drinking water environments bereschenko et al 2010 buse et al 2014 chao et al 2015 douterelo et al 2014 hong et al 2010 muchesa et al 2017 revetta et al 2010 rożej et al 2015 singh et al 2003 vaz moreira et al 2011 the occurrence and persistence of these microbes at all cooling towers suggest that biofilm formation is an important process in cooling tower microbial communities likely contributing to maintenance and resistance against disinfection measures cooling tower basins offer a large surface area and are characterized by a slow water flow speed a rather constant and elevated temperature as well as increased concentrations of organic matter compared to closed drinking water systems these conditions are well suited for biofilm formation türetgen and cotuk 2007 zacheus et al 2000 biofilms are preferred niches of protists because of the high density of microbes serving as a potential food source and grazing is a major factor modulating the structure and function of bacterial biofilms flemming et al 2016 matz et al 2005 parry 2004 biofilms are also a known reservoir and potential source for a number of bacterial pathogens delafont et al 2014 garcia et al 2013 greub and raoult 2004 wingender and flemming 2011 3 4 opportunistic bacterial pathogens over the course of our one year sampling campaign we detected few otus classified as genera comprising known opportunistic bacterial pathogens as defined in a previous study pereira et al 2017 table s5 the abundance of these otus ranges from 0 01 to 28 depending on the sampling location but the majority are below 1 we observed a total of 29 otus belonging to three different phyla actinobacteria firmicutes and proteobacteria this includes bosea helicobacter and stenotrophobacter and several arcobacter bacillus sphingomonas legionella mycobacterium and pseudomonas species table s5 in comparison to the cooling tower studied earlier the cooling towers investigated here display a less diverse set of genera including potential pathogens pereira et al 2017 of note none of the legionella sequences showed a particularly high similarity to the human pathogen legionella pneumophila this is consistent with no l pneumophila outbreak having been reported in the vicinity of our sampling locations during this study the legionella species detected belong to a group commonly referred to as legionella like amoebal pathogens a large number of species primarily found as parasites in free living amoebae greub and raoult 2004 marrie et al 2001 newsome et al 1988 all legionella otus belong to the set of site specific taxa and their relative abundances were below 0 1 rendering them members of the rare biosphere in these systems we found four otus assigned to the genus mycobacterium two of which occurred in two cooling towers one of those m wolinsky showed a relatively high abundance in ct 1 4 and belonged to the persistent taxa in this cooling tower table s3 fig 5 m wolinsky can cause bacteremia and like the other mycobacteria detected in this study is a member of the nontuberculous mycobacteria ntm group this group includes opportunistic human pathogens found in a variety of habitats ranging from soil water and man made systems to aerosols hilborn et al 2006 parker et al 1983 vaerewijck et al 2005 they are well known colonizers of water distribution systems and due to their unique cell wall composition may be involved in surface colonization and biofilm formation six pseudomonas otus were detected p stutzeri was the most abundant otu in ct 2 28 4 and was also found in the other two cooling towers p toyotomiensis 15 7 represented the second most abundant otu in ct 2 and was among the persistent shared otus table s3 fig 5 additional pseudomonas species were seen but at much lower frequencies not considered to be strict pathogens members of this genus are ubiquitous and metabolically versatile in addition to their prominent role in biofilm formation some are known as opportunistic human pathogens and cause various infections in e g the urinary tract soft tissues or the respiratory tract goetz et al 1983 keys et al 1983 potvliege et al 1987 taken together we couldn t find any evidence for the presence of sensu stricto human pathogens in the cooling tower microbial communities analysed in this study not even among the rare biosphere 3 5 a highly dynamic protist community we detected the presence of four groups of protists the rhizaria the excavata the alveolata and the amoebozoa at all three sampling sites although the top taxa in all cooling towers belonged mainly to the alveolata ciliophora and apicomplexa and amoebozoa lobosa we observed pronounced differences in relative abundances between the cooling towers fig 3 table s4 the most abundant protist groups in cooling tower ct 1 were classified into diverse taxa in the ciliophora like ancistrum 9 3 and vorticella 7 1 and lobosa taxa including vanella 8 1 cochliopodium 7 8 and vexillifera species 7 7 in contrast cooling towers ct 2 and ct 3 were dominated by diverse gregarines these apicomplexan parasites are often associated with small invertebrates although the source of the gregarines in our cooling tower water system remains unknown they were likely introduced together with their potential animal hosts still there were also several well known free living amoebae among the most abundant taxa such as vexillifera stenamoeba vannella hartmannella echinamoebida cochliopodium acanthamoeba and allovahlkampfia fig 3 table s4 taken together the protist community detected in the three cooling towers was dominated by taxa frequently found in diverse freshwater habitats and able to persist in an environment characterized by steady water movement the protist community composition was more variable than the bacterial microbiome no persistent protist taxa were observed and the most frequently recurring otus were detected in less than 50 of the samples table s4 these included stenamoeba ancistrum and vexillifera ct 1 and gregarines ct 2 the repeated occurrence of gregarines often associated with small invertebrates suggests that in addition to bacteria protists interactions small invertebrates though not analysed in this study may also affect the structure of cooling tower microbiomes by far the largest proportion of taxa was site specific fig 7 a table s4 this included representatives of the genera stenamoeba vannella echinamoeba and cochliopodium amoebozoa tetrahymena chilodonella and gregarines alveolata neobodo and vahlkampfiidae excavata and paracercomonas rhizaria more than half of these site specific otus do not occur at more than one time point further indicating that the protist community in the water basin is more variable than the bacterial community possible reasons for this may include i varying protist community composition of the source water ii competition between protists or iii random shearing of protists associated with bacterial biofilms there were few otus found at all three cooling towers 6 corresponding to 1 7 of all protist otus these included a member of the sessilida and free living amoebae such as hartmannella stenamoeba vexillifera and a conosa member fig 7b taken together the protist microbiome of cooling tower water is surprisingly diverse with a species richness lower than the bacterial community but in the same order of magnitude at the same time it is highly dynamic and only showed a small core set of persistent and shared taxa 3 6 bacteria protist interactions uncovered by co occurrence networks to gain insights into putative interactions between bacteria and protists in the cooling tower water microbiomes we constructed and analysed co occurrence networks for each cooling tower using all bacterial and protist otus and a comprehensive approach for sequence abundance based network inference faust and raes 2016 in our analysis we only considered relationships between bacteria and protists fig 8 the resulting co occurrence networks were characterized by a high number of nodes 189 otus for ct 1 61 for ct 2 and correlations 207 edges for ct 1 78 for ct 2 due to the low sample number ct 3 was not included in this analysis the networks are composed of mainly positive correlations in which the abundances of bacterial and protist otus followed the same trend protists in the ct 1 network are mainly ciliates alveolata oligohymenophorea followed by naked amoebae amoebozoa discosea most protists were correlated with a number of bacterial taxa with vorticella and an unclassified sessilida showing highest centrality i e number of edges identifying them as key players fig 8 each protist node had its own individual set of bacterial interaction partners some bacterial nodes were shared between different protists but the majority 73 of bacterial nodes were linked to only one protist suggesting a certain degree of specificity of bacteria protist interactions in comparison the ct 2 network had fewer protist nodes with high centrality however we could detect more bacterial taxa who co occurred with more than one protist 40 the most abundant bacterial otus included in both networks were members of the proteobacteria the planctomycetes and the bacteroidetes remarkably 15 6 of all predicted bacteria protist relationships in the ct 1 network and 24 in the ct 2 network were comprised of bacterial genera with members known to associate with protists fig 8 this included several well known bacterial symbionts of free living amoebae or ciliates such as members of the genera protochlamydia collingro et al 2005 fokin 2004 horn 2008 vannini et al 2004 and the family rickettsiaceae horn et al 1999 bacterial symbionts of protists are ubiquitous in ciliates and amoeba and in some cases represent ancient relationships originating millions of years ago görtz 2001 horn 2008 molmeret et al 2005 these bacteria generally show reduced metabolic capabilities and are thus dependent on their protist hosts klein et al 2012 mccutcheon and moran 2012 schmitz esser et al 2010 some act as defensive symbionts or confer resistance to environmental stress dziallas et al 2012 fujishima et al 2005 grosser et al 2018 hori and fujishima 2003 but the relevance for the protist host is often unclear the networks also included several bacterial groups transiently thriving in protists such as members of the genera legionella mycobacterium pseudomonas nordella variovorax bosea acidovorax cupriavidus brevundimonas and flavobacterium corsaro et al 2010 drancourt 2014 evstigneeva et al 2009 fields et al 2002 greub and raoult 2004 la scola et al 2004 michel et al 1995 thomas et al 2008 zeybek and binay 2014 interestingly our co occurrence analysis also predicted members of the groups parcubacteria od1 corsaro et al 2010 and depedentiae tm6 as interaction partner of protists this observation further supports a symbiotic lifestyle for parcubacteria as suggested by meta genomic analysis gong et al 2014 nelson and stegen 2015 and provides additional support for the endosymbiotic lifestyle of depedentiae members delafont et al 2015 our analysis underscores the potential of protists in cooling tower water microbiomes as reservoirs for intracellular bacteria including relatives of opportunistic pathogens greub and raoult 2004 of note the protist associated bacteria in our network generally show interactions with several different protist otus this indicates that in a natural setting bacterial symbionts are more promiscuous and thrive in a wide range of different protists among the taxa included in the networks there are several protists recognized previously as hosts for intracellular bacteria the amoeba vexillifera is a known host of the environmental chlamydia candidatus neptunochlamydia vexilliferae pizzetti et al 2016 hartmannella vermamoeba is the natural host of an intranuclear symbiont candidatus nucleicultrix amoebiphila and the environmental chlamydia rubidus massiliensis bou khalil et al 2016 horn 2008 schulz et al 2014 echinamoeba is a known host for pseudomonas aeruginosa michel et al 1995 in addition allovahlkampfia which have been suggested to act as hosts for pathogenic bacteria mohamed and huseein 2016 were also represented in our networks in this respect we have recently isolated from the water sample of the tower ct 1 the first testate amoeba cochliopodium minus containing a bacterial symbiont tsao et al 2017 taken together our co presence network analysis recovered a large number of known bacteria protist interactions and suggested that such relationships are much more diverse than recognized currently 4 conclusions bacterial and protist communities in cooling towers are broadly similar at the class level to those in natural freshwater and drinking water systems although community structure can be highly dynamic the presence of core taxa suggests that cooling tower basins select for biofilm forming and biofilm associated microbes amplicon sequencing techniques that target ribosomal rna genes is a useful tool to study microbial community dynamics in cooling tower water basins longer term longitudinal studies including outbreak situations are required to better understand the role of the microbial community for propagation and spread of opportunistic bacterial pathogens that have been associated with disease outbreaks the implementation of upcoming real time sequencing technologies might facilitate online monitoring of cooling tower communities to predict biofilm formation and colonization with opportunistic pathogens co occurrence network analysis is a helpful approach to predict bacteria protists interactions using amplicon sequencing data the high number of nodes and degree of connectedness in the networks obtained here highlights the importance of inter kingdom relationships in cooling tower water systems a design of cooling tower water basins and other measures that prevent biofilm formation should help to decrease the public health risk of

18797,to understand the effects of large scale sediment compaction on iodine enrichment in the groundwater system of the north china plain ncp hydrogeochemical and isotope 2h 18o and 87sr 86sr geochemical features of groundwater seawater and pore water of the deep aquifer sediments were characterized groundwater iodine concentration ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l and approximately 80 of groundwater samples have iodine concentration more than 100 μg l high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is mainly distributed in the bohai bay area where serious land subsidence occurs the sediments deposited during several events of marine transgression are considered as the main source of groundwater iodine the pore solution compacted from the clayey sediments has a iodine concentration up to 830 μg l indicating that marine source iodine was stored in the clayey layers the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures of groundwater show that the groundwater from ncp is mainly recharged by precipitation and the pore water from sediment compaction due to intense land subsidence the cl br molar ratio and 87sr 86sr signatures of groundwater and sediment pore water further suggest the effects of mixing with compaction released pore solution on the hydrochemical evolution of high iodine groundwater based on groundwater δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr the results of two end members mixing model calculation indicate that the compaction released pore solution contributes approximately 49 1 68 9 iodine to high iodine groundwater and the iodine from compaction released pore solution ranges between 407 and 572 μg l the results of this study therefore suggest that the compaction of clayey sediments can be a major hydrogeological process controlling the genesis of high iodine groundwater in deep aquifers at ncp keywords groundwater iodine environmental sediment compaction north china plain 1 introduction iodine an essential element for thyroid hormone synthesis plays an important role on energy metabolism thermoregulation and physical and mental development yu 1987 like all life essential elements and nutrients insufficient or excessive ingestion of iodine can result in iodine deficiency disorders idd and iodine excess disorders ied respectively may 2011 andersen et al 2009 in recent years while idd and its prevention remain as a focus for studies ren et al 2008 zimmermann 2009 andersson et al 2007 more attention has been paid to ieds carvalho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 katagirl et al 2017 according to the results of worldwide survey of median urinary iodine eleven countries are faced with the problem of excessive iodine intake andersson et al 2012 in china endemic goiter caused by excessive iodine intake from drinking water has been recognized as a serious public health problem guo et al 2015 and the maximum concentration limit mcl for iodine is 100 μg l in national standard for drinking water gb t 19380 2016 in areas with ieds problems among residents such as the north china plain ncp zhang et al 2013 the datong basin li et al 2013 and the taiyuan basin tang et al 2013 groundwater with iodine concentration higher than 100 μg l has been used as the dominant source for water supply therefore understanding the sources and enrichment mechanisms of iodine in aquifers is critical both for effective control of ieds disease and for sustainable management of water resources intensive human activities are associated with increasing water demand consequently groundwater over extraction has been reported in many countries such as usa japan mexico italy thailand and china hu et al 2004 phien wej et al 2006 guo et al 2015 kagabu et al 2013 erban et al 2013 smith et al 2018 groundwater as the main source of irrigation and drinking water has been over exploited at ncp in the past several decades which has caused several geo environmental problems such as groundwater level decline aquitards compaction and land subsidence zheng et al 2010 guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 it further affects the regional aquifer recharge and solutes transport for instance there is a notable contribution of inter aquifer leakage from the quaternary compressible clay compaction to groundwater especially in the coastal areas cao et al 2013 shi et al 2006 in ncp the occurrence of ieds yu 1987 and elevated iodine concentration up to more than 1000 μg l in deep groundwater have been reported zhang et al 2013 li et al 2017 the previous studies mainly focused on the geochemical processes affecting iodine mobilization from the aquifer matrix into groundwater for example our previous studies at ncp revealed that iodine mobilization in groundwater system is related to the hydrogeochemical conditions li et al 2017 xue et al 2018 and hydrogeochemical processes such as the breakdown of iodine containing organic matter and reductive dissolution of iodine loaded metal oxy hydroxides are responsible for iodine release from iodine rich aquifer sediment into groundwater fuge and johnson 2015 li et al 2014a korobava et al 2016 tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however little work has been done to study the impact of anthropogenic processes on iodine enrichment in groundwater recent studies have shown that over pumping of groundwater can lead to the release of naturally occurring contaminants within compressible clayey layers into aquifers erban et al 2013 smith et al 2018 during the quaternary period as a result of global climatic changes the fluctuation of sea level triggered several events of marine transgression and regression in coastal areas of ncp lin and dai 2012 gao and collins 2014 yao et al 2017 which caused retention of elements of marine sources in the sediments zhang et al 1997 it has been well known that ocean constitutes the major reservoir of global iodine cycle and there is a large amount of organic matter rich iodine in the ocean fuge and johnson 2015 besides the thermodynamically stable state of inorganic iodine in seawater is iodate which has a greater adsorption capability than iodide nagata and fukushi 2010 and thus favors the retention of iodine during the deposition of marine sediments several studies have documented that groundwater cl and br concentrations and cl br ratio can be successfully used to trace groundwater solute transport identify recharge sources and quantitatively evaluate groundwater systems cartwright et al 2006 xie et al 2013 liu et al 2016a b groundwater samples with cl br molar ratios exceeding or equal to about 650 are considered to be of marine origin or marine formation water davis et al 1998 similarly stable isotopes 2h 18o and radiogenic isotope 87sr 86sr are also powerful tools for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in groundwater systems liu et al 2016a b isotopes of water molecule 2h 18o could trace the recharge conditions over time rainwater infiltration and mixing of different waters peng et al 2012 negrel et al 2017 strontium isotope has been widely used to study the origin and evolution of solutes in groundwater sánchez et al 2010 skrzypek et al 2013 therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to identify the impact of compaction of compressible clayey layers on iodine enrichment in groundwater at ncp and 2 to quantify the contribution of sediment compaction released pore water to iodine enrichment in aquifers the results help better understand the fate of iodine in the complex aquifers systems in coastal areas like ncp 2 study area ncp is located in eastern china between 34 46 40 25 n and 112 30 119 30 e and bordered by the taihang mountains to the west and the bohai bay to the east by the yanshan mountains to the north and the yellow river to the south ncp has a middle latitude continental semiarid monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 12 13 c mean annual precipitation of 500 600 mm and evaporation of 1100 1800 mm liu et al 1997 chen 1999 the plain is drained by the haihe river the luanhe river and their tributaries from the taihang mountain on the west to the bohai sea on the east there are three hydrogeological units at ncp the piedmont alluvial plain central alluvial lacustrine plain and littoral plain xing et al 2013 the quaternary sediments consist of up to 600 m of sands with locally dispersed pebble beds and laminated fine silt and clay chen 1999 yao et al 2012 the quaternary strata comprise alluvial proluvial sediments in the piedmont alluvial lacustrine and marine sediments in the central plain and littoral plain respectively fig 1 in the littoral plain three events of marine transgression have been recognized during the pleistocene including bohai transgression sediment depth 270 290 m haixing transgression sediment depth 185 215 m and huanghua transgression sediment depth 130 167 m lin and dai 2012 the quaternary aquifers mainly consist of four aquifers aquifer 1 to aquifer 4 abbreviated as a1 a2 a3 and a4 downward the holocene aquifer a1 with the depth of 10 50 m the late pleistocene aquifer a2 with the depth of 110 170 m the middle pleistocene a3 with the depth of 250 310 m and the early pleistocene aquifers a4 with the depth of more than 350 m respectively chen et al 2005 liu et al 2016a b the aquifers are composed of sandy gravel and medium fine grained sand with interlayers of silt and clay including the layers of marine transgression the hydrogeological cross section a a from baoding area to bohai bay of ncp is shown in fig 2 the unconfined aquifer a1 and shallow confined aquifer a2 contain fresh groundwater tds 0 3 0 7 g l in the piedmont and saline water 2 g l in the central and littoral plain groundwater from a3 has tds concentrations of 0 3 0 5 g l while that from a4 is 0 5 1 5 g l and 1 5 2 0 g l in the central and littoral plains respectively the shallow groundwater is recharged by precipitation irrigation return flow infiltration of surface water flow in rivers and canals and lateral inflow from the taihang mountains zhang et al 1997 while the deep groundwater is recharged by infiltration of precipitation from the bedrock outcropping areas compaction released pore water and inter aquifer leakage in the eastern part of the basin due to excessive groundwater abstraction for agriculture industry and drinking water purposes groundwater depletion and regional land subsidence widely occurs in ncp guo et al 2015 pumping of groundwater from deep aquifers in the central littoral plain had resulted in depletion of groundwater reserves with a decline of the potentiometric surface of about 100 m the annual land subsidence volume of ncp due to compaction of compressible clay was 10 73 108 m3 while the annual deep groundwater yield was about 24 5 108 26 75 108 m3 between 1970 and 2010 zhu et al 2014 the ratio of subsidence volume to deep groundwater yield was about 40 1 43 8 in the cangzhou district the cumulative land subsidence increased from 9 mm in 1970 2600 mm in 2015 xing 2017 the annual land subsidence volume was 1 98 108 m3 and the annual deep groundwater extraction was 3 44 108 m3 between 1970 and 2008 the amount of compaction released water was estimated to account for 57 6 of the recharge for the deep confined groundwater zhu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 sampling a total of 38 groundwater samples from ncp and 1 bohai seawater sample were collected from ncp in august 2015 fig 1 the groundwater samples were collected from the confined aquifers a3 and a4 at depths ranging from 150 to 600 m which have been used as the main source of drinking water supply in the rural areas to avoid salinity contamination from shallow aquifers the holocene aquifer a1 and late pleistocene aquifer a2 were sealed and therefore the groundwater samples collected in this study were a mixture of groundwater from middle pleistocene and that from early pleistocene aquifers a3 and a4 the wells were purged at least 10 min using a high discharge pump prior to water sampling chemical and physical parameters including ph redox potential orp and temperature t were measured on site using hach portable meters after stabilization samples were collected in iodine free hdpe containers using a low flow pump and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the samples for cation and strontium isotope analysis were acidified using ultra purified hno3 to ph 2 and samples for anion analysis were collected directly after being filtered samples for oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis were collected in 50 ml hdpe bottles without head space ten clayey and silty core samples length 15 cm diameter 8 cm at the depth of 188 397 m were collected from two boreholes labeled as cz and hh which are located in the coastal area with the hh borehole closer to the sea fig 1 to minimize the soil disturbance and oxidation the core samples were stored in vacuum package at 4 c prior to testing the pore water compacted from the core samples were collected using a squeezing method with a maximum pressure of 6 mpa fernández et al 2014 prior to squeezing peripheral sediments within 1 cm from the edge were removed to minimize the effect of evaporation kwong et al 2015 the cylinder chamber made up of stainless steel was used to support the placement of core sample 1000 g and had a water outlet at the bottom the joints between the top bottom endplate and cylinder chamber were sealed with o rings a continuous gas pressure was applied to push a piston and pass the pressure to the sediment sample then the sediment was compressed under the pressure and pore water in the sediment would be constantly squeezed out and collected in the clean hdpe bottle the compaction released pore water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for the analysis of the concentration of anions chloride bromide sulfate iodide and iodate and the isotopic compositions of oxygen hydrogen and strontium 3 2 chemical analysis alkalinity measurement was performed using a titration method within 24 h after sampling anion concentrations including f cl and so4 were analyzed using ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact cations and trace element analysis were determined using icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp and icp ms aglient 7900 respectively the iodine speciation and total iodine concentration were determined by ic icp ms and icp ms and the detailed method was described by yang et al 2007 the organic iodine concentration is obtained by subtracting the concentration of iodate and iodide from the total iodine concentration a 5 of agreement was fulfilled in laboratory chemical analysis charge balance errors for all groundwater samples were below 9 qa qc stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were measured using finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer oxygen isotopes were determined via equilibration with h2o co2 at 25 c for 24 h and analyzed by continuous flow mass spectrometry using a thermo finnigan gas bench hydrogen isotopes were measured by reaction with cr at 850 c using an automated finnigan mat h device δ18o and δ2h values were determined relative to internal standards calibrated using v smow and isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h were expressed in standard δ notation representing per mille deviations from the v smow standard precision for δ18o and δ2h were 0 1 and 1 0 samples for 87sr 86sr analyses were treated by sr specific resin

asx 110 automatic sampler and a dsn 100 desolvating nebulizer systemtion mass spectrometer the reproducibility of 87sr 86sr measurement was tested by duplicate analysis of the nist srm 987 standard all of the analysis work was done at state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry groundwater iodine concentration ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l with a median value of 270 μg l with approximately 79 samples higher than 100 μg l the chinese mcl value for iodine in drinking water table 1 as shown in fig 1 high iodine 100 μg l groundwater is mainly distributed close to bohai bay area where evident land subsidence occurs the iodine concentration in compaction released pore solution samples ranged from 18 1 to 830 μg l half of them being more than 100 μg l the highest iodine concentration of compaction released pore solution occurred at the depth of 281 m in the hh borehole iodide is the predominant species of iodine which ranged from 1 2 to 854 μg l in groundwater and from 11 6 to 809 μg l in compaction released pore solution table 2 fig 3 iodate was not detected in most samples and organic iodine was detected in high iodine groundwater and in compaction released pore solution tables 1 and 2 the ph and orp values of groundwater samples ranged from 7 49 to 8 79 median value 8 06 and from 229 to 140 mv median value 18 8 mv respectively a narrow range of ph from 7 61 to 8 43 and low orp from 229 to 118 mv were observed in high iodine groundwater samples the tds of all groundwater samples varied from 370 to 2360 mg l with a median value of 1250 mg l and an increasing trend from the piedmont and central areas 376 664 mg l with a median value of 563 mg l to the coastal areas 494 2360 mg l 1370 mg l fig 4 c from the taihang mountain to the bohai sea the hydrochemical type of the groundwater changed from ca hco3 to na hco3 and the dominant type was na hco3 cl in the coastal areas fig 5 elevated cl concentration up to 14300 mg l was detected in compaction released pore solution from cz and hh borehole table 2 the br concentration of groundwater ranged from 25 to 2015 μg l with a median of 604 μg l similar to cl elevated br concentration was also observed in compaction released pore solution up to 29200 μg l close to that of seawater 33000 μg l as shown in fig s2 the cl br molar ratio in groundwater samples from the coastal areas fell into a variable range compared to that from the piedmont and the central areas fig 4d in the piedmont and central areas of ncp cl br molar ratios in groundwater ranged from 786 to 1120 with a relatively standard deviation of 119 while in the coastal area the range was 147 2547 with a relatively standard deviation of 535 similarly the cl br molar ratio 714 2159 of the compaction released pore solution also scattered with a standard deviation of 434 4 2 h o and sr isotopes groundwater δ18o and δ2h values varied from 10 3 to 8 9 and from 81 to 69 respectively the coastal groundwater samples had relatively higher values of δ18o ranging from 10 0 to 8 9 and δ2h ranging from 76 to 69 than those in the piedmont and central areas ranging from 10 3 to 9 6 and from 81 to 73 respectively the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of compaction released pore solution samples varied between 7 8 and 5 4 and between 65 and 52 respectively the bohai seawater sample had a δ18o value of 0 6 and δ2h value of 12 groundwater 87sr 86sr ratios ranged between 0 70985 and 0 71532 with a median value of 0 71232 which increased from the piedmont to the central areas and then decreased in the coastal areas fig 4f the 87sr 86sr ratios of two compaction released pore solutions 0 71321 for cz 03 and 0 71297 for cz 05 in the cz borehole are higher than those 0 71199 for hh 01 and 0 71245 for hh 03 in the hh borehole which is closer to the sea table 2 5 discussion 5 1 major clues about the marine origin of iodine according to the results of regional geological and hydrogeological studies there were several events of marine transgression in the quaternary period at ncp zhang et al 1997 wang et al 2008 lin and dai 2012 liu et al 2016a b it is worthy to note that the sediment sample depth 281 m with highest iodine concentration in its compaction released pore solution sample was collected from the reported horizon at the depth of 270 290 m of the bohai marine transgression lin and dai 2012 and the compaction released pore solution and groundwater samples with elevated iodine concentration were distributed near the bohai sea according to davis et al 1998 groundwater samples with cl br molar ratios higher than or equal to 650 indicate marine origin the values of cl br molar ratio for the compaction released pore solution clearly reflect their marine source for cl and br especially for those with elevated iodine concentration table 2 these observations all reflect the marine source of iodine in the high iodine aquifer systems iodine in compaction released pore solution exists as iodide which is a highly mobile species nagata and fukushi 2010 aimoz et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 to better understand the origin of iodine i cl iodide chloride and i br iodide bromide weight ratios can be used as iodine enrichment factor fig s1 and s2 the compaction released pore solution had significantly higher i cl 3 1020 and i br 1 492 ratios than those of seawater 2 for i cl and 1 for i br which may provide additional clues about iodine enrichment mechanism since iodate occurs widely in seawater and has a strong adsorption capability fuge and johnson 2015 nagata and fukushi 2010 marine iodate can be loaded onto sediments during the process of marine transgression and regression a recent study conducted by fuge and johnson 2015 indicates that as a result of the dominant oceanic source iodine is strongly enriched in near coastal soils during the long term burial process the species of iodine can be changed from iodate to iodide under the reducing conditions in the deep confined aquifers and iodide may be then desorbed and transported from the solid to the aqueous phase causing elevated concentration and proportion of iodide in the pore solution fig 3 similarly due to its high mobility and geochemically conservative nature chloride and bromide can hardly be retained in the solid phase during the burial process thus elevated i cl and i br ratios both in compaction released pore solution and in groundwater reflect the marine source and enrichment of iodine in the aqueous phase of the deep aquifer systems at ncp and as shown in the hydrogeological cross section profile modified by us marine iodine was mostly stored in the clayey layers overlying a3 and a4 fig 2 5 2 compaction of compressible clayey layers 5 2 1 identification of the mixing with compacted pore solution groundwater depletion at ncp due to over exploitation is the most serious worldwide alley et al 2002 zheng et al 2010 and has adverse consequences such as land subsidence accompanied with compaction of compressible clayey layers li et al 2014b wang et al 2018 it is likely to degrade groundwater quality in deep aquifers since the major areas of high iodine groundwater s occurrence overlap with those of significant land subsidence fig 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions can be used to trace the sources and mixing processes of groundwater faure 1986 as shown in fig 6 the δ18o and δ2h values of all groundwater samples are scattered close to the lmwl δ2h 7δ18o 1 7 zhang et al 2000 and slightly shift to its right suggesting that the groundwater is mainly recharged by local meteoric water it was proposed that the depletion in δ18o and δ2h isotopes in deep groundwater could be related to the recharge from precipitation in palaeo climate conditions at the end of the pleistocene and the deep groundwater is hardly affected by evaporation kreuzer et al 2009 both chen et al 2003 and kreuzer et al 2009 suggested that the δ18o and δ2h values of pleistocene groundwater from ncp presumably recharged during last glacial periods respectively range from 11 7 to 9 4 and from 85 to 76 as compared with the results of high iodine groundwater samples the values of pleistocene groundwater are commonly more negative indicating that there should be other recharge sources for the high iodine groundwater in order to reveal the difference the δ18o and δ2h values of low and high iodine groundwater were defined by two regression lines fig 6 δ2h 7 1 δ18o 3 1 low iodine groundwater liwl δ2h 3 6 δ18o 38 high iodine groundwater hiwl the liwl regression line is nearly parallel to the lmwl while the lower slope value of regression line for the high iodine groundwater 3 6 suggests that high iodine groundwater may be the result of mixing with other sources of water considering the groundwater from coastal plain and the serious land subsidence area there are two potential sources modern seawater intrusion and compaction released pore water due to compaction of clayey layers the annual rate of seawater intrusion was estimated to be 0 86 107 m3 yr based on the results of density dependent flow and transport modeling yi et al 2016 however it should be emphasized that the δ18o and δ2h isotopes of high iodine groundwater samples were considerably depleted as compared to those of seawater indicating that modern seawater intrusion has limited impact on the groundwater in particular the samples of between groundwater and compaction released pore solution fall on the mixing line which can be defined by the equation of δ2h 3 4 δ18o 36 the similar slope between this mixing line 3 4 and hiwl 3 6 also suggests the effect of mixing with compaction released pore solution on high iodine groundwater because of the conservative behavior and high solubility of chloride and bromide in natural water water sediment interaction has little effects in modification of cl and br concentration cartwright et al 2006 davis et al 1998 thus cl br ratios can be used as an indicator of the origin and evolution of groundwater solutes as shown in the plot of cl br vs cl fig 7 high iodine groundwater is likely to be mixed with compaction released pore solution similarly li et al 2012 suggested that water with high cl concentration in the cangzhou district may be recharged by pore water released from compacted clays induced by over exploitation of deep groundwater the wide range of cl br ratios in our groundwater and compaction released pore water samples may be related to dissolution of evaporate minerals as reported by previous studies xing et al 2013 cartwright et al 2006 besides kwong et al 2015 suggested that pore water from core samples in the cangzhou district may have experienced evaporate dissolution this can be clearly seen from the hydrochemical features of our high iodine groundwater samples high cl concentration high so4 concentration and high cl br molar ratios table 1 fig 4b c and d which are similar to those of compaction released pore water table 2 therefore the hydrochemical features indicate that high iodine groundwater may have experienced the mixing with compaction released pore solution the 87sr 86sr ratio is not affected by fractionation processes and its values depend on source waters or rocks faure and mensing 2005 therefore strontium isotopes have been widely used to identify source waters in hydrogeological studies wang et al 2006 cartwright et al 2007 xie et al 2013 dogramaci and skrzypek 2015 a general increase trend of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio along the flowpath in the piedmont and central area may be interpreted as the result of water sediment interactions while the decrease trend in the coastal areas may indicate the effect of mixing with strontium isotope of marine origin the 87sr 86sr ratios of compaction released pore solution from hh borehole closer to the sea ranged from 0 71100 to 0 71245 which were lower than those 0 71297 0 71321 from cz borehole farther away from the sea which is consistent with the general pattern of horizontal 87sr 86sr ratios variation of coastal groundwater fig 4f thus the variation of strontium isotope composition further indicates the contribution of compaction of compressible clayey layers of marine origin to the chemistry of high iodine groundwater 5 2 2 contributions of sediment compaction released pore water a recent study using times series data of 14c activity at ncp shows an increase of groundwater age with exploitation of the confined parts of aquifers system from 1985 to 2013 su et al 2018 indicating that a large fraction of old water has been exploited over time the results of groundwater flow modeling by cao et al 2013 indicate that the irrecoverable groundwater depletion due to aquitard compaction is about 40 0 km3 in deep aquifers in other words large amounts of water have been squeezed out from the storage of compressible clayey layers as mentioned above in the areas cangzhou city with high iodine groundwater the estimated contribution of subsidence volume to total deep groundwater yield was up to 57 6 based on gis spatial analysis method and statistical record of deep groundwater yield zhu et al 2014 indicating that the pore water resulted from the over exploitation of deep groundwater and regional land subsidence becomes an main source of recharge for regional deep aquifers guo et al 2015 over the past few decades groundwater exploitation has been concentrated in the deep aquifers a3 and a4 and the subsidence layer is mainly the compressible clayey layers between the a2 and a3 aquifers as well as in the a3 and a4 aquifers therefore the compaction released pore solution from these layers should play an important role in modification of the chemistry of deep groundwater at ncp in order to quantify the mixing proportion of compaction released pore solution in high iodine groundwater two end member mixing models were used one end member is the recharge water near the taihang mountain and the other one is the compaction released pore solution from cz borehole the average of five samples to calculate the mixing ratio of four groundwater samples around cz borehole then it can be quantified using the following equations a f r s c g b r c 1 where f s and g are the values of δ2h δ18o cl concentration sr 87sr 86sr banner et al 1989 in fresh groundwater compaction released pore solution and groundwater around cz borehole respectively and r and c represent the ratio of fresh groundwater and compaction released pore solution respectively accordingly the ratios of compaction released pore solution mixing in high iodine groundwater range from 41 0 to 54 3 with an average of 49 1 based on δ2h from 23 7 to 28 9 with an average of 26 3 based on δ18o from 57 1 to 70 1 with an average of 61 7 based on cl concentration and from 55 1 to 79 2 with an average of 68 9 based on 87sr 86sr the relatively low ratios based on δ18o may be related to water sediment interactions devriendt et al 2017 kwong et al 2015 it is interesting to see that the ratios based on δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr are similar to the proportion of subsidence volume of total deep groundwater yield 57 6 as a result of compaction of compressible clayey layers marine source iodine in compaction released pore solution from the sediments deposited during marine transgression periods is mobilized into adjacent aquifers relatively stable δ2h isotope signals with dramatic increase of cl concentration in high iodine groundwater clearly reflect the contribution of compaction of compressible clayey layers to iodine enrichment in groundwater fig 8 if we take one compaction released pore solution sample that has the highest concentration 830 μg l from borehole hh as the reference sample of marine source of iodine it can be seen from fig 8 that there is a sharp increase in δ2h values with substantial variation of cl concentrations and all the groundwater samples have elevated iodine concentrations indicating that compaction of compressible clayey layers deposited during marine transgression periods is the main factor controlling the genesis of high iodine groundwater assuming that the iodine concentration of 830 μg l represents that of the water released from the compaction of compressible clayey layers its contribution to iodine enrichment in groundwater can be calculated using the same approach mentioned above as shown in table 3 the proportion is 407 μg l for δ2h 512 μg l for cl 572 μg l for 87sr 86sr and 478 μg l for the evaluation proportion proposed by zhu et al 2014 all close to the average value 441 μg l of our high iodine groundwater samples reflecting again the importance of compaction of compressible clayey layers for the genesis of high iodine groundwater in deep aquifers at ncp 6 conclusions groundwater iodine concentration at ncp ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l and high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is distributed mainly in the southern coastal areas where serious land subsidence occurs the events of marine transgression provide the provenance of iodine in deep groundwater system at ncp the present study verifies the role that pore water compacted from deep sediments plays in the genesis of high iodine concentration in the deep aquifers our results show that high iodine groundwater is a mixture of fresh recharge water and pore water compacted from deep sediments accordingly the mixing ratios of compaction released pore solution in high iodine groundwater range from 41 0 to 54 3 with an average of 49 1 based on δ2h from 57 1 to 70 1 with an average of 61 7 based on cl concentration and from 55 1 to 79 2 with an average of 68 9 based on 87sr 86sr the ratios based on δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr are similar to the proportion of subsidence volume of total deep groundwater yield 57 6 the deposition of iodine rich sediment during marine transgression in the quaternary period may be responsible for the iodine enrichment of compaction released pore solution and the compaction of compressible clayey layers deposited during marine transgression events is the main factor controlling the genesis of the high iodine groundwater calculation results show that the contribution of iodine from compaction released pore solution is 407 μg l for δ2h 512 μg l for cl and 572 μg l for 87sr 86sr which is comparable with its average concentration 441 μg l of high iodine groundwater the findings of this study have highlighted the importance of controlling land subsidence for the protection of groundwater quality improving the monitoring and governance of groundwater is therefore urgently needed to ensure safe and sustainable

18797,to understand the effects of large scale sediment compaction on iodine enrichment in the groundwater system of the north china plain ncp hydrogeochemical and isotope 2h 18o and 87sr 86sr geochemical features of groundwater seawater and pore water of the deep aquifer sediments were characterized groundwater iodine concentration ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l and approximately 80 of groundwater samples have iodine concentration more than 100 μg l high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is mainly distributed in the bohai bay area where serious land subsidence occurs the sediments deposited during several events of marine transgression are considered as the main source of groundwater iodine the pore solution compacted from the clayey sediments has a iodine concentration up to 830 μg l indicating that marine source iodine was stored in the clayey layers the hydrogen and oxygen isotope signatures of groundwater show that the groundwater from ncp is mainly recharged by precipitation and the pore water from sediment compaction due to intense land subsidence the cl br molar ratio and 87sr 86sr signatures of groundwater and sediment pore water further suggest the effects of mixing with compaction released pore solution on the hydrochemical evolution of high iodine groundwater based on groundwater δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr the results of two end members mixing model calculation indicate that the compaction released pore solution contributes approximately 49 1 68 9 iodine to high iodine groundwater and the iodine from compaction released pore solution ranges between 407 and 572 μg l the results of this study therefore suggest that the compaction of clayey sediments can be a major hydrogeological process controlling the genesis of high iodine groundwater in deep aquifers at ncp keywords groundwater iodine environmental sediment compaction north china plain 1 introduction iodine an essential element for thyroid hormone synthesis plays an important role on energy metabolism thermoregulation and physical and mental development yu 1987 like all life essential elements and nutrients insufficient or excessive ingestion of iodine can result in iodine deficiency disorders idd and iodine excess disorders ied respectively may 2011 andersen et al 2009 in recent years while idd and its prevention remain as a focus for studies ren et al 2008 zimmermann 2009 andersson et al 2007 more attention has been paid to ieds carvalho et al 2012 kwon et al 2017 katagirl et al 2017 according to the results of worldwide survey of median urinary iodine eleven countries are faced with the problem of excessive iodine intake andersson et al 2012 in china endemic goiter caused by excessive iodine intake from drinking water has been recognized as a serious public health problem guo et al 2015 and the maximum concentration limit mcl for iodine is 100 μg l in national standard for drinking water gb t 19380 2016 in areas with ieds problems among residents such as the north china plain ncp zhang et al 2013 the datong basin li et al 2013 and the taiyuan basin tang et al 2013 groundwater with iodine concentration higher than 100 μg l has been used as the dominant source for water supply therefore understanding the sources and enrichment mechanisms of iodine in aquifers is critical both for effective control of ieds disease and for sustainable management of water resources intensive human activities are associated with increasing water demand consequently groundwater over extraction has been reported in many countries such as usa japan mexico italy thailand and china hu et al 2004 phien wej et al 2006 guo et al 2015 kagabu et al 2013 erban et al 2013 smith et al 2018 groundwater as the main source of irrigation and drinking water has been over exploited at ncp in the past several decades which has caused several geo environmental problems such as groundwater level decline aquitards compaction and land subsidence zheng et al 2010 guo et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 it further affects the regional aquifer recharge and solutes transport for instance there is a notable contribution of inter aquifer leakage from the quaternary compressible clay compaction to groundwater especially in the coastal areas cao et al 2013 shi et al 2006 in ncp the occurrence of ieds yu 1987 and elevated iodine concentration up to more than 1000 μg l in deep groundwater have been reported zhang et al 2013 li et al 2017 the previous studies mainly focused on the geochemical processes affecting iodine mobilization from the aquifer matrix into groundwater for example our previous studies at ncp revealed that iodine mobilization in groundwater system is related to the hydrogeochemical conditions li et al 2017 xue et al 2018 and hydrogeochemical processes such as the breakdown of iodine containing organic matter and reductive dissolution of iodine loaded metal oxy hydroxides are responsible for iodine release from iodine rich aquifer sediment into groundwater fuge and johnson 2015 li et al 2014a korobava et al 2016 tang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 however little work has been done to study the impact of anthropogenic processes on iodine enrichment in groundwater recent studies have shown that over pumping of groundwater can lead to the release of naturally occurring contaminants within compressible clayey layers into aquifers erban et al 2013 smith et al 2018 during the quaternary period as a result of global climatic changes the fluctuation of sea level triggered several events of marine transgression and regression in coastal areas of ncp lin and dai 2012 gao and collins 2014 yao et al 2017 which caused retention of elements of marine sources in the sediments zhang et al 1997 it has been well known that ocean constitutes the major reservoir of global iodine cycle and there is a large amount of organic matter rich iodine in the ocean fuge and johnson 2015 besides the thermodynamically stable state of inorganic iodine in seawater is iodate which has a greater adsorption capability than iodide nagata and fukushi 2010 and thus favors the retention of iodine during the deposition of marine sediments several studies have documented that groundwater cl and br concentrations and cl br ratio can be successfully used to trace groundwater solute transport identify recharge sources and quantitatively evaluate groundwater systems cartwright et al 2006 xie et al 2013 liu et al 2016a b groundwater samples with cl br molar ratios exceeding or equal to about 650 are considered to be of marine origin or marine formation water davis et al 1998 similarly stable isotopes 2h 18o and radiogenic isotope 87sr 86sr are also powerful tools for understanding the hydrogeochemical processes in groundwater systems liu et al 2016a b isotopes of water molecule 2h 18o could trace the recharge conditions over time rainwater infiltration and mixing of different waters peng et al 2012 negrel et al 2017 strontium isotope has been widely used to study the origin and evolution of solutes in groundwater sánchez et al 2010 skrzypek et al 2013 therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to identify the impact of compaction of compressible clayey layers on iodine enrichment in groundwater at ncp and 2 to quantify the contribution of sediment compaction released pore water to iodine enrichment in aquifers the results help better understand the fate of iodine in the complex aquifers systems in coastal areas like ncp 2 study area ncp is located in eastern china between 34 46 40 25 n and 112 30 119 30 e and bordered by the taihang mountains to the west and the bohai bay to the east by the yanshan mountains to the north and the yellow river to the south ncp has a middle latitude continental semiarid monsoon climate with mean annual temperature of 12 13 c mean annual precipitation of 500 600 mm and evaporation of 1100 1800 mm liu et al 1997 chen 1999 the plain is drained by the haihe

depth of more than 350 m respectively chen et al 2005 liu et al 2016a b the aquifers are composed of sandy gravel and medium fine grained sand with interlayers of silt and clay including the layers of marine transgression the hydrogeological cross section a a from baoding area to bohai bay of ncp is shown in fig 2 the unconfined aquifer a1 and shallow confined aquifer a2 contain fresh groundwater tds 0 3 0 7 g l in the piedmont and saline water 2 g l in the central and littoral plain groundwater from a3 has tds concentrations of 0 3 0 5 g l while that from a4 is 0 5 1 5 g l and 1 5 2 0 g l in the central and littoral plains respectively the shallow groundwater is recharged by precipitation irrigation return flow infiltration of surface water flow in rivers and canals and lateral inflow from the taihang mountains zhang et al 1997 while the deep groundwater is recharged by infiltration of precipitation from the bedrock outcropping areas compaction released pore water and inter aquifer leakage in the eastern part of the basin due to excessive groundwater abstraction for agriculture industry and drinking water purposes groundwater depletion and regional land subsidence widely occurs in ncp guo et al 2015 pumping of groundwater from deep aquifers in the central littoral plain had resulted in depletion of groundwater reserves with a decline of the potentiometric surface of about 100 m the annual land subsidence volume of ncp due to compaction of compressible clay was 10 73 108 m3 while the annual deep groundwater yield was about 24 5 108 26 75 108 m3 between 1970 and 2010 zhu et al 2014 the ratio of subsidence volume to deep groundwater yield was about 40 1 43 8 in the cangzhou district the cumulative land subsidence increased from 9 mm in 1970 2600 mm in 2015 xing 2017 the annual land subsidence volume was 1 98 108 m3 and the annual deep groundwater extraction was 3 44 108 m3 between 1970 and 2008 the amount of compaction released water was estimated to account for 57 6 of the recharge for the deep confined groundwater zhu et al 2014 guo et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 sampling a total of 38 groundwater samples from ncp and 1 bohai seawater sample were collected from ncp in august 2015 fig 1 the groundwater samples were collected from the confined aquifers a3 and a4 at depths ranging from 150 to 600 m which have been used as the main source of drinking water supply in the rural areas to avoid salinity contamination from shallow aquifers the holocene aquifer a1 and late pleistocene aquifer a2 were sealed and therefore the groundwater samples collected in this study were a mixture of groundwater from middle pleistocene and that from early pleistocene aquifers a3 and a4 the wells were purged at least 10 min using a high discharge pump prior to water sampling chemical and physical parameters including ph redox potential orp and temperature t were measured on site using hach portable meters after stabilization samples were collected in iodine free hdpe containers using a low flow pump and filtered through 0 45 μm membrane the samples for cation and strontium isotope analysis were acidified using ultra purified hno3 to ph 2 and samples for anion analysis were collected directly after being filtered samples for oxygen and hydrogen isotope analysis were collected in 50 ml hdpe bottles without head space ten clayey and silty core samples length 15 cm diameter 8 cm at the depth of 188 397 m were collected from two boreholes labeled as cz and hh which are located in the coastal area with the hh borehole closer to the sea fig 1 to minimize the soil disturbance and oxidation the core samples were stored in vacuum package at 4 c prior to testing the pore water compacted from the core samples were collected using a squeezing method with a maximum pressure of 6 mpa fernández et al 2014 prior to squeezing peripheral sediments within 1 cm from the edge were removed to minimize the effect of evaporation kwong et al 2015 the cylinder chamber made up of stainless steel was used to support the placement of core sample 1000 g and had a water outlet at the bottom the joints between the top bottom endplate and cylinder chamber were sealed with o rings a continuous gas pressure was applied to push a piston and pass the pressure to the sediment sample then the sediment was compressed under the pressure and pore water in the sediment would be constantly squeezed out and collected in the clean hdpe bottle the compaction released pore water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane for the analysis of the concentration of anions chloride bromide sulfate iodide and iodate and the isotopic compositions of oxygen hydrogen and strontium 3 2 chemical analysis alkalinity measurement was performed using a titration method within 24 h after sampling anion concentrations including f cl and so4 were analyzed using ion chromatography ic metrohm 761 compact cations and trace element analysis were determined using icp aes iris intrepid ii xsp and icp ms aglient 7900 respectively the iodine speciation and total iodine concentration were determined by ic icp ms and icp ms and the detailed method was described by yang et al 2007 the organic iodine concentration is obtained by subtracting the concentration of iodate and iodide from the total iodine concentration a 5 of agreement was fulfilled in laboratory chemical analysis charge balance errors for all groundwater samples were below 9 qa qc stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen were measured using finnigan mat 253 mass spectrometer oxygen isotopes were determined via equilibration with h2o co2 at 25 c for 24 h and analyzed by continuous flow mass spectrometry using a thermo finnigan gas bench hydrogen isotopes were measured by reaction with cr at 850 c using an automated finnigan mat h device δ18o and δ2h values were determined relative to internal standards calibrated using v smow and isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h were expressed in standard δ notation representing per mille deviations from the v smow standard precision for δ18o and δ2h were 0 1 and 1 0 samples for 87sr 86sr analyses were treated by sr specific resin

asx 110 automatic sampler and a dsn 100 desolvating nebulizer systemtion mass spectrometer the reproducibility of 87sr 86sr measurement was tested by duplicate analysis of the nist srm 987 standard all of the analysis work was done at state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan 4 results 4 1 groundwater chemistry groundwater iodine concentration ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l with a median value of 270 μg l with approximately 79 samples higher than 100 μg l the chinese mcl value for iodine in drinking water table 1 as shown in fig 1 high iodine 100 μg l groundwater is mainly distributed close to bohai bay area where evident land subsidence occurs the iodine concentration in compaction released pore solution samples ranged from 18 1 to 830 μg l half of them being more than 100 μg l the highest iodine concentration of compaction released pore solution occurred at the depth of 281 m in the hh borehole iodide is the predominant species of iodine which ranged from 1 2 to 854 μg l in groundwater and from 11 6 to 809 μg l in compaction released pore solution table 2 fig 3 iodate was not detected in most samples and organic iodine was detected in high iodine groundwater and in compaction released pore solution tables 1 and 2 the ph and orp values of groundwater samples ranged from 7 49 to 8 79 median value 8 06 and from 229 to 140 mv median value 18 8 mv respectively a narrow range of ph from 7 61 to 8 43 and low orp from 229 to 118 mv were observed in high iodine groundwater samples the tds of all groundwater samples varied from 370 to 2360 mg l with a median value of 1250 mg l and an increasing trend from the piedmont and central areas 376 664 mg l with a median value of 563 mg l to the coastal areas 494 2360 mg l 1370 mg l fig 4 c from the taihang mountain to the bohai sea the hydrochemical type of the groundwater changed from ca hco3 to na hco3 and the dominant type was na hco3 cl in the coastal areas fig 5 elevated cl concentration up to 14300 mg l was detected in compaction released pore solution from cz and hh borehole table 2 the br concentration of groundwater ranged from 25 to 2015 μg l with a median of 604 μg l similar to cl elevated br concentration was also observed in compaction released pore solution up to 29200 μg l close to that of seawater 33000 μg l as shown in fig s2 the cl br molar ratio in groundwater samples from the coastal areas fell into a variable range compared to that from the piedmont and the central areas fig 4d in the piedmont and central areas of ncp cl br molar ratios in groundwater ranged from 786 to 1120 with a relatively standard deviation of 119 while in the coastal area the range was 147 2547 with a relatively standard deviation of 535 similarly the cl br molar ratio 714 2159 of the compaction released pore solution also scattered with a standard deviation of 434 4 2 h o and sr isotopes groundwater δ18o and δ2h values varied from 10 3 to 8 9 and from 81 to 69 respectively the coastal groundwater samples had relatively higher values of δ18o ranging from 10 0 to 8 9 and δ2h ranging from 76 to 69 than those in the piedmont and central areas ranging from 10 3 to 9 6 and from 81 to 73 respectively the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition δ18o and δ2h of compaction released pore solution samples varied between 7 8 and 5 4 and between 65 and 52 respectively the bohai seawater sample had a δ18o value of 0 6 and δ2h value of 12 groundwater 87sr 86sr ratios ranged between 0 70985 and 0 71532 with a median value of 0 71232 which increased from the piedmont to the central areas and then decreased in the coastal areas fig 4f the 87sr 86sr ratios of two compaction released pore solutions 0 71321 for cz 03 and 0 71297 for cz 05 in the cz borehole are higher than those 0 71199 for hh 01 and 0 71245 for hh 03 in the hh borehole which is closer to the sea table 2 5 discussion 5 1 major clues about the marine origin of iodine according to the results of regional geological and hydrogeological studies there were several events of marine transgression in the quaternary period at ncp zhang et al 1997 wang et al 2008 lin and dai 2012 liu et al 2016a b it is worthy to note that the sediment sample depth 281 m with highest iodine concentration in its compaction released pore solution sample was collected from the reported horizon at the depth of 270 290 m of the bohai marine transgression lin and dai 2012 and the compaction released pore solution and groundwater samples with elevated iodine concentration were distributed near the bohai sea according to davis et al 1998 groundwater samples with cl br molar ratios higher than or equal to 650 indicate marine origin the values of cl br molar ratio for the compaction released pore solution clearly reflect their marine source for cl and br especially for those with elevated iodine concentration table 2 these observations all reflect the marine source of iodine in the high iodine aquifer systems iodine in compaction released pore solution exists as iodide which is a highly mobile species nagata and fukushi 2010 aimoz et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 to better understand the origin of iodine i cl iodide chloride and i br iodide bromide weight ratios can be used as iodine enrichment factor fig s1 and s2 the compaction released pore solution had significantly higher i cl 3 1020 and i br 1 492 ratios than those of seawater 2 for i cl and 1 for i br which may provide additional clues about iodine enrichment mechanism since iodate occurs widely in seawater and has a strong adsorption capability fuge and johnson 2015 nagata and fukushi 2010 marine iodate can be loaded onto sediments during the process of marine transgression and regression a recent study conducted by fuge and johnson 2015 indicates that as a result of the dominant oceanic source iodine is strongly enriched in near coastal soils during the long term burial process the species of iodine can be changed from iodate to iodide under the reducing conditions in the deep confined aquifers and iodide may be then desorbed and transported from the solid to the aqueous phase causing elevated concentration and proportion of iodide in the pore solution fig 3 similarly due to its high mobility and geochemically conservative nature chloride and bromide can hardly be retained in the solid phase during the burial process thus elevated i cl and i br ratios both in compaction released pore solution and in groundwater reflect the marine source and enrichment of iodine in the aqueous phase of the deep aquifer systems at ncp and as shown in the hydrogeological cross section profile modified by us marine iodine was mostly stored in the clayey layers overlying a3 and a4 fig 2 5 2 compaction of compressible clayey layers 5 2 1 identification of the mixing with compacted pore solution groundwater depletion at ncp due to over exploitation is the most serious worldwide alley et al 2002 zheng et al 2010 and has adverse consequences such as land subsidence accompanied with compaction of compressible clayey layers li et al 2014b wang et al 2018 it is likely to degrade groundwater quality in deep aquifers since the major areas of high iodine groundwater s occurrence overlap with those of significant land subsidence fig 1 oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions can be used to trace the sources and mixing processes of groundwater faure 1986 as shown in fig 6 the δ18o and δ2h values of all groundwater samples are scattered close to the lmwl δ2h 7δ18o 1 7 zhang et al 2000 and slightly shift to its right suggesting that the groundwater is mainly recharged by local meteoric water it was proposed that the depletion in δ18o and δ2h isotopes in deep groundwater could be related to the recharge from precipitation in palaeo climate conditions at the end of the pleistocene and the deep groundwater is hardly affected by evaporation kreuzer et al 2009 both chen et al 2003 and kreuzer et al 2009 suggested that the δ18o and δ2h values of pleistocene groundwater from ncp presumably recharged during last glacial periods respectively range from 11 7 to 9 4 and from 85 to 76 as compared with the results of high iodine groundwater samples the values of pleistocene groundwater are commonly more negative indicating that there should be other recharge sources for the high iodine groundwater in order to reveal the difference the δ18o and δ2h values of low and high iodine groundwater were defined by two regression lines fig 6 δ2h 7 1 δ18o 3 1 low iodine groundwater liwl δ2h 3 6 δ18o 38 high iodine groundwater hiwl the liwl regression line is nearly parallel to the lmwl while the lower slope value of regression line for the high iodine groundwater 3 6 suggests that high iodine groundwater may be the result of mixing with other sources of water considering the groundwater from coastal plain and the serious land subsidence area there are two potential sources modern seawater intrusion and compaction released pore water due to compaction of clayey layers the annual rate of seawater intrusion was estimated to be 0 86 107 m3 yr based on the results of density dependent flow and transport modeling yi et al 2016 however it should be emphasized that the δ18o and δ2h isotopes of high iodine groundwater samples were considerably depleted as compared to those of seawater indicating that modern seawater intrusion has limited impact on the groundwater in particular the samples of between groundwater and compaction released pore solution fall on the mixing line which can be defined by the equation of δ2h 3 4 δ18o 36 the similar slope between this mixing line 3 4 and hiwl 3 6 also suggests the effect of mixing with compaction released pore solution on high iodine groundwater because of the conservative behavior and high solubility of chloride and bromide in natural water water sediment interaction has little effects in modification of cl and br concentration cartwright et al 2006 davis et al 1998 thus cl br ratios can be used as an indicator of the origin and evolution of groundwater solutes as shown in the plot of cl br vs cl fig 7 high iodine groundwater is likely to be mixed with compaction released pore solution similarly li et al 2012 suggested that water with high cl concentration in the cangzhou district may be recharged by pore water released from compacted clays induced by over exploitation of deep groundwater the wide range of cl br ratios in our groundwater and compaction released pore water samples may be related to dissolution of evaporate minerals as reported by previous studies xing et al 2013 cartwright et al 2006 besides kwong et al 2015 suggested that pore water from core samples in the cangzhou district may have experienced evaporate dissolution this can be clearly seen from the hydrochemical features of our high iodine groundwater samples high cl concentration high so4 concentration and high cl br molar ratios table 1 fig 4b c and d which are similar to those of compaction released pore water table 2 therefore the hydrochemical features indicate that high iodine groundwater may have experienced the mixing with compaction released pore solution the 87sr 86sr ratio is not affected by fractionation processes and its values depend on source waters or rocks faure and mensing 2005 therefore strontium isotopes have been widely used to identify source waters in hydrogeological studies wang et al 2006 cartwright et al 2007 xie et al 2013 dogramaci and skrzypek 2015 a general increase trend of groundwater 87sr 86sr ratio along the flowpath in the piedmont and central area may be interpreted as the result of water sediment interactions while the decrease trend in the coastal areas may indicate the effect of mixing with strontium isotope of marine origin the 87sr 86sr ratios of compaction released pore solution from hh borehole closer to the sea ranged from 0 71100 to 0 71245 which were lower than those 0 71297 0 71321 from cz borehole farther away from the sea which is consistent with the general pattern of horizontal 87sr 86sr ratios variation of coastal groundwater fig 4f thus the variation of strontium isotope composition further indicates the contribution of compaction of compressible clayey layers of marine origin to the chemistry of high iodine groundwater 5 2 2 contributions of sediment compaction released pore water a recent study using times series data of 14c activity at ncp shows an increase of groundwater age with exploitation of the confined parts of aquifers system from 1985 to 2013 su et al 2018 indicating that a large fraction of old water has been exploited over time the results of groundwater flow modeling by cao et al 2013 indicate that the irrecoverable groundwater depletion due to aquitard compaction is about 40 0 km3 in deep aquifers in other words large amounts of water have been squeezed out from the storage of compressible clayey layers as mentioned above in the areas cangzhou city with high iodine groundwater the estimated contribution of subsidence volume to total deep groundwater yield was up to 57 6 based on gis spatial analysis method and statistical record of deep groundwater yield zhu et al 2014 indicating that the pore water resulted from the over exploitation of deep groundwater and regional land subsidence becomes an main source of recharge for regional deep aquifers guo et al 2015 over the past few decades groundwater exploitation has been concentrated in the deep aquifers a3 and a4 and the subsidence layer is mainly the compressible clayey layers between the a2 and a3 aquifers as well as in the a3 and a4 aquifers therefore the compaction released pore solution from these layers should play an important role in modification of the chemistry of deep groundwater at ncp in order to quantify the mixing proportion of compaction released pore solution in high iodine groundwater two end member mixing models were used one end member is the recharge water near the taihang mountain and the other one is the compaction released pore solution from cz borehole the average of five samples to calculate the mixing ratio of four groundwater samples around cz borehole then it can be quantified using the following equations a f r s c g b r c 1 where f s and g are the values of δ2h δ18o cl concentration sr 87sr 86sr banner et al 1989 in fresh groundwater compaction released pore solution and groundwater around cz borehole respectively and r and c represent the ratio of fresh groundwater and compaction released pore solution respectively accordingly the ratios of compaction released pore solution mixing in high iodine groundwater range from 41 0 to 54 3 with an average of 49 1 based on δ2h from 23 7 to 28 9 with an average of 26 3 based on δ18o from 57 1 to 70 1 with an average of 61 7 based on cl concentration and from 55 1 to 79 2 with an average of 68 9 based on 87sr 86sr the relatively low ratios based on δ18o may be related to water sediment interactions devriendt et al 2017 kwong et al 2015 it is interesting to see that the ratios based on δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr are similar to the proportion of subsidence volume of total deep groundwater yield 57 6 as a result of compaction of compressible clayey layers marine source iodine in compaction released pore solution from the sediments deposited during marine transgression periods is mobilized into adjacent aquifers relatively stable δ2h isotope signals with dramatic increase of cl concentration in high iodine groundwater clearly reflect the contribution of compaction of compressible clayey layers to iodine enrichment in groundwater fig 8 if we take one compaction released pore solution sample that has the highest concentration 830 μg l from borehole hh as the reference sample of marine source of iodine it can be seen from fig 8 that there is a sharp increase in δ2h values with substantial variation of cl concentrations and all the groundwater samples have elevated iodine concentrations indicating that compaction of compressible clayey layers deposited during marine transgression periods is the main factor controlling the genesis of high iodine groundwater assuming that the iodine concentration of 830 μg l represents that of the water released from the compaction of compressible clayey layers its contribution to iodine enrichment in groundwater can be calculated using the same approach mentioned above as shown in table 3 the proportion is 407 μg l for δ2h 512 μg l for cl 572 μg l for 87sr 86sr and 478 μg l for the evaluation proportion proposed by zhu et al 2014 all close to the average value 441 μg l of our high iodine groundwater samples reflecting again the importance of compaction of compressible clayey layers for the genesis of high iodine groundwater in deep aquifers at ncp 6 conclusions groundwater iodine concentration at ncp ranged from 5 8 to 1110 μg l and high iodine groundwater 100 μg l is distributed mainly in the southern coastal areas where serious land subsidence occurs the events of marine transgression provide the provenance of iodine in deep groundwater system at ncp the present study verifies the role that pore water compacted from deep sediments plays in the genesis of high iodine concentration in the deep aquifers our results show that high iodine groundwater is a mixture of fresh recharge water and pore water compacted from deep sediments accordingly the mixing ratios of compaction released pore solution in high iodine groundwater range from 41 0 to 54 3 with an average of 49 1 based on δ2h from 57 1 to 70 1 with an average of 61 7 based on cl concentration and from 55 1 to 79 2 with an average of 68 9 based on 87sr 86sr the ratios based on δ2h cl concentration and 87sr 86sr are similar to the proportion of subsidence volume of total deep groundwater yield 57 6 the deposition of iodine rich sediment during marine transgression in the quaternary period may be responsible for the iodine enrichment of compaction released pore solution and the compaction of compressible clayey layers deposited during marine transgression events is the main factor controlling the genesis of the high iodine groundwater calculation results show that the contribution of iodine from compaction released pore solution is 407 μg l for δ2h 512 μg l for cl and 572 μg l for 87sr 86sr which is comparable with its average concentration 441 μg l of high iodine groundwater the findings of this study have highlighted the importance of controlling land subsidence for the protection of groundwater quality improving the monitoring and governance of groundwater is therefore urgently needed to ensure safe and sustainable

18798,in electromembrane desalination processes such as electrodialysis ed and ion concentration polarization icp desalination ion depleted boundary layers constitute the desalted product stream yet also cause high resistivity and voltage drop directly manipulating fluid flow streams is a new method to break this fundamental trade off for electromembrane desalination in this work we are introducing a novel electromembrane desalination architecture that allows a feed stream to return to the feed inlet side of the membrane hereby named as return flow rf architecture to improve the energy efficiency by re distributing and controlling the depleted boundary layer even at high current values the technical feasibility of this idea was examined in icp desalination process rf icp with a wide range of feed salinity from 10 to 70 g l for a partial desalination rf icp 75 cm2 of membrane area has achieved similar power consumption compared to batch ed with 3 times bigger membrane area 200 cm2 with a higher area efficiency for salt removal which translates into lower optimal desalination cost the techno economic analysis of rf icp have been performed for the treatment of 70 g l brine waste for partial desalination of 70 g l brine down to 35 g l rf icp desalination achieved overall water cost as low as 2 57 m3 0 41 barrel this could translate into reduction in total water cost up to 31 for zero brine release scenarios depending on the concentrated brine treatment cost these results show that return flow architecture can improve the performance of electromembrane desalination enabling more flexible water treatment for many real world applications keywords electrodialysis desalination ion concentration polarization unipolar return flow 1 introduction conventional electrodialysis ed for desalination is an electromembrane process during which ions are transported using bipolar ion conduction employing alternating two ion exchange membranes anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem fig 1 a strathmann 2010 the ion depletion layers which develop next to aem and cem form by different ion transport numbers in the solution and the ion exchange membrane balster et al 2010 in natural water for desalination sodium chloride accounts for most of the salt 85 vermaas et al 2013 the ion depletion layer is thicker when developed next to cem than in aem with sodium chloride solution because diffusivity of chloride 2 03 10 9 m 2 s is higher than that of sodium 1 33 10 9 m 2 s newman and thomas alyea 2012 it is important to note that the development of the ion depletion layer a desired outcome for desalination also largely determines the energy consumption of electromembrane desalination because of the increased electrical resistance of ion depleted boundary layer chehayeb et al 2017 in ed the two depletion boundary layers developing along aem and cem cross each other towards the end of channel to achieve a high salt removal ratio necessary for the application since the thickness of ion depletion layer is largely determined by the current or salt removal ratio this poses a fundamental trade off for any electromembrane desalination processes the higher salt removal ratio of the process becomes i e thicker ion depletion layer the more resistant the cell becomes resulting in poorer energy efficiency in ed previous works to address this challenge were focused on the use of mesh spacers as a turbulence promoter or corrugated membrane for influencing the flow profile balster et al 2010 2006 tadimeti et al 2016 these studies have focused on eliminating ion depletion layer by mixing the entire channel as much as possible yet an entire diluate stream inevitably becomes of high electrical resistance no matter how well it is mixed when ed is operated with high salt removal ratio resulting in high power consumption previously our group has proposed a new desalination technique so called ion concentration polarization icp desalination using unipolar ion conduction by employing only cem to enhance an energy efficiency using the higher diffusivity of chloride ion fig 1b kwak et al 2016 the bifurcate icp bi icp desalination model facilitates to collect depleted and enriched stream via two separated channel ends in icp desalination both ion depletion and enrichment zones appear in a same channel enjoying a few unique advantages such as co removal of total suspended solids tss kwak et al 2016 yet mixing of the ion depleted and enriched streams defeats the desalination operation and therefore should be avoided in both ed and icp processes the fact that relatively large ion depletion region is generated especially toward the end of the channel represents a fundamental trade off limiting performance and cost effectiveness especially compared with reverse osmosis ro our group has recently proposed a trifurcate icp tri icp desalination architecture to facilitate a collection of thinly depleted and concentrated streams which developed adjacent to cem fig 1c kim et al 2016 in this architecture a thin ion depletion region is extracted to achieve both good energy efficiency only a small depletion region is generated and good salt removal ratio incrementally depleted desalted stream is extracted the porous membrane is implanted in a lab scale tri icp system to improve an energy efficiency as suppressing electroconvective instability kim et al 2017 using this we have demonstrated cost effective partial desalination of brine from 70 to 35 g l kim et al 2017 however tri icp essentially relies on lower current incremental electromembrane operation generation of relatively thin ion depletion regions therefore requires recirculation of main fluid intake another idea to address this tradeoff was the incorporation of microporous ion selective membranes allowing the diluate stream to penetrate into the membrane through large pores 100 μm effectively eliminating the ion depleted boundary layer and leading to higher energy efficiency kwon et al 2018 however this requires a rather complex fluid handling architecture in this paper we have developed a novel return flow rf electromembrane desalination process where direct control of flow path effectively limits the growth of ion depletion region therefore resulting in both high salt removal and high energy efficiency fig 1d and e shows schematic illustrations of rf ed and rf icp desalination with three channels separated by two porous membranes rf icp has nearly the same channel architecture with tri icp which has the three channels composed of a concentrate channel on the anodic side a diluate channel on the cathodic side and an intermediate channel between them however the intermediate channel outlet of tri icp is used for the inlet of rf icp the intermediate channel inlet of tri icp is blocked and all the intermediate flow is divided into concentrated and diluate channels due to the flow re direction and pressure distribution by this channel configuration two distinct flows appear in this system firstly the channel configuration facilitates that the flow returns to the original inlet side of the system forming so called return flow rt flow rt flow forces the feedwater to pass the same location of the system twice therefore equalizing the general current distribution across the length of the channel this feature addresses the uneven distribution of depletion zone in conventional electromembrane separations both ed and tri icp secondly the pressure difference across the porous membrane generates additional flow component passing from the intermediate channel to side channels pm flow which suppresses the leakage of desalted and concentrated stream back into the intermediate channel maintaining high current efficiency pm flow is the strongest near the entrance exit point of the feedwater where the strongest suppression of depletion region is also needed on the side of the concentrate stream the presence of pm flow reduces back diffusion salt flux from the concentrate stream into the intermediate stream therefore the combined effect of both rt flow and pm flow results in an overall increase in mass transfer due to more flattened depletion boundary layer i e more uniformly distributed cell resistance with a uniform current distribution along cem in contrast with the case of normal electromembrane process where the current decreases with thicker depletion boundary layer along cem due to fixed mass transfer fig 1f shaposhnik 1997 tanaka 2000 the net outcome of this architecture is the development of relatively even ion depleted and ion concentrated region across the system since the regions with largest depletion region thickness near the inlet outlets on the left is met by highest restricting flow from the intermediate flow this difference will result in many importance advantages both in terms of achieving high salt removal and high energy efficiency the benefit of evenly distributed ion depletion region follows the theorem of equipartition of entropy production tondeur and kvaalen 1987 which can also justify counter flow ed and ro for enhanced energy efficiency chehayeb et al 2018 in this work we demonstrate this new architecture by demonstrating the treatment of three concentrations of salt water 10 35 and 70 g l which represent brackish water seawater and highly saline brine respectively to evaluate technical and economic feasibility of rf icp desalination 2 material and method 2 1 device fabrication the modified lab scale icp desalination

result and discussion 3 1 studies on the feasibility of rf icp desalination system fig 2 a shows the general schematics of the experimental system to study the rf icp desalination process at various feed flow rate q f feed salinity c f and current density conditions the desalination system was operated under the condition of roughly 50 recovery ratio i e q d q c by adjusting the flow control needle valves attached to the two outlets several critical output variables were measured to understand the operation which include salinities of output diluate and concentrate streams salinity at the end of the intermediate channel midpoint of the feed flow and the net return flow rates to diluate and concentrate channel q r d and q r c while the output flow rates were set to be equally divided between the two output channels q d q c q r d and q r c are not the same in general and indeed q r d is less than q r c especially with higher operating current flux this is because of the contribution of electroosmotic flow from anode toward cathode in the system which becomes more prominent at higher driving current voltage while the full set of experimental data characterizing flow and salinity parameters are available in the supplementary information fig s2 s7 esi 1 1 electronic supplementary information esi available the general trend can be understood from fig 2b and c data for 35 g l feedwater in fig 2b the salinity of intermediate channel is increased with current density especially at low q f u f 1 2 mm s this is due to the combined effect of salt back diffusion from concentrate channel and the electroosmotic flow from concentrate stream to intermediate stream with the increased q f u f 2 4 mm s one can prevent such salt leakage by the increased pm flow returning to symmetry salt distribution between diluate and concentrate streams fig 2c is the estimated power consumption incurred in three distinct regions of the system calculated from the measured salinities see section 1 in esi 1 for details of calculation generation of near complete diluate stream at low q f results in significant increase in power consumption dominated by diluate channel while one can reduce such power consumption by increasing q f at the cost of reduced salt removal ratio less depleted output diluate stream the optimization of rf icp process therefore is achieved by reaching the balance between the necessary salt removal ratio and power consumption which was also the case for previous tri icp process for brine desalination kim et al 2017 3 2 comparison of rf icp and tri icp desalination we performed both rf icp and tri icp desalination experiments with same spacer and membrane dimension to evaluate an improved performance of rf icp desalination details of experiment set up are given in fig s8 esi 1 fig 3 shows the effect of systems on current utilization cu calculated from the experimental results with respect to c f and current density cu of both systems gradually decreases as the current density increases for all c f which is a well documented phenomenon chehayeb et al 2017 for all electromembrane separation processes including ed cu of rf icp is higher than 1 at the lower current density condition as previously proved cu of icp desalination technology can exceed 1 ideally increases up to 1 2 with sodium chloride solution because of ion diffusivities whereas ideal cu of ed is 1 kwak et al 2016 the higher current density leads to a thicker depletion and concentration layer on the opposite side of cem the development of trans membrane concentration difference promotes stronger back diffusion and osmosis resulting in the reduction of cu both systems show higher cu value under higher u f higher u f facilitates an increase in cu by the improved mass transfer reducing a depletion layer thickness the difference in cus between the different velocities tends to increase as the current density increases it indicates that the hydrodynamic convection has a more significant role at the higher current regime however it is clear that rf icp enjoys higher cu than that of tri icp at all operation parameters tested we plotted the power consumption as a function of salt removal ratio srratio in fig 4 a two systems rf icp and tri icp have the same membrane area with the same diluate production rate and show similar trends in power consumption where higher srratio generally requires higher power consumption however rf icp has better energy efficiency than tri icp in all tested cases with various feedwater salinity srratio and flow velocity values additionally the unit tri icp only has 25 recovery no recirculation while rf icp achieves 50 recovery with the same diluate flow rate conditions q d 7 5 and 15 ml min at better energy efficiency the difference in power consumption increases with increase in srratio indicating that rf icp has a more significant improvement of energy efficiency at higher srratio i e resulting in thicker depletion region the energy per unit ion removal epir was plotted as a function of salt removal rate srrate representing membrane area efficiency of the system to evaluate energy requirement for a specific mass transfer rate in fig 4b srrate can provide the removed mass per unit time per unit length and width of membrane but srratio can only represent the ratio of removed mass fraction fig s9 esi 1 less epir is required at higher feed salinity and flow velocity to achieve same srrate a large amount of ions in a high salinity solution are easily transported to and through the membrane due to low electrical resistance of the high salinity feedwater and a higher flow velocity increases mass transport near the membrane reducing depletion layer 3 3 numerical analysis we also performed a numerical analysis using previously developed multi physics icp desalination model kwak et al 2013 pham et al 2012 see section 3 in esi 1 for details of modeling the magnitude of velocity is visualized in fig 5 a the pressure of flow continuously decreases along the flow direction so that different pressures are developed next to the surfaces of porous membranes fig s11 in tri icp the flow formed parabolic profile i e no pm flow in each channel because the porous membranes worked as physical walls and generated a similar pressure drop along both side of porous membrane in rf icp however the intermediate side of porous membrane has a higher pressure than the diluate concentrate side of porous membrane which allows to flow through the porous membrane the velocity of intermediate stream decreases due to the outflux through the porous membrane but the velocity of other streams increases by the influx through the porous membrane also the pm flow velocity increases linearly along the porous membrane having the maximum value near the outlet of channel and one can observe that rf icp process enjoys relatively even distribution of current density along the channel as well as the thickness of ion depletion region fig 5b and fig s12 tri icp in contrast creates a thicker depletion layer toward the end of the membrane channel near the exit with rapidly deteriorating cu and epir values there this trend is more distinctive when a lower feed velocity generates a thicker depletion layer higher srratio generally higher velocity leads to an increase in mass transfer leading to a uniform current distribution along cem shaposhnik 1997 tanaka 2000 interestingly rf icp has better desalination performance even tri icp has a higher flow velocity than rf icp because the diluate flow velocity of rf icp gradually increases along the cem whereas the diluate flow velocity of tri icp is maintained the flow velocity of diluate outlet all along the cem 3 4 power consumption analysis the performance of rf icp is evaluated to achieve a fixed srratio 10 30 50 70 95 from various feed salinities and flow velocities fig 6 the experiment conditions are provided in table s3 esi 1 the range of operating current density depends on feed salinity 0 50 ma cm2 for 10 g l 0 150 ma cm2 for 35 g l and 0 250 ma cm2 for 70 g l for 10 and 35 g l of feed salinity the maximum current densities with corresponding flow velocity leads to a potable salinity of diluate stream however for 70 g l of feed salinity a current density over maximum results in malfunctions in cem creating unstable concentration profile and bubble formation in the spacer region it is not straightforward to compare the power efficiency of different electromembrane desalination systems because of differences in membrane length feed salinity production rate spacers and channel thickness still one can identify several trends applicable to these processes roughly speaking power consumption of electromembrane processes is proportional to current voltage drop where the first term current is related to current density or srrate multiplied by the membrane area and the second term voltage drop is related to the boundary layer thickness and salinity boundary layer depletion layer thickness is also roughly proportional to the current density several key insights resulting from this argument are the following 1 power efficiency wh l of different devices should be compared in the context of similar srrate or current density since they are roughly proportional to each other in the same device 2 larger channel thickness results in thicker boundary layer which increases the power consumption proportionally even under same srrate current density it is widely accepted that thicker spacers tend to increase power consumption chehayeb et al 2017 hattenbach and kneifel 1986 3 longer electromembrane channel allows one to distribute the net amount of current over a larger area resulting in lower current density and higher energy efficiency in general using these insights we can compare rf icp with several previous electromembrane processes in the specific desalination applications table 1 is summarizing the key numbers from various electromembrane processes recently published also in fig s13 we plotted the power consumption and srrate of different desalination processes for different feedwater and product water salinity in order to understand the merit of rf icp in the context of other comparable processes partial desalination of highly saline brine 70 g l into lower salinity 35 50 g l for reuse recycle applications choi et al 2019 fritzmann et al 2007 is one important potential application of electromembrane desalination compared with the batch ed mcgovern et al 2014 rf icp enjoys similar power consumption but with almost double the value of srrate higher membrane efficiency this can translate roughly into either 50 reduction in power consumption if similar sized membrane is used in comparison with previous tri icp kim et al 2017 rf icp process can maintain lower power consumption even when the srrate is high in addition rf icp is a continuous process with recovery rate of 50 while tri icp generally requires re circulation and with lower production rate another important application of electromembrane desalination is the treatment of brackish water 5 10 g l into potable water 0 5 g l rf icp in this work achieves desalination from 10 g l down to 0 5 g l with a power consumption of 33 7 61 7 wh l corresponding srrate is 2 5 10 1 μg s cm2 this is much worse than recent batch ed result desalination of 9 g l source water 2 5 wh l 0 5 2 5 μg s cm2 mcgovern et al 2014 as well as the result from a commercialized plant scale edr systems 0 5 1 wh l 3 6 6 7 μg s cm2 from 6 to 0 3 g l aquamite edr systems 2018 even after considering the relatively high srrate of rf icp the brackish water desalination power consumption of rf icp system is approximately 3 fold higher than that ed this is mainly because of the large stack channel thickness spacer height of rf icp model system used in our work the commercial ed spacers height thickness of the diluate channel typically used in laboratory and industry are 0 35 0 5 mm thick electro membrane applications 2016 technical datasheet electrodialysis cells 2014 which essentially becomes the thickness of the highly desalted with high electrical resistance diluate stream in the ed process in contrast rf icp system we used had the entire spacer thickness of 3 2 mm which is the sum of diluate 0 8 mm intermdiate 1 6 mm and concentrate channels 0 8 mm and two porous membranes 24 μm thick per porous membrane though the spacer thickness is a critical parameter for cell resistance the thickness of two porous membranes 48 μm can be ignored because it only contributes 0 15 of the thickness 48 μm 32 048 μm unlike ed in rf icp only the output diluate stream gets ion depleted due to the non linearity between salinity and resistivity fig s5 the resistance of diluate channel contributes most of the cell resistance fig s6 and the power is mainly consumed by the diluate channel fig s7 moreover the current rf icp spacer attains high resistance because it has the thick diluate channel 0 8 mm which is still 2 3 fold larger than that of commercial ed systems this challenge may be overcome in the future by building thinner spacers for our diluate output channel fig s14 also the thickness of cation exchange membrane cem chen et al 2013 kim et al 2017 tedesco et al 2018 and porous membrane pm alkhudhiri et al 2012 may have significant roles in a desalination performance but perhaps only in high salinity feed conditions where resistance of membrane becomes comparable with that of main channel from fig 6 it is obvious that the power consumption for c f 10 g l tests were dominated by the inefficiency of desalting the last 30 of the remaining salts as one can see that power consumption drastically increased when srratio is increased from 70 to 95 this is also observed in c f 35 g l seawater salinity cases which means that the key inefficiency in electromembrane desalination processes icp or ed is the removal of salt from low salinity conditions ideas like edi electrodeionization arar et al 2014 multiscale pore membranes kwon et al 2018 or minimizing spacer thickness could be used to address this problem specifically notwithstanding the srrate of continuous desalination single stage by our rf icp is almost 5 fold higher compared with earlier batch ed 4 stage works mcgovern et al 2014 i e area efficiency is 5 fold higher while using only a small size membrane 15 cm 5 cm 75 cm2 such a high membrane efficiency high current density or srrate at acceptable power consumption would be necessary for many applications including small scale portable desalination devices 3 5 cost analysis for the purpose of evaluating the efficiency and merit of desalination technology it is more appropriate to calculate a total water cost composed of capital and operating costs to evaluate a validity of technology in a practical desalination application in this study two techno economic analyses are applicable partial desalination of brine 70 g l for waste treatment and total desalination of brackish water 10 g l and seawater 35 g l for drinking water first of all we focus on how an optimized water cost changes to treat a brine 70 g l as previously reported choi 2017 kim et al 2017 the simplified water cost model is applied for a water cost optimization see section 5 in esi 1 for details the capital cost is mainly determined by equipment lifespan and its cost an increase in the equipment lifespan determined by the lifespan of membrane can reduce capital cost even the lifespan of commercial membrane is guaranteed for 10 years according to the specifications provided by the membrane manufacturer mega ralex membranes for ed edi and ef coating 2018 suez 2020 edr systems 2017 it is widely known that ion exchange membranes have a lifetime of 4 10 years while maintaining selective permeability depending on the type of feed solution and the degree of fouling electrodialysis and electrodialysis reversal 2010 protocols for electrodialysis membrane selection membrane fouling and design 2017 strathmann et al 2013 the equipment cost is dominated by a membrane cost and its size in the electromembrane desalination especially the membrane size length is correlated with the energy efficiency as the length increases energy efficiency improves therefore operating costs are reduced but capital costs increase the energy electricity cost is a key factor in determining operating costs the selection of electricity cost is also crucial to optimize water costs because the electricity cost varies according to local conditions and is widely distributed between 0 025 and 0 325 kwh world energy prices 2018 in fig 7 the water cost analysis has performed to understand how water costs change with different scenarios including equipment size lifespan and electricity cost we import an experiment data from the previous reported model tri icp which has bigger membrane size 180 cm2 length 30 cm width 6 cm and compared with rf icp prototype with 75 cm2 length 15 cm width 5 cm tri icp shows better energy efficiency of 0 31 40 wh l than rf icp with energy efficiency of 0 33 75 wh l to achieve the same srratio ranging from 10 to 70 with u d 0 5 mm s kim et al 2017 the water cost is optimized to the lowest cost value of the sum of capital and operating cost the lifespan and electricity cost are set as 5 and 10 years 0 05 and 0 1 kwh respectively the optimized water cost for rf icp is 4 01 m3 1 69 and 2 32 m3 for capital and operating cost respectively with a lifespan of 10 years and an electricity cost of 0 1 kwh it can be reduced to 2 57 m3 0 85 and 1 72 m3 for capital and operating cost respectively with a reduced electricity cost of 0 05 kwh albeit the same lifespan the changes in capital and operating cost provide changes in water cost but also system characteristics and their applications the operating costs determined by electricity costs used for both rf icp and tri icp increase dramatically with increasing srratio indicating that all icp desalination is basically power intensive process regardless of membrane size generally coastal sea water reverse osmosis ro process discharges 65 85 g l of brine waste to a coast afrasiabi and shahbazali 2011 greenlee et al 2009 the disposal to surface water can save a wastewater treatment cost but it causes increase in a seawater salinity e g seawater salinity around arabian gulf exceeded 40 ppt meshkati and tabibzadeh 2016 smith et al 2007 this higher seawater salinity causes a significant marine environment problem because the salinity of 40 45 ppt appears to cause a death of exposed marine plants roberts et al 2010 the brine wastes can be disposed by reinjection into underground formations or via evaporation pond 4 7 18 9 m3 or recycled by a post treatment such as mechanical vapor recompression mvr 22 39 m3 slutz et al 2012 this additional cost should be considered to be part of the desalination costs and it accounts for the majority of the water cost calculations because ro ranging 0 71 to 0 91 m3 has little change in cost addams et al 2009 in order to reduce total water cost both ro desalination and waste brine treatment the partial desalination by rf icp is applied to reduce the volume of waste from ro fig 8 a illustrates ro process incorporated rf icp and waste treatment process to calculate the total water cost including ro waste treatment and rf icp costs we applied ro cost model developed previously nayar et al 2017 fixed waste treatment costs and rf icp cost model with lifespan of 10 years and electricity cost of 0 05 kwh the feed salinity c f is set as a seawater salinity 35 g l and the brine salinity c r o b from ro is fixed as 70 g l the brine q r o b is partially desalinated by rf icp and the produced water q i c p p and brine q i c p b by rf icp are recirculated into the ro inflow q r o i n and discharged to waste treatment respectively the feed salinity for ro c r o i n can change depend on the srratio of rf icp desalination but it is limited to 30 45 g l which can be applied to typical ro fritzmann et al 2007 in fig 8b the total water cost varies with change in ro rf icp and waste treatment costs as the srratio of rf icp increases the ro recovery rate increases and q i c p b decreases resulting in saving the total water cost additionally the total water cost can be changed by the waste treatment cost the cost analysis performed to assess the feasibility of rf icp desalination with changes in wastewater treatment costs fig 8c the increase in waste treatment costs dominates the total cost variation but the increase in the srratio of rf icp reduces the total water cost the rf icp begins to show that it is cost effective reducing total water cost by 13 from 3 85 m3 without rf icp to 3 26 m3 with 30 of srratio by rf icp when wastewater treatment cost is 3 m3 above the waste treatment cost of 3 m3 the total cost decreases rapidly at the beginning of srratio increase and saturated a certain cost regardless of srratio increase in the case of 8 m3 of wastewater treatment cost the decrease in total water cost is approximately saturated with 6 07 m3 with 50 of srratio by rf icp reducing the total water cost by 31 from 8 86 m3 without rf icp for the total desalination for drinking water 95 of srr condition for 10 and 35 g l of feed water is chosen to obtain optimized water costs the optimized water costs are 4 44 m3 0 84 m3 of capital cost and 3 60 m3 of operating cost with 27 9 kw m3 of power consumption and 7 19 m3 1 69 m3 of capital cost and 5 50 m3 of operating cost with 55 0 kw m3 of power consumption for 10 and 35 g l of feed water respectively it can be applicable to portable desalination due to the small dimension and weight of device overall size and weight of device are 290 130 100 mm3 and 2 kg respectively but it is still a power intensive process generally requiring high operating cost 4 conclusion herein we demonstrate the feasibility of rf icp desalination system by a portable scale rf icp device 75 cm2 of membrane area the performance of rf icp desalination is evaluated with various flow rate 0 83 6 67 ml min per spacer and feed salinity 10 70 g l conditions to achieve fixed srratios the rf icp desalination improved a membrane efficiency with a higher srrate for a partial desalination and achieved a similar power consumption compared to batch ed even the membrane area of rf icp was 3 times smaller than the batch ed we carried out techno economic analysis of the rf icp desalination for two application scenarios of partial desalination of brine 70 g l where a relatively favorable cost picture emerged even if the experimental system used for the analysis was a lab scale system with small membrane area with much room for further optimization remaining e g stack thickness reduction incorporation of mixing promotor or porosity variation in porous membrane while the study presented here is only a proof of concept demonstration it is clearly validating a novel method to increase the energy

18798,in electromembrane desalination processes such as electrodialysis ed and ion concentration polarization icp desalination ion depleted boundary layers constitute the desalted product stream yet also cause high resistivity and voltage drop directly manipulating fluid flow streams is a new method to break this fundamental trade off for electromembrane desalination in this work we are introducing a novel electromembrane desalination architecture that allows a feed stream to return to the feed inlet side of the membrane hereby named as return flow rf architecture to improve the energy efficiency by re distributing and controlling the depleted boundary layer even at high current values the technical feasibility of this idea was examined in icp desalination process rf icp with a wide range of feed salinity from 10 to 70 g l for a partial desalination rf icp 75 cm2 of membrane area has achieved similar power consumption compared to batch ed with 3 times bigger membrane area 200 cm2 with a higher area efficiency for salt removal which translates into lower optimal desalination cost the techno economic analysis of rf icp have been performed for the treatment of 70 g l brine waste for partial desalination of 70 g l brine down to 35 g l rf icp desalination achieved overall water cost as low as 2 57 m3 0 41 barrel this could translate into reduction in total water cost up to 31 for zero brine release scenarios depending on the concentrated brine treatment cost these results show that return flow architecture can improve the performance of electromembrane desalination enabling more flexible water treatment for many real world applications keywords electrodialysis desalination ion concentration polarization unipolar return flow 1 introduction conventional electrodialysis ed for desalination is an electromembrane process during which ions are transported using bipolar ion conduction employing alternating two ion exchange membranes anion exchange membrane aem and cation exchange membrane cem fig 1 a strathmann 2010 the ion depletion layers which develop next to aem and cem form by different ion transport numbers in the solution and the ion exchange membrane balster et al 2010 in natural water for desalination sodium chloride accounts for most of the salt 85 vermaas et al 2013 the ion depletion layer is thicker when developed next to cem than in aem with sodium chloride solution because diffusivity of chloride 2 03 10 9 m 2 s is higher than that of sodium 1 33 10 9 m 2 s newman and thomas alyea 2012 it is important to note that the development of the ion depletion layer a desired outcome for desalination also largely determines the energy consumption of electromembrane desalination because of the increased electrical resistance of ion depleted boundary layer chehayeb et al 2017 in ed the two depletion boundary layers developing along aem and cem cross each other towards the end of channel to achieve a high salt removal ratio necessary for the application since the thickness of ion depletion layer is largely determined by the current or salt removal ratio this poses a fundamental trade off for any electromembrane desalination processes the higher salt removal ratio of the process becomes i e thicker ion depletion layer the more resistant the cell becomes resulting in poorer energy efficiency in ed previous works to address this challenge were focused on the use of mesh spacers as a turbulence promoter or corrugated membrane for influencing the flow profile balster et al 2010 2006 tadimeti et al 2016 these studies have focused on eliminating ion depletion layer by mixing the entire channel as much as possible yet an entire diluate stream inevitably becomes of high electrical resistance no matter how well it is mixed when ed is operated with high salt removal ratio resulting in high power consumption previously our group has proposed a new desalination technique so called ion concentration polarization icp desalination using unipolar ion conduction by employing only cem to enhance an energy efficiency using the higher diffusivity of chloride ion fig 1b kwak et al 2016 the bifurcate icp bi icp desalination model facilitates to collect depleted and enriched stream via two separated channel ends in icp desalination both ion depletion and enrichment zones appear in a same channel enjoying a few unique advantages such as co removal of total suspended solids tss kwak et al 2016 yet mixing of the ion depleted and enriched streams defeats the desalination operation and therefore should be avoided in both ed and icp processes the fact that relatively large ion depletion region is generated especially toward the end of the channel represents a fundamental trade off limiting performance and cost effectiveness especially compared with reverse osmosis ro our group has recently proposed a trifurcate icp tri icp desalination architecture to facilitate a collection of thinly depleted and concentrated streams which developed adjacent to cem fig 1c kim et al 2016 in this architecture a thin ion depletion region is extracted to achieve both good energy efficiency only a small depletion region is generated and good salt removal ratio incrementally depleted desalted stream is extracted the porous membrane is implanted in a lab scale tri icp system to improve an energy efficiency as suppressing electroconvective instability kim et al 2017 using this we have demonstrated cost effective partial desalination of brine from 70 to 35 g l kim et al 2017 however tri icp essentially relies on lower current incremental electromembrane operation generation of relatively thin ion depletion regions therefore requires recirculation of main fluid intake another idea to address this tradeoff was the incorporation of microporous ion selective membranes allowing the diluate stream to penetrate into the membrane through large pores 100 μm effectively eliminating the ion depleted boundary layer and leading to higher energy efficiency kwon et al 2018 however this requires a rather complex fluid handling architecture in this paper we have developed a novel return flow rf electromembrane desalination process where direct control of flow path effectively limits the growth of ion depletion region therefore resulting in both high salt removal and high energy efficiency fig 1d and e shows schematic illustrations of rf ed and rf icp desalination with three channels separated by two porous membranes rf icp has nearly the same channel architecture with tri icp which has the three channels composed of a concentrate channel on the anodic side a diluate channel on the cathodic side and an intermediate channel between them however the intermediate channel outlet of tri icp is used for the inlet of rf icp the intermediate channel inlet of tri icp is blocked and all the intermediate flow is divided into concentrated and diluate channels due to the flow re direction and pressure distribution by this channel configuration two distinct flows appear in this system firstly the channel configuration facilitates that the flow returns to the original inlet side of the system forming so called return flow rt flow rt flow forces the feedwater to pass the same location of the system twice therefore equalizing the general current distribution across the length of the channel this feature addresses the uneven distribution of depletion zone in conventional electromembrane separations both ed and tri icp secondly the pressure difference across the porous membrane generates additional flow component passing from the intermediate channel to side channels pm flow which suppresses the leakage of desalted and concentrated stream back into the intermediate channel maintaining high current efficiency pm flow is the strongest near the entrance exit point of the feedwater where the strongest suppression of depletion region is also needed on the side of the concentrate stream the presence of pm flow reduces back diffusion salt flux from the concentrate stream into the intermediate stream therefore the combined effect of both rt flow and pm flow results in an overall increase in mass transfer due to more flattened depletion boundary layer i e more uniformly distributed cell resistance with a uniform current distribution along cem in contrast with the case of normal electromembrane process where the current decreases with thicker depletion boundary layer along cem due to fixed mass transfer fig 1f shaposhnik 1997 tanaka 2000 the net outcome of this architecture is the development of relatively even ion depleted and ion concentrated region across the system since the regions with largest depletion region thickness near the inlet outlets on the left is met by highest restricting flow from the intermediate flow this difference will result in many importance advantages both in terms of achieving high salt removal and high energy efficiency the benefit of evenly distributed ion depletion region follows the theorem of equipartition of entropy production tondeur and kvaalen 1987 which can also justify counter flow ed and ro for enhanced energy efficiency chehayeb et al 2018 in this work we demonstrate this new architecture by demonstrating the treatment of three concentrations of salt water 10 35 and 70 g l which represent brackish water seawater and highly saline brine respectively to evaluate technical and economic feasibility of rf icp desalination 2 material and method 2 1 device fabrication the modified lab scale icp desalination

result and discussion 3 1 studies on the feasibility of rf icp desalination system fig 2 a shows the general schematics of the experimental system to study the rf icp desalination process at various feed flow rate q f feed salinity c f and current density conditions the desalination system was operated under the condition of roughly 50 recovery ratio i e q d q c by adjusting the flow control needle valves attached to the two outlets several critical output variables were measured to understand the operation which include salinities of output diluate and concentrate streams salinity at the end of the intermediate channel midpoint of the feed flow and the net return flow rates to diluate and concentrate channel q r d and q r c while the output flow rates were set to be equally divided between the two output channels q d q c q r d and q r c are not the same in general and indeed q r d is less than q r c especially with higher operating current flux this is because of the contribution of electroosmotic flow from anode toward cathode in the system which becomes more prominent at higher driving current voltage while the full set of experimental data characterizing flow and salinity parameters are available in the supplementary information fig s2 s7 esi 1 1 electronic supplementary information esi available the general trend can be understood from fig 2b and c data for 35 g l feedwater in fig 2b the salinity of intermediate channel is increased with current density especially at low q f u f 1 2 mm s this is due to the combined effect of salt back diffusion from concentrate channel and the electroosmotic flow from concentrate stream to intermediate stream with the increased q f u f 2 4 mm s one can prevent such salt leakage by the increased pm flow returning to symmetry salt distribution between diluate and concentrate streams fig 2c is the estimated power consumption incurred in three distinct regions of the system calculated from the measured salinities see section 1 in esi 1 for details of calculation generation of near complete diluate stream at low q f results in significant increase in power consumption dominated by diluate channel while one can reduce such power consumption by increasing q f at the cost of reduced salt removal ratio less depleted output diluate stream the optimization of rf icp process therefore is achieved by reaching the balance between the necessary salt removal ratio and power consumption which was also the case for previous tri icp process for brine desalination kim et al 2017 3 2 comparison of rf icp and tri icp desalination we performed both rf icp and tri icp desalination experiments with same spacer and membrane dimension to evaluate an improved performance of rf icp desalination details of experiment set up are given in fig s8 esi 1 fig 3 shows the effect of systems on current utilization cu calculated from the experimental results with respect to c f and current density cu of both systems gradually decreases as the current density increases for all c f which is a well documented phenomenon chehayeb et al 2017 for all electromembrane separation processes including ed cu of rf icp is higher than 1 at the lower current density condition as previously proved cu of icp desalination technology can exceed 1 ideally increases up to 1 2 with sodium chloride solution because of ion diffusivities whereas ideal cu of ed is 1 kwak et al 2016 the higher current density leads to a thicker depletion and concentration layer on the opposite side of cem the development of trans membrane concentration difference promotes stronger back diffusion and osmosis resulting in the reduction of cu both systems show higher cu value under higher u f higher u f facilitates an increase in cu by the improved mass transfer reducing a depletion layer thickness the difference in cus between the different velocities tends to increase as the current density increases it indicates that the hydrodynamic convection has a more significant role at the higher current regime however it is clear that rf icp enjoys higher cu than that of tri icp at all operation parameters tested we plotted the power consumption as a function of salt removal ratio srratio in fig 4 a two systems rf icp and tri icp have the same membrane area with the same diluate production rate and show similar trends in power consumption where higher srratio generally requires higher power consumption however rf icp has better energy efficiency than tri icp in all tested cases with various feedwater salinity srratio and flow velocity values additionally the unit tri icp only has 25 recovery no recirculation while rf icp achieves 50 recovery with the same diluate flow rate conditions q d 7 5 and 15 ml min at better energy efficiency the difference in power consumption increases with increase in srratio indicating that rf icp has a more significant improvement of energy efficiency at higher srratio i e resulting in thicker depletion region the energy per unit ion removal epir was plotted as a function of salt removal rate srrate representing membrane area efficiency of the system to evaluate energy requirement for a specific mass transfer rate in fig 4b srrate can provide the removed mass per unit time per unit length and width of membrane but srratio can only represent the ratio of removed mass fraction fig s9 esi 1 less epir is required at higher feed salinity and flow velocity to achieve same srrate a large amount of ions in a high salinity solution are easily transported to and through the membrane due to low electrical resistance of the high salinity feedwater and a higher flow velocity increases mass transport near the membrane reducing depletion layer 3 3 numerical analysis we also performed a numerical analysis using previously developed multi physics icp desalination model kwak et al 2013 pham et al 2012 see section 3 in esi 1 for details of modeling the magnitude of velocity is visualized in fig 5 a the pressure of flow continuously decreases along the flow direction so that different pressures are developed next to the surfaces of porous membranes fig s11 in tri icp the flow formed parabolic profile i e no pm flow in each channel because the porous membranes worked as physical walls and generated a similar pressure drop along both side of porous membrane in rf icp however the intermediate side of porous membrane has a higher pressure than the diluate concentrate side of porous membrane which allows to flow through the porous membrane the velocity of intermediate stream decreases due to the outflux through the porous membrane but the velocity of other streams increases by the influx through the porous membrane also the pm flow velocity increases linearly along the porous membrane having the maximum value near the outlet of channel and one can observe that rf icp process enjoys relatively even distribution of current density along the channel as well as the thickness of ion depletion region fig 5b and fig s12 tri icp in contrast creates a thicker depletion layer toward the end of the membrane channel near the exit with rapidly deteriorating cu and epir values there this trend is more distinctive when a lower feed velocity generates a thicker depletion layer higher srratio generally higher velocity leads to an increase in mass transfer leading to a uniform current distribution along cem shaposhnik 1997 tanaka 2000 interestingly rf icp has better desalination performance even tri icp has a higher flow velocity than rf icp because the diluate flow velocity of rf icp gradually increases along the cem whereas the diluate flow velocity of tri icp is maintained the flow velocity of diluate outlet all along the cem 3 4 power consumption analysis the performance of rf icp is evaluated to achieve a fixed srratio 10 30 50 70 95 from various feed salinities and flow velocities fig 6 the experiment conditions are provided in table s3 esi 1 the range of operating current density depends on feed salinity 0 50 ma cm2 for 10 g l 0 150 ma cm2 for 35 g l and 0 250 ma cm2 for 70 g l for 10 and 35 g l of feed salinity the maximum current densities with corresponding flow velocity leads to a potable salinity of diluate stream however for 70 g l of feed salinity a current density over maximum results in malfunctions in cem creating unstable concentration profile and bubble formation in the spacer region it is not straightforward to compare the power efficiency of different electromembrane desalination systems because of differences in membrane length feed salinity production rate spacers and channel thickness still one can identify several trends applicable to these processes roughly speaking power consumption of electromembrane processes is proportional to current voltage drop where the first term current is related to current density or srrate multiplied by the membrane area and the second term voltage drop is related to the boundary layer thickness and salinity boundary layer depletion layer thickness is also roughly proportional to the current density several key insights resulting from this argument are the following 1 power efficiency wh l of different devices should be compared in the context of similar srrate or current density since they are roughly proportional to each other in the same device 2 larger channel thickness results in thicker boundary layer which increases the power consumption proportionally even under same srrate current density it is widely accepted that thicker spacers tend to increase power consumption chehayeb et al 2017 hattenbach and kneifel 1986 3 longer electromembrane channel allows one to distribute the net amount of current over a larger area resulting in lower current density and higher energy efficiency in general using these insights we can compare rf icp with several previous electromembrane processes in the specific desalination applications table 1 is summarizing the key numbers from various electromembrane processes recently published also in fig s13 we plotted the power consumption and srrate of different desalination processes for different feedwater and product water salinity in order to understand the merit of rf icp in the context of other comparable processes partial desalination of highly saline brine 70 g l into lower salinity 35 50 g l for reuse recycle applications choi et al 2019 fritzmann et al 2007 is one important potential application of electromembrane desalination compared with the batch ed mcgovern et al 2014 rf icp enjoys similar power consumption but with almost double the value of srrate higher membrane efficiency this can translate roughly into either 50 reduction in power consumption if similar sized membrane is used in comparison with previous tri icp kim et al 2017 rf icp process can maintain lower power consumption even when the srrate is high in addition rf icp is a continuous process with recovery rate of 50 while tri icp generally requires re circulation and with lower production rate another important application of electromembrane desalination is the treatment of brackish water 5 10 g l into potable water 0 5 g l rf icp in this work achieves desalination from 10 g l down to 0 5 g l with a power consumption of 33 7 61 7 wh l corresponding srrate is 2 5 10 1 μg s cm2 this is much worse than recent batch ed result desalination of 9 g l source water 2 5 wh l 0 5 2 5 μg s cm2 mcgovern et al 2014 as well as the result from a commercialized plant scale edr systems 0 5 1 wh l 3 6 6 7 μg s cm2 from 6 to 0 3 g l aquamite edr systems 2018 even after considering the relatively high srrate of rf icp the brackish water desalination power consumption of rf icp system is approximately 3 fold higher than that ed this is mainly because of the large stack channel thickness spacer height of rf icp model system used in our work the commercial ed spacers height thickness of the diluate channel typically used in laboratory and industry are 0 35 0 5 mm thick electro membrane applications 2016 technical datasheet electrodialysis cells 2014 which essentially becomes the thickness of the highly desalted with high electrical resistance diluate stream in the ed process in contrast rf icp system we used had the entire spacer thickness of 3 2 mm which is the sum of diluate 0 8 mm intermdiate 1 6 mm and concentrate channels 0 8 mm and two porous membranes 24 μm thick per porous membrane though the spacer thickness is a critical parameter for cell resistance the thickness of two porous membranes 48 μm can be ignored because it only contributes 0 15 of the thickness 48 μm 32 048 μm unlike ed in rf icp only the output diluate stream gets ion depleted due to the non linearity between salinity and resistivity fig s5 the resistance of diluate channel contributes most of the cell resistance fig s6 and the power is mainly consumed by the diluate channel fig s7 moreover the current rf icp spacer attains high resistance because it has the thick diluate channel 0 8 mm which is still 2 3 fold larger than that of commercial ed systems this challenge may be overcome in the future by building thinner spacers for our diluate output channel fig s14 also the thickness of cation exchange membrane cem chen et al 2013 kim et al 2017 tedesco et al 2018 and porous membrane pm alkhudhiri et al 2012 may have significant roles in a desalination performance but perhaps only in high salinity feed conditions where resistance of membrane becomes comparable with that of main channel from fig 6 it is obvious that the power consumption for c f 10 g l tests were dominated by the inefficiency of desalting the last 30 of the remaining salts as one can see that power consumption drastically increased when srratio is increased from 70 to 95 this is also observed in c f 35 g l seawater salinity cases which means that the key inefficiency in electromembrane desalination processes icp or ed is the removal of salt from low salinity conditions ideas like edi electrodeionization arar et al 2014 multiscale pore membranes kwon et al 2018 or minimizing spacer thickness could be used to address this problem specifically notwithstanding the srrate of continuous desalination single stage by our rf icp is almost 5 fold higher compared with earlier batch ed 4 stage works mcgovern et al 2014 i e area efficiency is 5 fold higher while using only a small size membrane 15 cm 5 cm 75 cm2 such a high membrane efficiency high current density or srrate at acceptable power consumption would be necessary for many applications including small scale portable desalination devices 3 5 cost analysis for the purpose of evaluating the efficiency and merit of desalination technology it is more appropriate to calculate a total water cost composed of capital and operating costs to evaluate a validity of technology in a practical desalination application in this study two techno economic analyses are applicable partial desalination of brine 70 g l for waste treatment and total desalination of brackish water 10 g l and seawater 35 g l for drinking water first of all we focus on how an optimized water cost changes to treat a brine 70 g l as previously reported choi 2017 kim et al 2017 the simplified water cost model is applied for a water cost optimization see section 5 in esi 1 for details the capital cost is mainly determined by equipment lifespan and its cost an increase in the equipment lifespan determined by the lifespan of membrane can reduce capital cost even the lifespan of commercial membrane is guaranteed for 10 years according to the specifications provided by the membrane manufacturer mega ralex membranes for ed edi and ef coating 2018 suez 2020 edr systems 2017 it is widely known that ion exchange membranes have a lifetime of 4 10 years while maintaining selective permeability depending on the type of feed solution and the degree of fouling electrodialysis and electrodialysis reversal 2010 protocols for electrodialysis membrane selection membrane fouling and design 2017 strathmann et al 2013 the equipment cost is dominated by a membrane cost and its size in the electromembrane desalination especially the membrane size length is correlated with the energy efficiency as the length increases energy efficiency improves therefore operating costs are reduced but capital costs increase the energy electricity cost is a key factor in determining operating costs the selection of electricity cost is also crucial to optimize water costs because the electricity cost varies according to local conditions and is widely distributed between 0 025 and 0 325 kwh world energy prices 2018 in fig 7 the water cost analysis has performed to understand how water costs change with different scenarios including equipment size lifespan and electricity cost we import an experiment data from the previous reported model tri icp which has bigger membrane size 180 cm2 length 30 cm width 6 cm and compared with rf icp prototype with 75 cm2 length 15 cm width 5 cm tri icp shows better energy efficiency of 0 31 40 wh l than rf icp with energy efficiency of 0 33 75 wh l to achieve the same srratio ranging from 10 to 70 with u d 0 5 mm s kim et al 2017 the water cost is optimized to the lowest cost value of the sum of capital and operating cost the lifespan and electricity cost are set as 5 and 10 years 0 05 and 0 1 kwh respectively the optimized water cost for rf icp is 4 01 m3 1 69 and 2 32 m3 for capital and operating cost respectively with a lifespan of 10 years and an electricity cost of 0 1 kwh it can be reduced to 2 57 m3 0 85 and 1 72 m3 for capital and operating cost respectively with a reduced electricity cost of 0 05 kwh albeit the same lifespan the changes in capital and operating cost provide changes in water cost but also system characteristics and their applications the operating costs determined by electricity costs used for both rf icp and tri icp increase dramatically with increasing srratio indicating that all icp desalination is basically power intensive process regardless of membrane size generally coastal sea water reverse osmosis ro process discharges 65 85 g l of brine waste to a coast afrasiabi and shahbazali 2011 greenlee et al 2009 the disposal to surface water can save a wastewater treatment cost but it causes increase in a seawater salinity e g seawater salinity around arabian gulf exceeded 40 ppt meshkati and tabibzadeh 2016 smith et al 2007 this higher seawater salinity causes a significant marine environment problem because the salinity of 40 45 ppt appears to cause a death of exposed marine plants roberts et al 2010 the brine wastes can be disposed by reinjection into underground formations or via evaporation pond 4 7 18 9 m3 or recycled by a post treatment such as mechanical vapor recompression mvr 22 39 m3 slutz et al 2012 this additional cost should be considered to be part of the desalination costs and it accounts for the majority of the water cost calculations because ro ranging 0 71 to 0 91 m3 has little change in cost addams et al 2009 in order to reduce total water cost both ro desalination and waste brine treatment the partial desalination by rf icp is applied to reduce the volume of waste from ro fig 8 a illustrates ro process incorporated rf icp and waste treatment process to calculate the total water cost including ro waste treatment and rf icp costs we applied ro cost model developed previously nayar et al 2017 fixed waste treatment costs and rf icp cost model with lifespan of 10 years and electricity cost of 0 05 kwh the feed salinity c f is set as a seawater salinity 35 g l and the brine salinity c r o b from ro is fixed as 70 g l the brine q r o b is partially desalinated by rf icp and the produced water q i c p p and brine q i c p b by rf icp are recirculated into the ro inflow q r o i n and discharged to waste treatment respectively the feed salinity for ro c r o i n can change depend on the srratio of rf icp desalination but it is limited to 30 45 g l which can be applied to typical ro fritzmann et al 2007 in fig 8b the total water cost varies with change in ro rf icp and waste treatment costs as the srratio of rf icp increases the ro recovery rate increases and q i c p b decreases resulting in saving the total water cost additionally the total water cost can be changed by the waste treatment cost the cost analysis performed to assess the feasibility of rf icp desalination with changes in wastewater treatment costs fig 8c the increase in waste treatment costs dominates the total cost variation but the increase in the srratio of rf icp reduces the total water cost the rf icp begins to show that it is cost effective reducing total water cost by 13 from 3 85 m3 without rf icp to 3 26 m3 with 30 of srratio by rf icp when wastewater treatment cost is 3 m3 above the waste treatment cost of 3 m3 the total cost decreases rapidly at the beginning of srratio increase and saturated a certain cost regardless of srratio increase in the case of 8 m3 of wastewater treatment cost the decrease in total water cost is approximately saturated with 6 07 m3 with 50 of srratio by rf icp reducing the total water cost by 31 from 8 86 m3 without rf icp for the total desalination for drinking water 95 of srr condition for 10 and 35 g l of feed water is chosen to obtain optimized water costs the optimized water costs are 4 44 m3 0 84 m3 of capital cost and 3 60 m3 of operating cost with 27 9 kw m3 of power consumption and 7 19 m3 1 69 m3 of capital cost and 5 50 m3 of operating cost with 55 0 kw m3 of power consumption for 10 and 35 g l of feed water respectively it can be applicable to portable desalination due to the small dimension and weight of device overall size and weight of device are 290 130 100 mm3 and 2 kg respectively but it is still a power intensive process generally requiring high operating cost 4 conclusion herein we demonstrate the feasibility of rf icp desalination system by a portable scale rf icp device 75 cm2 of membrane area the performance of rf icp desalination is evaluated with various flow rate 0 83 6 67 ml min per spacer and feed salinity 10 70 g l conditions to achieve fixed srratios the rf icp desalination improved a membrane efficiency with a higher srrate for a partial desalination and achieved a similar power consumption compared to batch ed even the membrane area of rf icp was 3 times smaller than the batch ed we carried out techno economic analysis of the rf icp desalination for two application scenarios of partial desalination of brine 70 g l where a relatively favorable cost picture emerged even if the experimental system used for the analysis was a lab scale system with small membrane area with much room for further optimization remaining e g stack thickness reduction incorporation of mixing promotor or porosity variation in porous membrane while the study presented here is only a proof of concept demonstration it is clearly validating a novel method to increase the energy efficiency of any electromembrane desalination processes applicable to ed as well as icp by manipulating the feed flow in an intelligent manner and to increase membrane efficiency to enable smaller

18799,pharmaceutical wastewater often contains high levels of antibiotic residues and serves as an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes args however the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants pwwtps were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and args here we designed a lab scale simulation reactor including up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o and four separate advanced oxidation processes aops i e uv ozonation fenton and fenton uv to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 args from a real pharmaceutical wastewater the results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d operation among all treatment units uasb provided the greatest contribution 85 8 16 1 for the removal of 18 antibiotics the mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin 62 5 80 9 while sorption to sludge 73 9 was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in uasb meanwhile the substantial decrease of arg absolute abundance log reduction by 0 1 3 1 fold through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment 1 2 3 8 log units from the influent to the a o unit fenton uv combination was the most effective aop for the removal of args finally the optimum operating conditions for the removal of args using fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high arg elimination overall this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real pwwtps for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and args graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical wastewater up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o advanced oxidation processes aops antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args 1 introduction as a particularly important class of pharmaceuticals antibiotics have been extensively used in clinical medicine and veterinary practice for treating bacterial infections fritz and zuo 2007 venieri et al 2017 it was reported that approximate 100 000 to 200 000 tons of antibiotics were consumed per annum in the world and the most of these used antibiotics were discharged into the environment as the parent compounds or their active metabolites kümmerer 2009 kümmerer and henninger 2003 yan et al 2013 as a result antibiotics have been frequently detected in diverse environments including soil water manure sludge and etc göbel et al 2005 kümmerer 2009 kim and carlson 2007 which are accelerating the development and spread of antibacterial resistance in the environment dodd 2012 ferro et al 2015b resulting in an increased risk to human disease control and prevention chang et al 2010 wastewaters from pharmaceutical manufactures often contain extremely high concentrations of antibiotics antibiotic resistance bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args baker austin et al 2006 li et al 2016 pal

increasing evidence showed that the biological treatment processes that widely applied in both urban wastewater treatment plants and pwwtps might have contributed to the proliferation of arb and args in the process of wastewater treatment fatta kassinos et al 2011 manaia et al 2016 therefore the supplement of various advanced chemical oxidation processes aops at the final stage of wastewater treatment systems is gaining increased attention prior studies have demonstrated that the substantial reactive oxygen species ros produced in various aops e g uv irradiation ozonation fenton and fenton uv processes can not only effectively destroy antibiotics but also can deactivate the microbes by damaging their nucleic acids and membranes giannakis et al 2016a 2016b 2018a michael kordatou

experiments were performed at a constant inlet ozone concentration of 50 mg l which was commonly used in the disinfection experiments becerra castro et al 2016 sousa et al 2017 both uv disinfection and ozonation experiments were performed at a ph of 7 0 0 2 for the fenton oxidation feso4 7h2o purity 99 was used to obtain fe2 concentration of 0 5 mol l and then h2o2 30 w w solution at fe2 h2o2 molar ratio of 1 10 was added to initiate the reaction at ph 3 0 for 2 h the experimental conditions used in the fenton reaction were optimized from the orthogonal test in a preliminary experiment tables s3 and s4 in the fenton uv process h2o2 and fe2 at a molar ratio of 10 1 were combined with 165 mj cm2 uv exposure to conduct treatment for 2 h three replicated treated wastewater samples in different aops systems were collected and then filtered through 0 22 μm filter for the following analyses the optimal conditions for removing args in fenton reaction were obtained by conducting experiments at different fenton doses 1 mmol l h2o2 0 1 mmol l fe2 10 mmol l h2o2 1 0 mmol l fe2 25 mmol l h2o2 2 5 mmol l fe2 35 mmol l h2o2 3 5 mmol l fe2 and 50 mmol l h2o2 5 0 mmol l fe2 and reaction times 10 30 60 90 120 and 150 min 2 3 quantification of antibiotics and args sample pretreatment and solid phase extraction for both wastewater and sludge samples were developed according to the previous studies hou et al 2015 2016 luo et al 2011 yang et al 2011 2012 as detailed in the supplemental text s2 18 antibiotics were analyzed using ultrahigh liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry uplc esi ms ms in positive ion mode using waters acquity uplc and xevo tq ms waters usa hou et al 2015 2016 detailed analysis of the antibiotics and analytical method validation are described in the supplemental text s3 tables s1 and s2 the quantification of 16s rrna gene and 10 frequently detected args i e sul1 sul2 teto tetq tetm tetw qnrd ermb bla oxa 1 and bla oxa 10 in pwwtps was according to the previous studies mao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhai et al 2016 for pcr reactions the threshold cycle ct values of args were correlated with the standard curves to estimate the gene copy number ferro et al 2016 2017 and a ct of 35 was used as the limit of detection both absolute and relative abundance of genes were measured in this study the primer sequences and additional information of detection args were provided in text s4 table s5 and table s6 in si 2 4 mass balance calculation for exploring the removal mechanisms for antibiotics considering the target antibiotics were relatively low volatility table s7 the degradation including photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation and sorption to sludge were proposed as two major removal mechanisms for the targeted antibiotics in the studied reactor guerra et al 2014 hou et al 2016 thus the mass balance of each antibiotic in uasb unit a o tank and secondary clarifier activated sludge process can be calculated using the following equation guerra et al 2014 minf meff mdeg msor where minf mg d is the antibiotic mass per day in the influent of each treatment unit which was calculated from the mean flow rate l d mean influent antibiotics concentration mg l meff mg d is the antibiotic mass per day in the effluent of each treatment unit which was equal to the mean flow rate l d mean effluent antibiotics concentration mg l msor mg d is the mass per day of the antibiotic that sorbed to the sewage sludge which was calculated from the mean concentration of residual antibiotics in sewage sludge per day mg d kg the mean mass of mixed liquor suspended solids per volume kg l the reactor volume l mdeg was estimated by subtracting meff and msor from minf thus represented the degraded antibiotic mass per day gao et al 2012b guerra et al 2014 the contribution proportion of each antibiotic removal mechanism was assessed by dividing meff mdeg and msor by the minf respectively 2 5 statistical analysis correlation analysis paired samples t test one way analysis of variance anova and anova for factorial design were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 software with p 0 05 as the significance cut off standard deviation sd was applied to measure how far the data deviates from the mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of selected antibiotics and args in wastewater samples after 180 d treatment with the designed reactor we achieved relatively high removal efficiencies of cod 96 tn 85 nh3 n 90 tss 97 and turbidity 95 the average concentrations of all detected antibiotics and args in wastewater samples collected from various stages of treatment are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding each antibiotic and arg concentrations are displayed in fig 3 in the raw influent a total of 18 antibiotics including six sulfonamides smx scp sd sm2 tmp and sdm four tetracyclines tc otc doxy and ctc three quinolones cip ofl and enr three macrolides etm rox and tyl and two β lactams amp and clx were detected fig 3a most detected antibiotics smx scp sd tmp doxy ctc cip enr ofl rox and amp were in the μg l level while relatively lower concentrations ng l level were detected for sm2 sdm etm tyl and clx fig 3a otc 22 4 1 5 mg l and tc 8 0 3 5 mg l were two dominant antibiotics accounting for 96 8 of the total detected antimicrobials fig 3a after the secondary treatments with conventional activated sludge processes i e uasb a o and secondary clarifier the average concentration of all antibiotics decreased from 1 74 5 33 103 μg l to 1 36 4 49 102 μg l while 16 of 18 antibiotics were still detectable in the effluent samples fig 2a however most of the antibiotics were fully eliminated after tertiary treatment with the aops that respectively employed uv o3 fenton and fenton uv technology fenton uv achieved the best removal efficiency for the studied antibiotics resulting in only 5 antibiotics were detectable in final effluent samples fig 3a regardless of aop type otc still was the dominant antibiotic in the final effluent followed by tc in general all 18 antibiotics were efficiently eliminated the removal efficiency 99 8 through the designed bench scale simulation reactor fig 2a indicating the feasibility of our simulator system for treating pharmaceutical wastewater that contained high concentrations of antibiotics the average absolute abundance of 10 arg subtypes sul1 sul2 teto tetq tetm tetw qnrd ermb bla oxa 1 and bla oxa 10 in raw influent was 4 80 12 84 105 copies ml with the absolute abundance of each arg in the range of 2 34 0 24 103 to 5 82 0 16 106 copies ml the mean absolute abundance of all args in wastewater samples increased significantly by 1 2 3 8 log units through uasb and a o units p 0 001 implicating biological treatment processes might contribute to resistance proliferation fig 2b however no significant change of the average relative abundance of all args defined as arg copy number per copy number of 16s rrna from the raw influent to the a o effluent indicated that arg enrichment in the aforementioned biological processes could be due to the proliferation of arb prior studies have demonstrated that biological treatment units could be the hotspots for arg dissemination given that rich nutrients and dense bacteria in activated sludge may provide the suitable environments for the horizontal gene transfer among different bacterial species guo et al 2017 ju et al 2019 subsequently significant reductions of the average absolute abundance of all args and 16s rrna gene p 0 001 were observed from the a o unit to the aops treatment units fig 2b fenton uv was still the best aop for the removal of args genes ermb and tetq were undetectable after the aops treatments fig 3b therefore the designed simulation reactor was also effective on the decrease of arg proliferation that happened in conventional wastewater treatment plants interestingly the mean relative abundance of all args did not significantly change through the entire treatment process indicating the observed arg removal in the later units could be related to the elimination of bacterial biomass 3 2 contribution of different treatment units on antibiotic removal the mean removal efficiency of all antibiotics from influent to the effluent in each operation unit was also calculated yielding 80 7 17 9 in uasb 43 4 42 7 in a o 28 6 29 2 in the secondary clarifier 52 4 33 2 in flocculation tank and 55 6 33 2 94 3 7 3 in different aops fig 4 a regarding individual antibiotic up to 85 0 of scp tmp sdm doxy ctc cip enr ofl etm amp and clx were eliminated in uasb reactor above 77 0 of scp doxy ctc and etm were removed in a o process the flocculation process efficiently removed 83 7 of otc 91 0 of doxy 100 of rox and clx except for uv treatment the other three aops could remove approximate 99 0 of tc and otc fig 4a further we assessed the elimination contribution ec of each treatment stage for the total removal of selected antibiotics by dividing the antibiotic removal in each unit by the total removal in the simulation reactor li et al 2013 as shown in fig 4b uasb provided the greatest contribution for the removal of the investigated antibiotics average ec value up to 85 8 16 1 followed by a o and flocculation units ec value of 6 2 6 6 and 7 6 14 7 respectively overall above 91 0 of target antibiotics were removed in the uasb and a o units suggesting these two biological treatment processes played critical roles in the elimination of antibiotics in our simulation reactor it was worth noting that certain negative removal efficiencies and elimination contributions were observed for some specific antibiotics e g sd tmp ofl doxy etc in a o or secondary clarifier tank which could be attributed to the release of sludge adsorbed antibiotics to water phase resulting from the shift of the sorption equilibrium similar phenomena were also observed in some municipal wastewater treatment plants gao et al 2012b li et al 2013 3 3 antibiotic mass flow and removal mechanisms in the simulated pharmaceutical wastewater treatment system mass fraction of each removal mechanism for the detected antibiotics was calculated in fig 5 in the uasb reactor the mass loss due to the degradation for the selected tetracyclines tc otc doxy and ctc was 63 7 2 5 while sludge adsorption only accounted for 26 4 6 8 guerra et al 2014 also found that over 60 of tetracycline was removed by biodegradation in a real municipal wastewater treatment plant in michigan usa however substantial removal of tetracyclines mainly by sorption to sludge was observed as well in previous studies batt et al 2007 kim et al 2005 the discrepant results were possibly due to degradation and adsorption processes were largely affected by various operating parameters which were often diverse in the different real sewage treatment plants gao et al 2012a guerra et al 2014 jia et al 2012 similarly approximately 74 0 of enr were absorbed to activated sludge while the mass fraction of degradation was less than 18 0 suggesting that adsorption to sludge was also the predominant removal mechanism for enr this observation was consistent with previous studies that quinolones were mainly adsorbed to activated sludge during biological treatment and biodegradation was of minor importance in the removal of quinolones in wwtps batt et al 2007 giger et al 2003 jia et al 2012 li and zhang 2010 lindberg et al 2006 in contrast approximately 81 0 of the total mass loss of smx was due to degradation sorption to sludge and discharge along with effluent only accounted for 5 9 and 13 2 respectively fig 5 this result was in agreement with previous studies that sulfonamides were mainly removed by biodegradation li et al 2013 pérez et al 2005 yang et al 2011 degradation as major removal mechanism was also found for amp in which the contribution of degradation 76 8 was much higher than sorption 14 5 and effluent 8 8 fig 5 interestingly compared to sorption and degradation that accounted for 3 0 and 25 0 respectively a higher proportion of rox 72 0 was observed in the effluent suggesting that this antibiotic was persistent and may pass through uasb unit in the real pwwtps similar degradation as the predominant process responsible for the removal of tetracyclines and amp were also observed in a o tank fig 5 but the other three antibiotics smx enr and rox were found at a higher proportion in the effluent 82 9 128 8 in secondary clarifier tank mass balance analyses indicated that most antibiotics survived during the passage of the treatment process and were retained in the treated effluent 44 it was noted that the mass of smx and amp in the treated effluent of a o tank and secondary clarifier were at least 1 03 times higher than those in the influent respectively indicating the release of sludge adsorbed antibiotics to water phase during these two treatment processes in summary there were suites of factors that may determine the removal mechanism of antibiotics in uasb a o and secondary clarifier units such as the physicochemical properties of antibiotics and the characteristics of activated sludge in the above treatment units interestingly we found that removal mechanisms for some antibiotics in uasb reactor were consistent with their sludge sorption coefficients kd which were widely used to describe the reversible sorptive exchange of chemicals between water and sludge tolls 2001 for example quinolones and tetracyclines exhibited higher kd values 290 8058 l kg 1 among five detected antibiotic classes the corresponding higher adsorption potential to activated sludge was also found for these two classes of antibiotics le minh et al 2010 li and zhang 2010 li et al 2013 thiele bruhn 2003 vice versa lower kd values 32 6 52 l kg 1 of sulfonamides and macrolides also had greater potential to remain in the effluent joss et al 2006 li et al 2013 mcardell et al 2003 we further investigated the effect of cod loads and antibiotic concentrations on the removal of tetracyclines in the uasb unit as shown in supplemental fig s1a the average removal efficiency of detected tetracyclines tc otc ctc and doxy increased with the increase of cod loads from 3769 to 6528 mg l in raw influent and statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the removal of tetracyclines and cod loads r 0 853 p 0 05 meanwhile tetracycline removals were also significantly positive correlations with the abundance of 16s rrna gene r 0 977 p 0 05 fig s1a thus it can be inferred that biodegradation played a critical role in the removal of tetracyclines and the increasing of cod concentrations in influent could bring more nutrients for the growth of bacteria indicated by the corresponding positive correlation between cod loads and 16s rrna gene abundance which in turn further enhance tetracyclines removal otherwise the negative relationships between 16s rrna gene abundance and tetracyclines elimination with total antibiotics concentrations also provided evidence that high concentration of antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth resulting in the decrease of tetracyclines removal fig s1b 3 4 the performance of advanced oxidation technologies aops on arg removal aops have been applied as tertiary treatments to enhance the quality of the effluent of pwwtps however there is a lack of systematic studies that explore whether aops are effective in decreasing the threat posed by both antibiotics and args michael kordatou et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 consequently this study seeks to assess the ability of different strategies of aops i e uv irradiation ozonation fenton and fenton uv for the removal of args and 16s rrna from wastewater of pwwtps fig 6 among the tested aops the combination of fenton and uv i e fenton uv followed by fenton oxidation were the most efficient approaches for simultaneous removal of both 16s rrna and args decreased by 1 1 6 0 log units whereas uv disinfection and ozonation held only limited potential to eliminate 16s rrna and args 0 8 1 6 log reduction particularly tetq and ermb with relatively low initial abundance 1 8 0 1 103 to 2 7 0 2 103 were reduced to values below the limit of detection after fenton associated treatments while these two genes were still detectable after o3 or uv treatment fenton uv treatment was slightly more efficient in reducing args than that of fenton oxidation alone p 0 05 fig 6a similarly effective removal of 16s rrna sul1 tetx tetg and inti1 by fenton driven oxidation has been reported in previous studies and no regrowth of args harboring hosts e coli methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and salmonella spp after the inactivation suggested the irreversible inactivation from fenton driven process giannakis et al 2018a ndounla et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 this might be due to that the h2o2 and fe2 could diffuse into the cytoplasm and initiate an intracellular fenton reaction leading to dna damage mutagenesis and cell death ferro et al 2015a giannakis et al 2018b imlay 2003 michael kordatou et al 2018 mishra and imlay 2012 regarding the combination of uv and fenton more oh radicals would be produced by h2o2 upon irradiation with uv light thus more complete damage might be likely liu et al 2015 the less efficient reduction of args by uv or o3 disinfection could be attributed to the resistance of host bacteria to those two aops alexander et al 2016 auerbach et al 2007 becerra castro et al 2016 guo et al 2013 mckinney and pruden 2012 michael kordatou et al 2018 sousa et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 in addition the cell death by ozone is primarily related to cell surface damage and the inner molecular components such as args may be less affected by such oxidants cho et al 2010 michael kordatou et al 2018 although uv radiation could be directly absorbed by dna and thus cause nucleic acid modifications and arg damage uv induced damage in genetic material may be repaired by dna recombination of host bacteria hu et al 2017 lee et al 2004 li et al 2010 mckinney and pruden 2012 michod et al 2008 oguma et al 2001 sancar 2016 overall further studies are needed to verify the potential molecular mechanisms for arg removal in different aops considering that fenton driven oxidation presented the best performance for the removal of 16s rrna and args from pharmaceutical wastewater a further study was conducted to establish the optimum conditions for the fenton process obviously the fenton dose level and the reaction time play critical roles in the arg removal thus synthetic matrices were built between these two factors to predict the optimal condition of the fenton reaction as a result the removal efficiency of args and 16s rrna gene increased considerably with increasing the fenton dose or reaction time and this study also found that the damage of args requires greater fenton dose or longer time than the inactivation of 16s rrna gene fig 6b for instance under the same condition of fenton dose of 1 mmol l and reaction time of 60 min 16s rrna genes were removed above 90 while only 23 4 52 4 of args was removed fig 6b similar results have also reported by karaolia et al 2017 who found that after the treatment with the solar fenton the total dna concentration in water samples was reduced by 97 0 while sul1 and ermb did not significantly change these results plausibly indicated that the damage of args might require more energy in comparison with inactivation of 16s rrna gene mckinney and pruden 2012 however further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms on the basis of the obtained findings we systematically assessed the dose and time required to achieve a certain removal efficiency of all 10 args e g 30 50 70 90 and 95 using color fill contour map that contained 300 data points fig 7 a generally above 95 removal for target args were observed under the maximum fenton dose 50 mmol l and reaction time 150 min obviously both removal efficiency of args and the cost of reagents should be considered in the design of fenton mediated aops in the actual pwwtps it would be advantageous to choose the optimum combinations of time and dose on the contour lines that represented the higher removal efficiency of args thus the boundary points on the contour line that exhibited 95 of arg removal were extracted to show the relationship between reaction time and arg removal efficiency at the minimum fenton dose of 32 2 mmol l fig 7b and the relationship between fenton dose and arg removal efficiency at the minimum reaction time of 50 0 min fig 7c respectively when the pollution equivalent daily sewage treatment volume arg concentration and arg removal efficiency are same choosing a relatively low dose of fenton reagent could reduce the operational costs mainly from chemical reagents but it requires longer reaction time and larger aop tank which will increase the initial construction cost whereas choosing a short reaction time could reduce the initial construction cost however it enhances the operational costs from the greater dose level of fenton reagents therefore daily sewage treatment volume arg removal efficiency and cost should be taken into consideration to select the optimal combination of fenton dose and reaction time 4 conclusion uasb a o combined with aops have been applied in our lab scale simulation reactor which was proven to be efficient to simultaneously remove antibiotics and args from pharmaceutical wastewater the biological treatment units provided larger contributions for the elimination of investigated antibiotics while args were mainly removed by aops among the tested aops fenton uv process followed by fenton oxidation were the most efficient approaches for simultaneous removal of total bacteria and args in the pharmaceutical wastewater and the selection of the optimum condition for the fenton oxidation can refer to the color fill contour map constructed from the combinations of fenton dose arg removal and reaction time this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real pwwtps for

18799,pharmaceutical wastewater often contains high levels of antibiotic residues and serves as an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes args however the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants pwwtps were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and args here we designed a lab scale simulation reactor including up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o and four separate advanced oxidation processes aops i e uv ozonation fenton and fenton uv to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 args from a real pharmaceutical wastewater the results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d operation among all treatment units uasb provided the greatest contribution 85 8 16 1 for the removal of 18 antibiotics the mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin 62 5 80 9 while sorption to sludge 73 9 was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in uasb meanwhile the substantial decrease of arg absolute abundance log reduction by 0 1 3 1 fold through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment 1 2 3 8 log units from the influent to the a o unit fenton uv combination was the most effective aop for the removal of args finally the optimum operating conditions for the removal of args using fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high arg elimination overall this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real pwwtps for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and args graphical abstract image 1 keywords pharmaceutical wastewater up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o advanced oxidation processes aops antibiotics antibiotic resistance genes args 1 introduction as a particularly important class of pharmaceuticals antibiotics have been extensively used in clinical medicine and veterinary practice for treating bacterial infections fritz and zuo 2007 venieri et al 2017 it was reported that approximate 100 000 to 200 000 tons of antibiotics were consumed per annum in the world and the most of these used antibiotics were discharged into the environment as the parent compounds or their active metabolites kümmerer 2009 kümmerer and henninger 2003 yan et al 2013 as a result antibiotics have been frequently detected in diverse environments including soil water manure sludge and etc göbel et al 2005 kümmerer 2009 kim and carlson 2007 which are accelerating the development and spread of antibacterial resistance in the environment dodd 2012 ferro et al 2015b resulting in an increased risk to human disease control and prevention chang et al 2010 wastewaters from pharmaceutical manufactures often contain extremely high concentrations of antibiotics antibiotic resistance bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args baker austin et al 2006 li et al 2016 pal et al 2015 however conventional pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants pwwtps were not specifically designed for the removal of these emerging contaminants thus current pwwtps commonly achieved low removal efficiencies for antibiotics arb and args al jassim et al 2015 auerbach et al 2007 chang et al 2010 gao et al 2012a 2012b li et al 2013 yang et al 2011 zuo and lin 2007 meanwhile increasing evidence showed that the biological treatment processes that widely applied in both urban wastewater treatment plants and pwwtps might have contributed to the proliferation of arb and args in the process of wastewater treatment fatta kassinos et al 2011 manaia et al 2016 therefore the supplement of various advanced chemical oxidation processes aops at the final stage of wastewater treatment systems is gaining increased attention prior studies have demonstrated that the substantial reactive oxygen species ros produced in various aops e g uv irradiation ozonation fenton and fenton uv processes can not only effectively destroy antibiotics but also can deactivate the microbes by damaging their nucleic acids and membranes giannakis et al 2016a 2016b 2018a michael kordatou et al 2015 ribeiro et al 2015 rizzo et al 2013 suss et al 2009 taken fenton process as an example hydroxyl radicals oh generated rapidly from the decomposition of h2o2 catalyzed by fe2 can kill multiple bacterial species bautista et al 2008 burbano et al 2008 giannakis et al 2018a however to date the comprehensive comparison of the fate of antibiotics bacteria and args in the wastewater treatment system that simultaneously using the conventional activated sludge treatment and different aops is still inadequate here we designed a bench scale simulation reactor by the combinations of the conventional up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o secondary clarifier and flocculation tank with four separate aops the fate and removal of antibiotics bacteria and args during the entire treatment process in a real pharmaceutical wastewater was examined in particular the performance of different aops i e uv irradiation ozonation fenton and fenton uv processes in the inactivation of total bacteria and removal of args were discussed emphatically finally the optimum operating conditions that maximize the removal of bacteria and args for fenton disinfection process

si 2 2 pwwtp simulation reactor and sample collection the constructed indoor simulation reactor for treating pharmaceutical wastewater included up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb anoxic oxic tank a o secondary clarifier flocculation tank and an additional treatment system of aops as described in fig 1 the wastewater collected from a real pharmaceutical factory that mainly produced tetracyclines at tianjin china was used as the influent the turbidity of this wastewater was less than 100 nephelometric turbidity units ntu the chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total suspended solids tss were 3750 250 275 75 175 25 and 300 200 respectively the total concentration of 18 tested antibiotics was 30 9 6 3 mg l the activated sludge collected from the aforementioned pharmaceutical factory was pre cultivated in the simulation reactor using followed sludge acclimation process for one month to maintain the stability of the reactor briefly glucose solution at cod content from 1000 mg l to 3500 mg l were successively fed into the reactor and then the pharmaceutical water containing stepwise decreased glucose content volume proportion decreased from 87 5 to 0 were fed into the reactor when the removal efficiency of cod reached stable status 96 prior to the treatment the ph of the real pharmaceutical wastewater was adjusted to 7 0 0 3 to provide a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria to explore the influence of cod loads on the antibiotic removal cod in the raw influent ranged from 3769 to 6528 mg l were adjusted through the addition of glucose to examine the influence of antibiotic concentrations on the removal of tetracyclines the total concentrations of 18 antibiotics ranged from 5 2 to 85 3 mg l were obtained through the dilution of the original pharmaceutical wastewater or the addition of dregs that produced from the same pharmaceutical factory the above influents were continuously pumped into the reactor

treatment the pharmaceutical wastewater indoor simulation system was operated normally for 180 d three replicates of raw influent and treated wastewater samples 1 l at the outlet of each treatment unit were collected as detailed in fig 1 all collected water samples were stored in the glass bottles that were precleaned with 30 methanol and ultra pure water for further use sludge samples with three replicates were collected at the outlet of uasb a o and secondary clarifier units as well for the aops the uv ozonation fenton and fenton uv experiments were respectively carried out in a 1 l

different aops systems were collected and then filtered through 0 22 μm filter for the following analyses the optimal conditions for removing args in fenton reaction were obtained by conducting experiments at different fenton doses 1 mmol l h2o2 0 1 mmol l fe2 10 mmol l h2o2 1 0 mmol l fe2 25 mmol l h2o2 2 5 mmol l fe2 35 mmol l h2o2 3 5 mmol l fe2 and 50 mmol l h2o2 5 0 mmol l fe2 and reaction times 10 30 60 90 120 and 150 min 2 3 quantification of antibiotics and args sample pretreatment and solid phase extraction for both wastewater and sludge samples were developed according to the previous studies hou et al 2015 2016 luo et al 2011 yang et al 2011 2012 as detailed in the supplemental text s2 18 antibiotics were analyzed using ultrahigh liquid chromatography electrospray mass spectrometry uplc esi ms ms in positive ion mode using waters acquity uplc and xevo tq ms waters usa hou et al 2015 2016 detailed analysis of the antibiotics and analytical method validation are described in the supplemental text s3 tables s1 and s2 the quantification of 16s rrna gene and 10 frequently detected args i e sul1 sul2 teto tetq tetm tetw qnrd ermb bla oxa 1 and bla oxa 10 in pwwtps was according to the previous studies mao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 zhai et al 2016 for pcr reactions the threshold cycle ct values of args were correlated with the standard curves to estimate the gene copy number ferro et al 2016 2017 and a ct of 35 was used as the limit of detection both absolute and relative abundance of genes were measured in this study the primer sequences and additional information of detection args were provided in text s4 table s5 and table s6 in si 2 4 mass balance calculation for exploring the removal mechanisms for antibiotics considering the target antibiotics were relatively low volatility table s7 the degradation including photodegradation hydrolysis and biodegradation and sorption to sludge were proposed as two major removal mechanisms for the targeted antibiotics in the studied reactor guerra et al 2014 hou et al 2016 thus the mass balance of each antibiotic in uasb unit a o tank and secondary clarifier activated sludge process can be calculated using the following equation guerra et al 2014 minf meff mdeg msor where minf mg d is the antibiotic mass per day in the influent of each treatment unit which was calculated from the mean flow rate l d mean influent antibiotics concentration mg l meff mg d is the antibiotic mass per day in the effluent of each treatment unit which was equal to the mean flow rate l d mean effluent antibiotics concentration mg l msor mg d is the mass per day of the antibiotic that sorbed to the sewage sludge which was calculated from the mean concentration of residual antibiotics in sewage sludge per day mg d kg the mean mass of mixed liquor suspended solids per volume kg l the reactor volume l mdeg was estimated by subtracting meff and msor from minf thus represented the degraded antibiotic mass per day gao et al 2012b guerra et al 2014 the contribution proportion of each antibiotic removal mechanism was assessed by dividing meff mdeg and msor by the minf respectively 2 5 statistical analysis correlation analysis paired samples t test one way analysis of variance anova and anova for factorial design were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 0 software with p 0 05 as the significance cut off standard deviation sd was applied to measure how far the data deviates from the mean value 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and distribution of selected antibiotics and args in wastewater samples after 180 d treatment with the designed reactor we achieved relatively high removal efficiencies of cod 96 tn 85 nh3 n 90 tss 97 and turbidity 95 the average concentrations of all detected antibiotics and args in wastewater samples collected from various stages of treatment are shown in fig 2 and the corresponding each antibiotic and arg concentrations are displayed in fig 3 in the raw influent a total of 18 antibiotics including six sulfonamides smx scp sd sm2 tmp and sdm four tetracyclines tc otc doxy and ctc three quinolones cip ofl and enr three macrolides etm rox and tyl and two β lactams amp and clx were detected fig 3a most detected antibiotics smx scp sd tmp doxy ctc cip enr ofl rox and amp were in the μg l level while relatively lower concentrations ng l level were detected for sm2 sdm etm tyl and clx fig 3a otc 22 4 1 5 mg l and tc 8 0 3 5 mg l were two dominant antibiotics accounting for 96 8 of the total detected antimicrobials fig 3a after the secondary treatments with conventional activated sludge processes i e uasb a o and secondary clarifier the average concentration of all antibiotics decreased from 1 74 5 33 103 μg l to 1 36 4 49 102 μg l while 16 of 18 antibiotics were still detectable in the effluent samples fig 2a however most of the antibiotics were fully eliminated after tertiary treatment with the aops that respectively employed uv o3 fenton and fenton uv technology fenton uv achieved the best removal efficiency for the studied antibiotics resulting in only 5 antibiotics were detectable in final effluent samples fig 3a regardless of aop type otc still was the dominant antibiotic in the final effluent followed by tc in general all 18 antibiotics were efficiently eliminated the removal efficiency 99 8 through the designed bench scale simulation reactor fig 2a indicating the feasibility of our simulator system for treating pharmaceutical wastewater that contained high concentrations of antibiotics the average absolute abundance of 10 arg subtypes sul1 sul2 teto tetq tetm tetw qnrd ermb bla oxa 1 and bla oxa 10 in raw influent was 4 80 12 84 105 copies ml with the absolute abundance of each arg in the range of 2 34 0 24 103 to 5 82 0 16 106 copies ml the mean absolute abundance of all args in wastewater samples increased significantly by 1 2 3 8 log units through uasb and a o units p 0 001 implicating biological treatment processes might contribute to resistance proliferation fig 2b however no significant change of the average relative abundance of all args defined as arg copy number per copy number of 16s rrna from the raw influent to the a o effluent indicated that arg enrichment in the aforementioned biological processes could be due to the proliferation of arb prior studies have demonstrated that biological treatment units could be the hotspots for arg dissemination given that rich nutrients and dense bacteria in activated sludge may provide the suitable environments for the horizontal gene transfer among different bacterial species guo et al 2017 ju et al 2019 subsequently significant reductions of the average absolute abundance of all args and 16s rrna gene p 0 001 were observed from the a o unit to the aops treatment units fig 2b fenton uv was still the best aop for the removal of args genes ermb and tetq were undetectable after the aops treatments fig 3b therefore the designed simulation reactor was also effective on the decrease of arg proliferation that happened in conventional wastewater treatment plants interestingly the mean relative abundance of all args did not significantly change through the entire treatment process indicating the observed arg removal in the later units could be related to the elimination of bacterial biomass 3 2 contribution of different treatment units on antibiotic removal the mean removal efficiency of all antibiotics from influent to the effluent in each operation unit was also calculated yielding 80 7 17 9 in uasb 43 4 42 7 in a o 28 6 29 2 in the secondary clarifier 52 4 33 2 in flocculation tank and 55 6 33 2 94 3 7 3 in different aops fig 4 a regarding individual antibiotic up to 85 0 of scp tmp sdm doxy ctc cip enr ofl etm amp and clx were eliminated in uasb reactor above 77 0 of scp doxy ctc and etm were removed in a o process the flocculation process efficiently removed 83 7 of otc 91 0 of doxy 100 of rox and clx except for uv treatment the other three aops could remove approximate 99 0 of tc and otc fig 4a further we assessed the elimination contribution ec of each treatment stage for the total removal of selected antibiotics by dividing the antibiotic removal in each unit by the total removal in the simulation reactor li et al 2013 as shown in fig 4b uasb provided the greatest contribution for the removal of the investigated antibiotics average ec value up to 85 8 16 1 followed by a o and flocculation units ec value of 6 2 6 6 and 7 6 14 7 respectively overall above 91 0 of target antibiotics were removed in the uasb and a o units suggesting these two biological treatment processes played critical roles in the elimination of antibiotics in our simulation reactor it was worth noting that certain negative removal efficiencies and elimination contributions were observed for some specific antibiotics e g sd tmp ofl doxy etc in a o or secondary clarifier tank which could be attributed to the release of sludge adsorbed antibiotics to water phase resulting from the shift of the sorption equilibrium similar phenomena were also observed in some municipal wastewater treatment plants gao et al 2012b li et al 2013 3 3 antibiotic mass flow and removal mechanisms in the simulated pharmaceutical wastewater treatment system mass fraction of each removal mechanism for the detected antibiotics was calculated in fig 5 in the uasb reactor the mass loss due to the degradation for the selected tetracyclines tc otc doxy and ctc was 63 7 2 5 while sludge adsorption only accounted for 26 4 6 8 guerra et al 2014 also found that over 60 of tetracycline was removed by biodegradation in a real municipal wastewater treatment plant in michigan usa however substantial removal of tetracyclines mainly by sorption to sludge was observed as well in previous studies batt et al 2007 kim et al 2005 the discrepant results were possibly due to degradation and adsorption processes were largely affected by various operating parameters which were often diverse in the different real sewage treatment plants gao et al 2012a guerra et al 2014 jia et al 2012 similarly approximately 74 0 of enr were absorbed to activated sludge while the mass fraction of degradation was less than 18 0 suggesting that adsorption to sludge was also the predominant removal mechanism for enr this observation was consistent with previous studies that quinolones were mainly adsorbed to activated sludge during biological treatment and biodegradation was of minor importance in the removal of quinolones in wwtps batt et al 2007 giger et al 2003 jia et al 2012 li and zhang 2010 lindberg et al 2006 in contrast approximately 81 0 of the total mass loss of smx was due to degradation sorption to sludge and discharge along with effluent only accounted for 5 9 and 13 2 respectively fig 5 this result was in agreement with previous studies that sulfonamides were mainly removed by biodegradation li et al 2013 pérez et al 2005 yang et al 2011 degradation as major removal mechanism was also found for amp in which the contribution of degradation 76 8 was much higher than sorption 14 5 and effluent 8 8 fig 5 interestingly compared to sorption and degradation that accounted for 3 0 and 25 0 respectively a higher proportion of rox 72 0 was observed in the effluent suggesting that this antibiotic was persistent and may pass through uasb unit in the real pwwtps similar degradation as the predominant process responsible for the removal of tetracyclines and amp were also observed in a o tank fig 5 but the other three antibiotics smx enr and rox were found at a higher proportion in the effluent 82 9 128 8 in secondary clarifier tank mass balance analyses indicated that most antibiotics survived during the passage of the treatment process and were retained in the treated effluent 44 it was noted that the mass of smx and amp in the treated effluent of a o tank and secondary clarifier were at least 1 03 times higher than those in the influent respectively indicating the release of sludge adsorbed antibiotics to water phase during these two treatment processes in summary there were suites of factors that may determine the removal mechanism of antibiotics in uasb a o and secondary clarifier units such as the physicochemical properties of antibiotics and the characteristics of activated sludge in the above treatment units interestingly we found that removal mechanisms for some antibiotics in uasb reactor were consistent with their sludge sorption coefficients kd which were widely used to describe the reversible sorptive exchange of chemicals between water and sludge tolls 2001 for example quinolones and tetracyclines exhibited higher kd values 290 8058 l kg 1 among five detected antibiotic classes the corresponding higher adsorption potential to activated sludge was also found for these two classes of antibiotics le minh et al 2010 li and zhang 2010 li et al 2013 thiele bruhn 2003 vice versa lower kd values 32 6 52 l kg 1 of sulfonamides and macrolides also had greater potential to remain in the effluent joss et al 2006 li et al 2013 mcardell et al 2003 we further investigated the effect of cod loads and antibiotic concentrations on the removal of tetracyclines in the uasb unit as shown in supplemental fig s1a the average removal efficiency of detected tetracyclines tc otc ctc and doxy increased with the increase of cod loads from 3769 to 6528 mg l in raw influent and statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the removal of tetracyclines and cod loads r 0 853 p 0 05 meanwhile tetracycline removals were also significantly positive correlations with the abundance of 16s rrna gene r 0 977 p 0 05 fig s1a thus it can be inferred that biodegradation played a critical role in the removal of tetracyclines and the increasing of cod concentrations in influent could bring more nutrients for the growth of bacteria indicated by the corresponding positive correlation between cod loads and 16s rrna gene abundance which in turn further enhance tetracyclines removal otherwise the negative relationships between 16s rrna gene abundance and tetracyclines elimination with total antibiotics concentrations also provided evidence that high concentration of antibiotics may inhibit bacterial growth resulting in the decrease of tetracyclines removal fig s1b 3 4 the performance of advanced oxidation technologies aops on arg removal aops have been applied as tertiary treatments to enhance the quality of the effluent of pwwtps however there is a lack of systematic studies that explore whether aops are effective in decreasing the threat posed by both antibiotics and args michael kordatou et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 consequently this study seeks to assess the ability of different strategies of aops i e uv irradiation ozonation fenton and fenton uv for the removal of args and 16s rrna from wastewater of pwwtps fig 6 among the tested aops the combination of fenton and uv i e fenton uv followed by fenton oxidation were the most efficient approaches for simultaneous removal of both 16s rrna and args decreased by 1 1 6 0 log units whereas uv disinfection and ozonation held only limited potential to eliminate 16s rrna and args 0 8 1 6 log reduction particularly tetq and ermb with relatively low initial abundance 1 8 0 1 103 to 2 7 0 2 103 were reduced to values below the limit of detection after fenton associated treatments while these two genes were still detectable after o3 or uv treatment fenton uv treatment was slightly more efficient in reducing args than that of fenton oxidation alone p 0 05 fig 6a similarly effective removal of 16s rrna sul1 tetx tetg and inti1 by fenton driven oxidation has been reported in previous studies and no regrowth of args harboring hosts e coli methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and salmonella spp after the inactivation suggested the irreversible inactivation from fenton driven process giannakis et al 2018a ndounla et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 this might be due to that the h2o2 and fe2 could diffuse into the cytoplasm and initiate an intracellular fenton reaction leading to dna damage mutagenesis and cell death ferro et al 2015a giannakis et al 2018b imlay 2003 michael kordatou et al 2018 mishra and imlay 2012 regarding the combination of uv and fenton more oh radicals would be produced by h2o2 upon irradiation with uv light thus more complete damage might be likely liu et al 2015 the less efficient reduction of args by uv or o3 disinfection could be attributed to the resistance of host bacteria to those two aops alexander et al 2016 auerbach et al 2007 becerra castro et al 2016 guo et al 2013 mckinney and pruden 2012 michael kordatou et al 2018 sousa et al 2017 zhuang et al 2015 in addition the cell death by ozone is primarily related to cell surface damage and the inner molecular components such as args may be less affected by such oxidants cho et al 2010 michael kordatou et al 2018 although uv radiation could be directly absorbed by dna and thus cause nucleic acid modifications and arg damage uv induced damage in genetic material may be repaired by dna recombination of host bacteria hu et al 2017 lee et al 2004 li et al 2010 mckinney and pruden 2012 michod et al 2008 oguma et al 2001 sancar 2016 overall further studies are needed to verify the potential molecular mechanisms for arg removal in different aops considering that fenton driven oxidation presented the best performance for the removal of 16s rrna and args from pharmaceutical wastewater a further study was conducted to establish the optimum conditions for the fenton process obviously the fenton dose level and the reaction time play critical roles in the arg removal thus synthetic matrices were built between these two factors to predict the optimal condition of the fenton reaction as a result the removal efficiency of args and 16s rrna gene increased considerably with increasing the fenton dose or reaction time and this study also found that the damage of args requires greater fenton dose or longer time than the inactivation of 16s rrna gene fig 6b for instance under the same condition of fenton dose of 1 mmol l and reaction time of 60 min 16s rrna genes were removed above 90 while only 23 4 52 4 of args was removed fig 6b similar results have also reported by karaolia et al 2017 who found that after the treatment with the solar fenton the total dna concentration in water samples was reduced by 97 0 while sul1 and ermb did not significantly change these results plausibly indicated that the damage of args might require more energy in comparison with inactivation of 16s rrna gene mckinney and pruden 2012 however further studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms on the basis of the obtained findings we systematically assessed the dose and time required to achieve a certain removal efficiency of all 10 args e g 30 50 70 90 and 95 using color fill contour map that contained 300 data points fig 7 a generally above 95 removal for target args were observed under the maximum fenton dose 50 mmol l and reaction time 150 min obviously both removal efficiency of args and the cost of reagents should be considered in the design of fenton mediated aops in the actual pwwtps it would be advantageous to choose the optimum combinations of time and dose on the contour lines that represented the higher removal efficiency of args thus the boundary points on the contour line that exhibited 95 of arg removal were extracted to show the relationship between reaction time and arg removal efficiency at the minimum fenton dose of 32 2 mmol l fig 7b and the relationship between fenton dose and arg removal efficiency at the minimum reaction time of 50 0 min fig 7c respectively when the pollution equivalent daily sewage treatment volume arg concentration and arg removal efficiency are same choosing a relatively low dose of fenton reagent could reduce the operational costs mainly from chemical reagents but it requires longer reaction time and larger aop tank which will increase the initial construction cost whereas choosing a short reaction time could reduce the initial construction cost however it enhances the operational costs from the greater dose level of fenton reagents therefore daily sewage treatment volume arg removal efficiency and cost should be taken into consideration to select the optimal combination of fenton dose and reaction time 4 conclusion uasb a o combined with aops have been applied in our lab scale simulation reactor which was proven to be efficient to simultaneously remove antibiotics and args from pharmaceutical wastewater the biological treatment units provided larger contributions for the elimination of investigated antibiotics while args were mainly removed by aops among the tested aops fenton uv process followed by fenton oxidation were the most efficient approaches for simultaneous removal of total bacteria and args in the pharmaceutical wastewater and the selection of the optimum condition for the fenton oxidation can refer to the color fill contour map constructed from the combinations of fenton dose arg removal and reaction time this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real pwwtps for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and args conflicts of interest the authors declare no conflict of interest declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
