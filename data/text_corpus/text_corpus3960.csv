19800,although human exposure to water aerosols is common in residential showers the droplet distribution patterns generated in showers are not well understood nor is the bacteria released during shower operation in this study a two phase flow particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm was successfully used to characterize the spatial spray pattern and velocity field in two experimental showers one low flow and one high flow in addition the airborne bacteria present in the shower over nearly 5 months of controlled operation was determined for both showers the results indicate that the droplet velocity out of the low flow showerhead which had fewer orifices was significantly higher than that out of the high flow showerhead resulting in a higher aerosol number concentration in the low flow shower and more consistent wetting of the shower wall both showerheads generated droplets in the respirable range and genera of potential health concern were observed in the shower aerosols measured both prior to and following shower operation the study provides one of the first visualizations of droplet spray patterns in residential showers and provides insight into the airborne bacteria present in showers graphical abstract image 1 keywords shower particle tracking velocimetry ptv wetted wall cyclone wwc bacterial aerosols microbiome 1 introduction water sprays are widely used for applications that range from dispersing herbicides and washing down equipment in agricultural or industrial facilities to running showers in residential settings creech et al 2015 zhou et al 2007 water sprays in both occupational and domestic settings may contain harmful chemicals or bioparticles that once aerosolized pose an inhalation risk to human health de man et al 2014 barker et al 2017 angenent et al 2005 the extent to which potentially harmful particles can penetrate the human respiratory system is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the microbial or chemical agents present in the aerosolized water and the size distribution of the aerosolized droplets generated in the spray system thomas 2013 kleinstreuer et al 2008 steiling et al 2014 spray nozzles are often designed to achieve flow patterns needed for a specific industrial application issa 2009 castillo et al 2001 and or to meet water conservation goals via for instance the distribution of low flow showerheads to residents in water stressed municipalities wong et al 2016 watersense a voluntary partnership program sponsored by the u s environmental protection agency epa is both a label for water efficient products and a resource for saving water nationwide if watersense labeled showerheads with a flow rate of 2 0 gpm or less were purchased for all normal showerhead replacements and installed in all new construction the estimated water savings could reach 30 3 billion gallons per year estimated national energy savings could exceed 1 6 billion kwh of electricity and 10 9 million cubic feet mcf of natural gas each year watersense specification for showerheads www epa gov several studies have been conducted to characterize the droplet size and velocity distributions in spray systems ferreira et al 2010 including a few that have focused on aerosols generated during residential shower operation zhou et al 2007 however more advanced techniques now available for visualizing flow patterns kim et al 2011 cloeter et al 2010 have not yet been applied to residential showers in addition the links between showerhead design droplet spray pattern and the bacteria aerosolized in residential showers are not well understood aerosolization of tap water from residential showerheads can generate bioaerosols that contribute to the indoor microbiome prussin and marr 2015 perkins et al 2009 even with disinfection of the water leaving municipal treatment plants tap water used in residential showers contains a diverse microbial community that contributes to the airborne microbial community as well as to the development of biofilms some of which can harbor potential pathogens that are resistant to biocidal treatment taylor et al 2000 soto giron et al 2016 although many microorganisms are not of concern potentially pathogenic bacteria identified in tap water include legionella pneumophila mycobacteria burkholderia streptococcus anaerococcus and corynebacterium bauer et al 2008 falkinham et al 2008 krojgaard et al 2011 hernández garduño and elwood 2012 diaz flores et al 2015 similarly potentially pathogenic bacteria have been detected on shower curtains kelley et al 2004 in biofilms within showerheads feazel et al 2009 as well as in the bioaerosols generated during showering perkins et al 2009 an important consideration when evaluating potential human exposures during showering is the size distribution of the aerosols generated in an experimental shower stall fitted with a manikin to generate a realistic spray pattern zhou et al 2007 confirmed that respirable droplets are generated during showering but the effect of showerhead design was not considered quantitative microbial risk assessment models rely on this type of data as well as other parameters to assess the risk posed by specific pathogens such as legionella spp hamilton and haas 2016 another important feature of shower systems is the velocity of the spray generated and the effect of showerhead design on the distribution of droplets within the shower stall panão and delgado 2014 there has been a concerted effort in many municipalities to replace standard high flow 2 5 gpm 9 46 lpm showerheads with water efficient low flow 2 gpm 7 57 lpm showerheads the effect of showerhead design on the spray pattern generated has not been examined yet although recent advances in two phase flow visualization make such investigations possible particle tracking velocimetry ptv is one such technique that is typically used for visualizations but which can also be used as a tool to measure the motion of individual objects including droplets in experimental images the object tracking capability of the ptv algorithm utilized in the current study has previously been validated for two phase flow measurements kataoka et al 1986 estrada perez 2004 estrada perez and hassan 2010 estrada perez et al 2015 using object characteristics such as size and shape enables the easy discrimination of phases allowing the independent study of liquid and gas velocities within a single image and providing a series of images for statistical analysis of the results the goal of the current study was to assess the effect of two different showerhead designs on the liquid droplet distribution and bacterial release in two full scale experimental showers the experimental shower stalls were identical except one was equipped with a low flow showerhead and the other with a high flow showerhead particle tracking velocimetry experiments were conducted to assess the water droplet size direction and speed in each shower in addition the quantity and composition of the bacterial aerosols released over five months of daily operation were determined in each shower 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental shower unit a 9 m 6 m x 3 m tent within a temperature controlled building was constructed to accommodate a full scale residential dual shower unit sterling by kohler advantage white shower kit model 62040100 0 fig 1 the two shower stalls have a total volume of 2 5 m3 1 52 m width 0 76 m for each stall 0 86 m depth 1 93 m height with a 0 75 m gap between the top of each shower wall and the tent ceiling the two showers were separated in the middle with a vinyl shower curtain also the front opening of each shower unit was covered by a vinyl shower curtain a heimlich maneuver training manikin torso model 1602 simulaids inc saugerties ny was mounted below the showerhead in each shower to create realistic splash effects and droplet flow pattern conditions similar to those found in occupied residential units the showers were equipped with two different showerheads in the left shower was a low flow showerhead delta 1 spray 1 5 gallons per minute gpm water efficient shower head in chrome with 12 nozzles model 52653 pk table 1 fig 1 in the right shower was a high flow showerhead moen 2 5 gpm banbury 5 spray 4 in shower head in spot resist brushed nickel with 69 nozzles model 23045srn table 1 fig 1 the showerheads were positioned at approximately a 30 degree angle above the manikin heads the water supply to the shower consisted of chlorine disinfected groundwater supplied by the city of bryan regarding the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the bryan municipal water that was used to supply the experimental shower units the water had a chlorine residual that ranged between 0 42 and 3 10 ppm with the ph at about 8 5 the detected level for nitrates was 0 41 ppm city of bryan 2014 the temperature of the water in the pipes between individual shower events was measured to be between 23 c 25 c an electric water heater whirlpool e1f20us015v 120 v with a capacity of 20 gallons was used to supply hot water 45 46 c for the shower testing during shower operation the hot water was mixed continuously with cold water for a realistic shower event and to maintain the same water temperature for both sides of the shower 2 2 shower droplet sizing and particle tracking velocimetry ptv an aerodynamic particle sizer aps 3321 tsi inc burnsville mn was used to determine the particle size distribution of the shower aerosols generated during shower operation the aps has an upper size limit of 20 μm and thus was not used to measure the large shower droplets but rather the aerosols in the respirable range less than 10 μm as shown in the studies by zhou et al 2007 cowen and ollison 2006 and xu and weisel 2003 the particle number and mass size distributions of the aerosols generated during shower operation were measured by the aps instrument via 10 replicate measurements 20 s each at two locations one upper and one lower level at about 1 2 m and 0 6 m height in each shower stall as indicated in fig 1 ptv is a full field non intrusive flow visualization technique that can capture information on flow characteristics with high spatial and temporal resolution instantaneous fluid velocities can be determined using the ptv technique by recording the position of images at successive time instants via detection of fluorescent materials suspended in the fluid or by distinguishing the optical characteristics of the fluid e g water droplets the underlying assumption is that these tracers closely follow the fluid motion with minimal lag estrada perez and hassan 2010 however in this study no tracers were required because the droplets could be analyzed based on their reflection of light the accuracy of the ptv technique has been tested against international benchmarks stanislas et al 2005 where the algorithm uncertainties yielded subpixel accuracy of about 0 1056 pixel δt with δt time between frames in each experimental shower stall the water droplet flow from each showerhead was recorded with a high speed high resolution camera photron usa inc san diego ca a total of five trials were completed for each showerhead with two different camera views namely top and bottom views illuminated by a continuous halogen lamp fig 1 the top view covered the upper shower region which included the showerhead and most of the manikin s torso while the bottom view covered the lower part of the manikins and was intended to capture the behavior of the bouncing droplets before hitting the wall or ground the high speed camera was operated at 1000 frames per second for each trial 5000 images were captured and over a period of 4 s 4000 frames were selected 2 3 ptv algorithm to determine the droplet velocity fields from the experimental images a particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm originally developed by hassan et al 1992a 1992b and updated as needed for different applications estrada perez and hassan 2010 was used sensitivity studies performed previously with experimental and synthetic images estrada perez 2004 stanislas et al 2005 provide confirmation that ptv can be used successfully for studying the velocity of particles non intrusively in multiphase flows the main processes of the ptv algorithms are 1 particle detection 2 particle centroid location estimation and 3 particle matching in between consecutive frames particle tracking a detailed description of the ptv algorithm can be obtained from estrada perez 2004 the components of the algorithm that are new or relevant for the present study are described below 2 4 procedure for particle detection the object identification procedure classifies every pixel of the image into two parts pixels part of a particle in this study a droplet and pixels part of the background to this end two discriminatory thresholds are considered the gray scale threshold and the mask correlation threshold the gray scale threshold is used to discern whether or not a pixel is part of a particle based on its gray scale intensity and the mask correlation threshold which is based on the approach of takehara 1998 for this approach it is assumed that the gray scale intensity distribution of an ideal particle has a gaussian distribution with the peak on the center of the particle i e brighter pixels are more likely to be part of a particle and to be located near the center of such particle the gray scale threshold is sensitive to non uniform illumination therefore in some cases a local gray scale threshold is suggested in the present study the illumination distribution was fairly constant throughout the entire image therefore there was no need to implement a local gray scale threshold the mask correlation threshold allows assignment of a cut off value for the mask correlation coefficient the cut off depends on the signal to noise ratio within the experimental images and is a user input threshold to discriminate pixels representing a droplet from those representing the background generally it is obtained with a trial and error process until the algorithm selects only the objects to be tracked in this case until all the droplets are appropriately discriminated from the background pixels with coefficients larger than the cut off value are considered part of a particle the coefficient value depends on the likelihood of a pixel to represent the central pixel of an ideal particle template this ideal template is generated by assuming that the light reflected from an ideal particle will follow a 2d gaussian distribution as follows i x y i 0 exp x x 0 2 a 2 y y 0 2 b 2 2 d 0 2 where i is the image pixel intensity i 0 is the maximum gray scale intensity x 0 y 0 is the centroid location of the ideal particle a and b are shape modification constants to make the ideal particle into ellipsoidal shapes and d 0 is the particle diameter the range of x and y will determine how large the template is typically x and y are larger than d 0 once a correlation value is assigned to each pixel they are combined together in groups of pixels that will form an object part of a particle or part of the background the centroids of the identified particles are calculated using sub pixel interpolation if the interpolation fails the center of gravity method is used to locate the center with sub pixel accuracy 2 5 procedure for particle centroid estimation once the pixel representing the droplet centroid is located gaussian three point sub pixel interpolation and center of gravity methods are used to determine the droplet centroid location plus or minus a sub pixel correction with subpixel accuracy the subpixel corrections εx for the x coordinate and εy for the y coordinate are expressed as ε x log i x 0 1 y 0 log i x 0 1 y 0 2 log i x 0 1 y 0 log i x 0 1 y 0 2 log i x 0 y 0 and ε y log i x 0 y 0 1 log i x 0 y 0 1 2 log i x 0 y 0 1 log i x 0 y 0 1 2 log i x 0 y 0 the particle centroid position with sub pixel accuracy x c y c is calculated using x c x 0 ε x and y c y 0 ε y 2 6 procedure for particle matching in between consecutive frames the particle matching algorithm is based on direct spatial correlation this algorithm computes a correlation coefficient between two consecutives ptv sub images separated in time by δt the correlation coefficient between the two sub images i a and i b with a b dimensions is computed using the following relation c i a i b i 1 a j 1 b i a i j i a i b i j i b i 1 a j 1 b i a i j i a 1 2 i 1 a j 1 b i b i j i b 1 2 where i a and i b are the average intensities of sub images a and b respectively the correlation coefficient will determine which particle in picture b is the best match of a particle in picture a since particle locations are estimated to sub pixel accuracy and the interval between pictures is known an accurate particle velocity estimation is achieved for instance a droplet to be matched on image frame j will have multiple correlation coefficient values assigned each of these values corresponds to candidate droplets in frame j 1 based on these correlation values the droplet pair that shows the highest correlation is estimated to represent the same droplet at different instance of time and at a different location following the successful pairing of the droplets and recalling that the position in frame j and frame j 1 are known together with the time intervals between the frames the velocity components can be calculated with u i d x i d t x i j 1 x i j δ p i v v i d y i d t y i j 1 y i j δ p i v where u i and v i represent the velocities in the stream wise and normal flow directions of droplet i x ij and x ij 1 represent the x coordinate position in frame j and j 1 respectively and y ij and y ij 1 represent the y coordinate position of droplet i in frame j and j 1 2 7 shower operation and microbiome sampling each of the shower units was operated daily for 20 min to mimic routine shower operation for a period of five months the temperature of the water exiting the showers was controlled at 45 46 c and the water temperature measured at the manikins was between 35 and 37 c to model routine occupant activity in residential showers the surface of the manikins in each of the two units was wiped thoroughly with wet soap irish spring prior to each daily shower actuation bioaerosol samples for microbial analysis were collected on the first day of operation as well as periodically throughout the five month operating period the results presented herein focus primarily on the concentration of bacterial aerosol concentrations measured during the study as well as identification of potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa that developed in each shower portable wetted wall cyclone wwc collectors designed in our laboratory and manufactured at tsi inc shoreview mn mcfarland et al 2010 king and mcfarland 2012 were used to collect aerosol samples in each experimental shower for the 100 l min cyclone the cut point the particle size where the collection efficiency is 50 of the aerosol to hydrosol efficiency curve is 1 2 μm ad aerodynamic diameter and the average collection efficiency for single cells and clusters of bacterial particles is 86 over a size range of 1 8 6 μm mcfarland et al 2010 while maintaining the culturability of the collected bacteria king and mcfarland 2012 for each 20 min bioaerosol sampling event a wwc was operated at an air sampling flow rate of 100 l min and a collection liquid inflow rate of 100 μl min to concentrate the airborne particles present in the shower air by a factor of up to 106 in sterile dna free milli q water the collector inlet was positioned near the center point of each shower unit at approximately 0 4 m width 0 4 m depth 1 m height in between the aps sampling locations denoted on fig 1 aerosol samples from each shower unit were collected consecutively starting in the low flow unit and repeating the sampling in the high flow unit aerosol samples were collected with the wwc in each shower unit for a 20 min period before the water in the shower was turned on and for a 20 min period during shower operation to clean the wwc units between sample collections the collector was turned on and the inlet covered with a 102 mm a d filter pall ma for particle free airflow using a 1 ml pipette 100 μl of fresh 10 bleach was skirted into the wwc inlet three times within a 2 min period the bleach was removed by squirting 100 μl of isopropanol five times during a 5 min period into the collector finally 100 μl aliquots of sterile collection liquid 0 01 tween 20 were sprayed five times into the wwc inlet over a 5 min period the collector was then operated with sterile collection liquid for 20 min prior to each sample collection to prevent carryover of collected particles 2 8 analysis of microbial samples the concentration of viable bacteria present in the bioaerosol collection fluid samples was determined by plating 100 μl volumes in appropriate dilutions on difco tryptic soy agar tsa petri dishes becton dickinson co sparks md incubating the plates overnight for 24 h at 37 c and counting the resulting colony forming units cfu on the plates although water microbiology practices commonly use minimal medium and room temperature for long term growth of bacteria in water samples our goal was to enhance the culturability of bacteria that may have been affected during the aerosol collection process and also to stimulate the growth of bacteria that may cause waterborne diseases by incubating the cells on rich medium tsa at 37 c for 24 h liao and shollenberger 2003 in addition the aerosol samples were analyzed by whole cell qpcr an et al 2006 han et al 2010 briefly the bacteria were lysed by heating 1 ml aliquots of the diluted samples in 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes for 15 min at 95 c the tubes were placed on ice for 5 min to quickly chill the suspensions and the cell debris was sedimented by microcentrifuging at 117 g s for 2 min aliquots 3 μl of the supernatants in appropriate dilutions were

the end of each qpcr run to ensure specificity in each sample s amplification 2 9 illumina sequencing the alkaline lysis method was used to extract bacterial dna from all bioaerosol samples zhou et al

sodium acetate at ph 5 2 the proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to a sterile 1 5 ml micro centrifuge tube after the addition of 10 μl of polyacryl carrier pc

al 2007 with the reference database greengenes13 8 16s rrna mcdonald et al 2012 klappenbach et al 2001 for bacteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerosol particle sizing both the low flow and high flow showerheads produced aerosols in the respirable range with mass median diameters mmds ranging from 2 7 to 3 7 μm see table 2 and fig 2 for both the upper and lower sampling locations within each shower a slightly lower mmd was measured in the low flow shower as compared to the high flow shower the range of droplet sizes was similar in both showers with the measured aerosols ranging mostly between 0 5 μm 10 μm fig 2 as noted earlier the aps unit used to measure the aerosol size distribution has an upper cut off of 20 μm and thus does not measure the larger droplet sizes a comparison of the calculated aerosol concentrations from both the lower and upper regions of each shower unit indicates that the shower with the low flow showerhead had significantly higher aerosol number concentrations as compared to the high flow shower in both showers higher droplet concentrations were detected in the lower parts of both shower units likely as a result of the reflected spray off of the manikin obstacle in each shower the increased concentration of particles in the lower portion of the shower stall is likely most relevant for children in showers and should be considered when developing quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra for children although the current study mimicked adult occupants in showers we hypothesize that a child or a shorter object standing in the shower would result in the droplets bouncing off from the top of the object and hitting the opposite wall resulting in a similar albeit lower bounce pattern in the case of an empty shower stall without any object present a gravity driven straight flow could be expected the average aerosol mass concentration for the upper and lower aerosol samples collected in the low flow shower was 5 mg m3 the average for the high flow shower was 3 5 mg m3 these levels are generally lower but on the same order of magnitude as the levels 5 14 mg m3 reported by zhou et al 2007 during hot water operation at similar flow rates in a full scale experimental shower system although the water temperature and shower flow rates in the previous study were similar to the current study the aerosol concentrations were measured at a greater height 1 5 m and the shower was located in a much smaller room 16 7 m3 than that employed in the current study also the mass concentrations measured by zhou et al 2007 were significantly lower e g on the order of 0 1 1 mg m3 when the relative humidity conditions in the room were below 70 nevertheless our results confirm that showers generate aerosols in the respirable range although the size of the aerosol generated is a function of several factors including the configuration of the showers within the room and the sampling location 3 2 ptv measurements results from the ptv algorithm consist of full field velocity fields and corresponding velocity profiles the velocity profiles were extracted from regions of interest by means of virtual line probes this approach provides qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the two showerheads moreover the ptv technique provides insight into the influence of showerhead design on the induced flow patterns and ultimately it allows investigation of the relationship between these flow patterns and the microbiome that develops in each shower fig 3 shows the instantaneous fields of the droplet velocity estimated using the ptv algorithm an animated rendering of the image is provided in supplementary information each vector on these fields represents an individual droplet velocity which can be tracked over time the vectors are color coded to show the magnitude of the droplet velocity these fields are plotted on top of the images representing the manikin s location this helps to interpret the effect that the different shower nozzle characteristics have on the flow structure and distribution of the droplets in the vicinity of the manikins from these fields it is apparent that for both nozzles the velocity at the exit of the nozzles reaches a maximum value thereafter the droplets are directed towards the manikin s body hitting first the manikin s head interestingly the water droplets exit the low flow showerhead at a significantly higher speed compared to the high flow showerhead where the droplet speed is about 50 lower after hitting the manikin multiple droplet trajectories are observed there are elastic scattering collisions between the droplets and the top of the manikin head the droplets gain elevation to later start a free falling descent other droplets tend to adhere to the manikin s surface these slowly slide down the manikin s body which effectively delays their free falling descent until much later when they detach from the manikin the velocity fields show the droplets transitioning from the initial pressure driven velocity just after exiting the shower nozzles to their final velocity induced by gravitational acceleration the maximum droplet velocities observed in fig 3 are within the range of previously measured free falling droplets up to 9 m s as reported by gunn and kinzer 1949 changes in the position of the shower occupants would be expected to change the spray pattern in addition the spray off a manikin could be different than off a human to better understand the general behavior of the shower droplets the droplet streamlines were added to fig 3 see left and right images these streamlines represent the most probable paths that the droplets may follow after being expulsed from the nozzles han and moss 1997 described streamlines during a flow visualization experiment in virtual impactor models similar vortices and streamlines have been generated for the shower droplet pattern fig 3 one interesting finding from these streamline images is the fact that the droplets horizontal displacements on the left shower are consistently larger than those on the right shower droplets in the low flow shower have a higher probability to reach the wall opposite the manikin s location hence different periods of active wetting are expected for each shower wall depending on the type of showerhead used the ptv results indicate that the low flow shower wall is subjected to a greater number of high velocity droplets than the high flow shower wall which is less disturbed during operation these results suggest that the wall biofilm in the low flow shower may be continuously interrupted and broken up by the shower droplets which may yield a less diverse biofilm containing taxa that could tolerate these conditions cense et al 2006 epstein et al 2011 the streamlines also show dramatic differences between the flow patterns in the two units the water droplets exit the 12 nozzles on the low flow showerhead with sufficiently high velocity to bounce off the manikin s body and reach the opposite wall the ptv images show higher droplet concentrations in the low flow unit in agreement with the aps analysis fig 2 indicating that the streams break up earlier resulting in a more turbulent pattern in contrast while the water passing through the perimeter nozzles of the high flow showerhead seem to have higher speed compared to the rest of the droplets exiting the head the particles display a turbulent pattern after bouncing off the manikin and they gravitate towards the shower base before reaching the wall to achieve a better understanding of the droplets in flight behavior we classify the droplets as experiencing three different stages a pressure driven stage b scattering stage and c gravity driven stage the pressure driven stage happens near the droplet generation just after exiting the nozzle at this stage the droplets velocity is high reaching a maximum velocity magnitude of approximately 4 5 m s depending on the showerhead in this stage the droplets horizontal velocity component is significantly larger than the vertical component if the droplet is left undisturbed it will gain vertical acceleration due to gravity however this is not the case in this experiment because of the presence of the manikin in the droplets path when the droplets reach the manikin body the second droplet stage begins namely the scattering stage in the scattering stage the droplets are decelerated through elastic collisions with the manikin as noted above the droplets in this stage may go through different paths for instance the droplets may bounce off the manikin gaining elevation prior to free falling droplets in this path experience a sudden change of direction towards the wall opposite the manikin s location also the droplets experience vertical acceleration due to gravity if droplets do not interact with each other the droplets may undergo a parabolic trajectory starting from the bouncing point and ending either on the shower wall or on the shower floor if droplets in this path interact with each other they may coalesce forming a larger droplet which will change direction and vertical speed due to the added mass another observed droplet path after the droplets interact with the manikin surface is the sliding path in this path droplets do not bounce off the manikin but rather adhere to it as they form a small water layer that covers the surface thereafter droplets of water begin to start falling off the manikin towards the shower floor finally the last droplet stage is the gravity driven stage this stage covers all droplets before they hit the shower wall or floor in the gravity driven stage there is a vertical preferential direction and a continued acceleration due to gravity the velocity at a given height in this stage will depend on the droplet size mass and whether or not the droplets interact with each other during flight due to the complexity of droplet behavior much of the individual droplet interactions are difficult to quantify to simplify interpretation of the velocity field results virtual line probes located at five different positions in each shower fig 4 were used calculate the average magnitude of the droplets velocity v v x 2 v y 2 1 2 passing through each line on the images x n denotes the length in cm along the virtual line profile where the velocity measurements were recorded thus each profile starts at point zero at the beginning of each arrow and extends to a maximum of 60 cm along the length of the probe line probe 1 was selected to analyze the water droplet velocities on their path from each nozzle outlet to the region of first interaction with the manikin line probe 2 is a cross section of the spray exiting the shower nozzle and accounts for droplets traveling down to the region where the shower stall base meets the shower wall forming a lip that retains moisture and supports the formation of a biofilm line probe 3 captures close to body droplet interactions droplets bouncing off the body and dispersing droplets from the showerhead passing the manikin s upper torso line probe 4 captures the droplets dispersing directly from the initial showerhead spray far from body droplet interaction and other droplet patterns finally line probe 5 captures the droplets passing at about the level of a showering occupant s knee prior to reaching the stall base where it impacts and re aerosolizes from the shower floor surface the line probe 1 velocity profiles along the spray centerline and the line probe 2 velocity profiles transverse to the showerhead spray confirm that the velocity of water droplets exiting the low flow showerhead are higher than those exiting the high flow showerhead the velocity of the spray droplets increases rapidly as the spray exits each showerhead as evident in the step function shape of the velocities from position 8 35 cm along line probe 1 in both showers however in both showers the magnitude of the droplet velocities fluctuates after 35 cm along line probe 1 likely due to the interference of water droplets bouncing off of the manikins fig 3 the higher droplet velocities in the low flow shower versus the high flow shower persist as the spray reaches the shower occupant manikin as evident by the velocity profiles along line probe 3 however the step velocity profiles for each shower are slightly shifted along profile 3 suggesting that the droplets are impacting the manikin s heads at slightly different locations along line probe 4 the magnitude of the droplet velocities are similar near the manikin in each shower but ultimately the magnitude of droplet velocities is higher in the low flow shower as the droplets approach the wall opposite the manikin this result is consistent with the observation evident in fig 3 that more spray reaches the opposite wall in the low flow shower as compared to the high flow shower finally the droplet velocities in both showers are similar along horizontal line probe 5 near the bottom of the showers where re aerosolization of droplets from the shower floor is likely occurring the virtual line probes capture the magnitude of the droplets velocity crossing them v v x 2 v y 2 1 2 hence a profile of the average velocity magnitude is provided for each virtual line the average velocity magnitude and the length along each line profile are described with v n m s and x n cm respectively with n 1 2 3 4 5 representing the number of the line probe used 3 3 microbial analysis of the collected aerosols the total concentration of bacteria in cfu m3 and in bacterial genome copy number gcn m3 present in the shower air prior to shower operation and during shower operation were determined for days 0 6 56 and 146 of shower operation to assess the effect of shower operation on total bacteria aerosolized the log of the ratio of airborne bacterial concentrations gcn m3 measured during and immediately prior to shower operation was calculated for each shower a similar process was used to calculate the log of the airborne concentration ratio based on viable bacterial concentrations cfu m3 thus positive concentration ratios indicate that shower operation increased the estimated concentration of bacteria in the shower air whereas negative values indicate that turning on the shower reduced the airborne bacterial concentration as evident in fig 5 the log of the concentration ratios based on gcn varied from approximately 1 0 indicating substantial enrichment of total bacterial concentrations with shower operation to 1 0 indicating a substantial decrease in bacterial concentrations with shower operation removal of some fraction of the aerosol as a result of the shower spray is certainly possible as this is a common approach employed in wet scrubber technologies kim et al 2001 in general however an increase in airborne bacterial concentration was observed more frequently during shower operation than a decrease in concentration especially for the high flow shower this result suggests that bacteria from the shower water itself or biofilms associated with the shower are released during shower operation as has been documented previously perkins et al 2009 during the initial period of operation the log of the cfu and gcn based concentration ratios were in general agreement but more significant differences between the two metrics were observed over time particularly on day 56 and on day 146 low flow shower only an examination of the sequencing results indicates that several genera associated with potential human pathogens were detected in the air of the experimental shower units microorganisms in these genera which included burkholderia streptococcus ralstonia among others have been shown to cause a range of adverse human health effects ranging from pneumonia to skin infections table s2 to calculate the estimated airborne concentration of each of these genera in the showers the relative abundance of each genera in the rarified sequence dataset was multiplied by the total airborne bacterial genome concentration in the air gcn m3 following the method proposed previously by dannemiller et al 2014 the results summarized in table 3 indicate that the peak concentrations for the 14 genera examined varied from 102 to 105 gcn m3 the calculated estimate of the concentration of any given genera in the shower air varied substantially table s3 and no consistent pattern is evident with respect to the effect of shower operation the calculated concentrations of each genera in the experimental shower units before shower operation were not statistically different than those measured after shower operation paired t test of square root transformed data p 0 05 indicating that at least at the genus level multiple sources other than just the water spray contribute to the composition of the airborne community the frequency of detection also varied substantially with some genera such as pseudomonas and sphingomonas present in all samples and others such as mycobacterium only detected sporadically e g in six of 16 samples nevertheless the estimated maximum concentrations of potentially pathogenic bacteria detected over the course of the study day 0 day 146 indicates that pathogenic genera of potential concern were present in abundant quantities table 3 while this data provides only an estimated concentration of genera of potential concern as compared to qpcr techniques that quantify specific pathogenic taxa at the species level the results nevertheless provide insight into the aerosols of potential concern present in showers perkins et al 2009 bernard 2012 4 conclusions this study successfully demonstrated the adaptation of a particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm for multiphase flows to provide qualitative visualization and quantitative data on the spray patterns and velocity fields generated in two full scale experimental showers since this process was possible without the introduction of fluorescent particles into the shower water it greatly simplifies the application of this technology and suggests that it may be applicable to other water spray systems specific findings from the current study include a complex droplet pattern is evident in showers nevertheless the droplets generated in each shower can conceptually be divided into three stages 1 a pressure driven stage 2 a scattering stage and 3 a gravity driven stage the spray flow pattern and velocity profiles in residential showers are a function of showerhead design the number and size of the nozzles in the two showerheads investigated in this study substantially affected the water velocity profiles and spray patterns observed the droplets exiting the low flow showerhead had higher velocities up to 5 m s than the high flow showerhead up to 3 m s and as a result generated a greater number of small droplets some of which bounced off the shower occupant e g manikin to reach the opposite shower wall the particle size distribution data collected from the experimental showers confirms that both showers generate aerosols in the respirable range the concentration ratio of total bacteria in the air during shower operation relative to the baseline values before shower operation varied by day of shower operation indicating that while turning on the shower spray could increase the bacterial load in the shower air relative to that present prior to shower operation it could also decrease the total and viable bacterial concentrations presumably through scrubbing of the air genera of potential health concern including burkholderia staphylococcus and streptococcus were observed frequently in the shower air of both experimental showers however there was substantial variability observed in the estimated airborne concentrations of these genera and the concentrations in the shower air during shower operation were not statistically different than those present in the shower air prior to operation additional research would be required to confirm the presence of specific pathogenic species and to identify the primary sources e g water air or biofilm contributing to the calculated airborne concentrations the current study highlights the potential for linking ptv measurements with microbiome investigations to assess aerosols that may be important to human health however additional studies are required to elucidate how droplet distribution and velocities affect the aerosolized bacterial communities in addition for residential showers other factors such as type of shower stall water temperature piping materials and human occupants should be investigated further as these activities will impact the

19800,although human exposure to water aerosols is common in residential showers the droplet distribution patterns generated in showers are not well understood nor is the bacteria released during shower operation in this study a two phase flow particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm was successfully used to characterize the spatial spray pattern and velocity field in two experimental showers one low flow and one high flow in addition the airborne bacteria present in the shower over nearly 5 months of controlled operation was determined for both showers the results indicate that the droplet velocity out of the low flow showerhead which had fewer orifices was significantly higher than that out of the high flow showerhead resulting in a higher aerosol number concentration in the low flow shower and more consistent wetting of the shower wall both showerheads generated droplets in the respirable range and genera of potential health concern were observed in the shower aerosols measured both prior to and following shower operation the study provides one of the first visualizations of droplet spray patterns in residential showers and provides insight into the airborne bacteria present in showers graphical abstract image 1 keywords shower particle tracking velocimetry ptv wetted wall cyclone wwc bacterial aerosols microbiome 1 introduction water sprays are widely used for applications that range from dispersing herbicides and washing down equipment in agricultural or industrial facilities to running showers in residential settings creech et al 2015 zhou et al 2007 water sprays in both occupational and domestic settings may contain harmful chemicals or bioparticles that once aerosolized pose an inhalation risk to human health de man et al 2014 barker et al 2017 angenent et al 2005 the extent to which potentially harmful particles can penetrate the human respiratory system is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the microbial or chemical agents present in the aerosolized water and the size distribution of the aerosolized droplets generated in the spray system thomas 2013 kleinstreuer et al 2008 steiling et al 2014 spray nozzles are often designed to achieve flow patterns needed for a specific industrial application issa 2009 castillo et al 2001 and or to meet water conservation goals via for instance the distribution of low flow showerheads to residents in water stressed municipalities wong et al 2016 watersense a voluntary partnership program sponsored by the u s environmental protection agency epa is both a label for water efficient products and a resource for saving water nationwide if watersense labeled showerheads with a flow rate of 2 0 gpm or less were purchased for all normal showerhead replacements and installed in all new construction the estimated water savings could reach 30 3 billion gallons per year estimated national energy savings could exceed 1 6 billion kwh of electricity and 10 9 million cubic feet mcf of natural gas each year watersense specification for showerheads www epa gov several studies have been conducted to characterize the droplet size and velocity distributions in spray systems ferreira et al 2010 including a few that have focused on aerosols generated during residential shower operation zhou et al 2007 however more advanced techniques now available for visualizing flow patterns kim et al 2011 cloeter et al 2010 have not yet been applied to residential showers in addition the links between showerhead design droplet spray pattern and the bacteria aerosolized in residential showers are not well understood aerosolization of tap water from residential showerheads can generate bioaerosols that contribute to the indoor microbiome prussin and marr 2015 perkins et al 2009 even with disinfection of the water leaving municipal treatment plants tap water used in residential showers contains a diverse microbial community that contributes to the airborne microbial community as well as to the development of biofilms some of which can harbor potential pathogens that are resistant to biocidal treatment taylor et al 2000 soto giron et al 2016 although many microorganisms are not of concern potentially pathogenic bacteria identified in tap water include legionella pneumophila mycobacteria burkholderia streptococcus anaerococcus and corynebacterium bauer et al 2008 falkinham et al 2008 krojgaard et al 2011 hernández garduño and elwood 2012 diaz flores et al 2015 similarly potentially pathogenic bacteria have been detected on shower curtains kelley et al 2004 in biofilms within showerheads feazel et al 2009 as well as in the bioaerosols generated during showering perkins et al 2009 an important consideration when evaluating potential human exposures during showering is the size distribution of the aerosols generated in an experimental shower stall fitted with a manikin to generate a realistic spray pattern zhou et al 2007 confirmed that respirable droplets are generated during showering but the effect of showerhead design was not considered quantitative microbial risk assessment models rely on this type of data as well as other parameters to assess the risk posed by specific pathogens such as legionella spp hamilton and haas 2016 another important feature of shower systems is the velocity of the spray generated and the effect of showerhead design on the distribution of droplets within the shower stall panão and delgado 2014 there has been a concerted effort in many municipalities to replace standard high flow 2 5 gpm 9 46 lpm showerheads with water efficient low flow 2 gpm 7 57 lpm showerheads the effect of showerhead design on the spray pattern generated has not been examined yet although recent advances in two phase flow visualization make such investigations possible particle tracking velocimetry ptv is one such technique that is typically used for visualizations but which can also be used as a tool to measure the motion of individual objects including droplets in experimental images the object tracking capability of the ptv algorithm utilized in the current study has previously been validated for two phase flow measurements kataoka et al 1986 estrada perez 2004 estrada perez and hassan 2010 estrada perez et al 2015 using object characteristics such as size and shape enables the easy discrimination of phases allowing the independent study of liquid and gas velocities within a single image and providing a series of images for statistical analysis of the results the goal of the current study was to assess the effect of two different showerhead designs on the liquid droplet distribution and bacterial release in two full scale experimental showers the experimental shower stalls were identical except one was equipped with a low flow showerhead and the other with a high flow showerhead particle tracking velocimetry experiments were conducted to assess the water droplet size direction and speed in each shower in addition the quantity and composition of the bacterial aerosols released over five months of daily operation were determined in each shower 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental shower unit a 9 m 6 m x 3 m tent within a temperature controlled building was constructed to accommodate a full scale residential dual shower unit sterling by kohler advantage white shower kit model 62040100 0 fig 1 the two shower stalls have a total volume of 2 5 m3 1 52 m width 0 76 m for each stall 0 86 m depth 1 93 m height with a 0 75 m gap between the top of each shower wall and the tent ceiling the two showers were separated in the middle with a vinyl shower curtain also the front opening of each shower unit was covered by a vinyl shower curtain a heimlich maneuver training manikin torso model 1602 simulaids inc saugerties ny was mounted below the showerhead in each shower to create realistic splash effects and droplet flow pattern conditions similar to those found in occupied residential units the showers were equipped with two different showerheads in the left shower was a low flow showerhead delta 1 spray 1 5 gallons per minute gpm water efficient shower head in chrome with 12 nozzles model 52653 pk table 1 fig 1 in the right shower was a high flow showerhead moen 2 5 gpm banbury 5 spray 4 in shower head in spot resist brushed nickel with 69 nozzles model 23045srn table 1 fig 1 the showerheads were positioned at approximately a 30 degree angle above the manikin heads the water supply to the shower consisted of chlorine disinfected groundwater supplied by the city of bryan regarding the physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the bryan municipal water that was used to supply the experimental shower units the water had a chlorine residual that ranged between 0 42 and 3 10 ppm with the ph at about 8 5 the detected level for nitrates was 0 41 ppm city of bryan 2014 the temperature of the water in the pipes between individual shower events was measured to be between 23 c 25 c an electric water heater whirlpool e1f20us015v 120 v with a capacity of 20 gallons was used to supply hot water 45 46 c for the shower testing during shower operation the hot water was mixed continuously with cold water for a realistic shower event and to maintain the same water temperature for both sides of the shower 2 2 shower droplet sizing and particle tracking velocimetry ptv an aerodynamic particle sizer aps 3321 tsi inc burnsville mn was used to determine the particle size distribution of the shower aerosols generated during shower operation the aps has an upper size limit of 20 μm and thus was not used to measure the large shower droplets but rather the aerosols in the respirable range less than 10 μm as shown in the studies by zhou et al 2007 cowen and ollison 2006 and xu and weisel 2003 the particle number and mass size distributions of the aerosols generated during shower operation were measured by the aps instrument via 10 replicate measurements 20 s each at two locations one upper and one lower level at about 1 2 m and 0 6 m height in each shower stall as indicated in fig 1 ptv is a full field non intrusive flow visualization technique that can capture information on flow characteristics with high spatial and temporal resolution instantaneous fluid velocities can be determined using the ptv technique by recording the position of images at successive time instants via detection of fluorescent materials suspended in the fluid or by distinguishing the optical characteristics of the fluid e g water droplets the underlying assumption is that these tracers closely follow the fluid motion with minimal lag estrada perez and hassan 2010 however in this study no tracers were required because the droplets could be analyzed based on their reflection of light the accuracy of the ptv technique has been tested against international benchmarks stanislas et al 2005 where the algorithm uncertainties yielded subpixel accuracy of about 0 1056 pixel δt with δt time between frames in each experimental shower stall the water droplet flow from each showerhead was recorded with a high speed high resolution camera photron usa inc san diego ca a total of five trials were completed for each showerhead with two different camera views namely top and bottom views illuminated by a continuous halogen lamp fig 1 the top view covered the upper shower region which included the showerhead and most of the manikin s torso while the bottom view covered the lower part of the manikins and was intended to capture the behavior of the bouncing droplets before hitting the wall or ground the high speed camera was operated at 1000 frames per second for each trial 5000 images were captured and over a period of 4 s 4000 frames were selected 2 3 ptv algorithm to determine the droplet velocity fields from the experimental images a particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm originally developed by hassan et al 1992a 1992b and updated as needed for different applications estrada perez and hassan 2010 was used sensitivity studies performed previously with experimental and synthetic images estrada perez 2004 stanislas et al 2005 provide confirmation that ptv can be used successfully for studying the velocity of particles non intrusively in multiphase flows the main processes of the ptv algorithms are 1 particle detection 2 particle centroid location estimation and 3 particle matching in between consecutive frames particle tracking a detailed description of the ptv algorithm can be obtained from estrada perez 2004 the components of the algorithm that are new or relevant for the present study are described below 2 4 procedure for particle detection the object identification procedure classifies every pixel of the image into two parts pixels part of a particle in this study a droplet and pixels part of the background to this end two discriminatory thresholds are considered the gray scale threshold and the mask correlation threshold the gray scale threshold is used to discern whether or not a pixel is part of a particle based on its gray scale intensity and the mask correlation threshold which is based on the approach of takehara 1998 for this approach it is assumed that the gray scale intensity distribution of an ideal particle has a gaussian distribution with the peak on the center of the particle i e brighter pixels are more likely to be part of a particle and to be located near the center of such particle the gray scale threshold is sensitive to non uniform illumination therefore in some cases a local gray scale threshold is suggested in the present study the illumination distribution was fairly constant throughout the entire image therefore there was no need to implement a local gray scale threshold the mask correlation threshold allows assignment of a cut off value for the mask correlation coefficient the cut off depends on the signal to noise ratio within the experimental images and is a user input threshold to discriminate pixels representing a droplet from those representing the background generally it is obtained with a trial and error process until the algorithm selects only the objects to be tracked in this case until all the droplets are appropriately discriminated from the background pixels with coefficients larger than the cut off value are considered part of a particle the coefficient value depends on the likelihood of a pixel to represent the central pixel of an ideal particle template this ideal template is generated by assuming that the light reflected from an ideal particle will follow a 2d gaussian distribution as follows i x y i 0 exp x x 0 2 a 2 y y 0 2 b 2 2 d 0 2 where i is the image pixel intensity i 0 is the maximum gray scale intensity x 0 y 0 is the centroid location of the ideal particle a and b are shape modification constants to make the ideal particle into ellipsoidal shapes and d 0 is the particle diameter the range of x and y will determine how large the template is typically x and y are larger than d 0 once a correlation value is assigned to each pixel they are combined together in groups of pixels that will form an object part of a particle or part of the background the centroids of the identified particles are calculated using sub pixel interpolation if the interpolation fails the center of gravity method is used to locate the center with sub pixel accuracy 2 5 procedure for particle centroid estimation once the pixel representing the droplet centroid is located gaussian three point sub pixel interpolation and center of gravity methods are used to determine the droplet centroid location plus or minus a sub pixel correction with subpixel accuracy the subpixel corrections εx for the x coordinate and εy for the y coordinate are expressed as ε x log i x 0 1 y 0 log i x 0 1 y 0 2 log i x 0 1 y 0 log i x 0 1 y 0 2 log i x 0 y 0 and ε y log i x 0 y 0 1 log i x 0 y 0 1 2 log i x 0 y 0 1 log i x 0 y 0 1 2 log i x 0 y 0 the particle centroid position with sub pixel accuracy x c y c is calculated using x c x 0 ε x and y c y 0 ε y 2 6 procedure for particle matching in between consecutive frames the particle matching algorithm is based on direct spatial correlation this algorithm computes a correlation coefficient between two consecutives ptv sub images separated in time by δt the correlation coefficient between the two sub images i a and i b with a b dimensions is computed using the following relation c i a i b i 1 a j 1 b i a i j i a i b i j i b i 1 a j 1 b i a i j i a 1 2 i 1 a j 1 b i b i j i b 1 2 where i a and i b are the average intensities of sub images a and b respectively the correlation coefficient will determine which particle in picture b is the best match of a particle in picture a since particle locations are estimated to sub pixel accuracy and the interval between pictures is known an accurate particle velocity estimation is achieved for instance a droplet to be matched on image frame j will have multiple correlation coefficient values assigned each of these values corresponds to candidate droplets in frame j 1 based on these correlation values the droplet pair that shows the highest correlation is estimated to represent the same droplet at different instance of time and at a different location following the successful pairing of the droplets and recalling that the position in frame j and frame j 1 are known together with the time intervals between the frames the velocity components can be calculated with u i d x i d t x i j 1 x i j δ p i v v i d y i d t y i j 1 y i j δ p i v where u i and v i represent the velocities in the stream wise and normal flow directions of droplet i x ij and x ij 1 represent the x coordinate position in frame j and j 1 respectively and y ij and y ij 1 represent the y coordinate position of droplet i in frame j and j 1 2 7 shower operation and microbiome sampling each of the shower units was operated daily for 20 min to mimic routine shower operation for a period of five months the temperature of the water exiting the showers was controlled at 45 46 c and the water temperature measured at the manikins was between 35 and 37 c to model routine occupant activity in residential showers the surface of the manikins in each of the two units was wiped thoroughly with wet soap irish spring prior to each daily shower actuation bioaerosol samples for microbial analysis were collected on the first day of operation as well as periodically throughout the five month operating period the results presented herein focus primarily on the concentration of bacterial aerosol concentrations measured during the study as well as identification of potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa that developed in each shower portable wetted wall cyclone wwc collectors designed in our laboratory and manufactured at tsi inc shoreview mn mcfarland et al 2010 king and mcfarland 2012 were used to collect aerosol samples in each experimental shower for the 100 l min cyclone the cut point the particle size where the collection efficiency is 50 of the aerosol to hydrosol efficiency curve is 1 2 μm ad aerodynamic diameter and the average collection efficiency for single cells and clusters of bacterial particles is 86 over a size range of 1 8 6 μm mcfarland et al 2010 while maintaining the culturability of the collected bacteria king and mcfarland 2012 for each 20 min bioaerosol sampling event a wwc was operated at an air sampling flow rate of 100 l min and a collection liquid inflow rate of 100 μl min to concentrate the airborne particles present in the shower air by a factor of up to 106 in sterile dna free milli q water the collector inlet was positioned near the center point of each shower unit at approximately 0 4 m width 0 4 m depth 1 m height in between the aps sampling locations denoted on fig 1 aerosol samples from each shower unit were collected consecutively starting in the low flow unit and repeating the sampling in the high flow unit aerosol samples were collected with the wwc in each shower unit for a 20 min period before the water in the shower was turned on and for a 20 min period during shower operation to clean the wwc units between sample collections the collector was turned on and the inlet covered with a 102 mm a d filter pall ma for particle free airflow using a 1 ml pipette 100 μl of fresh 10 bleach was skirted into the wwc inlet three times within a 2 min period the bleach was removed by squirting 100 μl of isopropanol five times during a 5 min period into the collector finally 100 μl aliquots of sterile collection liquid 0 01 tween 20 were sprayed five times into the wwc inlet over a 5 min period the collector was then operated with sterile collection liquid for 20 min prior to each sample collection to prevent carryover of collected particles 2 8 analysis of microbial samples the concentration of viable bacteria present in the bioaerosol collection fluid samples was determined by plating 100 μl volumes in appropriate dilutions on difco tryptic soy agar tsa petri dishes becton dickinson co sparks md incubating the plates overnight for 24 h at 37 c and counting the resulting colony forming units cfu on the plates although water microbiology practices commonly use minimal medium and room temperature for long term growth of bacteria in water samples our goal was to enhance the culturability of bacteria that may have been affected during the aerosol collection process and also to stimulate the growth of bacteria that may cause waterborne diseases by incubating the cells on rich medium tsa at 37 c for 24 h liao and shollenberger 2003 in addition the aerosol samples were analyzed by whole cell qpcr an et al 2006 han et al 2010 briefly the bacteria were lysed by heating 1 ml aliquots of the diluted samples in 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes for 15 min at 95 c the tubes were placed on ice for 5 min to quickly chill the suspensions and the cell debris was sedimented by microcentrifuging at 117 g s for 2 min aliquots 3 μl of the supernatants in appropriate dilutions were

the end of each qpcr run to ensure specificity in each sample s amplification 2 9 illumina sequencing the alkaline lysis method was used to extract bacterial dna from all bioaerosol samples zhou et al 1990 for illumina sequencing briefly the cells were pelleted and then lysed in fresh tens lysis buffer containing 0 1 m naoh 1x te buffer and 0 5 sds the proteins were precipitated by adding 3 n sodium acetate at ph 5 2 the proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was transferred to a sterile 1 5 ml micro centrifuge tube after the addition of 10 μl of polyacryl carrier pc

al 2007 with the reference database greengenes13 8 16s rrna mcdonald et al 2012 klappenbach et al 2001 for bacteria 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerosol particle sizing both the low flow and high flow showerheads produced aerosols in the respirable range with mass median diameters mmds ranging from 2 7 to 3 7 μm see table 2 and fig 2 for both the upper and lower sampling locations within each shower a slightly lower mmd was measured in the low flow shower as compared to the high flow shower the range of droplet sizes was similar in both showers with the measured aerosols ranging mostly between 0 5 μm 10 μm fig 2 as noted earlier the aps unit used to measure the aerosol size distribution has an upper cut off of 20 μm and thus does not measure the larger droplet sizes a comparison of the calculated aerosol concentrations from both the lower and upper regions of each shower unit indicates that the shower with the low flow showerhead had significantly higher aerosol number concentrations as compared to the high flow shower in both showers higher droplet concentrations were detected in the lower parts of both shower units likely as a result of the reflected spray off of the manikin obstacle in each shower the increased concentration of particles in the lower portion of the shower stall is likely most relevant for children in showers and should be considered when developing quantitative microbial risk assessments qmra for children although the current study mimicked adult occupants in showers we hypothesize that a child or a shorter object standing in the shower would result in the droplets bouncing off from the top of the object and hitting the opposite wall resulting in a similar albeit lower bounce pattern in the case of an empty shower stall without any object present a gravity driven straight flow could be expected the average aerosol mass concentration for the upper and lower aerosol samples collected in the low flow shower was 5 mg m3 the average for the high flow shower was 3 5 mg m3 these levels are generally lower but on the same order of magnitude as the levels 5 14 mg m3 reported by zhou et al 2007 during hot water operation at similar flow rates in a full scale experimental shower system although the water temperature and shower flow rates in the previous study were similar to the current study the aerosol concentrations were measured at a greater height 1 5 m and the shower was located in a much smaller room 16 7 m3 than that employed in the current study also the mass concentrations measured by zhou et al 2007 were significantly lower e g on the order of 0 1 1 mg m3 when the relative humidity conditions in the room were below 70 nevertheless our results confirm that showers generate aerosols in the respirable range although the size of the aerosol generated is a function of several factors including the configuration of the showers within the room and the sampling location 3 2 ptv measurements results from the ptv algorithm consist of full field velocity fields and corresponding velocity profiles the velocity profiles were extracted from regions of interest by means of virtual line probes this approach provides qualitative and quantitative comparisons between the two showerheads moreover the ptv technique provides insight into the influence of showerhead design on the induced flow patterns and ultimately it allows investigation of the relationship between these flow patterns and the microbiome that develops in each shower fig 3 shows the instantaneous fields of the droplet velocity estimated using the ptv algorithm an animated rendering of the image is provided in supplementary information each vector on these fields represents an individual droplet velocity which can be tracked over time the vectors are color coded to show the magnitude of the droplet velocity these fields are plotted on top of the images representing the manikin s location this helps to interpret the effect that the different shower nozzle characteristics have on the flow structure and distribution of the droplets in the vicinity of the manikins from these fields it is apparent that for both nozzles the velocity at the exit of the nozzles reaches a maximum value thereafter the droplets are directed towards the manikin s body hitting first the manikin s head interestingly the water droplets exit the low flow showerhead at a significantly higher speed compared to the high flow showerhead where the droplet speed is about 50 lower after hitting the manikin multiple droplet trajectories are observed there are elastic scattering collisions between the droplets and the top of the manikin head the droplets gain elevation to later start a free falling descent other droplets tend to adhere to the manikin s surface these slowly slide down the manikin s body which effectively delays their free falling descent until much later when they detach from the manikin the velocity fields show the droplets transitioning from the initial pressure driven velocity just after exiting the shower nozzles to their final velocity induced by gravitational acceleration the maximum droplet velocities observed in fig 3 are within the range of previously measured free falling droplets up to 9 m s as reported by gunn and kinzer 1949 changes in the position of the shower occupants would be expected to change the spray pattern in addition the spray off a manikin could be different than off a human to better understand the general behavior of the shower droplets the droplet streamlines were added to fig 3 see left and right images these streamlines represent the most probable paths that the droplets may follow after being expulsed from the nozzles han and moss 1997 described streamlines during a flow visualization experiment in virtual impactor models similar vortices and streamlines have been generated for the shower droplet pattern fig 3 one interesting finding from these streamline images is the fact that the droplets horizontal displacements on the left shower are consistently larger than those on the right shower droplets in the low flow shower have a higher probability to reach the wall opposite the manikin s location hence different periods of active wetting are expected for each shower wall depending on the type of showerhead used the ptv results indicate that the low flow shower wall is subjected to a greater number of high velocity droplets than the high flow shower wall which is less disturbed during operation these results suggest that the wall biofilm in the low flow shower may be continuously interrupted and broken up by the shower droplets which may yield a less diverse biofilm containing taxa that could tolerate these conditions cense et al 2006 epstein et al 2011 the streamlines also show dramatic differences between the flow patterns in the two units the water droplets exit the 12 nozzles on the low flow showerhead with sufficiently high velocity to bounce off the manikin s body and reach the opposite wall the ptv images show higher droplet concentrations in the low flow unit in agreement with the aps analysis fig 2 indicating that the streams break up earlier resulting in a more turbulent pattern in contrast while the water passing through the perimeter nozzles of the high flow showerhead seem to have higher speed compared to the rest of the droplets exiting the head the particles display a turbulent pattern after bouncing off the manikin and they gravitate towards the shower base before reaching the wall to achieve a better understanding of the droplets in flight behavior we classify the droplets as experiencing three different stages a pressure driven stage b scattering stage and c gravity driven stage the pressure driven stage happens near the droplet generation just after exiting the nozzle at this stage the droplets velocity is high reaching a maximum velocity magnitude of approximately 4 5 m s depending on the showerhead in this stage the droplets horizontal velocity component is significantly larger than the vertical component if the droplet is left undisturbed it will gain vertical acceleration due to gravity however this is not the case in this experiment because of the presence of the manikin in the droplets path when the droplets reach the manikin body the second droplet stage begins namely the scattering stage in the scattering stage the droplets are decelerated through elastic collisions with the manikin as noted above the droplets in this stage may go through different paths for instance the droplets may bounce off the manikin gaining elevation prior to free falling droplets in this path experience a sudden change of direction towards the wall opposite the manikin s location also the droplets experience vertical acceleration due to gravity if droplets do not interact with each other the droplets may undergo a parabolic trajectory starting from the bouncing point and ending either on the shower wall or on the shower floor if droplets in this path interact with each other they may coalesce forming a larger droplet which will change direction and vertical speed due to the added mass another observed droplet path after the droplets interact with the manikin surface is the sliding path in this path droplets do not bounce off the manikin but rather adhere to it as they form a small water layer that covers the surface thereafter droplets of water begin to start falling off the manikin towards the shower floor finally the last droplet stage is the gravity driven stage this stage covers all droplets before they hit the shower wall or floor in the gravity driven stage there is a vertical preferential direction and a continued acceleration due to gravity the velocity at a given height in this stage will depend on the droplet size mass and whether or not the droplets interact with each other during flight due to the complexity of droplet behavior much of the individual droplet interactions are difficult to quantify to simplify interpretation of the velocity field results virtual line probes located at five different positions in each shower fig 4 were used calculate the average magnitude of the droplets velocity v v x 2 v y 2 1 2 passing through each line on the images x n denotes the length in cm along the virtual line profile where the velocity measurements were recorded thus each profile starts at point zero at the beginning of each arrow and extends to a maximum of 60 cm along the length of the probe line probe 1 was selected to analyze the water droplet velocities on their path from each nozzle outlet to the region of first interaction with the manikin line probe 2 is a cross section of the spray exiting the shower nozzle and accounts for droplets traveling down to the region where the shower stall base meets the shower wall forming a lip that retains moisture and supports the formation of a biofilm line probe 3 captures close to body droplet interactions droplets bouncing off the body and dispersing droplets from the showerhead passing the manikin s upper torso line probe 4 captures the droplets dispersing directly from the initial showerhead spray far from body droplet interaction and other droplet patterns finally line probe 5 captures the droplets passing at about the level of a showering occupant s knee prior to reaching the stall base where it impacts and re aerosolizes from the shower floor surface the line probe 1 velocity profiles along the spray centerline and the line probe 2 velocity profiles transverse to the showerhead spray confirm that the velocity of water droplets exiting the low flow showerhead are higher than those exiting the high flow showerhead the velocity of the spray droplets increases rapidly as the spray exits each showerhead as evident in the step function shape of the velocities from position 8 35 cm along line probe 1 in both showers however in both showers the magnitude of the droplet velocities fluctuates after 35 cm along line probe 1 likely due to the interference of water droplets bouncing off of the manikins fig 3 the higher droplet velocities in the low flow shower versus the high flow shower persist as the spray reaches the shower occupant manikin as evident by the velocity profiles along line probe 3 however the step velocity profiles for each shower are slightly shifted along profile 3 suggesting that the droplets are impacting the manikin s heads at slightly different locations along line probe 4 the magnitude of the droplet velocities are similar near the manikin in each shower but ultimately the magnitude of droplet velocities is higher in the low flow shower as the droplets approach the wall opposite the manikin this result is consistent with the observation evident in fig 3 that more spray reaches the opposite wall in the low flow shower as compared to the high flow shower finally the droplet velocities in both showers are similar along horizontal line probe 5 near the bottom of the showers where re aerosolization of droplets from the shower floor is likely occurring the virtual line probes capture the magnitude of the droplets velocity crossing them v v x 2 v y 2 1 2 hence a profile of the average velocity magnitude is provided for each virtual line the average velocity magnitude and the length along each line profile are described with v n m s and x n cm respectively with n 1 2 3 4 5 representing the number of the line probe used 3 3 microbial analysis of the collected aerosols the total concentration of bacteria in cfu m3 and in bacterial genome copy number gcn m3 present in the shower air prior to shower operation and during shower operation were determined for days 0 6 56 and 146 of shower operation to assess the effect of shower operation on total bacteria aerosolized the log of the ratio of airborne bacterial concentrations gcn m3 measured during and immediately prior to shower operation was calculated for each shower a similar process was used to calculate the log of the airborne concentration ratio based on viable bacterial concentrations cfu m3 thus positive concentration ratios indicate that shower operation increased the estimated concentration of bacteria in the shower air whereas negative values indicate that turning on the shower reduced the airborne bacterial concentration as evident in fig 5 the log of the concentration ratios based on gcn varied from approximately 1 0 indicating substantial enrichment of total bacterial concentrations with shower operation to 1 0 indicating a substantial decrease in bacterial concentrations with shower operation removal of some fraction of the aerosol as a result of the shower spray is certainly possible as this is a common approach employed in wet scrubber technologies kim et al 2001 in general however an increase in airborne bacterial concentration was observed more frequently during shower operation than a decrease in concentration especially for the high flow shower this result suggests that bacteria from the shower water itself or biofilms associated with the shower are released during shower operation as has been documented previously perkins et al 2009 during the initial period of operation the log of the cfu and gcn based concentration ratios were in general agreement but more significant differences between the two metrics were observed over time particularly on day 56 and on day 146 low flow shower only an examination of the sequencing results indicates that several genera associated with potential human pathogens were detected in the air of the experimental shower units microorganisms in these genera which included burkholderia streptococcus ralstonia among others have been shown to cause a range of adverse human health effects ranging from pneumonia to skin infections table s2 to calculate the estimated airborne concentration of each of these genera in the showers the relative abundance of each genera in the rarified sequence dataset was multiplied by the total airborne bacterial genome concentration in the air gcn m3 following the method proposed previously by dannemiller et al 2014 the results summarized in table 3 indicate that the peak concentrations for the 14 genera examined varied from 102 to 105 gcn m3 the calculated estimate of the concentration of any given genera in the shower air varied substantially table s3 and no consistent pattern is evident with respect to the effect of shower operation the calculated concentrations of each genera in the experimental shower units before shower operation were not statistically different than those measured after shower operation paired t test of square root transformed data p 0 05 indicating that at least at the genus level multiple sources other than just the water spray contribute to the composition of the airborne community the frequency of detection also varied substantially with some genera such as pseudomonas and sphingomonas present in all samples and others such as mycobacterium only detected sporadically e g in six of 16 samples nevertheless the estimated maximum concentrations of potentially pathogenic bacteria detected over the course of the study day 0 day 146 indicates that pathogenic genera of potential concern were present in abundant quantities table 3 while this data provides only an estimated concentration of genera of potential concern as compared to qpcr techniques that quantify specific pathogenic taxa at the species level the results nevertheless provide insight into the aerosols of potential concern present in showers perkins et al 2009 bernard 2012 4 conclusions this study successfully demonstrated the adaptation of a particle tracking velocimetry ptv algorithm for multiphase flows to provide qualitative visualization and quantitative data on the spray patterns and velocity fields generated in two full scale experimental showers since this process was possible without the introduction of fluorescent particles into the shower water it greatly simplifies the application of this technology and suggests that it may be applicable to other water spray systems specific findings from the current study include a complex droplet pattern is evident in showers nevertheless the droplets generated in each shower can conceptually be divided into three stages 1 a pressure driven stage 2 a scattering stage and 3 a gravity driven stage the spray flow pattern and velocity profiles in residential showers are a function of showerhead design the number and size of the nozzles in the two showerheads investigated in this study substantially affected the water velocity profiles and spray patterns observed the droplets exiting the low flow showerhead had higher velocities up to 5 m s than the high flow showerhead up to 3 m s and as a result generated a greater number of small droplets some of which bounced off the shower occupant e g manikin to reach the opposite shower wall the particle size distribution data collected from the experimental showers confirms that both showers generate aerosols in the respirable range the concentration ratio of total bacteria in the air during shower operation relative to the baseline values before shower operation varied by day of shower operation indicating that while turning on the shower spray could increase the bacterial load in the shower air relative to that present prior to shower operation it could also decrease the total and viable bacterial concentrations presumably through scrubbing of the air genera of potential health concern including burkholderia staphylococcus and streptococcus were observed frequently in the shower air of both experimental showers however there was substantial variability observed in the estimated airborne concentrations of these genera and the concentrations in the shower air during shower operation were not statistically different than those present in the shower air prior to operation additional research would be required to confirm the presence of specific pathogenic species and to identify the primary sources e g water air or biofilm contributing to the calculated airborne concentrations the current study highlights the potential for linking ptv measurements with microbiome investigations to assess aerosols that may be important to human health however additional studies are required to elucidate how droplet distribution and velocities affect the aerosolized bacterial communities in addition for residential showers other factors such as type of shower stall water temperature piping materials and human occupants should be investigated further as these activities will impact the

promising technology for biofuel production and treatment of wastewater sludge the current study investigates a novel utilization of biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge to obtain high dry matter dm content sludge drastic improvements in filtration speed are achieved using different types of lignocellulosic biomass filter aids prepared via mechanical pre treatment the combined sludge biomass filter cake is subsequently used as a feedstock for htl and shows superior bio crude yields and properties compared to their individual counterparts the chemical energy recovery to bio crude is increased to 75 compared to 46 for biomass and 67 for sludge on its own the increased dm content of filter cakes 25 compared to primary sludge 5 increases the energy efficiency of htl of primary sludge by a factor of 4 5 introducing a biomass filteraid htl combination to a wastewater treatment plant would reduce the organic carbon load to treat by 62 by combining sludge with lignocellulosic biomass the use of alkali catalyst can be avoided entirely which represents a major cost factor in htl of lignocellulosics graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater primary sludge hydrothermal liquefaction filtration filter aid biomass 1 introduction the modern conception of wastewater is more to see it as a resource of energy and nutrients rather than a waste with the possibility of net energy extraction and nutrient conservation mccarty et al 2011 the utilisation of wastewater treatment wwt sludge is an area of on going investment and research around the world current treatment practices for sludge include anaerobic digestion dewatering and incineration in a typical wastewater treatment plant wwtp incoming wastewater is screened and thickened during primary treatment and primary sludge removed the non sludge fraction is subsequently treated aerobically to reduce bod cod by oxidization of organic carbon the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria produce waste activated sludge flocculating bacterial biomass which settles easily for recovery since the heterotrophic aerobic bacteria typically has a growth yield about 0 5 around half of the wastewater s carbon is converted into co2 in this process henze et al 2001 the sludge produced from aeration is termed waste activated sludge which can be combined with primary sludge and anaerobically digested to produce methane and co2 this final digestate is considered safe for landfill disposal incineration or is sometimes used as fertiliser the latter has been subject to controversy due to unresolved problems with slurry content of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals non degraded organics such as plastics and heavy metals another drawback of this treatment process is the inefficient use of the wastewaters carbon since typically 70 75 is converted to co2 50 in the aeration process and another 40 50 of the remainder in the anaerobic digestion process only 20 30 of the carbon can be conserved as methane amounting to less than half the incoming energy content thus a much more efficient carbon and energy recuperation is critical for the transformation of wastewater treatment to become net energy producing in one study the aeration process was shown to use 42 of the wwtp s total electricity consumption yeshi et al 2013 it is therefore an extremely attractive strategy to separate as much carbon as possible from the wastewater before aeration for bod reduction this conserves the separated carbon as an energy carrier and significantly lowers the energy demand for aeration hydrothermal liquefaction htl has been proposed as a technology for sludge management which can process wastewater sludges more efficiently by applying high heat and pressure to the slurries producing a liquid bio crude subsequent upgrading of the bio crude via hydrotreating then produces renewable fuels with a high proportion of middle distillate fuels diesel and kerosene the htl process is characterised by high carbon efficiency low residence time 20 min and high throughput resulting in low land requirements htl is a potential technology for the production of renewable aviation fuels with competitive cost and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to other renewable biofuel technologies and favourable over petro fuels de jong et al 2017 de jong et al 2015 until now most htl applications have been identified as conversion of lignocellulosic side streams such as straw wood waste or energy crops in these processes the lignocellulosic materials are milled to small particles and suspended in water to make a pumpable slurry with 10 20 dm the pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl and genifuel corporation recently published a comprehensive report on the htl technology for sludge processing for the water environment reuse foundation werf marrone and moeller 2016 all three types of sludge primary sludge secondary waste activated sludge and digested solids were converted to bio crude yields dry basis including ash of 37 25 and 34 respectively demonstrating the potential of htl for sludge management the report highlighted the reduction of waste solid material of 94 99 compared to common wwt practices the promising results from the technical investigation and a techno economic analysis led to an assessment of the total amounts of sludge available for bioenergy production in the us seiple et al 2017 it estimated that the us treat 130 5 million m3 of wastewater per day which generates millions of tons of sludge annually seiple et al 2017 state that 14 mt per annum of dry solids are produced in the us of which only 50 are beneficially used e g biogas production or incineration for combined heat and power seiple et al 2017 the influent flow into wwtp is typically very dilute in the range of 0 01 0 04 total suspended solids during primary treatment and after removal of bulky items from the influent primary sludge is obtained at solids concentrations of 2 6 wt after primary clarifiers and thickeners dewatering to higher solids concentrations is desired in many applications as it reduces the transportation cost when less water is transported if sludge is used for energy production via hydrothermal liquefaction it is important to increase the solids concentration as far as possible while still forming a pumpable slurry higher solids concentrations achieve higher energy efficiencies as less water is heated in the process in relation to organic material ideal dry matter content of slurries for htl are around 15 20 wt a recent techno economic assessment found that if the solids concentrations of wwt sludges can be increased from 12 to 20 a 30 cost reduction in minimum fuel price mfsp could be achieved snowden swan et al 2016 sludges are however notoriously difficult to dewater due to the presence of extra cellular polymeric material it has been reported to make up 80 of primary sludge and includes proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and phospholipids skinner et al 2015 one way of improving sludge dewatering properties is the use of filter aids qi et al 2011 in the current investigation we propose to use biomass as filter aid for the filtration of wastewater filter aids act as skeleton builders during filtration operations and aid the filtration process by speeding up the process and obtaining slurries with higher solids content during the filter cake formation filter aids increase the porosity of the cake and hence reduce the specific cake resistance which results in faster filtration the use of filter aids is not novel but commonly filter aids are produced from inorganic material such as diatomic earth kieselguhr zeolites or polymeric material the issue with these types of filter aids is their high cost once the filter aid is clogged it has to be replaced and ideally recovered to be re used in practice this is difficult to achieve and hence the application of filter aids is not implemented at large scale in wwtps the novelty in the current investigation is to use a filter aid produced from lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for the htl process in combination with the filtration media sewage sludge the htl fuel production step can produce bio crude from both the filter aid and the sewage sludge in addition to making the lignocellulosic biomass pumpable for htl conversion the main advantage being that the solids concentration can be increased in the slurry with a filter aid which aids both the filtration and the htl process a similar approach to increasing the solids concentration without the filtration aspect was recently suggested in two separate publications zhang et al 2017 performed hydrothermal co carbonization of sewage sludge with pinewood sawdust for hydro char production zhang et al 2017 they found that the co carbonization led to significant synergistic enhancements in the bio char yields and carbon retentions nazari et al 2017 similarly performed co liquefaction of waste activated sludge and birchwood sawdust nazari et al 2017 the waste activated sludge had a moisture content of 96 1 and was mixed with sawdust to achieve solids concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 wt to achieve the solids concentration of 15 wt daf sawdust was added at a ratio of 3 8 1 relative to dry sludge i e almost 4 times as much sawdust as dry sludge was necessary to obtain slurry with optimal solids concentration in a scenario where dry biomass is limited this could pose a potential problem when large amounts of sludge are to be treated and it may require a costly drying process for the biomass the proposed method can negate the requirement for such large dry biomass demand while still producing high solids content slurries therefore in the current paper we investigate the use of different biomass materials as filter aids for sludge filtration in order to obtain higher solids loading slurries for hydrothermal liquefaction a range of different biomasses are examined and particularly filter aids produced by extrusion pre treatment of as harvested biomass are investigated the extrusion process tears apart the plant s macromolecular structures and results in a fibrous structure which is hypothesized to be particularly suited for filtration applications compared to e g milling or grinding which produces primarily spherical particles the combined filter cake of sludge and filter aid material produced from biomass is then processed under htl conditions for bio crude production this study into the novel combination of slurry preparation for htl and co liquefaction is carried out with the following objectives to investigate if extruded biomass exhibits good filtration properties for primary and secondary sludge if suitable dry matter content slurries for htl can be produced using biomass assisted filtration to investigate any synergistic effects in co liquefaction of combined filter cake for bio crude yields and properties to provide an overview of carbon and energy flows in a co liquefaction system compared to only htl of sludge to assess if the addition of alkali catalysts can be avoided in co liquefaction of lignocellulosics and sludge the last objective is motivated by the prior knowledge that lignocellulosic material generally requires an alkali htl environment for satisfactory performance if the ph is too low acid catalyzed decomposition of carbohydrate reactions are favored over useful aldol condensation reactions which leads to increased char production feedstocks high in nitrogen such as algae and sewage sludge generally do not require an alkali catalyst as the n containing protein decomposes to nh4 leading to a more alkali environment biller and ross 2011 this means the addition of alkali can be avoided biller et al 2016 therefore the co liquefaction of lignocellulosics with a feedstock high in n such as sewage sludge could negate the use of costly alkali catalyst the alkali catalyst can account for over 10 of the operating cost excluding biomass feed of a htl plant tews et al 2014 2 materials and methods primary and secondary sludge samples were collected at the marselisborg wwtp aarhus denmark operated by aarhus vand a s primary sludge was obtained after screening grease and grit removal processes primary clarifiers and sludge thickeners secondary sludge was the excess waste activated sludge from the biological tank after secondary clarifiers filtration tests were carried out using a 240 ml batch pressure filter operated at 0 8 mpa and a filtration area of 50 27 cm2 tests were carried out using a wire mesh mesh 40 or using fisherbrand filter papers type ql100 during each experiment 200 ml of primary sludge with 5 g of filter aid were employed unless otherwise stated for experiments using extruded miscanthus the filter aid material was added at varying levels of 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 g the filter aid method known as body feed was used which entails mixing of the filter aid with the media prior to filtration time resolved mass recordings were obtained from the filtrate as soon as the filter pressurization valve was opened samples of filtrate and filter aid were collected at the end of the filtration experiments homogenized filter cake samples were analysed for moisture content in triplicate using a mettler toledo he53 moisture analyser filtrate samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to measure the dry matter content the drying methods correspond to the awwa method 2540 d for total suspended solids tss the dry filtrate samples were then heated to 550 c for 5 h to determine the ash content filter aid materials were produced from willow miscanthus and switchgrass via extrusion extruded biomass was prepared from roughly chopped material 10 50 mm using an extruder xinda 65 mm twin screw extruder with 2000 mm barrel length miscanthus was harvested early autumn with leaves and had a natural content of water of 30 willow was harvested as year sprouts in the winter and had a water content of 50 whereas switchgrass harvested in early autumn had a 45 water content additionally miscanthus only stems was milled using a knife mill and separated using a vibrating sieve shaker to obtain particles in the size range of 180 250 μm pine flakes as well as hammer milled pine flakes were sourced from a commercial wood shaving supplier agroform a s denmark the six different biomass samples used as filter aid are shown in fig 1s electronic supplementary visual inspection of the samples led to following estimations on size and

fibrous medium pn c6288 and kieselguhr sigma aldrich dk kieselguhr calcined purified pn 18514 in order to calculate the effect of filter aid on the specific cake resistance and estimate filtration

area length 2 m radius 0 67 m area 8 38 m2 samples of biomass filter aid filter cake and primary sludge were processed via hydrothermal liquefaction in 20 ml batch reactors at 340 c for 20 min the procedure has been published previously biller et al 2016b briefly the htl procedure consisted of loading the sample slurry into the batch reactors sealing them and submerging them into a pre heated fluidized sand bath after 20 min total reaction time in the sand bath the reactors were quickly removed and quenched in a water bath after cleaning the outside of the reactors from sand and water they were weighed carefully vented and weighed again to determine the mass of gas produced the water phase was then decanted into a centrifuge tube and the reactor rinsed with 3 aliquots 3 ml each of dichloromethane dcm and recovered in a separate centrifuge tube the tube with the aqueous phase was spun in a centrifuge and the supernatant recovered using a pipette in a separate tube the remaining contents from the two tubes were recovered using dcm and vacuum filtered through a pre weighed filter paper and rinsed with dcm until clear the filter paper was dried and re weighed to determine the mass of solid residue produced the dcm phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and the remaining bio crude mass determined gravimetrically the yields of aqueous soluble product was determined by difference from the three measured fractions gas solids and bio crude biomass bio crude and htl solid residue samples were analyzed for elemental content using an elementar vario macro cube elemental

biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge fig 1 a c shows the filtration curves from experiments carried out using primary sludge with 5 dry matter content fig 1d shows the results for secondary waste activated sludge 1 7 dry matter content and mixtures of secondary and primary sludge all tests were carried out with only a wire mesh and no filter paper in the filtration apparatus fig 1a shows the use of extruded miscanthus and the commercial filter aid kieselguhr diatomaceous earth and compares the filtration curves to not using any filter aid at all the use of extruded miscanthus filter aid results in a dramatic improvement of filterability of the primary sludge sample constant filtrate mass is obtained after 1 min with a total of 141 g filtrate obtained constant filtrate mass is only achieved after approximately 2500 s for both kieselguhr and no filter aid experiments the total amount of filtrate obtained using miscanthus filter aid is lower compared to kieselguhr and no filter aid this is due to the additional water holding capacity of the miscanthus filter aid to residual water in the sludge the filtration time using extruded miscanthus filter aid is drastically reduced from around 40 min down to 1 min the specific cake resistance using extruded miscanthus was reduced around 180 fold compared to no filter aid as shown in fig 2 a fig 1b compares the different types of biomass filter aid materials investigated the experiments without filter aid and the commercial filter aid are not included in the graph but can be compared to fig 1a as the experimental conditions were the same the scale of the graph is changed to allow more detail most biomasses performed similar apart from milled miscanthus and pine seen by the filtration curves but also by the specific cake resistances plotted in fig 2a the milled samples represent the smallest and most spherical particles it is likely that this decreases the porosity of the filter cake resulting in a higher cake resistance all extruded biomasses and the pine flakes exhibited good filtration aid properties with very fast filtration completed after around 1 min the two experiments with finely milled biomass miscanthus and pine resulted in higher final filtrate mass of 150 160 g compared to 140 g for extruded biomass and pine flakes in terms of filtration performance the type of biomass used does not appear to have an effect while the type of biomass filter aid preparation does have an influence extrusion was chosen as a size reduction and preparation technique as it is currently used in our laboratories for the preparation of slurries for htl on a continuous pilot scale htl system in our experience the extrusion process produces a low density fluffy material with few hard particles which could block the high pressure pumping system it is also easier to soak the extruded biomass with water for slurry preparation than it is for biomass processed in a different way e g saw dust or milled particles the extrusion process is also performed in the presence of water either from the natural moisture content in fresh biomass 30 70 or added to the extruder to obtain the right moisture content for the process of around 50 i e it avoids the necessity of drying the biomass before size reduction the advantages of the extrusion process for slurry preparation for continuous htl are hence apparent and some of these advantages may apply for filter aid preparation however in filtration experiments the fine pine flakes gave comparable results as can be seen by the filtration curves and cake resistances for pine flakes and extruded biomass respectively filtration experiments in fig 1 a b were carried out using 5 g of filter aid while the experiments in fig 1c present the results of varying the amount of filter aid misc ext from 1 to 10 g with a constant 200 ml of sludge in terms of filter aid to dry sludge dm ratio this represents 0 1 1 to 1 1 using only 1 g of filter resulted in improved filtration time compared to not using any filter aid at all fig 1a but considerably longer final filtration time is observed compared to the experiments using 5 g filter aid fig 1c all experiments in varying amount of filter aid exhibit the same steep initial filtration curve but at 60 g of filtrate recovered the 1 g experiment slows down compared to the rest the experiment with 2 5 g is complete after around 100 s which is around 3 times as long as the fastest experiment at 33 s when 7 5 g of filter aid is used in terms of practical applications is may however be more viable to use 2 5 g of filter aid as it exhibits vastly improved filtration times compared to not using any filter aid and only 0 25 g of filter aid is required per g of dry sludge processed the graph also shows that the amount of filtrate consistently reduces with increasing amount of filter aid added this is due to the additional water holding capacity of the increased amount of biomass present the filtration times are directly related to the cake resistance plotted in fig 2a which confirm the good performance of the 0 25 1 filter aid ratio comparing no filter aid to 0 1 1 ratio results in a 1 8 fold reduction of cake resistance the change from 0 1 1 to 0 25 1 ratio resulted in a 50 fold reduction in resistance while the other steps 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 also only showed a reduction of 1 8 fold in cake resistance although the main objective of the work is to valorize primary sludge it is worthwhile looking at the filtration behavior of secondary sludge as it can likely be co processed in future htl wwt systems at the wwtp the current samples were collected approximately 3200 dry tons primary sludge at 5 dm and 1600 dry tons excess secondary sludge 1 7 dm are produced annually hence fig 2d includes combinations of secondary to primary sludge filtration experiments to reflect this composition secondary sludge on its own could not be filtered with a filter paper or without due to the filter clogging instantly with filter aid and no retention of solids with just the wire mesh with the use of filter aid reasonable filtration times of around 400 s were observed for secondary sludge interestingly the combination of secondary to primary sludge of 3 5 1 using 5 g extruded willow could not be filtered satisfactory with a filtration time of around 20 min decreasing the secondary to primary sludge ratio to 2 5 1 with filter aid resulted in fast filtration times comparable to primary sludge decreasing the secondary to primary ratio further to 1 5 0 75 and 0 5 all showed good filtration performances within the margin of error to each other at around 80 100 s filtration time however increasing the ratio to a higher value of 3 5 1 resulted in a slow filtration of almost 20 min using no filter aid neither the 2 5 1 or 3 5 1 secondary to primary sludge combinations could be filtered why the 3 5 1 sludge combination does not filter even with the use of filter aid is currently unclear and deserves further investigation at the wwtp the samples were obtained from the secondary to primary production ratio is in the order of 1 25 2 5 1 in a range where good filtration performance shown in fig 1d filtration experiments on primary sludge were also carried out using a filter paper in addition to the wire mesh these were generally very slow and did not show good filtration performance overall the different biomass assisted filtration experiments show that if the particle size is not too small the preparation method and type of biomass as filter aid are not significant in terms of filtration performance the cake resistances of extruded switchgrass extruded miscanthus and pine flakes and miscanthus are not significantly different from each other 95 of confidence t test but milled pine is statistically different filtration times are reduced from around 40 min 1 min with the use of biomass filter aid and specific cake resistances are reduced by 180 300 times 0 25 1 ratio of filter aid to dry matter sludge appears optimal for primary sludge filtration with fast filtration time low cake resistance and low biomass requirement fig 2a shows the specific filter cake resistances calculated using eqn 2 on a logarithmic scale the data visualizes the improvements obtained using the different biomasses and the advantage of the larger filter aid particles the cake resistance were used to estimate the filtration capacity of a rotary drum vacuum filtration system using eqn 3 a theoretical rotary drum with 2 m length and 0 67 m radius resulting in a filtration area of 8 34 m2 was chosen operating at 0 5 bar differential pressure and a rotational speed of 2 rpm the calculations show that only 0 5 m3 h can be processed using no filter aid for primary sludge filtration using the theoretical rotary drum filter the filtration capacity increases to 3 6 m3 h is achieved with the addition of milled pine filter aid but the highest capacities are achieved using extruded miscanthus pine flakes and extruded willow ranging from 7 0 to 9 2 m3 h sludge filtration capacity 7 m3 h is the approximate flow of primary sludge in the wwtp the sludge was collected marselisborg aarhus vand a s denmark these preliminary small scale filtration results could hence be used to postulate that all the primary sludge could be processed using a continuous rotary drum filter with 8 3 m2 filtration area operating at 0 5 bar and 2 rpm eqn 2 can be rearranged to calculate the filtration area required for a batch pressure filter with low filtration pressure e g 0 5 bar to achieve a flow of 7 m3 h this calculation estimates a required filtration area of around 36 m2 using extruded willow as a filter aid these calculations are however theoretical and the same filtration efficiencies table 1 and specific cake resistances obtained in the current study using lab scale pressure filtration may not be achieved at pilot scale our current efforts are directed at verifying the laboratory results at pilot scale nevertheless the calculations give an approximation of the potential of biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge the final dry matter content measurements of filtrate and filter cake final filtrate mass and filtration efficiencies are listed in table 1 using kieselguhr resulted in the lowest solids content in the filtrate of 0 4 which translates to the highest filtration efficiency of 94 based on total solids removed slightly reduced filtration efficiency is obtained without the use of filter aid with 91 using miscanthus resulted in a final solids concentration in the filtrate of 0 9 translating to a filtration efficiency of 87 this indicates that the filtration efficiency is negatively impacted using miscanthus as additional material such as fine particles salts and soluble carbohydrates are washed out of the biomass filter material compared to not using any filter aid blank filtration tests with only filter aid confirmed this as e g 0 13 g and 0 08 g were washed out from extruded willow and miscanthus respectively taking this into account leads to approximately 1 higher filtration efficiencies on average samples of filtrate were also dried and combusted in order to determine the ash content of the non retained solids and was found to be 44 wt db this means that in terms of organic retention in the filter cake the filtration efficiency is slightly higher at 92 on average vs 87 on total solids as reported in table 1 this translates to an organic carbon content in the filtrate of 0 2 0 3 vs 2 2 in the original sludge sample the filter cakes from all extruded biomass assisted filtration tests essentially perform similar in terms of final dry matter content of filter cake ranging from 20 5 to 22 6 for the use as a slurry in continuous htl these dm contents may be slightly too high to pump typically a dm of 15 20 is desired the addition of additional water to the filtrate in order to obtain the right dm content is however not a problem as the addition of water is performed more easily than its removal the dm of the filter cakes from milled samples misc and pine are higher than the extruded samples most likely due to a more densely packed filter cake and increased filtration times increasing the amount of filter cake relative to sludge resulted in higher levels of total solids in the filtrate and reduced dm filter cakes the previously identified optimal ratio of 0 25 1 resulted in a dm content of 24 which would most likely require slight dilution with filtrate in order to obtain a pumpable slurry if a dm content of 24 was to be obtained by simply adding biomass to the sludge 3 8 g of biomass would be required per g of dry sludge rather than just 0 25 g i e a 15 fold increase in biomass demand secondary sludge filtration using extruded willow led to a higher filtration efficiency compared to primary sludge but in a lower dm content of the filter cake of only 13 1 at a low secondary to primary sludge ratios of 0 5 1 and high ratios 2 5 1 the dm content of the filter cakes are low in the range of 12 14 only at the intermediate rations of 0 75 and 1 5 1 is the dm content in a comparable range to those from primary sludge filtration 19 in general the secondary sludge filtration and combination experiments exhibit higher filtration efficiencies compared to primary sludge filtration 3 2 hydrothermal liquefaction samples of biomass used for filter aid production and raw sewage sludge were subjected to htl either in water or in the presence of homogenous alkali catalyst at 2 wt loading of total slurry this was firstly carried out to investigate the yields and bio crude properties of the individual components used for biomass assisted sludge filtration secondly the effect of catalyst was investigated to shed light on the co liquefaction of filter cake of lignocellulosic biomass without the use of catalyst the yields of bio crude on an organic basis dry ash free daf and the dry basis mass balances to the four fractions bio crude gas solids and process water are presented for all htl experiments in table 2 the proximate and ultimate analysis of the raw samples prior to filtration can be found in the electronic supplementary material table s1 primary sludge htl resulted in a bio crude yield of 37 0 and 42 6 wt daf respectively in the presence and absence of k2co3 pnnl researchers report a bio crude yield of 37 on a dry basis without the use of alkali comparable to the result observed in the current study 35 4 db marrone and moeller 2016 the use of alkali in htl of primary sludge resulted in lower yields of gas and bio crude with an increase in process water yield generally the use of alkali is employed to minimize the char production but this is not observed in sludge liquefaction in the liquefaction of the lignocellulosic biomass samples this is however evident with significant reduction for miscanthus willow and pine surprisingly switchgrass does not show this trend bio crude yields of biomass samples are not necessarily higher with the use of alkali willow and miscanthus are while switchgrass and pine are lower we reported similar observations previously in the liquefaction of 15 types of natural vegetation and agricultural crops where the addition of alkali sometimes increased and sometimes decreased bio crude yields biller et al 2017 the combined filter cake from filtration experiments were processed at the dm contents obtained after filtration ranging from 21 to 29 wt while the individual components were all liquefied at 10 wt loadings it is important to state this as solids loadings have been reported to affect bio crude yields both positively and negatively generally in batch systems as employed in the current study increased solids loadings do not have large effects on bio crude yields faeth and savage 2016 xu and savage 2017 however on continuous systems higher dm slurries have been reported to increase the carbon recovery to bio crude snowden swan et al 2016 and the bio crude yields jazrawi et al 2013 on continuous systems higher solids loadings also increase the energy efficiency as less water is heated per unit of bio crude produced and reduces all equipment and associated capital costs as well as operating costs snowden swan et al 2016 the bio crude yields for combined sewage biomass filter cakes range from 41 to 47 on an organic basis which represents a considerable increase compared to the biomass samples and a slight increase compared to sewage sludge the gas yield in co liquefaction ranges averages at 21 higher than the average for non catalytic liquefaction of individual components 14 5 and lower compared to catalyzed htl 24 as the co liquefaction was carried out without catalyst and the gas yields from sludge were low 16 2 it stands to reason that the co liquefaction of sludge and biomass has similar effects as adding a catalyst in terms of increased gas production and decarboxylation as the majority of gas produced in htl is co2 madsen et al 2015 the yield of water soluble products is low with an average of 22 compared to 40 in non combined liquefaction for both catalytic and non catalytic htl this could represent a positive side effect in addition to the high bio crude yields as it reduces the amounts of product in the water which has to be treated in a wwtp context fig 3 depicts the dry ash free bio crude yields from htl of the combined filter cakes after sludge filtration and theoretical values calculated the theoretical bio crude yields were calculated on basis of linear averaging the results from single feedstocks in the experiments with biomass filter aid and sludge approximately 1 3 of the feedstock going into the htl reaction is biomass while 2 3 are primary sludge primary sludge on its own resulted in a bio crude yield of 42 6 and that of e g miscanthus 22 8 in theory a yield of 2 3 42 6 1 3 22 8 36 0 should be achieved from the combination of filter aid and sludge the measured yield however is shown to be higher at 47 this shows that the combination has a positive synergetic effect on bio crude formation one possible reason could be the breakdown of protein in sludge to nh4 which acts as an alkali agent in the htl reaction alkali catalysts have been shown to increase bio crude yields from lignocellulosic biomass such as miscanthus zhu et al 2014 however the individual processing of biomass samples with and without catalyst in table 2 does not necessarily support this conclusion at least for all biomass samples fig 3 shows however that the increase is observed for all five types of lignocellulosic biomass investigated a further reason could be the increased solids loadings employed in co liquefaction as discussed above co liquefaction of different biomasses has been investigated recently by various researchers as it can increase the viability and scale up potential of htl brilman et al 2017 madsen et al 2017 nazari et al 2017 sintamarean et al 2017 brilman et al 2017 co liquefied combinations of microalgae wood and sugar beet pulp they observed opposite results to the current study with reduced yields of 8 40 compared to the estimated values they also found that if microalgae was employed in the co liquefaction that the bio crude exhibited a higher than proportional nitrogen content this is in agreement with the study by madsen et al 2017 where 11 different biomasses and mixtures were processed the nitrogen content was also shown the increase during co liquefaction while the oxygen content was decreased and the carbon content increased compared to estimated values based on individual components madsen et al 2017 an additional advantage of co liquefaction could be the better pumpability of slurries producing slurries from lignocellulosic biomass is relatively difficult to its hydrophobic nature which can result in phase separation of biomass and water when pressure is applied sintamarean et al 2017 therefore proposed the preparation of slurries from wood and microalgae and macroalgae to improve the pumpability of lignocellulosics sintamarean et al 2017 this was successful in their study and from our preliminary observations this also appears be the case for the sludge biomass combinations representing an additional advantage of sludge co liquefaction 3 3 elemental balances the elemental composition of bio crudes is presented in table 3 alongside the calculated higher heating value hhv using the dulong equation and the energy recovery to the bio crude the energy recovery is a function of the original hhv of the feedstock the bio crude yield and its hhv the results for primary sludge show that it is of no benefit using an alkali catalyst as the yields are lower table 2 oxygen content is higher and the energy recovery around 10 lower miscanthus willow and pine all exhibit benefits in alkali htl the oxygen contents are lower resulting in increased hhv in the case of miscanthus and willow the alkali catalyst also resulted in a higher bio crude yield which in combination leads to a higher energy recovery switchgrass similarly to sludge shows an increase in oxygen content when processed in the presence of potassium carbonate it also exhibits lower yields using this condition contrary to the other biomass feedstocks a likely reason for this could be that switchgrass had the highest nitrogen content of all biomasses at 1 1 and also the highest ash content 7 7 as discussed the nitrogen could lead to higher ph due to formation of nh4 while the ash content could be comprised of alkali salts with a similar effect the co liquefaction of biomass and sludge in the form of filter cake led to improvements in terms of oxygen content hhv and energy recovery particularly the energy recovery is very encouraging with an average of 75 compared to an average of 46 for biomasses and 67 for sludge on its own the co liquefied samples also show a higher hydrogen content most likely stemming from the high hydrogen content obtained from only processing sludge nitrogen and sulphur on the other hand are negatively affected by co liquefaction the bio crudes from only biomass are very low in sulphur content with a maximum of 0 1 although the co liquefaction bio crudes are slightly lower in sulphur than sludge on its own the levels are quite high in the range of 0 5 0 7 co liquefaction of sludge with low nitrogen biomass feedstocks also did not have the desired effect of reducing nitrogen in the combined bio crude the values are relatively high with an average of 2 4 compared to the biomass bio crudes but in comparison to e g microalgae 5 9 jazrawi et al 2013 xu and savage 2017 or dried distillers grain with solubles 5 biller et al 2016b the values are reasonable in htl is it important to try to reduce the amount of heteroatoms as much as possible for subsequent hydrotreating the more heteroatoms are present the more hydrogen is required for hydrogenation overall carbon and nitrogen balances for primary sludge htl are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the diagrams are based on 1000 kg of sludge input at 5 dm the values are calculated from the overall carbon and nitrogen balances which are included in the electronic supplementary material table s2 and s3 respectively the carbon balances achieved mass balance closures of 100 6 5 on average the nitrogen balances achieved a mass balance closure of 100 6 5 average for samples containing sludge while the low nitrogen biomass samples only achieved an average of 100 25 for calculation of the visual representation in fig 3 the sum of the individual carbon values to each fraction were normalized to 100 fig 4 b and fig 5b depict the biomass filter aid co liquefaction process where an additional input of 11 kg c are included this represents the 0 5 1 filter aid to dm sludge ratio and all four diagrams are based on extruded miscanthus sludge htl fig 4a is shown to have a carbon recovery to bio crude of 57 19 to the water phase 10 to gas co2 and solid residue each for nitrogen the majority is fractionated into the water phase with 58 followed by the bio crude with 33 and the solid residue 8 it is assumed no nitrogen is found in the gas phase in terms of wastewater treatment a 57 carbon efficiency to bio crude is very encouraging traditional wwtp will lose around half of the sludge s carbon during aeration as co2 the remaining half is anaerobically digested to methane and carbon dioxide optimistically a carbon to methane efficiency of around 25 can be achieved using this traditional approach mccarty et al 2011 in a future htl sludge process the htl process water will still have to be cleaned as the main objective of a wwtp is naturally to treat wastewater the 4 kg of carbon and 0 7 kg of nitrogen shown in figs 4a and 5a will be present as a particle and pathogen free solution in a htl wwt context there appear three likely scenarios for this hydrothermal gasification htg using the existing wwtp processes to deal with the water e g aeration anaerobic digestion etc or to use a dedicated anaerobic digester with immobilized methanogens such as an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion uasb reactor the htg option would require additional infrastructure but will convert the organic content of the htl water to methane and carbon dioxide this option has been shown to result in cod values as low as 20 50 mgo2 l marrone and moeller 2016 in the htg effluent however the nitrogen levels are too high for discharge so that an additional nitrogen removal step would be required it has also been suggested to perform htg for hydrogen production which could potentially be used for hydrogenation of the bio crude this approach has shown cod reduction of 98 watson et al 2017 the alternative to htg of htl process waters is ad it was recently suggested in a techno economic analysis that this approach could be less costly for the clean up of htl waters due to lower capital and operating costs gerber van doren et al 2017 and could make sense if these facilities are already in place at a wwtp ad of htl waters from sewage sludge has not been reported but from algae and modeled food waste htl waters posmanik et al 2017 tommaso et al 2015 in both studies a biodegradability of around 60 of organics was achieved the current results suggest a c n ratio of 6 for the htl sludge scenario while ratios of 20 30 are considered ideal for ad allen et al 2016 if the ad scenario and utilization of existing wwtp unit operations aeration and or ad is chosen the reduction of carbon to treat would be 81 the use of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion reactors uasb for the htl aqueous effluents is not studied but holds some potential for this stream with high concentration of organics the anaerobic digestion routes could potentially suffer from inhibition of the anaerobic digestion process by inhibitory compounds such as nh4 n and certain organic compounds such as phenols which can induce a lag phase tommaso et al 2015 however studies have shown that using dilutions e g 30 v v fernandez et al 2018 during the ad process and allowing for lag phases htl waters can successfully be digested with a biodegradability of up to around 60 if htl were to be used directly on sludge the problem is the low dm content of the sludge feed 5 as shown in scenario fig 4a in this scenario the 1000 kg of feed would require around 1500 mj to heat to 350 c while producing 18 kg of bio crude with an energy content of 38 mj kg which translates to 673 mj i e less than half the energy required to heat the water this would equal an energy return on investment eroi of 0 4 newly developed htl plants are able to recover heat and our pilot plant is able to recover around 85 which would mean that the eroi would be around 3 0 the proposed scenario including the biomass filter aid filtration could be processed at 20 dm feed producing around 84 kg bio crude with a hhv of 36 mj 3024 mj total while still requiring approximately 1500 mj to heat up the feed this translates to an eroi of 2 0 without heat recovery and 13 5 with in terms of energy balance the advantage of the filtration step is therefore evident with a 4 5 fold increase in eroi figs 4b and 5b shows the filter cake co liquefaction scenarios carbon and nitrogen balances respectively the input carbon is now increased to 32 kg due to the addition of 11 kg c from the biomass filter aid the filtration step itself is around 90 efficient in terms of carbon a combined 29 kg c are available for co liquefaction a total of 19 kg c bio crude are produced compared to the 12 kg in the htl only scenario due to the addition of additional carbon from the filter aid but also from higher bio crude yields carbon fractionation to the gas and solid is similar to the standalone scenario the aqueous effluent consists of a large volume filtrate from primary filtrate with a total of 3 kg non retained c and a sterile high concentration water phase from the htl process water 4 kg c the amount of nitrogen to the process water is not increased using the new scenario but slight increases to bio crude and solids are observed 8 kg represents a 62 reduction in c to treat compared to treating all of the sludge c using traditional wwt and a reduction of 42 nitrogen to treat the c n ratio is increased to an average of 11 1 in the htl combination bringing it closer to the desired ratio for microbial utilisation overall the results show a promising technology by combining biomass assisted filtration of sludge with htl the main advantages lie in the superior bio crude yields and quality due to synergistic effects and the improved energy efficiency of the process due to higher dm slurries in on going investigations we will assess the technology for filtration of primary influent to the wwtp where dm contents are even lower 0 01 0 04 this could reduce the land and energy requirements of wwtp for clarifiers and thickening tanks during primary treatment a further possibility of the technology is to use wetland biomass plantations as tertiary treatment of the wwtp effluents for nitrogen removal the biomass could then directly be utilised on site for filter aid production our future efforts on the technology will examine such possibilities and a focus will also lie on understanding the chemical reaction pathways that lead to the observed positive synergistic effects in co liquefaction 4 conclusions the novel combination of using biomass as a filter aid for primary sludge filtration and subsequent co liquefaction for bio crude production is shown to be a very promising approach due to several advantages over both traditional wwtps and htl of sludge on its own primary sludge filtration times of are reduced from around 40 to 1 min with a moderate penalty in filtration efficiency on average 92 of carbon is retained in the filter cake which exhibit a dm content of 21 29 for further htl processing the higher dm results in a 4 5 fold increase in energy return on energy invested eroi of the htl process synergistic effects in co liquefaction are observed resulting in higher bio crude yields and an increase in chemical energy recovery to 75 vs 46 for biomass and 67 for sludge the integration of filter aid co liquefaction in existing wwtp would reduce the carbon and nitrogen amount to treat by 62 and 42 respectively acknowledgments the

promising technology for biofuel production and treatment of wastewater sludge the current study investigates a novel utilization of biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge to obtain high dry matter dm content sludge drastic improvements in filtration speed are achieved using different types of lignocellulosic biomass filter aids prepared via mechanical pre treatment the combined sludge biomass filter cake is subsequently used as a feedstock for htl and shows superior bio crude yields and properties compared to their individual counterparts the chemical energy recovery to bio crude is increased to 75 compared to 46 for biomass and 67 for sludge on its own the increased dm content of filter cakes 25 compared to primary sludge 5 increases the energy efficiency of htl of primary sludge by a factor of 4 5 introducing a biomass filteraid htl combination to a wastewater treatment plant would reduce the organic carbon load to treat by 62 by combining sludge with lignocellulosic biomass the use of alkali catalyst can be avoided entirely which represents a major cost factor in htl of lignocellulosics graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater primary sludge hydrothermal liquefaction filtration filter aid biomass 1 introduction the modern conception of wastewater is more to see it as a resource of energy and nutrients rather than a waste with the possibility of net energy extraction and nutrient conservation mccarty et al 2011 the utilisation of wastewater treatment wwt sludge is an area of on going investment and research around the world current treatment practices for sludge include anaerobic digestion dewatering and incineration in a typical wastewater treatment plant wwtp incoming wastewater is screened and thickened during primary treatment and primary sludge removed the non sludge fraction is subsequently treated aerobically to reduce bod cod by oxidization of organic carbon the aerobic heterotrophic bacteria produce waste activated sludge flocculating bacterial biomass which settles easily for recovery since the heterotrophic aerobic bacteria typically has a growth yield about 0 5 around half of the wastewater s carbon is converted into co2 in this process henze et al 2001 the sludge produced from aeration is termed waste activated sludge which can be combined with primary sludge and anaerobically digested to produce methane and co2 this final digestate is considered safe for landfill disposal incineration or is sometimes used as fertiliser the latter has been subject to controversy due to unresolved problems with slurry content of micropollutants e g pharmaceuticals non degraded organics such as plastics and heavy metals another drawback of this treatment process is the inefficient use of the wastewaters carbon since typically 70 75 is converted to co2 50 in the aeration process and another 40 50 of the remainder in the anaerobic digestion process only 20 30 of the carbon can be conserved as methane amounting to less than half the incoming energy content thus a much more efficient carbon and energy recuperation is critical for the transformation of wastewater treatment to become net energy producing in one study the aeration process was shown to use 42 of the wwtp s total electricity consumption yeshi et al 2013 it is therefore an extremely attractive strategy to separate as much carbon as possible from the wastewater before aeration for bod reduction this conserves the separated carbon as an energy carrier and significantly lowers the energy demand for aeration hydrothermal liquefaction htl has been proposed as a technology for sludge management which can process wastewater sludges more efficiently by applying high heat and pressure to the slurries producing a liquid bio crude subsequent upgrading of the bio crude via hydrotreating then produces renewable fuels with a high proportion of middle distillate fuels diesel and kerosene the htl process is characterised by high carbon efficiency low residence time 20 min and high throughput resulting in low land requirements htl is a potential technology for the production of renewable aviation fuels with competitive cost and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to other renewable biofuel technologies and favourable over petro fuels de jong et al 2017 de jong et al 2015 until now most htl applications have been identified as conversion of lignocellulosic side streams such as straw wood waste or energy crops in these processes the lignocellulosic materials are milled to small particles and suspended in water to make a pumpable slurry with 10 20 dm the pacific northwest national laboratory pnnl and genifuel corporation recently published a comprehensive report on the htl technology for sludge processing for the water environment reuse foundation werf marrone and moeller 2016 all three types of sludge primary sludge secondary waste activated sludge and digested solids were converted to bio crude yields dry basis including ash of 37 25 and 34 respectively demonstrating the potential of htl for sludge management the report highlighted the reduction of waste solid material of 94 99 compared to common wwt practices the promising results from the technical investigation and a techno economic analysis led to an assessment of the total amounts of sludge available for bioenergy production in the us seiple et al 2017 it estimated that the us treat 130 5 million m3 of wastewater per day which generates millions of tons of sludge annually seiple et al 2017 state that 14 mt per annum of dry solids are produced in the us of which only 50 are beneficially used e g biogas production or incineration for combined heat and power seiple et al 2017 the influent flow into wwtp is typically very dilute in the range of 0 01 0 04 total suspended solids during primary treatment and after removal of bulky items from the influent primary sludge is obtained at solids concentrations of 2 6 wt after primary clarifiers and thickeners dewatering to higher solids concentrations is desired in many applications as it reduces the transportation cost when less water is transported if sludge is used for energy production via hydrothermal liquefaction it is important to increase the solids concentration as far as possible while still forming a pumpable slurry higher solids concentrations achieve higher energy efficiencies as less water is heated in the process in relation to organic material ideal dry matter content of slurries for htl are around 15 20 wt a recent techno economic assessment found that if the solids concentrations of wwt sludges can be increased from 12 to 20 a 30 cost reduction in minimum fuel price mfsp could be achieved snowden swan et al 2016 sludges are however notoriously difficult to dewater due to the presence of extra cellular polymeric material it has been reported to make up 80 of primary sludge and includes proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids and phospholipids skinner et al 2015 one way of improving sludge dewatering properties is the use of filter aids qi et al 2011 in the current investigation we propose to use biomass as filter aid for the filtration of wastewater filter aids act as skeleton builders during filtration operations and aid the filtration process by speeding up the process and obtaining slurries with higher solids content during the filter cake formation filter aids increase the porosity of the cake and hence reduce the specific cake resistance which results in faster filtration the use of filter aids is not novel but commonly filter aids are produced from inorganic material such as diatomic earth kieselguhr zeolites or polymeric material the issue with these types of filter aids is their high cost once the filter aid is clogged it has to be replaced and ideally recovered to be re used in practice this is difficult to achieve and hence the application of filter aids is not implemented at large scale in wwtps the novelty in the current investigation is to use a filter aid produced from lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for the htl process in combination with the filtration media sewage sludge the htl fuel production step can produce bio crude from both the filter aid and the sewage sludge in addition to making the lignocellulosic biomass pumpable for htl conversion the main advantage being that the solids concentration can be increased in the slurry with a filter aid which aids both the filtration and the htl process a similar approach to increasing the solids concentration without the filtration aspect was recently suggested in two separate publications zhang et al 2017 performed hydrothermal co carbonization of sewage sludge with pinewood sawdust for hydro char production zhang et al 2017 they found that the co carbonization led to significant synergistic enhancements in the bio char yields and carbon retentions nazari et al 2017 similarly performed co liquefaction of waste activated sludge and birchwood sawdust nazari et al 2017 the waste activated sludge had a moisture content of 96 1 and was mixed with sawdust to achieve solids concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 wt to achieve the solids concentration of 15 wt daf sawdust was added at a ratio of 3 8 1 relative to dry sludge i e almost 4 times as much sawdust as dry sludge was necessary to obtain slurry with optimal solids concentration in a scenario where dry biomass is limited this could pose a potential problem when large amounts of sludge are to be treated and it may require a costly drying process for the biomass the proposed method can negate the requirement for such large dry biomass demand while still producing high solids content slurries therefore in the current paper we investigate the use of different biomass materials as filter aids for sludge filtration in order to obtain higher solids loading slurries for hydrothermal liquefaction a range of different biomasses are examined and particularly filter aids produced by extrusion pre treatment of as harvested biomass are investigated the extrusion process tears apart the plant s macromolecular structures and results in a fibrous structure which is hypothesized to be particularly suited for filtration applications compared to e g milling or grinding which produces primarily spherical particles the combined filter cake of sludge and filter aid material produced from biomass is then processed under htl conditions for bio crude production this study into the novel combination of slurry preparation for htl and co liquefaction is carried out with the following objectives to investigate if extruded biomass exhibits good filtration properties for primary and secondary sludge if suitable dry matter content slurries for htl can be produced using biomass assisted filtration to investigate any synergistic effects in co liquefaction of combined filter cake for bio crude yields and properties to provide an overview of carbon and energy flows in a co liquefaction system compared to only htl of sludge to assess if the addition of alkali catalysts can be avoided in co liquefaction of lignocellulosics and sludge the last objective is motivated by the prior knowledge that lignocellulosic material generally requires an alkali htl environment for satisfactory performance if the ph is too low acid catalyzed decomposition of carbohydrate reactions are favored over useful aldol condensation reactions which leads to increased char production feedstocks high in nitrogen such as algae and sewage sludge generally do not require an alkali catalyst as the n containing protein decomposes to nh4 leading to a more alkali environment biller and ross 2011 this means the addition of alkali can be avoided biller et al 2016 therefore the co liquefaction of lignocellulosics with a feedstock high in n such as sewage sludge could negate the use of costly alkali catalyst the alkali catalyst can account for over 10 of the operating cost excluding biomass feed of a htl plant tews et al 2014 2 materials and methods primary and secondary sludge samples were collected at the marselisborg wwtp aarhus denmark operated by aarhus vand a s primary sludge was obtained after screening grease and grit removal processes primary clarifiers and sludge thickeners secondary sludge was the excess waste activated sludge from the biological tank after secondary clarifiers filtration tests were carried out using a 240 ml batch pressure filter operated at 0 8 mpa and a filtration area of 50 27 cm2 tests were carried out using a wire mesh mesh 40 or using fisherbrand filter papers type ql100 during each experiment 200 ml of primary sludge with 5 g of filter aid were employed unless otherwise stated for experiments using extruded miscanthus the filter aid material was added at varying levels of 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 0 g the filter aid method known as body feed was used which entails mixing of the filter aid with the media prior to filtration time resolved mass recordings were obtained from the filtrate as soon as the filter pressurization valve was opened samples of filtrate and filter aid were collected at the end of the filtration experiments homogenized filter cake samples were analysed for moisture content in triplicate using a mettler toledo he53 moisture analyser filtrate samples were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h to measure the dry matter content the drying methods correspond to the awwa method 2540 d for total suspended solids tss the dry filtrate samples were then heated to 550 c for 5 h to determine the ash content filter aid materials were produced from willow miscanthus and switchgrass via extrusion extruded biomass was prepared from roughly chopped material 10 50 mm using an extruder xinda 65 mm twin screw extruder with 2000 mm barrel length miscanthus was harvested early autumn with leaves and had a natural content of water of 30 willow was harvested as year sprouts in the winter and had a water content of 50 whereas switchgrass harvested in early autumn had a 45 water content additionally miscanthus only stems was milled using a knife mill and separated using a vibrating sieve shaker to obtain particles in the size range of 180 250 μm pine flakes as well as hammer milled pine flakes were sourced from a commercial wood shaving supplier agroform a s denmark the six different biomass samples used as filter aid are shown in fig 1s electronic supplementary visual inspection of the samples led to following estimations on size and geometry of the samples where aspect ratio is calculated as the ratio of the particles diameter to length pine milled particles range from 0 2 to 3 mm mean 2 mm length to diameter ratio aspect ratio

extruded particles 0 1 8 mm aspect ratio 10 40 willow extruded particles 0 1 8 mm aspect ratio 5 35 commercial filter aids were purchased from sigma aldrich cellulose sigma aldrich dk cellulose fibrous medium pn c6288 and kieselguhr sigma aldrich dk kieselguhr calcined purified pn 18514 in order to calculate the effect of filter aid on the specific cake resistance and estimate filtration capacities in a rotary drum filter following calculations were applied the kozeny carman equation carman 1997 1 δ p f l 180 1 ε 2 ε 3 μv s d p 2 the equation describes the pressure loss in systems involving laminar flow through packed beds approximating them to a group of capillary tubes and using darcy s law as the cake resistance term in the equation this equation can be rearranged to a useful function which relates the rate and the volume of filtrate as summarized by foust et al 1980 foust et al 1980 assuming that the liquid suspension is homogeneous during the experiment we have 2

2010 using eqn 3 3 v 2 3 α w 2 α w p μ 1 2 f 3 2 t c 1 2 a where w is the combined solids content in the sludge 7 5 5 from primary sludge plus filter aid δp the differential pressure applied to the

area length 2 m radius 0 67 m area 8 38 m2 samples of biomass filter aid filter cake and primary sludge were processed via hydrothermal liquefaction in 20 ml batch reactors at 340 c for 20 min the procedure has been published previously biller et al 2016b briefly the htl procedure consisted of loading the sample slurry into the batch reactors sealing them and submerging them into a pre heated fluidized sand bath after 20 min total reaction time in the sand bath the reactors were quickly removed and quenched in a water bath after cleaning the outside of the reactors from sand and water they were weighed carefully vented and weighed again to determine the mass of gas produced the water phase was then decanted into a centrifuge tube and the reactor rinsed with 3 aliquots 3 ml each of dichloromethane dcm and recovered in a separate centrifuge tube the tube with the aqueous phase was spun in a centrifuge and the supernatant recovered using a pipette in a separate tube the remaining contents from the two tubes were recovered using dcm and vacuum filtered through a pre weighed filter paper and rinsed with dcm until clear the filter paper was dried and re weighed to determine the mass of solid residue produced the dcm phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and the remaining bio crude mass determined gravimetrically the yields of aqueous soluble product was determined by difference from the three measured fractions gas solids and bio crude biomass bio crude and htl solid residue samples were analyzed for elemental content using an elementar vario macro cube elemental analyser langenselbold germany water phase samples were analysed for total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn content using hach lange cuvette tests lck 387 lck338 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge fig 1 a c shows the filtration curves from experiments carried out using primary sludge with 5 dry matter content fig 1d shows the results for secondary waste activated sludge 1 7 dry matter content and mixtures of secondary and primary sludge all tests were carried out with only a wire mesh and no filter paper in the filtration apparatus fig 1a shows the use of extruded miscanthus and the commercial filter aid kieselguhr diatomaceous earth and compares the filtration curves to not using any filter aid at all the use of extruded miscanthus filter aid results in a dramatic improvement of filterability of the primary sludge sample constant filtrate mass is obtained after 1 min with a total of 141 g filtrate obtained constant filtrate mass is only achieved after approximately 2500 s for both kieselguhr and no filter aid experiments the total amount of filtrate obtained using miscanthus filter aid is lower compared to kieselguhr and no filter aid this is due to the additional water holding capacity of the miscanthus filter aid to residual water in the sludge the filtration time using extruded miscanthus filter aid is drastically reduced from around 40 min down to 1 min the specific cake resistance using extruded miscanthus was reduced around 180 fold compared to no filter aid as shown in fig 2 a fig 1b compares the different types of biomass filter aid materials investigated the experiments without filter aid and the commercial filter aid are not included in the graph but can be compared to fig 1a as the experimental conditions were the same the scale of the graph is changed to allow more detail most biomasses performed similar apart from milled miscanthus and pine seen by the filtration curves but also by the specific cake resistances plotted in fig 2a the milled samples represent the smallest and most spherical particles it is likely that this decreases the porosity of the filter cake resulting in a higher cake resistance all extruded biomasses and the pine flakes exhibited good filtration aid properties with very fast filtration completed after around 1 min the two experiments with finely milled biomass miscanthus and pine resulted in higher final filtrate mass of 150 160 g compared to 140 g for extruded biomass and pine flakes in terms of filtration performance the type of biomass used does not appear to have an effect while the type of biomass filter aid preparation does have an influence extrusion was chosen as a size reduction and preparation technique as it is currently used in our laboratories for the preparation of slurries for htl on a continuous pilot scale htl system in our experience the extrusion process produces a low density fluffy material with few hard particles which could block the high pressure pumping system it is also easier to soak the extruded biomass with water for slurry preparation than it is for biomass processed in a different way e g saw dust or milled particles the extrusion process is also performed in the presence of water either from the natural moisture content in fresh biomass 30 70 or added to the extruder to obtain the right moisture content for the process of around 50 i e it avoids the necessity of drying the biomass before size reduction the advantages of the extrusion process for slurry preparation for continuous htl are hence apparent and some of these advantages may apply for filter aid preparation however in filtration experiments the fine pine flakes gave comparable results as can be seen by the filtration curves and cake resistances for pine flakes and extruded biomass respectively filtration experiments in fig 1 a b were carried out using 5 g of filter aid while the experiments in fig 1c present the results of varying the amount of filter aid misc ext from 1 to 10 g with a constant 200 ml of sludge in terms of filter aid to dry sludge dm ratio this represents 0 1 1 to 1 1 using only 1 g of filter resulted in improved filtration time compared to not using any filter aid at all fig 1a but considerably longer final filtration time is observed compared to the experiments using 5 g filter aid fig 1c all experiments in varying amount of filter aid exhibit the same steep initial filtration curve but at 60 g of filtrate recovered the 1 g experiment slows down compared to the rest the experiment with 2 5 g is complete after around 100 s which is around 3 times as long as the fastest experiment at 33 s when 7 5 g of filter aid is used in terms of practical applications is may however be more viable to use 2 5 g of filter aid as it exhibits vastly improved filtration times compared to not using any filter aid and only 0 25 g of filter aid is required per g of dry sludge processed the graph also shows that the amount of filtrate consistently reduces with increasing amount of filter aid added this is due to the additional water holding capacity of the increased amount of biomass present the filtration times are directly related to the cake resistance plotted in fig 2a which confirm the good performance of the 0 25 1 filter aid ratio comparing no filter aid to 0 1 1 ratio results in a 1 8 fold reduction of cake resistance the change from 0 1 1 to 0 25 1 ratio resulted in a 50 fold reduction in resistance while the other steps 0 25 1 0 5 1 0 75 1 1 1 also only showed a reduction of 1 8 fold in cake resistance although the main objective of the work is to valorize primary sludge it is worthwhile looking at the filtration behavior of secondary sludge as it can likely be co processed in future htl wwt systems at the wwtp the current samples were collected approximately 3200 dry tons primary sludge at 5 dm and 1600 dry tons excess secondary sludge 1 7 dm are produced annually hence fig 2d includes combinations of secondary to primary sludge filtration experiments to reflect this composition secondary sludge on its own could not be filtered with a filter paper or without due to the filter clogging instantly with filter aid and no retention of solids with just the wire mesh with the use of filter aid reasonable filtration times of around 400 s were observed for secondary sludge interestingly the combination of secondary to primary sludge of 3 5 1 using 5 g extruded willow could not be filtered satisfactory with a filtration time of around 20 min decreasing the secondary to primary sludge ratio to 2 5 1 with filter aid resulted in fast filtration times comparable to primary sludge decreasing the secondary to primary ratio further to 1 5 0 75 and 0 5 all showed good filtration performances within the margin of error to each other at around 80 100 s filtration time however increasing the ratio to a higher value of 3 5 1 resulted in a slow filtration of almost 20 min using no filter aid neither the 2 5 1 or 3 5 1 secondary to primary sludge combinations could be filtered why the 3 5 1 sludge combination does not filter even with the use of filter aid is currently unclear and deserves further investigation at the wwtp the samples were obtained from the secondary to primary production ratio is in the order of 1 25 2 5 1 in a range where good filtration performance shown in fig 1d filtration experiments on primary sludge were also carried out using a filter paper in addition to the wire mesh these were generally very slow and did not show good filtration performance overall the different biomass assisted filtration experiments show that if the particle size is not too small the preparation method and type of biomass as filter aid are not significant in terms of filtration performance the cake resistances of extruded switchgrass extruded miscanthus and pine flakes and miscanthus are not significantly different from each other 95 of confidence t test but milled pine is statistically different filtration times are reduced from around 40 min 1 min with the use of biomass filter aid and specific cake resistances are reduced by 180 300 times 0 25 1 ratio of filter aid to dry matter sludge appears optimal for primary sludge filtration with fast filtration time low cake resistance and low biomass requirement fig 2a shows the specific filter cake resistances calculated using eqn 2 on a logarithmic scale the data visualizes the improvements obtained using the different biomasses and the advantage of the larger filter aid particles the cake resistance were used to estimate the filtration capacity of a rotary drum vacuum filtration system using eqn 3 a theoretical rotary drum with 2 m length and 0 67 m radius resulting in a filtration area of 8 34 m2 was chosen operating at 0 5 bar differential pressure and a rotational speed of 2 rpm the calculations show that only 0 5 m3 h can be processed using no filter aid for primary sludge filtration using the theoretical rotary drum filter the filtration capacity increases to 3 6 m3 h is achieved with the addition of milled pine filter aid but the highest capacities are achieved using extruded miscanthus pine flakes and extruded willow ranging from 7 0 to 9 2 m3 h sludge filtration capacity 7 m3 h is the approximate flow of primary sludge in the wwtp the sludge was collected marselisborg aarhus vand a s denmark these preliminary small scale filtration results could hence be used to postulate that all the primary sludge could be processed using a continuous rotary drum filter with 8 3 m2 filtration area operating at 0 5 bar and 2 rpm eqn 2 can be rearranged to calculate the filtration area required for a batch pressure filter with low filtration pressure e g 0 5 bar to achieve a flow of 7 m3 h this calculation estimates a required filtration area of around 36 m2 using extruded willow as a filter aid these calculations are however theoretical and the same filtration efficiencies table 1 and specific cake resistances obtained in the current study using lab scale pressure filtration may not be achieved at pilot scale our current efforts are directed at verifying the laboratory results at pilot scale nevertheless the calculations give an approximation of the potential of biomass assisted filtration of primary sludge the final dry matter content measurements of filtrate and filter cake final filtrate mass and filtration efficiencies are listed in table 1 using kieselguhr resulted in the lowest solids content in the filtrate of 0 4 which translates to the highest filtration efficiency of 94 based on total solids removed slightly reduced filtration efficiency is obtained without the use of filter aid with 91 using miscanthus resulted in a final solids concentration in the filtrate of 0 9 translating to a filtration efficiency of 87 this indicates that the filtration efficiency is negatively impacted using miscanthus as additional material such as fine particles salts and soluble carbohydrates are washed out of the biomass filter material compared to not using any filter aid blank filtration tests with only filter aid confirmed this as e g 0 13 g and 0 08 g were washed out from extruded willow and miscanthus respectively taking this into account leads to approximately 1 higher filtration efficiencies on average samples of filtrate were also dried and combusted in order to determine the ash content of the non retained solids and was found to be 44 wt db this means that in terms of organic retention in the filter cake the filtration efficiency is slightly higher at 92 on average vs 87 on total solids as reported in table 1 this translates to an organic carbon content in the filtrate of 0 2 0 3 vs 2 2 in the original sludge sample the filter cakes from all extruded biomass assisted filtration tests essentially perform similar in terms of final dry matter content of filter cake ranging from 20 5 to 22 6 for the use as a slurry in continuous htl these dm contents may be slightly too high to pump typically a dm of 15 20 is desired the addition of additional water to the filtrate in order to obtain the right dm content is however not a problem as the addition of water is performed more easily than its removal the dm of the filter cakes from milled samples misc and pine are higher than the extruded samples most likely due to a more densely packed filter cake and increased filtration times increasing the amount of filter cake relative to sludge resulted in higher levels of total solids in the filtrate and reduced dm filter cakes the previously identified optimal ratio of 0 25 1 resulted in a dm content of 24 which would most likely require slight dilution with filtrate in order to obtain a pumpable slurry if a dm content of 24 was to be obtained by simply adding biomass to the sludge 3 8 g of biomass would be required per g of dry sludge rather than just 0 25 g i e a 15 fold increase in biomass demand secondary sludge filtration using extruded willow led to a higher filtration efficiency compared to primary sludge but in a lower dm content of the filter cake of only 13 1 at a low secondary to primary sludge ratios of 0 5 1 and high ratios 2 5 1 the dm content of the filter cakes are low in the range of 12 14 only at the intermediate rations of 0 75 and 1 5 1 is the dm content in a comparable range to those from primary sludge filtration 19 in general the secondary sludge filtration and combination experiments exhibit higher filtration efficiencies compared to primary sludge filtration 3 2 hydrothermal liquefaction samples of biomass used for filter aid production and raw sewage sludge were subjected to htl either in water or in the presence of homogenous alkali catalyst at 2 wt loading of total slurry this was firstly carried out to investigate the yields and bio crude properties of the individual components used for biomass assisted sludge filtration secondly the effect of catalyst was investigated to shed light on the co liquefaction of filter cake of lignocellulosic biomass without the use of catalyst the yields of bio crude on an organic basis dry ash free daf and the dry basis mass balances to the four fractions bio crude gas solids and process water are presented for all htl experiments in table 2 the proximate and ultimate analysis of the raw samples prior to filtration can be found in the electronic supplementary material table s1 primary sludge htl resulted in a bio crude yield of 37 0 and 42 6 wt daf respectively in the presence and absence of k2co3 pnnl researchers report a bio crude yield of 37 on a dry basis without the use of alkali comparable to the result observed in the current study 35 4 db marrone and moeller 2016 the use of alkali in htl of primary sludge resulted in lower yields of gas and bio crude with an increase in process water yield generally the use of alkali is employed to minimize the char production but this is not observed in sludge liquefaction in the liquefaction of the lignocellulosic biomass samples this is however evident with significant reduction for miscanthus willow and pine surprisingly switchgrass does not show this trend bio crude yields of biomass samples are not necessarily higher with the use of alkali willow and miscanthus are while switchgrass and pine are lower we reported similar observations previously in the liquefaction of 15 types of natural vegetation and agricultural crops where the addition of alkali sometimes increased and sometimes decreased bio crude yields biller et al 2017 the combined filter cake from filtration experiments were processed at the dm contents obtained after filtration ranging from 21 to 29 wt while the individual components were all liquefied at 10 wt loadings it is important to state this as solids loadings have been reported to affect bio crude yields both positively and negatively generally in batch systems as employed in the current study increased solids loadings do not have large effects on bio crude yields faeth and savage 2016 xu and savage 2017 however on continuous systems higher dm slurries have been reported to increase the carbon recovery to bio crude snowden swan et al 2016 and the bio crude yields jazrawi et al 2013 on continuous systems higher solids loadings also increase the energy efficiency as less water is heated per unit of bio crude produced and reduces all equipment and associated capital costs as well as operating costs snowden swan et al 2016 the bio crude yields for combined sewage biomass filter cakes range from 41 to 47 on an organic basis which represents a considerable increase compared to the biomass samples and a slight increase compared to sewage sludge the gas yield in co liquefaction ranges averages at 21 higher than the average for non catalytic liquefaction of individual components 14 5 and lower compared to catalyzed htl 24 as the co liquefaction was carried out without catalyst and the gas yields from sludge were low 16 2 it stands to reason that the co liquefaction of sludge and biomass has similar effects as adding a catalyst in terms of increased gas production and decarboxylation as the majority of gas produced in htl is co2 madsen et al 2015 the yield of water soluble products is low with an average of 22 compared to 40 in non combined liquefaction for both catalytic and non catalytic htl this could represent a positive side effect in addition to the high bio crude yields as it reduces the amounts of product in the water which has to be treated in a wwtp context fig 3 depicts the dry ash free bio crude yields from htl of the combined filter cakes after sludge filtration and theoretical values calculated the theoretical bio crude yields were calculated on basis of linear averaging the results from single feedstocks in the experiments with biomass filter aid and sludge approximately 1 3 of the feedstock going into the htl reaction is biomass while 2 3 are primary sludge primary sludge on its own resulted in a bio crude yield of 42 6 and that of e g miscanthus 22 8 in theory a yield of 2 3 42 6 1 3 22 8 36 0 should be achieved from the combination of filter aid and sludge the measured yield however is shown to be higher at 47 this shows that the combination has a positive synergetic effect on bio crude formation one possible reason could be the breakdown of protein in sludge to nh4 which acts as an alkali agent in the htl reaction alkali catalysts have been shown to increase bio crude yields from lignocellulosic biomass such as miscanthus zhu et al 2014 however the individual processing of biomass samples with and without catalyst in table 2 does not necessarily support this conclusion at least for all biomass samples fig 3 shows however that the increase is observed for all five types of lignocellulosic biomass investigated a further reason could be the increased solids loadings employed in co liquefaction as discussed above co liquefaction of different biomasses has been investigated recently by various researchers as it can increase the viability and scale up potential of htl brilman et al 2017 madsen et al 2017 nazari et al 2017 sintamarean et al 2017 brilman et al 2017 co liquefied combinations of microalgae wood and sugar beet pulp they observed opposite results to the current study with reduced yields of 8 40 compared to the estimated values they also found that if microalgae was employed in the co liquefaction that the bio crude exhibited a higher than proportional nitrogen content this is in agreement with the study by madsen et al 2017 where 11 different biomasses and mixtures were processed the nitrogen content was also shown the increase during co liquefaction while the oxygen content was decreased and the carbon content increased compared to estimated values based on individual components madsen et al 2017 an additional advantage of co liquefaction could be the better pumpability of slurries producing slurries from lignocellulosic biomass is relatively difficult to its hydrophobic nature which can result in phase separation of biomass and water when pressure is applied sintamarean et al 2017 therefore proposed the preparation of slurries from wood and microalgae and macroalgae to improve the pumpability of lignocellulosics sintamarean et al 2017 this was successful in their study and from our preliminary observations this also appears be the case for the sludge biomass combinations representing an additional advantage of sludge co liquefaction 3 3 elemental balances the elemental composition of bio crudes is presented in table 3 alongside the calculated higher heating value hhv using the dulong equation and the energy recovery to the bio crude the energy recovery is a function of the original hhv of the feedstock the bio crude yield and its hhv the results for primary sludge show that it is of no benefit using an alkali catalyst as the yields are lower table 2 oxygen content is higher and the energy recovery around 10 lower miscanthus willow and pine all exhibit benefits in alkali htl the oxygen contents are lower resulting in increased hhv in the case of miscanthus and willow the alkali catalyst also resulted in a higher bio crude yield which in combination leads to a higher energy recovery switchgrass similarly to sludge shows an increase in oxygen content when processed in the presence of potassium carbonate it also exhibits lower yields using this condition contrary to the other biomass feedstocks a likely reason for this could be that switchgrass had the highest nitrogen content of all biomasses at 1 1 and also the highest ash content 7 7 as discussed the nitrogen could lead to higher ph due to formation of nh4 while the ash content could be comprised of alkali salts with a similar effect the co liquefaction of biomass and sludge in the form of filter cake led to improvements in terms of oxygen content hhv and energy recovery particularly the energy recovery is very encouraging with an average of 75 compared to an average of 46 for biomasses and 67 for sludge on its own the co liquefied samples also show a higher hydrogen content most likely stemming from the high hydrogen content obtained from only processing sludge nitrogen and sulphur on the other hand are negatively affected by co liquefaction the bio crudes from only biomass are very low in sulphur content with a maximum of 0 1 although the co liquefaction bio crudes are slightly lower in sulphur than sludge on its own the levels are quite high in the range of 0 5 0 7 co liquefaction of sludge with low nitrogen biomass feedstocks also did not have the desired effect of reducing nitrogen in the combined bio crude the values are relatively high with an average of 2 4 compared to the biomass bio crudes but in comparison to e g microalgae 5 9 jazrawi et al 2013 xu and savage 2017 or dried distillers grain with solubles 5 biller et al 2016b the values are reasonable in htl is it important to try to reduce the amount of heteroatoms as much as possible for subsequent hydrotreating the more heteroatoms are present the more hydrogen is required for hydrogenation overall carbon and nitrogen balances for primary sludge htl are presented in figs 4 and 5 respectively the diagrams are based on 1000 kg of sludge input at 5 dm the values are calculated from the overall carbon and nitrogen balances which are included in the electronic supplementary material table s2 and s3 respectively the carbon balances achieved mass balance closures of 100 6 5 on average the nitrogen balances achieved a mass balance closure of 100 6 5 average for samples containing sludge while the low nitrogen biomass samples only achieved an average of 100 25 for calculation of the visual representation in fig 3 the sum of the individual carbon values to each fraction were normalized to 100 fig 4 b and fig 5b depict the biomass filter aid co liquefaction process where an additional input of 11 kg c are included this represents the 0 5 1 filter aid to dm sludge ratio and all four diagrams are based on extruded miscanthus sludge htl fig 4a is shown to have a carbon recovery to bio crude of 57 19 to the water phase 10 to gas co2 and solid residue each for nitrogen the majority is fractionated into the water phase with 58 followed by the bio crude with 33 and the solid residue 8 it is assumed no nitrogen is found in the gas phase in terms of wastewater treatment a 57 carbon efficiency to bio crude is very encouraging traditional wwtp will lose around half of the sludge s carbon during aeration as co2 the remaining half is anaerobically digested to methane and carbon dioxide optimistically a carbon to methane efficiency of around 25 can be achieved using this traditional approach mccarty et al 2011 in a future htl sludge process the htl process water will still have to be cleaned as the main objective of a wwtp is naturally to treat wastewater the 4 kg of carbon and 0 7 kg of nitrogen shown in figs 4a and 5a will be present as a particle and pathogen free solution in a htl wwt context there appear three likely scenarios for this hydrothermal gasification htg using the existing wwtp processes to deal with the water e g aeration anaerobic digestion etc or to use a dedicated anaerobic digester with immobilized methanogens such as an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion uasb reactor the htg option would require additional infrastructure but will convert the organic content of the htl water to methane and carbon dioxide this option has been shown to result in cod values as low as 20 50 mgo2 l marrone and moeller 2016 in the htg effluent however the nitrogen levels are too high for discharge so that an additional nitrogen removal step would be required it has also been suggested to perform htg for hydrogen production which could potentially be used for hydrogenation of the bio crude this approach has shown cod reduction of 98 watson et al 2017 the alternative to htg of htl process waters is ad it was recently suggested in a techno economic analysis that this approach could be less costly for the clean up of htl waters due to lower capital and operating costs gerber van doren et al 2017 and could make sense if these facilities are already in place at a wwtp ad of htl waters from sewage sludge has not been reported but from algae and modeled food waste htl waters posmanik et al 2017 tommaso et al 2015 in both studies a biodegradability of around 60 of organics was achieved the current results suggest a c n ratio of 6 for the htl sludge scenario while ratios of 20 30 are considered ideal for ad allen et al 2016 if the ad scenario and utilization of existing wwtp unit operations aeration and or ad is chosen the reduction of carbon to treat would be 81 the use of upflow anaerobic sludge blanket digestion reactors uasb for the htl aqueous effluents is not studied but holds some potential for this stream with high concentration of organics the anaerobic digestion routes could potentially suffer from inhibition of the anaerobic digestion process by inhibitory compounds such as nh4 n and certain organic compounds such as phenols which can induce a lag phase tommaso et al 2015 however studies have shown that using dilutions e g 30 v v fernandez et al 2018 during the ad process and allowing for lag phases htl waters can successfully be digested with a biodegradability of up to around 60 if htl were to be used directly on sludge the problem is the low dm content of the sludge feed 5 as shown in scenario fig 4a in this scenario the 1000 kg of feed would require around 1500 mj to heat to 350 c while producing 18 kg of bio crude with an energy content of 38 mj kg which translates to 673 mj i e less than half the energy required to heat the water this would equal an energy return on investment eroi of 0 4 newly developed htl plants are able to recover heat and our pilot plant is able to recover around 85 which would mean that the eroi would be around 3 0 the proposed scenario including the biomass filter aid filtration could be processed at 20 dm feed producing around 84 kg bio crude with a hhv of 36 mj 3024 mj total while still requiring approximately 1500 mj to heat up the feed this translates to an eroi of 2 0 without heat recovery and 13 5 with in terms of energy balance the advantage of the filtration step is therefore evident with a 4 5 fold increase in eroi figs 4b and 5b shows the filter cake co liquefaction scenarios carbon and nitrogen balances respectively the input carbon is now increased to 32 kg due to the addition of 11 kg c from the biomass filter aid the filtration step itself is around 90 efficient in terms of carbon a combined 29 kg c are available for co liquefaction a total of 19 kg c bio crude are produced compared to the 12 kg in the htl only scenario due to the addition of additional carbon from the filter aid but also from higher bio crude yields carbon fractionation to the gas and solid is similar to the standalone scenario the aqueous effluent consists of a large volume filtrate from primary filtrate with a total of 3 kg non retained c and a sterile high concentration water phase from the htl process water 4 kg c the amount of nitrogen to the process water is not increased using the new scenario but slight increases to bio crude and solids are observed 8 kg represents a 62 reduction in c to treat compared to treating all of the sludge c using traditional wwt and a reduction of 42 nitrogen to treat the c n ratio is increased to an average of 11 1 in the htl combination bringing it closer to the desired ratio for microbial utilisation overall the results show a promising technology by combining biomass assisted filtration of sludge with htl the main advantages lie in the superior bio crude yields and quality due to synergistic effects and the improved energy efficiency of the process due to higher dm slurries in on going investigations we will assess the technology for filtration of primary influent to the wwtp where dm contents are even lower 0 01 0 04 this could reduce the land and energy requirements of wwtp for clarifiers and thickening tanks during primary treatment a further possibility of the technology is to use wetland biomass plantations as tertiary treatment of the wwtp effluents for nitrogen removal the biomass could then directly be utilised on site for filter aid production our future efforts on the technology will examine such possibilities and a focus will also lie on understanding the chemical reaction pathways that lead to the observed positive synergistic effects in co liquefaction 4 conclusions the novel combination of using biomass as a filter aid for primary sludge filtration and subsequent co liquefaction for bio crude production is shown to be a very promising approach due to several advantages over both traditional wwtps and htl of sludge on its own primary sludge filtration times of are reduced from around 40 to 1 min with a moderate penalty in filtration efficiency on average 92 of carbon is retained in the filter cake which exhibit a dm content of 21 29 for further htl processing the higher dm results in a 4 5 fold increase in energy return on energy invested eroi of the htl process synergistic effects in co liquefaction are observed resulting in higher bio crude yields and an increase in chemical energy recovery to 75 vs 46 for biomass and 67 for sludge the integration of filter aid co liquefaction in existing wwtp would reduce the carbon and nitrogen amount to treat by 62 and 42 respectively acknowledgments the

19802,ecological degradation of streams remains a major environmental concern worldwide while stream restoration has received considerable attention mitigation efforts focused on the improvement of physical habitat have not proven completely effective several small scale studies have emphasized that effective restoration strategies require a more holistic understanding of the variables at play although the generalization of the findings based on the small scale studies remains unclear using a comprehensive statewide stream monitoring database from west virginia wv a detailed landscape dataset and a machine learning algorithm this study explores the interactive impacts of water quality and physical habitat on stream ecosystem health as indicated by benthic macroinvertebrate scores given the long history of energy extraction in this region i e coal mining and oil gas production investigation of energy extraction influences is highlighted our results demonstrate that a combination of good habitat and low specific conductance is generally associated with favorable benthic macroinvertebrate scores whereas poor habitat combined with water quality conditions typically indicative of high ionic strength are associated with impaired stream status in addition streams impacted by both energy extraction and residential development had a higher percentage of impairment compared to those impacted predominantly by energy extraction or residential development alone while water quality played a more important role in the ecosystem health of streams impacted primarily by energy extraction activities habitat seems to be more influential in streams impacted by residential development together these findings emphasize that stream restoration strategies should consider interactive effects of multiple environmental stressors tailored to specific sites or site types as opposed to considering a single stressor or multiple stressors separately graphical abstract image 1 keywords benthic macroinvertebrates habitat stream ecosystem health water quality watershed activities 1 introduction rivers and streams provide important ecological functions and services yet the ecological degradation of lotic surface waters is unprecedentedly high often attributed to intensive anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate change bullock et al 2011 palmer and filoso 2009 in many countries remediation and or restoration of degraded waterways is legally required as compensatory mitigation for various impacts for example one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation adopted in the european union member countries is the 2000 water framework directive wfd with the ultimate objective to achieve good status for all waters in europe toward this the wfd calls for an integrated approach to watershed management which is fundamentally different from traditional practices that approach management by targeting specific problems or objectives in relative isolation brack et al 2017 griffiths 2002 vlachopoulou et al 2014 while some significant progress has been made recent assessments of wfd outcomes have concluded that the implementation of holistic management strategies remains a real challenge hering et al 2010 voulvoulis et al 2017 similarly in the united states us the 1972 federal clean water act cwa states a primary goal to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation s waters foster and matlock 2001 usepa 2002 the mechanisms for watershed management under the cwa have evolved considerably over the past several decades to follow an integrated basin wide approach however implementation presents similar challenges with respect to holistic management approaches as in europe a particular criticism in the realm of stream restoration is that conventional strategies e g those with a strong focus on channel morphology have not yielded adequate restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services bernhardt et al 2005 palmer and hondula 2014 a common theme in analysis of this problem and its possible solutions is that a stronger focus need to be applied to interactive impacts of multiple stressors when identifying factors for ecological degradation of waters and prioritizing remediation activities palmer and filoso 2009 palmer et al 2014 to this end extensive monitoring and modeling efforts toward distinctive types of ecosystems and landscapes are essential to develop effective restoration plans that can provide implications beyond the specific study areas this study takes advantage of a uniquely complete large scale stream monitoring data set for the state of west virginia wv in the eastern us an area currently struggling to balance multiple sources of major anthropogenic land use and ecosystem services west virginia is both a leading energy producing state in the us fig 1 holzman 2011 palmer et al 2010 and a biodiversity hotspot of global significance bernhardt and palmer 2011 the ecosystem health of wv streams is often assessed by the structure and function of benthic macroinvertebrate communities which serve as sentinels for the long term health of a wide variety of aquatic life damásio et al 2011 ogbeibu and oribhabor 2002 at present approximately 40 of wadeable stream miles are ecologically impaired across the state wvdep 2014 previous studies attempting to better understand the major stressors associated with benthic impairments in wv streams have focused largely on impacts related to coal mining activities bernhardt et al 2012

indicate that both contemporary and historic mining activities are associated with losses of sensitive aquatic species throughout the entire central appalachia region lindberg et al 2011 palmer et al 2010 pond et al 2014 often impacts have been attributed to high concentrations of dissolved solids in affected streams composed predominantly of ions associated with weathering of pyrite and carbonate rich materials e g so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 lindberg et al 2011 palmer et al 2010 despite the recognition of major water quality issues correlated to mining activities mitigation efforts have frequently been targeted to improve physical habitat e g following the natural channel design approach palmer and hondula 2014 such habitat based restoration strategies have been shown to be insufficient to the recovery of aquatic communities and ecosystem functions in many cases both in appalachian and elsewhere buchanan et al 2012 palmer and hondula 2014 palmer et al 2014 wortley et al 2013 to protect aquatic life in central appalachian streams the usepa proposed in 2011 a field based benchmark for specific conductance sc i e 300 μs cm a measure that is often used as an in stream surrogate for total dissolved solids cormier et al 2011 varying toxicity effects associated with different ions that may compose specific conductance and or variable responses by whole benthic communities to the levels and types of ions present have rendered the general application of this benchmark controversial clements and kotalik 2016 cook et al 2015 timpano et al 2015 ziemkiewicz and northway 2013 rather an increasing number of studies have emphasized the need to account for the complex interactive impacts of in stream water quality physical habitat and upstream watershed anthropogenic activities cook et al 2015 merriam et al 2011 petty et al 2010 these studies however have focused on relatively small geographic areas and well characterized sites and so broader applicability of such findings remains largely unknown the current study presents a systematic assessment of streams across wv to explore the interplay between water quality and physical habitat on aquatic ecosystem health in streams influenced by energy extraction i e coal mining and oil gas production and or residential development specifically three research questions are addressed 1 what type s of watershed activities are associated with higher degree of stream ecological impairments 2 what conditions of water quality and physical habitat are generally favorable for healthy benthic communities and how do these relationships vary with different type s of watershed anthropogenic influences on streams and 3 how can insights gained from observed associations inform strategies for stream restoration in the us and beyond identifying distinctive favorable conditions of benthic communities can aid in the design of more effective stream protection and or restoration strategies tailored to site specific conditions this study is unique in that a comprehensive monitoring dataset including thousands of evenly distributed sites was employed representing impacts from various anthropogenic activities in addition the application of a random forest machine learning algorithm demonstrated successful identification and visualization of the relative and complex interactive impacts of multiple environmental factors on stream ecosystem health status though the present study is grounded in the central appalachian region of the us the findings may provide insights for many other areas with less available monitoring data especially in developing countries balancing general urban development resource extraction and ecological preservation 2 methodology 2 1 assessment of aquatic ecosystem

subsequent analyses this screening resulted in a total of 2102 samples referred to as the overall dataset below a second further reduced subset of this data was selected to allow investigation of the influence of different anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecology for this effort all samples collected prior to 2000 were excluded in order to limit temporal changes in landscape which was characterized based on 2003 2016 data table s1 then sample sites were excluded if they did not drain independent watersheds the final independent dataset includes a total of 909 sample sites fig 1 the watersheds were delineated using esri arcgis version 10 3 environmental systems research institute redlands california areas of the contributing watersheds for the independent sites ranged from 0 3 to

reclaimed mine lands slurry impoundments mine facilities and abandoned mine lands density of underground mining national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits no km2 density of oil and gas wells no km2 density of buildings no km2 mean elevation m and mean slope for the draining watershed were calculated data sources used for calculation are summarized in table s1 based on the primary watershed anthropogenic activities the 909 sites were divided into seven groups table 1 three of the groups have a primary classification of activities energy extraction only e residential development only r and no identifiable energy extraction or residential development n the other four groups have a mix of energy extraction and residential development activities low energy extraction and low residential development m1 low energy extraction and high residential development m2 high energy extraction and low residential development m3 and high energy extraction and high residential development m4 the threshold values used to divide low and high levels of energy extraction and residential development were chosen based on findings from previous studies bernhardt et al 2012 merriam et al 2011 and the divisions were focused on the relative percentages of surface mining in the independent watershed subset since surface mining i e as opposed to underground mine discharges or oil gas wells represents the primary energy extraction activity across all of these sites it should also be noted that the specific impact of energy extraction and residential development was focused in this study given that the overall percentage of agriculture grass land was relatively small i e median 3 range 0 19 9 across the independent watershed subset and nutrients did not appear as significant predictors of wvsci a detailed description and characterization of major land uses and human activities is provided in table 1 2 4 statistical analysis a flowchart illustrating the overall methodology for data analysis is shown in fig 2 a recursive partitioning algorithm was applied to both the overall dataset and independent watershed subset that were grouped by distinct watershed anthropogenic activities more detailed description of the statistical methods is provided below all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 2 3 r core team 2015 2 4 1 measure of variable importance via random forest permutation importance test the influences of the independent variables i e water quality and habitat variables on wvsci categories i e unimpaired impaired grey zone and impaired poor were evaluated using recursive partitioning algorithms achieved via inference trees and random forests as the study datasets contain continuous and integer variables with different scales of measurement and categorical variables that vary in the number of categories variable importance measures by traditional random forest methods are biased strobl et al 2007 therefore a conditional random forest method was employed which uses unbiased conditional permutation importance tests strobl et al 2008 it is worth noting that the unbiased permutation importance test would not work for the overall dataset due to the high number of observations therefore in the first analysis where land use was not examined the traditional permutation importance test was applied the conditional random forest method has been demonstrated to provide robust ranking of variable importance in various research fields e g bioinformatics ecology and psychology etc due to its ability to handle large numbers and different types of independent variables even in the presence of complex interactions or covariates lee et al 2015 mondy and usseglio polatera 2013 strobl et al 2009 the rationale of permutation importance measurement is detailed by hothorn et al 2006 briefly by randomly permuting the values of an independent variable its original association with the dependent variable is broken accordingly when the permuted variable together with the unpermuted independent variables is used to predict the dependent variable the prediction accuracy should decrease substantially if the permuted variable is associated with the dependent variable on the other hand if the original variable is not associated with the dependent variable i e it is either not included in the tree or included by chance permutation of the variable should result in either only a small random decrease in prediction accuracy or even a small increase in the prediction accuracy i e the permutation importance can show small negative values for irrelevant independent variables thus a reasonable measure for variable importance is the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting a variable averaged over all trees the function cforest in the r package party was used for conducting random forest analysis the number of trees n 1000 and randomly pre selected variables for each tree growth m 5 were set as recommended hothorn et al 2006 the function varimp was used to rank the importance of the independent variables 2 4 2 conditional inference tree visualizing influences of the top five most important variables on wvsci categories to assist in visualizing the interactive influences of the most important variables on wvsci categories a single conditional inference tree was grown using the top five most important independent variables this was done via the function ctree in the r package party hothorn et al 2006 this technique identified the most influential independent variable using a partitioning algorithm based on the lowest statistically significant p value i e tested against the null hypothesis h0 of independence between wvsci and each of the selected independent variables which avoids overfitting and biased selection among covariates a significance level of 0 05 was used in assessing all splits the classification error for each tree was calculated using an out of bag oob built in test sample to generate oob error making it unnecessary to create training and testing samples the overall model performance was evaluated using the classification accuracy that is calculated by 1 oob error 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality patterns summary statistics for each variable in the overall dataset i e 2102 sites and the independent watershed subset i e 909 sites are provided in tables s2 and s3 respectively the percentage of sites identified as impaired i e wvsci 68 among the overall dataset was 37 6 which is slightly higher than that among the independent watershed subset 28 3 fig 3 this is not necessarily unexpected as the sites in the independent watershed subset are generally near headwaters whereas the overall dataset includes additional sites located farther downstream and thus impacted cumulatively by a greater variety of upstream watershed activities while the overall dataset can more holistically represent the wvsci levels across the entire state the independent watershed subset is directly more useful in investigating the impact of particular watershed anthropogenic activities i e to limit interdependence between sites a comparison of the seven groups within the independent watershed subset indicates that a relatively low degree of disturbance i e the n and m1 groups or disturbance by a single category of activities i e the e or r groups is associated with much lower percentages of benthic impairments versus the groups with moderate to high degrees of mixed disturbances i e m2 m3 and m4 fig 3 for example the percentage of impaired sites for groups m2 m4 35 1 74 1 was two times greater than or more the impaired percentages for the e 17 9 r 10 0 and n 13 6 groups the percentage of impairment in the m1 group 10 4 which had sites with relatively low degree of mixed disturbance was similar to that in the r 10 0 and n 13 6 groups these findings suggest that multiple upstream watershed anthropogenic activities can have a synergistic negative effect on the health of benthic macroinvertebrate communities the slightly higher percentage of impairment in group n relative to those in r or m1 may seem surprising given that sites in group n were 86 5 100 forested with no other notable human activities except for small percentage of agriculture grass land i e 0 7 3 in this region however it should be noted that the wvsci scores for the impaired sites in n 59 22 60 55 were very close to the threshold value of 68 whereas those in r 35 41 59 32 and m1 34 44 60 05 represented a much wider range of impaired scores 3 2 relative effects of water quality and physical habitat on wvsci categories in the overall dataset the classification accuracy of the conditional inference tree model used to visualize the interactive impacts of the top five most important predictor variables was quite high 72 1 the importance plot showing the relative importance of all selected predictor variables on wvsci is provided in fig s1 more than 80 of streams were classified as unimpaired when rbp score was above 142 and specific conductance was below 435 μs cm fig 4 in contrast more than 60 of streams were impaired when rbp was above 142 and specific conductance was above 435 μs cm or when rbp was below 142 and one of the following conditions existed that generally signal high ionic strength 1 total calcium concentration was above 76 6 mg l 2 total calcium concentration was between 24 3 mg l and 76 6 mg l and embeddedness was below 10 or 3 total calcium concentration was between 24 3 mg l and 76 6 mg l and embeddedness was above 10 and specific conductance was above 541 μs cm fig 4 high calcium concentrations in many of the study streams are likely indicative of mining related disturbances to local carbonate rich geology and in some instances calcium may be contributed by acid mine drainage treatment moreover the identification of total calcium concentrations as an important predictor of the wvsci categories may also results from high collinearity between total calcium concentration and specific conductance spearman s rank correlation coefficient 0 93 table s4 the high number of observations in the overall dataset i e n 2102 do not allow a conditional permutation importance test to avoid overestimation of the importance of highly correlated predictor variables strobl et al 2008 the above observations suggest that in general good habitat and low specific conductance tend to promote healthy benthic communities which is consistent with findings of previous small scale studies cook et al 2015 timpano et al 2015 however the study data clearly shows that high probability of impairments can occur across a wide range of conditions such that neither good habitat nor low specific conductance alone can reliably predict healthy benthic communities this findings highlight potential implications for overgeneralized stream mitigation practice and indicate that consistent with several previous studies palmer and hondula 2014 ziemkiewicz and northway 2013 practices should be focused on site specific data and a holistic understanding of multiple benthic stressors 3 3 relative effects of water quality and physical habitat on wvsci categories with respect to energy extraction and other anthropogenic activities in order to examine the effects of distinct primary watershed activities conditional inference tree models using the top five most important predictor variables of wvsci categories were also generated for each of the seven groups within the independent watershed subset fig 5 the importance plot of the predictor variables is provided in fig s2 s8 for all seven models the classification accuracy was high i e 76 2 12 5 sulfate concentration was the key predictor variable for sites predominantly affected by energy extraction activities i e group e fig 5a when sulfate concentration was above 316 mg l 100 of streams were impaired while only 9 were impaired when sulfate concentration was below 316 mg l high sulfate sites generally also had higher specific conductance i e 611 2847 μs cm when sulfate concentration was above 316 mg l vs 20 916 μs cm when sulfate concentration was below 316 mg l this indicated that for sites impacted by energy extraction activities only ionic strength was a major predictor for benthic macroinvertebrate communities rather than physical habitat this finding is consistent with a previous study where streams were rigorously selected to only represent impacts of mining activities timpano et al 2015 in contrast for sites predominantly affected by residential development i e group r bank stability was the strongest predictor of wvsci categories fig 5b for these sites a bank stability value of 9 was observed as a critical threshold i e 54 of streams were impaired when bank stability was below 9 vs 7 when bank stability was above 9 it is worth noting that sites with poor bank stability i e below 9 generally had relatively low specific conductance i e below the proposed benchmark of 300 μs cm this suggests that in these watersheds physical habitat is the major predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate communities rather than ionic strength taken together the results of both the development and energy extraction groups echo to the work of merriam et al 2011 which found strong correlations between residential development physical habitat and macroinvertebrate community structure whereas acute changes in water quality were correlated with mining activities merriam et al 2011 when considering sites impacted by a mix of residential development and energy extraction activities both physical habitat and water quality appear to play important roles in shaping the stream condition as shown in fig 5e g for the m2 m3 and m4 groups the top tier variable in the conditional inference trees was consistently associated with habitat i e either total rbp or embeddedness and the second tier variables were consistently associated with water quality i e total calcium total magnesium chloride or specific conductance for the groups with relatively low levels of residential development and energy extraction m1 or no known impacts n water quality appears to be the most important predictor variable for wvsci low ph i e below 4 71 was associated with about half of the total benthic impairments in group n which may indicate that acid deposition is likely contributing to the impairment in this group notably neither habitat nor ionic strength were major predictors for sites in this group fig 5c for the m1 group somewhat elevated magnesium appears to be the key predictor variable of benthic impairments fig 5d the threshold value of 8 1 mg l total magnesium found by the model is not particularly high in the context of wv surface waters wvdep 2015 so it is likely that elevated total magnesium concentration is simply correlated with increased hardness and or specific conductance which may be general indicators of disturbed soil and or rock layers water treatment or interaction between surface and groundwater upstream of sampling sites in general sites in the m1 and n categories had much healthier benthic communities i e only 10 15 impaired as compared to the watersheds with higher degrees of anthropogenic influence i e 35 74 of m2 m3 m4 sites impaired 3 4 management implications for streams in the us and beyond restoration and conservation of stream ecosystem health is tough and complicated work that demand holistic interdisciplinary approaches previous studies have shown restoration projects targeted physical habitat improvement alone often resulted in unsatisfactory ecological outcomes as such failure is becoming widely recognized in both the us palmer et al 2014 and other countries nilsson et al 2015 voulvoulis et al 2017 there has been an increasing emphasis on how multiple factors interactively affect stream ecosystem health palmer et al 2014 voulvoulis et al 2017 the results of this present study show good habitat and low specific conductance are generally favorable for healthy benthic macroinvertebrate communities which is in keeping with previous studies cook et al 2015 cormier et al 2013 merriam et al 2015a b it is worth noting that relative importance each of multiple factors plays in affecting stream ecosystem health status differs substantially between watersheds dominated by energy extraction activities versus those dominated by residential development while ionic strength appears to be the major predictor for watersheds affected primarily by energy extraction activities across the sites surveyed in west virginia physical habitat degradation appears the major predictor for watersheds affected by residential development therefore a thorough field investigation of the target site and upstream watershed is essential for the design of more effective restoration strategies without taken into consideration of upstream watershed activities the application of a single field based benchmark for specific conductance i e 300 μs cm may likely be insufficient to protect aquatic ecosystem health of all streams across central appalachia a comparison of stream restoration efforts across multiple countries generated the following recommendations 1 a holistic approach integrating all parts of the complex ecosystems and their interactions is emphasized for more effective stream restoration efforts while this has been highlighted in several water regulations and initiatives worldwide e g the federal clean water act in the us and the water framework directive in eu a departure of existing implementation efforts from the systemic intentions likely resulted in the unsatisfactory ecological outcomes palmer et al 2014 voulvoulis et al 2017 therefore there is an urgent need for a rigorous revision of current implementation of stream restoration plans 2 while it is almost impossible to perform a holistic analysis of potential limiting factors for every polluted water bodies establishment of distinctive pilot study areas with intensive monitoring and modeling on an array of abiotic and biotic factors would be indispensably important to generate understandings that can provide implications beyond the specific study areas 3 standardized long term monitoring efforts are needed to follow up with the effectiveness of implementation efforts as a lack of outcome evaluation or a lack of consistence in the evaluation processes makes it challenging to understand how biodiversity and ecosystem functions response to restoration strategies carré et al 2017 dedieu et al 2016 notably stream bottom sediments typically associated with higher levels of pollutants deserve more extensive monitoring efforts as bottom sediments and associated pollutants are frequently identified as a major stressor for degradation of stream ecosystem health in many different types of watersheds amweg et al 2006 carré et al 2017 govenor et al 2017 pettigrove and hoffmann 2005 4 conclusions the findings of this study highlight the interactive impacts of water quality and habitat on stream ecosystem health which vary substantially among different types of watersheds with multiple sources of anthropogenic disturbance in contrast to previous studies focusing on a few distinctively selected sites the present study was grounded on an extensive monitoring database across west virginia in eastern us encompassing thousands of evenly distributed sites that represent various anthropogenic activities in addition the application of the conditional random forest algorithm demonstrated successful identification and visualization of the complex interactive impacts of multiple environmental factors by selecting an independent watershed subset to study the impacts of distinct watershed anthropogenic activities these data provide important clues regarding the types of restoration plans that may be considered for streams with varying anthropogenic influences sites impacted by a mixture of high levels of energy extraction and residential development will likely require the most extensive remediation efforts including improvement of both physical habitat and water quality in watersheds dominated by mining water quality appears most critical to aquatic communities while stable habitat is most important in residential sites it is important to recognize that while the selection of independent watershed subset allows the investigation of the impacts of different watershed activities the over representation of low order streams can represent distinct ecologies and structures that may not always be representative of the total riverine system in addition elevated levels of stream bottom sediments which physically impair habitat and may comprise higher levels of contaminants than the water column are not currently routinely monitored or explicitly regulated though they were frequently associated with aquatic ecological impairment in many different types of watershed therefore future studies should evaluate both

19802,ecological degradation of streams remains a major environmental concern worldwide while stream restoration has received considerable attention mitigation efforts focused on the improvement of physical habitat have not proven completely effective several small scale studies have emphasized that effective restoration strategies require a more holistic understanding of the variables at play although the generalization of the findings based on the small scale studies remains unclear using a comprehensive statewide stream monitoring database from west virginia wv a detailed landscape dataset and a machine learning algorithm this study explores the interactive impacts of water quality and physical habitat on stream ecosystem health as indicated by benthic macroinvertebrate scores given the long history of energy extraction in this region i e coal mining and oil gas production investigation of energy extraction influences is highlighted our results demonstrate that a combination of good habitat and low specific conductance is generally associated with favorable benthic macroinvertebrate scores whereas poor habitat combined with water quality conditions typically indicative of high ionic strength are associated with impaired stream status in addition streams impacted by both energy extraction and residential development had a higher percentage of impairment compared to those impacted predominantly by energy extraction or residential development alone while water quality played a more important role in the ecosystem health of streams impacted primarily by energy extraction activities habitat seems to be more influential in streams impacted by residential development together these findings emphasize that stream restoration strategies should consider interactive effects of multiple environmental stressors tailored to specific sites or site types as opposed to considering a single stressor or multiple stressors separately graphical abstract image 1 keywords benthic macroinvertebrates habitat stream ecosystem health water quality watershed activities 1 introduction rivers and streams provide important ecological functions and services yet the ecological degradation of lotic surface waters is unprecedentedly high often attributed to intensive anthropogenic activities exacerbated by climate change bullock et al 2011 palmer and filoso 2009 in many countries remediation and or restoration of degraded waterways is legally required as compensatory mitigation for various impacts for example one of the most important pieces of environmental legislation adopted in the european union member countries is the 2000 water framework directive wfd with the ultimate objective to achieve good status for all waters in europe toward this the wfd calls for an integrated approach to watershed management which is fundamentally different from traditional practices that approach management by targeting specific problems or objectives in relative isolation brack et al 2017 griffiths 2002 vlachopoulou et al 2014 while some significant progress has been made recent assessments of wfd outcomes have concluded that the implementation of holistic management strategies remains a real challenge hering et al 2010 voulvoulis et al 2017 similarly in the united states us the 1972 federal clean water act cwa states a primary goal to restore and maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nation s waters foster and matlock 2001 usepa 2002 the mechanisms for watershed management under the cwa have evolved considerably over the past several decades to follow an integrated basin wide approach however implementation presents similar challenges with respect to holistic management approaches as in europe a particular criticism in the realm of stream restoration is that conventional strategies e g those with a strong focus on channel morphology have not yielded adequate restoration of biodiversity and ecosystem services bernhardt et al 2005 palmer and hondula 2014 a common theme in analysis of this problem and its possible solutions is that a stronger focus need to be applied to interactive impacts of multiple stressors when identifying factors for ecological degradation of waters and prioritizing remediation activities palmer and filoso 2009 palmer et al 2014 to this end extensive monitoring and modeling efforts toward distinctive types of ecosystems and landscapes are essential to develop effective restoration plans that can provide implications beyond the specific study areas this study takes advantage of a uniquely complete large scale stream monitoring data set for the state of west virginia wv in the eastern us an area currently struggling to balance multiple sources of major anthropogenic land use and ecosystem services west virginia is both a leading energy producing state in the us fig 1 holzman 2011 palmer et al 2010 and a biodiversity hotspot of global significance bernhardt and palmer 2011 the ecosystem health of wv streams is often assessed by the structure and function of benthic macroinvertebrate communities which serve as sentinels for the long term health of a wide variety of aquatic life damásio et al 2011 ogbeibu and oribhabor 2002 at present approximately 40 of wadeable stream miles are ecologically impaired across the state wvdep 2014 previous studies attempting to better understand the major stressors associated with benthic impairments in wv streams have focused largely on impacts related to coal mining activities bernhardt et al 2012

indicate that both contemporary and historic mining activities are associated with losses of sensitive aquatic species throughout the entire central appalachia region lindberg et al 2011 palmer et al 2010 pond et al 2014 often impacts have been attributed to high concentrations of dissolved solids in affected streams composed predominantly of ions associated with weathering of pyrite and carbonate rich materials e g so4 2 ca2 mg2 and hco3 lindberg et al 2011 palmer et al 2010 despite the recognition of major water quality issues correlated to mining activities mitigation efforts have frequently been targeted to improve physical habitat e g following the natural channel design approach palmer and hondula 2014 such habitat based restoration strategies have been shown to be insufficient to the recovery of aquatic communities and ecosystem functions in many cases both in appalachian and elsewhere buchanan et al 2012 palmer and hondula 2014 palmer et al 2014 wortley et al 2013 to protect aquatic life in central appalachian streams the usepa proposed in 2011 a field based benchmark for specific conductance sc i e 300 μs cm a measure that is often used as an in stream surrogate for total dissolved solids cormier et al 2011 varying toxicity effects associated with different ions that may compose specific conductance and or variable responses by whole benthic communities to the levels and types of ions present have rendered the general application of this benchmark controversial clements and kotalik 2016 cook et al 2015 timpano et al 2015 ziemkiewicz and northway 2013 rather an increasing number of studies have emphasized the need to account for the complex interactive impacts of in stream water quality physical habitat and upstream watershed anthropogenic activities cook et al 2015 merriam et al 2011 petty et al 2010 these studies however have focused on relatively small geographic areas and well characterized sites and so broader applicability of such findings remains largely unknown the current study presents a systematic assessment of streams across wv to explore the interplay between water quality and physical habitat on aquatic ecosystem health in streams influenced by energy extraction i e coal mining and oil gas production and or residential development specifically three research questions are addressed 1 what type s of watershed activities are associated with higher degree of stream ecological impairments 2 what conditions of water quality and physical habitat are generally favorable for healthy benthic communities and how do these relationships vary with different type s of watershed anthropogenic influences on streams and 3 how can insights gained from observed associations inform strategies for stream restoration in the us and beyond identifying distinctive favorable conditions of benthic communities can aid in the design of more effective stream protection and or restoration strategies tailored to site specific conditions this study is unique in that a comprehensive monitoring dataset including thousands of evenly distributed sites was employed representing impacts from various anthropogenic activities in addition the application of a random forest machine learning algorithm demonstrated successful identification and visualization of the relative and complex interactive impacts of multiple environmental factors on stream ecosystem health status though the present study is grounded in the central appalachian region of the us the findings may provide insights for many other areas with less available monitoring data especially in developing countries balancing general urban development resource extraction and ecological preservation 2 methodology 2 1 assessment of aquatic ecosystem

macroinvertebrate assemblages the wv stream condition index wvsci is a family level index established in the late 1990s it was officially used to evaluate stream conditions per us federal clean water act s requirements from 2002 to 2012 though monitoring data is available as far back as 1998 in some parts of the state 1 1 in 2012 a new genus level index of most probable stream status glimpss was

subsequent analyses this screening resulted in a total of 2102 samples referred to as the overall dataset below a second further reduced subset of this data was selected to allow investigation of the influence of different anthropogenic activities on aquatic ecology for this effort all samples collected prior to 2000 were excluded in order to limit temporal changes in landscape which was characterized based on 2003 2016 data table s1 then sample sites were excluded if they did not drain independent watersheds the final independent dataset includes a total of 909 sample sites fig 1 the watersheds were delineated using esri arcgis version 10 3 environmental systems research institute redlands california areas of the contributing watersheds for the independent sites ranged from 0 3 to

reclaimed mine lands slurry impoundments mine facilities and abandoned mine lands density of underground mining national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permits no km2 density of oil and gas wells no km2 density of buildings no km2 mean elevation m and mean slope for the draining watershed were calculated data sources used for calculation are summarized in table s1 based on the primary watershed anthropogenic activities the 909 sites were divided into seven groups table 1 three of the groups have a primary classification of activities energy extraction only e residential development only r and no identifiable energy extraction or residential development n the other four groups have a mix of energy extraction and residential development activities low energy extraction and low residential development m1 low energy extraction and high residential development m2 high energy extraction and low residential development m3 and high energy extraction and high residential development m4 the threshold values used to divide low and high levels of energy extraction and residential development were chosen based on findings from previous studies bernhardt et al 2012 merriam et al 2011 and the divisions were focused on the relative percentages of surface mining in the independent watershed subset since surface mining i e as opposed to underground mine discharges or oil gas wells represents the primary energy extraction activity across all of these sites it should also be noted that the specific impact of energy extraction and residential development was focused in this study given that the overall percentage of agriculture grass land was relatively small i e median 3 range 0 19 9 across the independent watershed subset and nutrients did not appear as significant predictors of wvsci a detailed description and characterization of major land uses and human activities is provided in table 1 2 4 statistical analysis a flowchart illustrating the overall methodology for data analysis is shown in fig 2 a recursive partitioning algorithm was applied to both the overall dataset and independent watershed subset that were grouped by distinct watershed anthropogenic activities more detailed description of the statistical methods is provided below all statistical analyses were conducted in r version 3 2 3 r core team 2015 2 4 1 measure of variable importance via random forest permutation importance test the influences of the independent variables i e water quality and habitat variables on wvsci categories i e unimpaired impaired grey zone and impaired poor were evaluated using recursive partitioning algorithms achieved via inference trees and random forests as the study datasets contain continuous and integer variables with different scales of measurement and categorical variables that vary in the number of categories variable importance measures by traditional random forest methods are biased strobl et al 2007 therefore a conditional random forest method was employed which uses unbiased conditional permutation importance tests strobl et al 2008 it is worth noting that the unbiased permutation importance test would not work for the overall dataset due to the high number of observations therefore in the first analysis where land use was not examined the traditional permutation importance test was applied the conditional random forest method has been demonstrated to provide robust ranking of variable importance in various research fields e g bioinformatics ecology and psychology etc due to its ability to handle large numbers and different types of independent variables even in the presence of complex interactions or covariates lee et al 2015 mondy and usseglio polatera 2013 strobl et al 2009 the rationale of permutation importance measurement is detailed by hothorn et al 2006 briefly by randomly permuting the values of an independent variable its original association with the dependent variable is broken accordingly when the permuted variable together with the unpermuted independent variables is used to predict the dependent variable the prediction accuracy should decrease substantially if the permuted variable is associated with the dependent variable on the other hand if the original variable is not associated with the dependent variable i e it is either not included in the tree or included by chance permutation of the variable should result in either only a small random decrease in prediction accuracy or even a small increase in the prediction accuracy i e the permutation importance can show small negative values for irrelevant independent variables thus a reasonable measure for variable importance is the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting a variable averaged over all trees the function cforest in the r package party was used for conducting random forest analysis the number of trees n 1000 and randomly pre selected variables for each tree growth m 5 were set as recommended hothorn et al 2006 the function varimp was used to rank the importance of the independent variables 2 4 2 conditional inference tree visualizing influences of the top five most important variables on wvsci categories to assist in visualizing the interactive influences of the most important variables on wvsci categories a single conditional inference tree was grown using the top five most important independent variables this was done via the function ctree in the r package party hothorn et al 2006 this technique identified the most influential independent variable using a partitioning algorithm based on the lowest statistically significant p value i e tested against the null hypothesis h0 of independence between wvsci and each of the selected independent variables which avoids overfitting and biased selection among covariates a significance level of 0 05 was used in assessing all splits the classification error for each tree was calculated using an out of bag oob built in test sample to generate oob error making it unnecessary to create training and testing samples the overall model performance was evaluated using the classification accuracy that is calculated by 1 oob error 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality patterns summary statistics for each variable in the overall dataset i e 2102 sites and the independent watershed subset i e 909 sites are provided in tables s2 and s3 respectively the percentage of sites identified as impaired i e wvsci 68 among the overall dataset was 37 6 which is slightly higher than that among the independent watershed subset 28 3 fig 3 this is not necessarily unexpected as the sites in the independent watershed subset are generally near headwaters whereas the overall dataset includes additional sites located farther downstream and thus impacted cumulatively by a greater variety of upstream watershed activities while the overall dataset can more holistically represent the wvsci levels across the entire state the independent watershed subset is directly more useful in investigating the impact of particular watershed anthropogenic activities i e to limit interdependence between sites a comparison of the seven groups within the independent watershed subset indicates that a relatively low degree of disturbance i e the n and m1 groups or disturbance by a single category of activities i e the e or r groups is associated with much lower percentages of benthic impairments versus the groups with moderate to high degrees of mixed disturbances i e m2 m3 and m4 fig 3 for example the percentage of impaired sites for groups m2 m4 35 1 74 1 was two times greater than or more the impaired percentages for the e 17 9 r 10 0 and n 13 6 groups the percentage of impairment in the m1 group 10 4 which had sites with relatively low degree of mixed disturbance was similar to that in the r 10 0 and n 13 6 groups these findings suggest that multiple upstream watershed anthropogenic activities can have a synergistic negative effect on the health of benthic macroinvertebrate communities the slightly higher percentage of impairment in group n relative to those in r or m1 may seem surprising given that sites in group n were 86 5 100 forested with no other notable human activities except for small percentage of agriculture grass land i e 0 7 3 in this region however it should be noted that the wvsci scores for the impaired sites in n 59 22 60 55 were very close to the threshold value of 68 whereas those in r 35 41 59 32 and m1 34 44 60 05 represented a much wider range of impaired scores 3 2 relative effects of water quality and physical habitat on wvsci categories in the overall dataset the classification accuracy of the conditional inference tree model used to visualize the interactive impacts of the top five most important predictor variables was quite high 72 1 the importance plot showing the relative importance of all selected predictor variables on wvsci is provided in fig s1 more than 80 of streams were classified as unimpaired when rbp score was above 142 and specific conductance was below 435 μs cm fig 4 in contrast more than 60 of streams were impaired when rbp was above 142 and specific conductance was above 435 μs cm or when rbp was below 142 and one of the following conditions existed that generally signal high ionic strength 1 total calcium concentration was above 76 6 mg l 2 total calcium concentration was between 24 3 mg l and 76 6 mg l and embeddedness was below 10 or 3 total calcium concentration was between 24 3 mg l and 76 6 mg l and embeddedness was above 10 and specific conductance was above 541 μs cm fig 4 high calcium concentrations in many of the study streams are likely indicative of mining related disturbances to local carbonate rich geology and in some instances calcium may be contributed by acid mine drainage treatment moreover the identification of total calcium concentrations as an important predictor of the wvsci categories may also results from high collinearity between total calcium concentration and specific conductance spearman s rank correlation coefficient 0 93 table s4 the high number of observations in the overall dataset i e n 2102 do not allow a conditional permutation importance test to avoid overestimation of the importance of highly correlated predictor variables strobl et al 2008 the above observations suggest that in general good habitat and low specific conductance tend to promote healthy benthic communities which is consistent with findings of previous small scale studies cook et al 2015 timpano et al 2015 however the study data clearly shows that high probability of impairments can occur across a wide range of conditions such that neither good habitat nor low specific conductance alone can reliably predict healthy benthic communities this findings highlight potential implications for overgeneralized stream mitigation practice and indicate that consistent with several previous studies palmer and hondula 2014 ziemkiewicz and northway 2013 practices should be focused on site specific data and a holistic understanding of multiple benthic stressors 3 3 relative effects of water quality and physical habitat on wvsci categories with respect to energy extraction and other anthropogenic activities in order to examine the effects of distinct primary watershed activities conditional inference tree models using the top five most important predictor variables of wvsci categories were also generated for each of the seven groups within the independent watershed subset fig 5 the importance plot of the predictor variables is provided in fig s2 s8 for all seven models the classification accuracy was high i e 76 2 12 5 sulfate concentration was the key predictor variable for sites predominantly affected by energy extraction activities i e group e fig 5a when sulfate concentration was above 316 mg l 100 of streams were impaired while only 9 were impaired when sulfate concentration was below 316 mg l high sulfate sites generally also had higher specific conductance i e 611 2847 μs cm when sulfate concentration was above 316 mg l vs 20 916 μs cm when sulfate concentration was below 316 mg l this indicated that for sites impacted by energy extraction activities only ionic strength was a major predictor for benthic macroinvertebrate communities rather than physical habitat this finding is consistent with a previous study where streams were rigorously selected to only represent impacts of mining activities timpano et al 2015 in contrast for sites predominantly affected by residential development i e group r bank stability was the strongest predictor of wvsci categories fig 5b for these sites a bank stability value of 9 was observed as a critical threshold i e 54 of streams were impaired when bank stability was below 9 vs 7 when bank stability was above 9 it is worth noting that sites with poor bank stability i e below 9 generally had relatively low specific conductance i e below the proposed benchmark of 300 μs cm this suggests that in these watersheds physical habitat is the major predictor of benthic macroinvertebrate communities rather than ionic strength taken together the results of both the development and energy extraction groups echo to the work of merriam et al 2011 which found strong correlations between residential development physical habitat and macroinvertebrate community structure whereas acute changes in water quality were correlated with mining activities merriam et al 2011 when considering sites impacted by a mix of residential development and energy extraction activities both physical habitat and water quality appear to play important roles in shaping the stream condition as shown in fig 5e g for the m2 m3 and m4 groups the top tier variable in the conditional inference trees was consistently associated with habitat i e either total rbp or embeddedness and the second tier variables were consistently associated with water quality i e total calcium total magnesium chloride or specific conductance for the groups with relatively low levels of residential development and energy extraction m1 or no known impacts n water quality appears to be the most important predictor variable for wvsci low ph i e below 4 71 was associated with about half of the total benthic impairments in group n which may indicate that acid deposition is likely contributing to the impairment in this group notably neither habitat nor ionic strength were major predictors for sites in this group fig 5c for the m1 group somewhat elevated magnesium appears to be the key predictor variable of benthic impairments fig 5d the threshold value of 8 1 mg l total magnesium found by the model is not particularly high in the context of wv surface waters wvdep 2015 so it is likely that elevated total magnesium concentration is simply correlated with increased hardness and or specific conductance which may be general indicators of disturbed soil and or rock layers water treatment or interaction between surface and groundwater upstream of sampling sites in general sites in the m1 and n categories had much healthier benthic communities i e only 10 15 impaired as compared to the watersheds with higher degrees of anthropogenic influence i e 35 74 of m2 m3 m4 sites impaired 3 4 management implications for streams in the us and beyond restoration and conservation of stream ecosystem health is tough and complicated work that demand holistic interdisciplinary approaches previous studies have shown restoration projects targeted physical habitat improvement alone often resulted in unsatisfactory ecological outcomes as such failure is becoming widely recognized in both the us palmer et al 2014 and other countries nilsson et al 2015 voulvoulis et al 2017 there has been an increasing emphasis on how multiple factors interactively affect stream ecosystem health palmer et al 2014 voulvoulis et al 2017 the results of this present study show good habitat and low specific conductance are generally favorable for healthy benthic macroinvertebrate communities which is in keeping with previous studies cook et al 2015 cormier et al 2013 merriam et al 2015a b it is worth noting that relative importance each of multiple factors plays in affecting stream ecosystem health status differs substantially between watersheds dominated by energy extraction activities versus those dominated by residential development while ionic strength appears to be the major predictor for watersheds affected primarily by energy extraction activities across the sites surveyed in west virginia physical habitat degradation appears the major predictor for watersheds affected by residential development therefore a thorough field investigation of the target site and upstream watershed is essential for the design of more effective restoration strategies without taken into consideration of upstream watershed activities the application of a single field based benchmark for specific conductance i e 300 μs cm may likely be insufficient to protect aquatic ecosystem health of all streams across central appalachia a comparison of stream restoration efforts across multiple countries generated the following recommendations 1 a holistic approach integrating all parts of the complex ecosystems and their interactions is emphasized for more effective stream restoration efforts while this has been highlighted in several water regulations and initiatives worldwide e g the federal clean water act in the us and the water framework directive in eu a departure of existing implementation efforts from the systemic intentions likely resulted in the unsatisfactory ecological outcomes palmer et al 2014 voulvoulis et al 2017 therefore there is an urgent need for a rigorous revision of current implementation of stream restoration plans 2 while it is almost impossible to perform a holistic analysis of potential limiting factors for every polluted water bodies establishment of distinctive pilot study areas with intensive monitoring and modeling on an array of abiotic and biotic factors would be indispensably important to generate understandings that can provide implications beyond the specific study areas 3 standardized long term monitoring efforts are needed to follow up with the effectiveness of implementation efforts as a lack of outcome evaluation or a lack of consistence in the evaluation processes makes it challenging to understand how biodiversity and ecosystem functions response to restoration strategies carré et al 2017 dedieu et al 2016 notably stream bottom sediments typically associated with higher levels of pollutants deserve more extensive monitoring efforts as bottom sediments and associated pollutants are frequently identified as a major stressor for degradation of stream ecosystem health in many different types of watersheds amweg et al 2006 carré et al 2017 govenor et al 2017 pettigrove and hoffmann 2005 4 conclusions the findings of this study highlight the interactive impacts of water quality and habitat on stream ecosystem health which vary substantially among different types of watersheds with multiple sources of anthropogenic disturbance in contrast to previous studies focusing on a few distinctively selected sites the present study was grounded on an extensive monitoring database across west virginia in eastern us encompassing thousands of evenly distributed sites that represent various anthropogenic activities in addition the application of the conditional random forest algorithm demonstrated successful identification and visualization of the complex interactive impacts of multiple environmental factors by selecting an independent watershed subset to study the impacts of distinct watershed anthropogenic activities these data provide important clues regarding the types of restoration plans that may be considered for streams with varying anthropogenic influences sites impacted by a mixture of high levels of energy extraction and residential development will likely require the most extensive remediation efforts including improvement of both physical habitat and water quality in watersheds dominated by mining water quality appears most critical to aquatic communities while stable habitat is most important in residential sites it is important to recognize that while the selection of independent watershed subset allows the investigation of the impacts of different watershed activities the over representation of low order streams can represent distinct ecologies and structures that may not always be representative of the total riverine system in addition elevated levels of stream bottom sediments which physically impair habitat and may comprise higher levels of contaminants than the water column are not currently routinely monitored or explicitly regulated though they were frequently associated with aquatic ecological impairment in many different types of watershed therefore future studies should evaluate both

19803,the removal of bromate bro3 as a by product of ozonation in subsequent managed aquifer recharge mar systems specifically in anoxic nitrate no3 reducing zones has so far gained little attention in this study batch reactors and columns were used to explore the influence of no3 and increased assimilable organic carbon aoc due to ozonation pre treatment on bro3 removal in mar systems 8 m column experiments were carried out for 10 months to investigate bro3 behavior in anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems anoxic batch experiments showed that an increase of aoc promoted microbial activity and corresponding bro3 removal a drastic increase of bro3 biodegradation was observed in the sudden absence of no3 in both batch reactors and columns indicating that bro3 and no3 competed for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and no3 was preferred as an electron acceptor under the simultaneous presence of no3 and bro3 however within 75 days absence of no3 in the anoxic column bro3 removal gradually decreased indicating that the presence of no3 is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones in the 8 m anoxic column set up retention time 6 days the bro3 removal achieved levels as low as 1 3 μg l starting at 60 μg l 98 removal taken together bro3 removal is likely to occur in vicinity of no3 reducing anoxic zones so mar systems following ozonation are potentially effective to remove bro3 graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromate nitrate denitrifying bacteria managed aquifer recharge ozonation 1 introduction managed aquifer recharge mar such as artificial recharge and dune filtration is a natural water treatment process that induces surface water to flow through the soil after soil passage the water is abstracted by vertical or horizontal wells bouwer 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 in some european countries water utilities use mar as a robust and cost effective water treatment process to supply drinking water without needing to use chlorination as a disinfection process because of its pathogen removal ability lekkerkerker 2012 maeng 2010 van der hoek et al 2014 additionally mar has proven to be an effective barrier for multiple organic micro pollutants omps present in surface waters during drinking water production due to filtration sorption ion exchange precipitation and biological degradation kim et al 2015 laws et al 2011 postigo and barceló 2015 however some highly persistent trace organic compounds can still be detected in mar filtrate drewes et al 2003 and may reach the drinking water supply ternes et al 2002 ozonation is a powerful process for the removal of many omps and the combination of mar with ozonation as a pre treatment has been suggested as a comprehensive treatment system to effectively remove various omps during drinking water production lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 lekkerkerker et al 2009 oller et al 2011 however bromate bro3 a genotoxic carcinogen ahmad et al 2013 may be formed when ozonation is applied in the treatment of bromide containing water assuncao et al 2011 haag and holgne 1983 kurokawa et al 1990 who usepa and the european union have set drinking water regulations for the maximum allowable concentration of bro3 at 10 μg l carney 1991 eu 1998 forum 2005 who 2011 bro3 cannot be easily eliminated using conventional treatment technologies due to its high solubility and stability in water butler et al 2005 and its weak sorption characteristics to common soil and sediment components several studies involving different chemical physical and biological techniques have been conducted bhatnagar and sillanpää 2012 hijnen et al 1999 jia et al 2015 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 microbial bro3 reduction may be an effective treatment strategy because microbiological reduction of bro3 has been observed in anaerobic activated sludge columns biologically active carbon filters and denitrifying bioreactors hijnen et al 1999 kirisits et al 2001 van ginkel et al 2005 the study of van ginkel et al 2005 showed that bro3 reduction was detected only in the absence of o2 in a microbial culture from activated sludge however some other studies found that bro3 reduction could also take place in the presence of o2 for example a biological activated carbon bac filter almost completely reduced 60 μg l bro3 to br at both 2 and 8 mg l influent dissolved oxygen do concentrations liu et al 2012 therefore redox condition may be one of the important factors impacting bro3 removal in mar systems hijnen et al 1995 isolated denitrifying organisms that were able to reduce bro3 with ethanol as the electron donor and carbon source hijnen et al 1999 showed that bro3 was removed in a denitrifying bioreactor fed with methanol however they demonstrated that bro3 removal in a denitrifying bioreactor did not seem to be a realistic option in drinking water treatment due to the long contact times required for bro3 removal and extensive post treatment necessary to remove excessive methanol and released biomass the anoxic zone within mar systems might be effective in reducing bro3 as retention times in the subsurface are days to months however there has been only one study hübner et al 2012 concerning the removal of bro3 in mar systems since hijnen et al 1999 and kruithof and meijers 1995 mentioned that soil passage under anoxic conditions such as artificial recharge and river bank filtration may enable bro3 removal from ozonated water only recently hübner et al 2016 studied bro3 removal in 1 m sand columns with a focus on treatment of secondary effluent wastewater instead of drinking water treatment they observed that bro3 was effectively reduced under anoxic conditions instead of oxic conditions and that no3 and bro3 were consumed as electron acceptors simultaneously in small scale columns however because microbial biodegradation in secondary effluent differs given high dissolved organic carbon doc and no3 concentrations these findings cannot be directly translated to surface water infiltration sites for drinking water production water composition e g no3 so4 2 clo3 and clo4 is known to affect bro3 reduction in reactors demirel et al 2014 fan et al 2006 kirisits et al 2001 xu et al 2015b so it is likely to affect biological bro3 reduction during mar as well several microbial bro3 conversion pathways have been described in literature bro3 was reduced to bromide by denitrifying and clo3 reducing enrichments possibly via co metabolic action of no3 reductase and clo3 reductase enzymes downing and nerenberg 2007 other studies suggested the existence of a specific bro3 reduction pathway davidson et al 2011 additionally the aerobically expressed selenate reductase of enterobacter cloacae is capable of low rates of bro3 reduction ridley et al 2006 indicating that oxic bacteria might also be capable of bro3 reduction therefore although different bro3 removal pathways have been identified it is unknown whether these pathways exist during mar soil passage the objectives of this study were to explore the bro3 removal in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems and the potential mechanisms behind this removal specifically the influence of a increased assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations due to ozonation pre treatment and b no3 long term presence sudden absence and long term absence and c bro3 removal performance with infiltration retention time in 8 m anoxic zones were investigated in order to evaluate the feasibility of bro3 removal by mar systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and sand the water used in this study was collected every two weeks from the mar site of dunea a drinking water company in the netherlands the composition of mar influent water is shown in table s1 in the supplemental information the sand used in batch reactors and column reactors was collected from a 1 m depth from the mar site of dunea chemicals nabro3 nano3 ch3coona k2so4 and purolite a520e resin were purchased from sigma st louis mo united states all chemicals were of ar grade all solutions used in this study were prepared using water from a millipore milli q system 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the role of increased aoc from ozonation as a pre treatment for mar and the influence of no3 on bro3 removal batch experiments using 15 glass bottles with a volume of 500 ml were performed for approximately 3 months under anoxic conditions the batch reactors were filled with 100 g sand and 400 ml mar water this ratio of mar water and sand was chosen from previous literature that also focused on mar studies wang et al 2016 anoxic conditions were provided by stripping the water with nitrogen gas for 15 min then sealing the bottles with rubber stoppers and plastic caps all batch reactors were placed in a dark room with temperature control 11 5 0 5 c a 60 day acclimation period was necessary to stabilize the batch reactors with respect to doc removal fill and draw mode during the acclimation period hydraulic retention time hrt 7 d next the 15 bottles were divided into 5 groups with different doc concentrations and different no3 concentrations as shown in fig 1 a three batch reactors as reference group 1 to distinguish bro3 adsorption from biological bro3 removal in group 2 were autoclaved at 121 c for 40 min to inactivate bacteria ozonation can oxidize a part of doc into biodegradable doc so 1 mg l of additional c ch3coona was dosed in group 3 to investigate the effect of ozonation pre treatment on bro3 removal the aim of groups 4 and 5 was to assess the effect of the sudden absence of no3 on bro3 removal the microbial community may change in the absence of no3 after a certain time to achieve bro3 removal as early as possible before microbial community change 4 mg l c ch3coona was dosed into groups 4 and 5 to promote microbial activity also for groups 4 and 5 the concentration of no3 initially present in the mar water was measured daily until it fell below the detection limit 0 89 mg l then 10 mg l no3 was dosed to group 4 and not to group 5 60 μg l bro3 was dosed to all batch reactors after the acclimation period and the above described different treatments bro3 no3 sulfate so4 2 adenosine triphosphate atp and doc samples were collected from groups 1 3 at day 7 and day 21 for groups 4 and 5 samples were collected after 2 7 h because of the high microbial activity in these groups caused by the 4 mg l c ch3coona dose 2 3 column experiments all columns l 1 m d 36 mm shown in fig 1b and c were constructed from pvc l 1 m d 36 mm a peristaltic multichannel pump 205 s watson marlow the netherlands using marprene pump tubes d 0 63 mm watson marlow the netherlands was connected to the columns by dark polyamide tubing d 2 9 mm festo the netherlands to feed both columns the columns were operated in continuous up flow mode at 11 5 0 5 c corresponding to the natural aquifer temperature in a dark room to prevent algal growth to avoid the leaching of soil sand grains both the top and bottom of the column were fitted with perforated pvc plates 30 holes d 0 8 mm that were covered with filter cloth 45 μm top7even net mesh the netherlands the oxic column was fed from a 10 l open glass bottle with dunea mar influent water and the anoxic columns were fed from 10 l sealed glass bottles with n2 flushing as pre treatment feed bottles were washed twice with acetone and flushed several times with demineralized water before refilling to avoid biofilm formation before starting the bro3 experiment these columns had been acclimated for 3 months until steady state conditions were reached with respect to doc removal and no3 removal 2 3 1 1 m oxic and anoxic sand columns to investigate bro3 biodegradation performance in oxic zones and anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems and to study the influence of no3 on bro3 removal column experiments using a 1 m oxic sand column simulating oxic zones and a 1 m anoxic sand column simulating anoxic zones of mar systems were carried out in the presence and absence of no3 the hydraulic retention time was 22 h for both columns corresponding to a filtration velocity of 1 m day the experiment lasted 13 months in total a 3 months acclimation period followed by a 10 month period divided into two phases in the first phase no3 was present in the influent water while in the second phase no3 was absent during the 13 months experiment 150 μg l c ch3coona was dosed to the influent water of both oxic and anoxic columns to simulate the increased aoc from ozonation since in practice the ozonation pre treatment before mar increases the aoc hammes et al 2006 orlandini et al 1997 sarathy et al 2011 van der hoek et al 1998 and as reported by hammes et al 2006 60 90 of the aoc consists of organic acid carbon bro3 formation at concentrations ranging from 2 to 293 μg l has been reported during ozonation of natural waters under normal drinking water treatment conditions amy et al 2000 glaze et al 1993 krasner et al 1993 van der hoek et al 1998 but in 100 investigated drinking water utilities bro3 concentration was within the range of 2 60 μg l after ozonation of water containing 2 429 μg l br butler et al 2005 kirisits and snoeyink 1999 for this study it was decided to investigate the upper value of this range so 60 μg l bro3 was dosed to the influent of the oxic column and anoxic columns a summary of bro3 and aoc formed during ozonation based on existing literature agbaba et al 2016 escobar and randall 2001 huang and chen 2004 orlandini et al 1997 van der hoek et al 1998 is presented in table s2 the influent water of these columns was no3 containing mar water in phase 1 while in phase 2 the influent was no3 free mar water no3 free water was produced by using a strong base anion exchange resin purolite a520e ratio of water and resin 2 l 20 g to remove no3 to below the detection limit 0 89 mg l the water was in contact with the resin were for a period of 12 h the ion exchange resin used to remove no3 from the mar water was pre treated as follows firstly a520e resin was soaked in both 1 m naoh solution followed by 1 m hcl solution or one day each to remove impurities afterwards the resin was washed several times using demineralized water until ph 7 was reached finally the clean resin was dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h and kept in a desiccator until use since purolite a520e resin removes not only no3 but also a portion of so4 2 50 mg l so4 2 was dosed back to the influent water in phase 2 influent water samples and corresponding effluent water samples were collected every 1 2 weeks during each phase to measure bro3 no3 and so4 2 concentrations do concentrations in the influent and effluent of oxic and anoxic columns were measured to confirm oxic and anoxic conditions 2 3 2 8 m anoxic columns a long anoxic column set up consisting of eight 1 m columns in series was used for 10 months to better simulate anoxic zones of mar systems since the retention time 6 days was much longer than the above 1 m anoxic column in section 2 3 1 the objective of the long anoxic column was to further investigate bro3 biodegradation with respect to retention time in anoxic no3 reducing zones and to further assess the role of aoc formation as a result of ozonation pre treatment on bro3 biodegradation the whole experiment consisted of a 4 months acclimation period followed by two phases with and without an extra 150 μg l c ch3coona in the influent water each phase was carried out for 3 4 months to establish a stable bro3 removal water samples were collected 4 7 times at depth 0 m 1 m 3 m and 8 m that is retention time 0 0 75 2 25 and 6 days during each phase to measure bro3 no3 and so4 2 concentrations do concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured to confirm anoxic conditions 2 4 sample analysis dissolved oxygen do temperature and ph were measured with a multimeter sentix 940 ids probe multi 340i wtw germany directly in the feed bottle or in a flow through cell connected to the influent or effluent tubes of the columns bro3 no3 and so4 2 samples were analysed by ion chromatography at het waterlaboratorium haarlem the netherlands following ion chromatography bro3 was also analysed by conductivity detection 30 ml samples were pre treated by filtration on barium and silver loaded on guard columns to remove sulfate and chloride respectively followed by a h column for the removal of ag ions leaching from the ag column 2000 μl of the sample was subsequently concentrated on a positively charged anion exchange column dionex ionpac ag9sc the anions on the ion exchange column were eluted with 1 5 ml min of a 0 7 mm nahco3 solution and separated on an ion exchange analytical column dionex ionpac as9sc detection was performed by using suppressed conductivity the measured bro3 concentration was confirmed using a two point calibrated uv absorption measurement at a wavelength of 200 nm the bro3 detection limit was 0 5 μg l no3 and so4 2 were analysed with a profic 15 ancat ion chromatograph metrohm 881 anion suppressed and 883 cation system metrohm switzerland after filtering through 0 45 μm filters whatman germany a supp 150 4 0 anion column was used with 3 2 mm na2co3 and 1 mm nahco3 eluent for the anions measurement regenerant for the suppressor was 50 mm h2so4 detection limits of no3 and so4 2 were 0 89 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively doc was measured with a shimadzu toc analyser according to the protocols described in wang et al 2016 3 results 3 1 batch reactor experiments 3 1 1 effect of increased aoc due to ozonation as pre treatment fig 2 presents bro3 concentrations over 7 days fig 2a and 21 days fig 2b in anoxic batch reactors with mar water and acetate supplemented mar water and autoclaved batch reactors with mar water in the reference experiments with autoclaved batch reactors bro3 degradation over 7 days and 21 days was not observed indicating bro3 adsorption did not occur therefore the bro3 removal was caused by biodegradation instead of adsorption which is in agreement with the studies of xie and shang 2006 and weast 1986 though differences were small bromate removal was found not to be significant p 0 05 in mar water while removal was observed in acetate supplemented mar water slightly more bro3 was removed in acetate supplemented mar water after 21 days 9 μg l 16 9 compared to 7 days 2 4 μg l 4 2 fig 3 presents no3 concentrations over 7 days fig 3a and 21 days fig 3b in anoxic batch reactors with mar water group 2 and acetate supplemented mar water group 3 no3 was not significantly biodegraded in mar water p 0 05 while no3 was biodegraded in acetate supplemented mar water over 7 days 2 6 mg l 22 7 p 0 05 and at a greater magnitude after 21 days 17 8 mg l 87 8 p 0 05 these results demonstrate that the retention time as well as the availability of aoc is an important factor influencing bro3 and no3 biodegradation with no3 degradation occurring faster than bro3 degradation 3 1 2 presence of no3 the influence of no3 on bro3 removal was investigated in anoxic batch reactors containing acetate supplemented mar water in the presence and sudden absence of no3 fig 4 no bro3 biodegradation p 0 05 was observed in batch reactors with an initial no3 concentration of 6 1 mg l while a clear decrease of no3 p 0 05 from 6 1 mg l to 3 8 mg l was observed after 2 7 h in case of a sudden absence of no3 in the batch reactors lower than 0 89 mg l bro3 was reduced from 47 μg l to 35 μg l in 2 7 h p 0 05 indicating that no3 and bro3 compete for biodegradation 3 2 1 m column experiments 3 2 1 oxic and anoxic zones the removal of bro3 no3 and so4 2 in 1 m oxic and anoxic columns retention time 22 h for 98 days are shown in fig 5 bro3 removal was slightly higher in the anoxic column 8 than in the oxic column 5 7 although the difference was not significant p 0 05 10 7 no3 was removed in the anoxic column indicating anoxic conditions were indeed reached in the oxic column no3 was not converted and passed through the column no significant so4 2 removal in both oxic and anoxic columns was observed so neither columns reached so4 2 reducing conditions 3 2 2 effect of no3 the 1 m columns were operated in two subsequent phases during phase 1 day 0 98 10 3 1 8 mg l no3 was present in the influent whereas during phase 2 day 98 209 no3 was extracted from the influent until the concentration was lower than 0 89 mg l fig 6 presents bro3 removal in the oxic and anoxic columns with long term presence and absence of no3 during phase 1 the bro3 removal in the oxic column 1 3 11 2 and anoxic column 3 9 11 7 with a 22 h retention time was not highly effective however during phase 2 the sudden absence of no3 in the influent water at day 98 resulted in sharp initial increases of bro3 reduction 82 5 in anoxic column and 13 6 in oxic column after which bro3 removal decreased to 61 4 in the anoxic column and 0 32 in the oxic column in day 98 99 5 after that the oxic column had a very limited bro3 removal of 0 3 3 lower than that in the presence of no3 whereas the bro3 removal in the anoxic column gradually decreased and finally returned to a steady 5 5 12 9 during 99 5 209 days 3 3 8 m column experiments 3 3 1 effect of infiltration retention time in order to investigate the effect of infiltration retention time during mar a series of columns 8 m total 6 days retention time was operated with mar influent water for several months fig 7 presents the continuous bro3 removal during the final 2 months for 1 3 and 8 m infiltration depth in the first 1 m corresponding to a retention time of 0 75 day no clear bro3 and no3 removal was observed after 3 m infiltration corresponding to a retention time of 2 25 days bro3 and no3 remaining concentrations were clearly lower than the influent concentrations with 20 4 bro3 and 15 8 no3 removal after 8 m of soil passage 48 2 bro3 and 30 2 no3 were removed and the final bro3 concentration reached with a retention time of 6 days was 29 6 μg l 3 3 2 effect of increased aoc due to ozonation pre treatment fig 8 presents concentrations of bro3 no3 and so4 2 along the column height of the 8 m anoxic columns in series containing acetate supplemented mar water phase 1 fig 8a and mar water phase 2 fig 8b respectively fig 8a shows that bro3 was removed by 8 59 and 98 at a depth of 1 m 3 m and 8 m respectively no3 was removed by 8 51 and 80 at a depth of 1 m 3 m and 8 m respectively consequently at the end of the 8 m column corresponding to an infiltration retention time of 6 days the bro3 concentration was as low as 1 3 μg l and the no3 concentration was 1 1 mg l no so4 2 removal was observed in this column set up with and without the increased aoc concentration as a result of ozonation pre treatment indicating no so4 2 reducing conditions were reached comparison of the no3 and bro3 removal efficiencies of the two phases consistently shows better bro3 and no3 removal over the height of the column indicating that the addition of 150 μg l c ch3coona resulted in substantially higher bro3 and no3 removals 4 discussion 4 1 role of no3 in bro3 removal as stated in the introduction it has been reported by other authors that biological bro3 reduction is a side reaction of the no3 reduction pathway butler et al 2005 korom 1992 and bro3 can be biodegraded by several other anoxic bacteria instead of denitrifying bacteria davidson et al 2011 both anoxic batch reactors and 1 m anoxic column experiments showed that bro3 removal in the presence of no3 was low and no3 biodegradation was higher indicating that bro3 biodegradation can occur in the presence of no3 bro3 removal suddenly increased due to the sudden absence of no3 indicating that bro3 and no3 in mar systems may compete for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria prefer no3 over bro3 although the biodegradation of no3 and bro3 occur simultaneously in anoxic no3 reducing zones in fig 8 the bro3 biodegradation rate may initially appear higher than no3 biodegradation rate in 1 8 m but actually the mass of no3 reduction phase 1 2 02 mg l m in 1 8 m phase 2 0 63 mg l m in 1 8 m was much higher than the mass of bro3 biodegradation phase 1 20 59 μg l m phase 2 10 27 μg l m in 1 8 m some studies demonstrated the potential role of no3 reductase in bro3 reduction davidson et al 2011 hijnen et al 1995 it can be observed from fig 8 that both no3 and bro3 biodegradation rates in the first 1 m column passage were lower than from 1 to 3 m one potential explanation for this result is that even if the anoxic condition were achieved in the first 1 m do became lower with increasing retention time and resulted in more active no3 reductase bell et al 1990 cavigelli and robertson 2000 and correspondingly more no3 and bro3 biodegradation no3 and bro3 biodegradation rates reduced in 3 8 m soil passage than higher up in the column which can be potentially explained by aoc becoming insufficient as retention time increased and therefore lowered the level of microbial activity in the 1 m anoxic column a rapid decrease of bro3 removal was observed in 1 5 days running time 98 99 5 days following an increase due to the sudden absence of no3 subsequently a gradual decrease of bro3 biodegradation within 2 5 months phase 2 in fig 6 was observed this study is the first documentation of bro3 removal in the long term absence of no3 korner and zumft 1989 concluded that the presence of nitrogen oxides was a prerequisite to promote the synthesis and the activity of denitrification enzymes several other studies cove 1966 saleh lakha et al 2009 sun et al 2016 reported that no3 absence or limited no3 leads to a decrease of denitrification functional genes and no3 reductase activity decay or denitrification rate decrease in several hours in pure microbial species and mixed microbial strains therefore the rapid decrease of bro3 removal in the 8 m column from 82 5 to 61 4 in 1 5 days running time 98 99 5 days can potentially be explained by the limitation of no3 reductase activity of denitrifying bacteria by a no3 concentration below detection limit 0 89 mg l the gradual decrease of bro3 biodegradation fits the first order kinetic model with the first order decay constant 0 034 day fig s1 in the supplemental information the decay of heterotrophic bacteria due to a lack of substrate is a relatively slow process particularly under anoxic conditions lin 2008 showed that when no3 or glucose were limited in a moving fixed bed biofilm reactor denitrifying bacterial biomass decayed from 100 to 51 5 in 11 days with a first order kinetic coefficient of 0 061 day although the decay rate of denitrifying bacteria reported in the previous study lin 2008 is faster double than the observed bro3 removal decrease given that these experiments were performed under different conditions including higher temperatures 20 25 c vs 11 c the results of lin 2008 indicate the hypothesized relationship between denitrifying bacteria biomass and bro3 removal 4 2 ozonation as mar pre treatment figs 2 3 and 7 show that in both the batch experiments and the 8 m column experiment the addition of extra c ch3coona simulating formation of aoc during ozonation pre treatment resulted in slight but significantly higher no3 and bro3 reductions this observation is similar to the results of kirisits et al 2001 who showed that the increase of doc as an external electron donor resulted in the increase of bro3 reduction in a bac filter the addition of extra carbon stimulated microbial growth which was monitored with atp measurements biomass in the batch reactors with 1 mg l c ch3coona addition was approximately two times as high as in the reference reactors 3 3 ng ml and 1 5 ng ml respectively fig s2 this result suggests that an increase of aoc as a result of the ozonation pre treatment can promote microbial activity and therefore bro3 removal in subsequent mar systems inevitably the ozonation pre treatment not only affects the aoc concentration but also causes high concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in the mar influent water in the column studies bro3 reduction was much higher in the anoxic column than in the oxic column indicating that biological reduction of bro3 predominantly occurs in anoxic zones instead of oxic zones in mar systems this result is in agreement with previous studies hübner et al 2016 kirisits et al 2001 liu et al 2012 hijnen et al 1995 found that bro3 reduction was inhibited by oxygen controlled column studies simulating mar revealed inefficient bro3 removal under oxic conditions in the study of hübner et al 2012 this observation can be potentially explained by do being preferred over bro3 and no3 as a competing electron acceptor it is therefore recommended to design ozonation mar systems in such a way that anoxic zones develop which can generally be achieved by extending the subsurface retention time depending on site specific water quality and hydrogeological conditions oxic zones are usually found in the first several meters with a retention time of a couple of hours to days bertelkamp et al 2016 therefore the ozonation effluent with high oxygen concentrations is not likely to limit biological bro3 reduction in most mar systems 4 3 redox conditions in mar fig s3 in the supplemental information shows redox conditions in mar systems and the theoretical sequence of terminal electron acceptor processes the initial infiltration phase in mar systems are usually oxic followed first by no3 reducing and then fe mn reducing zones bertelkamp et al 2016 lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 maeng et al 2010 schmidt et al 2011 this study only focused on bro3 removal in oxic and no3 reducing anoxic zones in the oxic column the observed slight bro3 reduction fig 6 is an indication that minor bro3 reduction by oxic bacteria in mar systems can also take place based on the absence of no3 removal in the oxic column it can be concluded that no denitrifying bacteria or anoxic microniches were present in this column therefore bro3 reduction by denitrifying bacteria in this oxic column can be excluded in the current study the retention time in the 8 m anoxic column was 6 days 60 μg l bro3 was biodegraded to 1 3 μg l and 29 6 μg l in this long anoxic column set up with and without increased aoc respectively in practice travel times weeks months or even years for mar systems are much longer than those used in this study baumgarten et al 2011 grünheid et al 2005 stauder et al 2012 with a greater retention time of the anoxic no3 reducing zones in mar systems more bro3 than in the 8 m anoxic column with 6 days retention time may be biodegraded as the travel time is longer and thus the reaction time is also longer in addition the concentration of no3 as a competitor of bro3 reduction by denitrifying bacteria becomes lower and lower therefore bro3 biodegradation should be more efficient with greater retention time in anoxic zones especially in the zone immediately after no3 depletion i e at the interface of the anoxic denitrification zone and the fe mn oxide reduction zone additional evidence of this inference is illustrated by the study of hübner et al 2016 in which it was observed that bro3 removal in the presence of low no3 concentrations was significantly higher than in the presence of high no3 concentrations 5 conclusions this study focused on the effect of no3 and the role of increased aoc concentrations on the removal of bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems the following conclusions can be drawn bro3 and no3 compete for reduction by denitrifying bacteria but bro3 reduction and no3 reduction can occur simultaneously even if denitrifying bacteria prefer no3 to bro3 as an electron acceptor the presence of no3 is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems an increase of aoc as a result of ozonation pre treatment promotes microbial activity and therefore bro3 removal in subsequent mar systems in the 8 m long anoxic column retention time 6 days simulating anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems bro3 biodegraded to a concentration of 1 3 μg l indicating that bro3 biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria can happen in anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems mar systems following ozonation are potentially effective to biodegrade bro3

19803,the removal of bromate bro3 as a by product of ozonation in subsequent managed aquifer recharge mar systems specifically in anoxic nitrate no3 reducing zones has so far gained little attention in this study batch reactors and columns were used to explore the influence of no3 and increased assimilable organic carbon aoc due to ozonation pre treatment on bro3 removal in mar systems 8 m column experiments were carried out for 10 months to investigate bro3 behavior in anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems anoxic batch experiments showed that an increase of aoc promoted microbial activity and corresponding bro3 removal a drastic increase of bro3 biodegradation was observed in the sudden absence of no3 in both batch reactors and columns indicating that bro3 and no3 competed for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and no3 was preferred as an electron acceptor under the simultaneous presence of no3 and bro3 however within 75 days absence of no3 in the anoxic column bro3 removal gradually decreased indicating that the presence of no3 is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones in the 8 m anoxic column set up retention time 6 days the bro3 removal achieved levels as low as 1 3 μg l starting at 60 μg l 98 removal taken together bro3 removal is likely to occur in vicinity of no3 reducing anoxic zones so mar systems following ozonation are potentially effective to remove bro3 graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromate nitrate denitrifying bacteria managed aquifer recharge ozonation 1 introduction managed aquifer recharge mar such as artificial recharge and dune filtration is a natural water treatment process that induces surface water to flow through the soil after soil passage the water is abstracted by vertical or horizontal wells bouwer 2002 tufenkji et al 2002 in some european countries water utilities use mar as a robust and cost effective water treatment process to supply drinking water without needing to use chlorination as a disinfection process because of its pathogen removal ability lekkerkerker 2012 maeng 2010 van der hoek et al 2014 additionally mar has proven to be an effective barrier for multiple organic micro pollutants omps present in surface waters during drinking water production due to filtration sorption ion exchange precipitation and biological degradation kim et al 2015 laws et al 2011 postigo and barceló 2015 however some highly persistent trace organic compounds can still be detected in mar filtrate drewes et al 2003 and may reach the drinking water supply ternes et al 2002 ozonation is a powerful process for the removal of many omps and the combination of mar with ozonation as a pre treatment has been suggested as a comprehensive treatment system to effectively remove various omps during drinking water production lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 lekkerkerker et al 2009 oller et al 2011 however bromate bro3 a genotoxic carcinogen ahmad et al 2013 may be formed when ozonation is applied in the treatment of bromide containing water assuncao et al 2011 haag and holgne 1983 kurokawa et al 1990 who usepa and the european union have set drinking water regulations for the maximum allowable concentration of bro3 at 10 μg l carney 1991 eu 1998 forum 2005 who 2011 bro3 cannot be easily eliminated using conventional treatment technologies due to its high solubility and stability in water butler et al 2005 and its weak sorption characteristics to common soil and sediment components several studies involving different chemical physical and biological techniques have been conducted bhatnagar and sillanpää 2012 hijnen et al 1999 jia et al 2015 wang et al 2009 xu et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 microbial bro3 reduction may be an effective treatment strategy because microbiological reduction of bro3 has been observed in anaerobic activated sludge columns biologically active carbon filters and denitrifying bioreactors hijnen et al 1999 kirisits et al 2001 van ginkel et al 2005 the study of van ginkel et al 2005 showed that bro3 reduction was detected only in the absence of o2 in a microbial culture from activated sludge however some other studies found that bro3 reduction could also take place in the presence of o2 for example a biological activated carbon bac filter almost completely reduced 60 μg l bro3 to br at both 2 and 8 mg l influent dissolved oxygen do concentrations liu et al 2012 therefore redox condition may be one of the important factors impacting bro3 removal in mar systems hijnen et al 1995 isolated denitrifying organisms that were able to reduce bro3 with ethanol as the electron donor and carbon source hijnen et al 1999 showed that bro3 was removed in a denitrifying bioreactor fed with methanol however they demonstrated that bro3 removal in a denitrifying bioreactor did not seem to be a realistic option in drinking water treatment due to the long contact times required for bro3 removal and extensive post treatment necessary to remove excessive methanol and released biomass the anoxic zone within mar systems might be effective in reducing bro3 as retention times in the subsurface are days to months however there has been only one study hübner et al 2012 concerning the removal of bro3 in mar systems since hijnen et al 1999 and kruithof and meijers 1995 mentioned that soil passage under anoxic conditions such as artificial recharge and river bank filtration may enable bro3 removal from ozonated water only recently hübner et al 2016 studied bro3 removal in 1 m sand columns with a focus on treatment of secondary effluent wastewater instead of drinking water treatment they observed that bro3 was effectively reduced under anoxic conditions instead of oxic conditions and that no3 and bro3 were consumed as electron acceptors simultaneously in small scale columns however because microbial biodegradation in secondary effluent differs given high dissolved organic carbon doc and no3 concentrations these findings cannot be directly translated to surface water infiltration sites for drinking water production water composition e g no3 so4 2 clo3 and clo4 is known to affect bro3 reduction in reactors demirel et al 2014 fan et al 2006 kirisits et al 2001 xu et al 2015b so it is likely to affect biological bro3 reduction during mar as well several microbial bro3 conversion pathways have been described in literature bro3 was reduced to bromide by denitrifying and clo3 reducing enrichments possibly via co metabolic action of no3 reductase and clo3 reductase enzymes downing and nerenberg 2007 other studies suggested the existence of a specific bro3 reduction pathway davidson et al 2011 additionally the aerobically expressed selenate reductase of enterobacter cloacae is capable of low rates of bro3 reduction ridley et al 2006 indicating that oxic bacteria might also be capable of bro3 reduction therefore although different bro3 removal pathways have been identified it is unknown whether these pathways exist during mar soil passage the objectives of this study were to explore the bro3 removal in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems and the potential mechanisms behind this removal specifically the influence of a increased assimilable organic carbon aoc concentrations due to ozonation pre treatment and b no3 long term presence sudden absence and long term absence and c bro3 removal performance with infiltration retention time in 8 m anoxic zones were investigated in order to evaluate the feasibility of bro3 removal by mar systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 water and sand the water used in this study was collected every two weeks from the mar site of dunea a drinking water company in the netherlands the composition of mar influent water is shown in table s1 in the supplemental information the sand used in batch reactors and column reactors was collected from a 1 m depth from the mar site of dunea chemicals nabro3 nano3 ch3coona k2so4 and purolite a520e resin were purchased from sigma st louis mo united states all chemicals were of ar grade all solutions used in this study were prepared using water from a millipore milli q system 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the role of increased aoc from ozonation as a pre treatment for mar and the influence of no3 on bro3 removal batch experiments using 15 glass bottles with a volume of 500 ml were performed for approximately 3 months under anoxic conditions the batch reactors were filled with 100 g sand and 400 ml mar water this ratio of mar water and sand was chosen from previous literature that also focused on mar studies wang et al 2016 anoxic conditions were provided by stripping the water with nitrogen gas for 15 min then sealing the bottles with rubber stoppers and plastic caps all batch reactors were placed in a dark room with temperature control 11 5 0 5 c a 60 day acclimation period was necessary to stabilize the batch reactors with respect to doc removal fill and draw mode during the acclimation period hydraulic retention time hrt 7 d next the 15 bottles were divided into 5 groups with different doc concentrations and different no3 concentrations as shown in fig 1 a three batch reactors as reference group 1 to distinguish bro3 adsorption from biological bro3 removal in group 2 were autoclaved at 121 c for 40 min to inactivate bacteria ozonation can oxidize a part of doc into biodegradable doc so 1 mg l of additional c ch3coona was dosed in group 3 to investigate the effect of ozonation pre treatment on bro3 removal the aim of groups 4 and 5 was to assess the effect of the sudden absence of no3 on bro3 removal the microbial community may change in the absence of no3 after a certain time to achieve bro3 removal as early as possible before microbial community change 4 mg l c ch3coona was dosed into groups 4 and 5 to promote microbial activity also for groups 4 and 5 the concentration of no3 initially present in the mar water was measured daily until it fell below the detection limit 0 89 mg l then 10 mg l no3 was dosed to group 4 and not to group 5 60 μg l bro3 was dosed to all batch reactors after the acclimation period and the above described different treatments bro3 no3 sulfate so4 2 adenosine triphosphate atp and doc samples were collected from groups 1 3 at day 7 and day 21 for groups 4 and 5 samples were collected after 2 7 h because of the high microbial activity in these groups caused by the 4 mg l c ch3coona dose 2 3 column experiments all columns l 1 m d 36 mm shown in fig 1b and c were constructed from pvc l 1 m d 36 mm a peristaltic multichannel pump 205 s watson marlow the netherlands using marprene pump tubes d 0 63 mm watson marlow the netherlands was connected to the columns by dark polyamide tubing d 2 9 mm festo the netherlands to feed both columns the columns were operated in continuous up flow mode at 11 5 0 5 c corresponding to the natural aquifer temperature in a dark room to prevent algal growth to avoid the leaching of soil sand grains both the top and bottom of the column were fitted with perforated pvc plates 30 holes d 0 8 mm that were covered with filter cloth 45 μm top7even net mesh the netherlands the oxic column was fed from a 10 l open glass bottle with dunea mar influent water and the anoxic columns were fed from 10 l sealed glass bottles with n2 flushing as pre treatment feed bottles were washed twice with acetone and flushed several times with demineralized water before refilling to avoid biofilm formation before starting the bro3 experiment these columns had been acclimated for 3 months until steady state conditions were reached with respect to doc removal and no3 removal 2 3 1 1 m oxic and anoxic sand columns to investigate bro3 biodegradation performance in oxic zones and anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems and to study the influence of no3 on bro3 removal column experiments using a 1 m oxic sand column simulating oxic zones and a 1 m anoxic sand column simulating anoxic zones of mar systems were carried out in the presence and absence of no3 the hydraulic retention time was 22 h for both columns corresponding to a filtration velocity of 1 m day the experiment lasted 13 months in total a 3 months acclimation period followed by a 10 month period divided into two phases in the first phase no3 was present in the influent water while in the second phase no3 was absent during the 13 months experiment 150 μg l c ch3coona was dosed to the influent water of both oxic and anoxic columns to simulate the increased aoc from ozonation since in practice the ozonation pre treatment before mar increases the aoc hammes et al 2006 orlandini et al 1997 sarathy et al 2011 van der hoek et al 1998 and as reported by hammes et al 2006 60 90 of the aoc consists of organic acid carbon bro3 formation at concentrations ranging from 2 to 293 μg l has been reported during ozonation of natural waters under normal drinking water treatment conditions amy et al 2000 glaze et al 1993 krasner et al 1993 van der hoek et al 1998 but in 100 investigated drinking water utilities bro3 concentration was within the range of 2 60 μg l after ozonation of water containing 2 429 μg l br butler et al 2005 kirisits and snoeyink 1999 for this study it was decided to investigate the upper value of this range so 60 μg l bro3 was dosed to the influent of the oxic column and anoxic columns a summary of bro3 and aoc formed during ozonation based on existing literature agbaba et al 2016 escobar and randall 2001 huang and chen 2004 orlandini et al 1997 van der hoek et al 1998 is presented in table s2 the influent water of these columns was no3 containing mar water in phase 1 while in phase 2 the influent was no3 free mar water no3 free water was produced by using a strong base anion exchange resin purolite a520e ratio of water and resin 2 l 20 g to remove no3 to below the detection limit 0 89 mg l the water was in contact with the resin were for a period of 12 h the ion exchange resin used to remove no3 from the mar water was pre treated as follows firstly a520e resin was soaked in both 1 m naoh solution followed by 1 m hcl solution or one day each to remove impurities afterwards the resin was washed several times using demineralized water until ph 7 was reached finally the clean resin was dried in an oven at 80 c for 24 h and kept in a desiccator until use since purolite a520e resin removes not only no3 but also a portion of so4 2 50 mg l so4 2 was dosed back to the influent water in phase 2 influent water samples and corresponding effluent water samples were collected every 1 2 weeks during each phase to measure bro3 no3 and so4 2 concentrations do concentrations in the influent and effluent of oxic and anoxic columns were measured to confirm oxic and anoxic conditions 2 3 2 8 m anoxic columns a long anoxic column set up consisting of eight 1 m columns in series was used for 10 months to better simulate anoxic zones of mar systems since the retention time 6 days was much longer than the above 1 m anoxic column in section 2 3 1 the objective of the long anoxic column was to further investigate bro3 biodegradation with respect to retention time in anoxic no3 reducing zones and to further assess the role of aoc formation as a result of ozonation pre treatment on bro3 biodegradation the whole experiment consisted of a 4 months acclimation period followed by two phases with and without an extra 150 μg l c ch3coona in the influent water each phase was carried out for 3 4 months to establish a stable bro3 removal water samples were collected 4 7 times at depth 0 m 1 m 3 m and 8 m that is retention time 0 0 75 2 25 and 6 days during each phase to measure bro3 no3 and so4 2 concentrations do concentrations in the influent and effluent were measured to confirm anoxic conditions 2 4 sample analysis dissolved oxygen do temperature and ph were measured with a multimeter sentix 940 ids probe multi 340i wtw germany directly in the feed bottle or in a flow through cell connected to the influent or effluent tubes of the columns bro3 no3 and so4 2 samples were analysed by ion chromatography at het waterlaboratorium haarlem the netherlands following ion chromatography bro3 was also analysed by conductivity detection 30 ml samples were pre treated by filtration on barium and silver loaded on guard columns to remove sulfate and chloride respectively followed by a h column for the removal of ag ions leaching from the ag column 2000 μl of the sample was subsequently concentrated on a positively charged anion exchange column dionex ionpac ag9sc the anions on the ion exchange column were eluted with 1 5 ml min of a 0 7 mm nahco3 solution and separated on an ion exchange analytical column dionex ionpac as9sc detection was performed by using suppressed conductivity the measured bro3 concentration was confirmed using a two point calibrated uv absorption measurement at a wavelength of 200 nm the bro3 detection limit was 0 5 μg l no3 and so4 2 were analysed with a profic 15 ancat ion chromatograph metrohm 881 anion suppressed and 883 cation system metrohm switzerland after filtering through 0 45 μm filters whatman germany a supp 150 4 0 anion column was used with 3 2 mm na2co3 and 1 mm nahco3 eluent for the anions measurement regenerant for the suppressor was 50 mm h2so4 detection limits of no3 and so4 2 were 0 89 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively doc was measured with a shimadzu toc analyser according to the protocols described in wang et al 2016 3 results 3 1 batch reactor experiments 3 1 1 effect of increased aoc due to ozonation as pre treatment fig 2 presents bro3 concentrations over 7 days fig 2a and 21 days fig 2b in anoxic batch reactors with mar water and acetate supplemented mar water and autoclaved batch reactors with mar water in the reference experiments with autoclaved batch reactors bro3 degradation over 7 days and 21 days was not observed indicating bro3 adsorption did not occur therefore the bro3 removal was caused by biodegradation instead of adsorption which is in agreement with the studies of xie and shang 2006 and weast 1986 though differences were small bromate removal was found not to be significant p 0 05 in mar water while removal was observed in acetate supplemented mar water slightly more bro3 was removed in acetate supplemented mar water after 21 days 9 μg l 16 9 compared to 7 days 2 4 μg l 4 2 fig 3 presents no3 concentrations over 7 days fig 3a and 21 days fig 3b in anoxic batch reactors with mar water group 2 and acetate supplemented mar water group 3 no3 was not significantly biodegraded in mar water p 0 05 while no3 was biodegraded in acetate supplemented mar water over 7 days 2 6 mg l 22 7 p 0 05 and at a greater magnitude after 21 days 17 8 mg l 87 8 p 0 05 these results demonstrate that the retention time as well as the availability of aoc is an important factor influencing bro3 and no3 biodegradation with no3 degradation occurring faster than bro3 degradation 3 1 2 presence of no3 the influence of no3 on bro3 removal was investigated in anoxic batch reactors containing acetate supplemented mar water in the presence and sudden absence of no3 fig 4 no bro3 biodegradation p 0 05 was observed in batch reactors with an initial no3 concentration of 6 1 mg l while a clear decrease of no3 p 0 05 from 6 1 mg l to 3 8 mg l was observed after 2 7 h in case of a sudden absence of no3 in the batch reactors lower than 0 89 mg l bro3 was reduced from 47 μg l to 35 μg l in 2 7 h p 0 05 indicating that no3 and bro3 compete for biodegradation 3 2 1 m column experiments 3 2 1 oxic and anoxic zones the removal of bro3 no3 and so4 2 in 1 m oxic and anoxic columns retention time 22 h for 98 days are shown in fig 5 bro3 removal was slightly higher in the anoxic column 8 than in the oxic column 5 7 although the difference was not significant p 0 05 10 7 no3 was removed in the anoxic column indicating anoxic conditions were indeed reached in the oxic column no3 was not converted and passed through the column no significant so4 2 removal in both oxic and anoxic columns was observed so neither columns reached so4 2 reducing conditions 3 2 2 effect of no3 the 1 m columns were operated in two subsequent phases during phase 1 day 0 98 10 3 1 8 mg l no3 was present in the influent whereas during phase 2 day 98 209 no3 was extracted from the influent until the concentration was lower than 0 89 mg l fig 6 presents bro3 removal in the oxic and anoxic columns with long term presence and absence of no3 during phase 1 the bro3 removal in the oxic column 1 3 11 2 and anoxic column 3 9 11 7 with a 22 h retention time was not highly effective however during phase 2 the sudden absence of no3 in the influent water at day 98 resulted in sharp initial increases of bro3 reduction 82 5 in anoxic column and 13 6 in oxic column after which bro3 removal decreased to 61 4 in the anoxic column and 0 32 in the oxic column in day 98 99 5 after that the oxic column had a very limited bro3 removal of 0 3 3 lower than that in the presence of no3 whereas the bro3 removal in the anoxic column gradually decreased and finally returned to a steady 5 5 12 9 during 99 5 209 days 3 3 8 m column experiments 3 3 1 effect of infiltration retention time in order to investigate the effect of infiltration retention time during mar a series of columns 8 m total 6 days retention time was operated with mar influent water for several months fig 7 presents the continuous bro3 removal during the final 2 months for 1 3 and 8 m infiltration depth in the first 1 m corresponding to a retention time of 0 75 day no clear bro3 and no3 removal was observed after 3 m infiltration corresponding to a retention time of 2 25 days bro3 and no3 remaining concentrations were clearly lower than the influent concentrations with 20 4 bro3 and 15 8 no3 removal after 8 m of soil passage 48 2 bro3 and 30 2 no3 were removed and the final bro3 concentration reached with a retention time of 6 days was 29 6 μg l 3 3 2 effect of increased aoc due to ozonation pre treatment fig 8 presents concentrations of bro3 no3 and so4 2 along the column height of the 8 m anoxic columns in series containing acetate supplemented mar water phase 1 fig 8a and mar water phase 2 fig 8b respectively fig 8a shows that bro3 was removed by 8 59 and 98 at a depth of 1 m 3 m and 8 m respectively no3 was removed by 8 51 and 80 at a depth of 1 m 3 m and 8 m respectively consequently at the end of the 8 m column corresponding to an infiltration retention time of 6 days the bro3 concentration was as low as 1 3 μg l and the no3 concentration was 1 1 mg l no so4 2 removal was observed in this column set up with and without the increased aoc concentration as a result of ozonation pre treatment indicating no so4 2 reducing conditions were reached comparison of the no3 and bro3 removal efficiencies of the two phases consistently shows better bro3 and no3 removal over the height of the column indicating that the addition of 150 μg l c ch3coona resulted in substantially higher bro3 and no3 removals 4 discussion 4 1 role of no3 in bro3 removal as stated in the introduction it has been reported by other authors that biological bro3 reduction is a side reaction of the no3 reduction pathway butler et al 2005 korom 1992 and bro3 can be biodegraded by several other anoxic bacteria instead of denitrifying bacteria davidson et al 2011 both anoxic batch reactors and 1 m anoxic column experiments showed that bro3 removal in the presence of no3 was low and no3 biodegradation was higher indicating that bro3 biodegradation can occur in the presence of no3 bro3 removal suddenly increased due to the sudden absence of no3 indicating that bro3 and no3 in mar systems may compete for biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria prefer no3 over bro3 although the biodegradation of no3 and bro3 occur simultaneously in anoxic no3 reducing zones in fig 8 the bro3 biodegradation rate may initially appear higher than no3 biodegradation rate in 1 8 m but actually the mass of no3 reduction phase 1 2 02 mg l m in 1 8 m phase 2 0 63 mg l m in 1 8 m was much higher than the mass of bro3 biodegradation phase 1 20 59 μg l m phase 2 10 27 μg l m in 1 8 m some studies demonstrated the potential role of no3 reductase in bro3 reduction davidson et al 2011 hijnen et al 1995 it can be observed from fig 8 that both no3 and bro3 biodegradation rates in the first 1 m column passage were lower than from 1 to 3 m one potential explanation for this result is that even if the anoxic condition were achieved in the first 1 m do became lower with increasing retention time and resulted in more active no3 reductase bell et al 1990 cavigelli and robertson 2000 and correspondingly more no3 and bro3 biodegradation no3 and bro3 biodegradation rates reduced in 3 8 m soil passage than higher up in the column which can be potentially explained by aoc becoming insufficient as retention time increased and therefore lowered the level of microbial activity in the 1 m anoxic column a rapid decrease of bro3 removal was observed in 1 5 days running time 98 99 5 days following an increase due to the sudden absence of no3 subsequently a gradual decrease of bro3 biodegradation within 2 5 months phase 2 in fig 6 was observed this study is the first documentation of bro3 removal in the long term absence of no3 korner and zumft 1989 concluded that the presence of nitrogen oxides was a prerequisite to promote the synthesis and the activity of denitrification enzymes several other studies cove 1966 saleh lakha et al 2009 sun et al 2016 reported that no3 absence or limited no3 leads to a decrease of denitrification functional genes and no3 reductase activity decay or denitrification rate decrease in several hours in pure microbial species and mixed microbial strains therefore the rapid decrease of bro3 removal in the 8 m column from 82 5 to 61 4 in 1 5 days running time 98 99 5 days can potentially be explained by the limitation of no3 reductase activity of denitrifying bacteria by a no3 concentration below detection limit 0 89 mg l the gradual decrease of bro3 biodegradation fits the first order kinetic model with the first order decay constant 0 034 day fig s1 in the supplemental information the decay of heterotrophic bacteria due to a lack of substrate is a relatively slow process particularly under anoxic conditions lin 2008 showed that when no3 or glucose were limited in a moving fixed bed biofilm reactor denitrifying bacterial biomass decayed from 100 to 51 5 in 11 days with a first order kinetic coefficient of 0 061 day although the decay rate of denitrifying bacteria reported in the previous study lin 2008 is faster double than the observed bro3 removal decrease given that these experiments were performed under different conditions including higher temperatures 20 25 c vs 11 c the results of lin 2008 indicate the hypothesized relationship between denitrifying bacteria biomass and bro3 removal 4 2 ozonation as mar pre treatment figs 2 3 and 7 show that in both the batch experiments and the 8 m column experiment the addition of extra c ch3coona simulating formation of aoc during ozonation pre treatment resulted in slight but significantly higher no3 and bro3 reductions this observation is similar to the results of kirisits et al 2001 who showed that the increase of doc as an external electron donor resulted in the increase of bro3 reduction in a bac filter the addition of extra carbon stimulated microbial growth which was monitored with atp measurements biomass in the batch reactors with 1 mg l c ch3coona addition was approximately two times as high as in the reference reactors 3 3 ng ml and 1 5 ng ml respectively fig s2 this result suggests that an increase of aoc as a result of the ozonation pre treatment can promote microbial activity and therefore bro3 removal in subsequent mar systems inevitably the ozonation pre treatment not only affects the aoc concentration but also causes high concentrations of dissolved oxygen do in the mar influent water in the column studies bro3 reduction was much higher in the anoxic column than in the oxic column indicating that biological reduction of bro3 predominantly occurs in anoxic zones instead of oxic zones in mar systems this result is in agreement with previous studies hübner et al 2016 kirisits et al 2001 liu et al 2012 hijnen et al 1995 found that bro3 reduction was inhibited by oxygen controlled column studies simulating mar revealed inefficient bro3 removal under oxic conditions in the study of hübner et al 2012 this observation can be potentially explained by do being preferred over bro3 and no3 as a competing electron acceptor it is therefore recommended to design ozonation mar systems in such a way that anoxic zones develop which can generally be achieved by extending the subsurface retention time depending on site specific water quality and hydrogeological conditions oxic zones are usually found in the first several meters with a retention time of a couple of hours to days bertelkamp et al 2016 therefore the ozonation effluent with high oxygen concentrations is not likely to limit biological bro3 reduction in most mar systems 4 3 redox conditions in mar fig s3 in the supplemental information shows redox conditions in mar systems and the theoretical sequence of terminal electron acceptor processes the initial infiltration phase in mar systems are usually oxic followed first by no3 reducing and then fe mn reducing zones bertelkamp et al 2016 lekkerkerker teunissen et al 2012 maeng et al 2010 schmidt et al 2011 this study only focused on bro3 removal in oxic and no3 reducing anoxic zones in the oxic column the observed slight bro3 reduction fig 6 is an indication that minor bro3 reduction by oxic bacteria in mar systems can also take place based on the absence of no3 removal in the oxic column it can be concluded that no denitrifying bacteria or anoxic microniches were present in this column therefore bro3 reduction by denitrifying bacteria in this oxic column can be excluded in the current study the retention time in the 8 m anoxic column was 6 days 60 μg l bro3 was biodegraded to 1 3 μg l and 29 6 μg l in this long anoxic column set up with and without increased aoc respectively in practice travel times weeks months or even years for mar systems are much longer than those used in this study baumgarten et al 2011 grünheid et al 2005 stauder et al 2012 with a greater retention time of the anoxic no3 reducing zones in mar systems more bro3 than in the 8 m anoxic column with 6 days retention time may be biodegraded as the travel time is longer and thus the reaction time is also longer in addition the concentration of no3 as a competitor of bro3 reduction by denitrifying bacteria becomes lower and lower therefore bro3 biodegradation should be more efficient with greater retention time in anoxic zones especially in the zone immediately after no3 depletion i e at the interface of the anoxic denitrification zone and the fe mn oxide reduction zone additional evidence of this inference is illustrated by the study of hübner et al 2016 in which it was observed that bro3 removal in the presence of low no3 concentrations was significantly higher than in the presence of high no3 concentrations 5 conclusions this study focused on the effect of no3 and the role of increased aoc concentrations on the removal of bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems the following conclusions can be drawn bro3 and no3 compete for reduction by denitrifying bacteria but bro3 reduction and no3 reduction can occur simultaneously even if denitrifying bacteria prefer no3 to bro3 as an electron acceptor the presence of no3 is a precondition for denitrifying bacteria to reduce bro3 in no3 reducing anoxic zones of mar systems an increase of aoc as a result of ozonation pre treatment promotes microbial activity and therefore bro3 removal in subsequent mar systems in the 8 m long anoxic column retention time 6 days simulating anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems bro3 biodegraded to a concentration of 1 3 μg l indicating that bro3 biodegradation by denitrifying bacteria can happen in anoxic no3 reducing zones of mar systems mar systems following ozonation are potentially effective to biodegrade bro3

19804,strategies to control biofouling without using antimicrobial chemicals are needed to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and disruption of microbial activities in biological treatment this study developed an environmentally friendly biofouling resistant membrane by incorporating d tyrosine onto a commercial nanofiltration membrane using fau type zeolite nanoparticles that covalently bound to the membrane surface as carriers for slow release the d tyrosine loaded membrane had similar water permeability as the unmodified membrane but greatly reduced initial cell attachment and strongly inhibited subsequent biofilm formation without inactivating the bacteria the membrane slowly released d tyrosine in the time course of over 5 days and retained its anti biofouling capability in repeated 24 h efficacy tests for as long as 6 days in nanofiltration operation the d tyrosine incorporated zeolite coating completely inhibited cell adhesion on the membrane surface and significantly alleviated membrane flux decline graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling d tyrosine zeolite slow release nanofiltration 1 introduction biofouling is a critical issue in the operation and maintenance of membrane systems used for water and wastewater treatment it causes not only decline in membrane flux but also deterioration of selectivity flemming et al 1997 as a result extensive pretreatment and membrane cleaning are needed to combat membrane biofouling which contributes significantly to operational cost al ahmad et al 2000 membrane surface maintains favorable conditions for microbial growth due to the permeate drag force that facilitates cell attachment and elevated nutrient concentrations caused by concentration polarization herzberg and elimelech 2008 semiao et al 2014 current practices to prevent membrane biofouling use strong oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine in both pretreatment of the feed water and chemical cleaning to control microbial growth unfortunately in polyamide thin film composite nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the amide linkage in the membrane active layer is highly susceptible to oxidation therefore no disinfectants can be used in chemical cleaning of nf or ro membranes and residual chlorine in pretreated feed must be carefully removed prior to entering nf or ro modules adding to treatment cost mansouri et al 2010 regardless of cost pretreatment of the feed water is often ineffective because absolute sterilization of large scale treatment systems is technically unachievable and even a small number of residue microbial cells may eventually lead to biofouling flemming et al 1997 in addition the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts during oxidation disinfection treatment is of great concern especially for feed water with high organic concentrations e g reclaimed wastewater krasner et al 2006 the use of antibiotics is also limited due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria michael et al 2013 in some cases such as in membrane bioreactors bacterial inactivation is undesirable drews 2010 extensive research has been done to develop anti biofouling membranes by increasing membrane hydrophilicity or incorporating anti microbial chemicals on membrane surface kang and cao 2012 zhang et al 2013 zirehpour et al 2017 increasing attention has been drawn to biological biofouling control reagents that are benign to membrane material and the environment but also effective in biofilm inhibition or removal malaeb et al 2013 shen

variety of bacteria and have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation by both gram positive and gram negative bacteria at concentrations as low as 5 nm hochbaum et al 2011 kolodkin gal et al 2010 lam et al 2009 yu et al 2016 providing a new low cost and non germicidal approach for membrane biofouling control because they do not inhibit bacteria growth d amino acids exert low evolutionary pressure for resistance although the mechanisms involved are still unclear their potential for controlling membrane biofouling has been demonstrated in recent studies in a bench scale nf system yu et al demonstrated that d tyrosine in membrane feed water strongly inhibited biological fouling of the nf membrane at concentrations as low as 3 μm in synthetic wastewaters of different water quality yu et al 2012 in another study xu et al reported that 30 μm d tyrosine effectively prevented and removed biofilm on a nylon microfiltration membrane formed by bacteria from activated sludge xu and liu 2011c this was attributed to the reduced production of eps and interspecies quorum sensing signal ai 2 xu and liu 2011a however continuous feeding of d amino acids to the bulk feed water is very costly due to the large volume of water treated by a membrane system instead d amino acids can be supplied to membrane surface where biofouling occurs several methods have been explored to incorporate anti biofouling molecules or nanoparticles into membranes direct blending of the active reagent such as ag nanoparticles in membrane polymer often suffers from fast leaching and limited bioavailability zodrow et al 2009 polymeric slow release materials have been shown to provide more sustainable anti biofouling activity for example zodrow et al 2014 encapsulated natural antibiotics in poly d l lactide co glycolide particles bound to the ro membrane surface the membranes maintained release of kanamycin and cinnamaldehyde for 80 and 20 h respectively wu et al 2015b incorporated a quorum sensing inhibitor brominated furanone into a nafion film coated on glass slides and demonstrated reduced biofilm formation for 3 days however in these studies the anti biofouling activity cannot be regenerated once the loaded chemicals are completely released wu et al 2015a developed a regenerable anti biofouling coating using zeolite nanoparticles as carriers for ag and ag nanoparticles which allowed slow release of ag and reloading of silver upon depletion this paper reports the development of the first regenerable non biocidal anti biofouling membrane coating the regenerable nano zeolite coating was adapted for slow release of d tyrosine from the membrane surface the anti biofouling efficacy of the membrane was evaluated and related to d tyrosine release kinetics the anti biofouling performance of the membrane was also tested in a bench scale nanofiltration system and the d tyrosine consumption was compared with that when d tyrosine is added to membrane feed water 2 experimental

preparation a commercial thin film composite nanofiltration membrane nf270 dow filmtec minneapolis mn was used in all experiments the membrane was received as a dry flat sheet prior to use the membrane was cut into coupons of required sizes rinsed thoroughly and stored in ultrapure water at 4 c until use zeolite nanoparticles with or without d tyrosine loaded were tethered onto the surface of nf270 membranes via covalent binding as previously described wu et al 2015a briefly the zeolite particles were first grafted with amine functional groups by reacting 1 wt zeolite in 5 ml isopropanol with 26 mm apmdes for 24 h at ambient temperature in argon environment the amine functionalized zeolite nanoparticles were then allowed to react with the carboxyl groups on the surface of nf270 with the assist of edc and nhs the membrane surface was exposed to a solution of 4 mm edc 10 mm nhs and 0 5 m nacl at ph 5 buffered by mes for 1 h to activate the carboxyl groups then the solution was discarded and the membrane surface promptly brought in contact with an aqueous suspension containing 0 05 wt amine functionalized zeolite and 0 15 m nacl at ph 7 5 buffered by hepes for 3 h to allow amide bond formation 2 3 2 d tyrosine loading to load d tyrosine onto zeolite nanoparticles 0 03 g zeolite powder was mixed with 30 ml 2 mm d tyrosine solution purged with prepurified nitrogen for 5 min to avoid oxidation of d tyrosine sonicated at 100 w for 20 min in an ultrasonication cup horn and agitated on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 24 or 48 h the zeolite nanoparticles were then collected by centrifugation at 14 630 g for 20 min thoroughly washed by ultrapure water and dried in a vacuum oven the concentration of d tyrosine in the aqueous phase before and after adsorption was measured by uv absorbance at 275 nm to determine the d tyrosine loading the d tyrosine loaded zeolite membranes were denoted according to the loading time i e d tyr 24 h and d tyr 48 h

preformed zeolite membrane was determined the zeolite membrane was cut into 2 cm 2 cm coupons and immersed in 20 ml of a 2 mm d tyrosine solution in a petri dish for 24 h on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation at 50 rpm after loading the membrane samples denoted d tyr regen were washed with ultrapure water and dried in air 2 3 3 membrane surface characterization membrane samples were

measurements were performed at 3 to 5 locations on the surface to characterize surface morphology of membranes a gold layer of 10 nm was sputter coated on each sample and surface images were taken with an fei quanta 400 feg sem fei hillsboro or 2 4 measurement of d tyrosine release kinetics to determine the release rate and total available d tyrosine the release of d tyrosine from d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes was studied in ultrapure water and nacl solutions with concentrations ranging from 10 mm to 1 8 m to mimic the salinity in municipal wastewater and the m63 media for biofilm growth the d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes were cut into 2 cm 2 cm pieces immersed in 4 ml of test solution in 15 ml centrifuge tubes and shaken at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker for 24 h the d tyrosine concentration in the solution was measured by the bca assay pierce rockford il calibrated with standard solutions prepared using pure d tyrosine the release cycle was repeated in a fresh solution every 24 h until the d tyrosine concentration was below detection limit 0 0906 mg l 2 5 evaluation of anti biofouling performance 2 5 1 quantification of initial bacterial attachment the d tyr 24 h membranes were first tested for their effect on bacterial attachment the initial stage of biofilm formation the membrane samples were cut into 2 cm 2 cm coupons rinsed with 75 ethanol for sterilization and then thoroughly rinsed with sterilized ultrapure water the membrane coupons were then mounted on a 6 well plate and 5 ml of p aeruginosa lb suspension was added to each well to yield a cell concentration of 2 106 cfu ml the samples were then incubated at 37 c at 95 rpm for 1 h six replicates were tested in two independent experiments after incubation the membrane coupons were recovered and rinsed gently with pbs

followed by 10 s mixing on a vortex mixer fisher scientific hampton nh the suspension was collected and the cells quantified by plate counting 2 5 2 biofilm growth the membranes were prepared sterilized and mounted on 6 well plates following the same protocol as in the attachment experiment samples were inoculated to achieve an initial cell concentration of 2 105 cfu ml and incubated statically at 37 c for 24 h in a biofilm inducing media m63 supplemented with 2 glucose all membranes were tested in triplicates after incubation membrane samples were gently washed with pbs for 3 times to remove loosely attached cells each membrane coupon was cut into 4 pieces two were characterized by sem and the other two by live dead fluorescence staining for sem characterization the samples were fixed using 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight and dehydrated in a series of ethanol gradient solutions 20 40 60 80 90 95 100 100 100 for 10 min in each solution a gold layer of 10 nm was sputter coated on each sample and sem images were then taken with an fei quanta 400 feg sem fei hillsboro or for live dead fluorescence staining each sample was first stained with 50 μg ml pi for 20 min and then 10 μg ml dapi for 10 min the samples were then rinsed with pbs 3 times to remove excessive dye dead cells have damaged cell membrane and are stained by pi while dapi stains both live and dead cells the stained samples were observed with an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix71 japan 2 5 3 bench scale nanofiltration experiments the effectiveness of d tyrosine in preventing membrane biofouling during the nanofiltration process was examined with accelerated biofouling conditions as described previously in a bench scale dead end filtration system yu et al 2012 a low nutrient water containing 7 mm nacl 1 mm calcl2 and 0 1 lb and a high nutrient feed water modified synthetic wastewater herzberg et al 2009 containing 4 9 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 1 16 mm trisodium citrate 0 5 mm kh2po4 0 94 mm nh4cl and 0 1 lb were tested the nanofiltration experiment was carried out in three stages compaction conditioning and fouling using ultrapure water feed water and feed water inoculated with bacteria respectively herzberg et al 2009 during the fouling stage the feed water in the stirred cell was inoculated with 4 ml of 5 108 cfu ml freshly harvested p aeruginosa suspension to achieve initial cell concentration of 5 106 cfu ml the fouling experiment was repeated for twice with zeolite membranes and d tyr 24 h membranes in each feed water condition water permeate flux of the pristine nf the zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes was measured the fouling potential of the background feed solution was also evaluated with the unmodified nf270 membranes after each filtration experiment the fouled membrane was carefully recovered and cut into four 1 cm 1 cm pieces the membrane samples were gently rinsed with sterilized pbs to remove unbounded cells two samples were fixed and observed using sem as previously described the other two were stained with 10 μg ml dapi for 10 min and examined using fluorescence microscope 2 6 evaluation of long term anti biofouling efficacy the virgin nf270 zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes were evaluated for long term biofouling resistance twelve 1 cm 1 cm membrane coupons of each type were sterilized with 75 ethanol rinsed thoroughly with sterilized ultrapure water and mounted on 12 well plates two milliliter of bacteria suspension 2 105 cfu ml in m63 media supplemented with 2 glucose was added into each well and the samples were incubated statically at 37 c for 24 h after each 24 h incubation cycle one coupon of each membrane type was retrieved and analyzed by fluorescence imaging each coupon was washed 3 times with pbs and stained with dapi for 10 min before imaging fifteen locations from each coupon were analyzed by the cellsens software olympus japan the rest of the membrane samples were rinsed with ultrapure water to remove visible biofilm and transferred to a new 12 well plate where a fresh bacterial suspension was added for another 24 h incubation cycle nine incubation cycles were performed for each membrane type 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface characterization sem images of the membrane surface before and after zeolite coating fig 1 show successful attachment of zeolite nanoparticles on the nf270 membrane the zeolite nanoparticles were well distributed on the membrane surface with some small aggregates the nf270 was highly negatively charged over the ph range tested fig 2 a the zeolite coating notably reduced the negative charge on the membrane surface d tyrosine loading further reduced the negative surface zeta potential at ph below 5 this is consistent with the isoelectric point of d tyrosine 5 6 below which d tyrosine carries net positive charges as a result d tyrosine loading slightly increased the isoelectric point of the membrane from 2 8 to 3 4 contact angle measurements fig 2b suggest that the zeolite coating increased membrane surface hydrophilicity but the loading of d tyrosine showed no impact on the contact angle 3 2 d tyrosine loading and release the adsorption of d tyrosine on zeolite particles loaded for 24 h and 48 h was 48 85 2 25 μmol g and 132 94 4 21 μmol g respectively showing that adsorption did not reach equilibrium within 24 h these results suggest that d tyrosine adsorption in zeolite nanoparticles is diffusion limited and slow due to steric hindrance as the molecular size of d tyrosine is comparable to the pore opening of the fau type zeolite used 7 35 å krohn and tsapatsis 2006 the d tyrosine release kinetics of d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes is shown in fig 3 the d tyr 24 h membrane gradually released d tyrosine for 5 days and became below detection 0 5 μm on day 6 the d tyr 48 h membrane continuously released d tyrosine for 9 days and was depleted on day 10 the total release from the d tyr 24 h membrane into ultrapure water was 56 69 15 59 μmol m2 in 5 days table 1 while that from the d tyr 48 h membrane after 9 days was 124 5 32 97 μmol m2 therefore the longevity of the membrane may be further increased by extending adsorption time for the d tyr 48 h membrane the total amount of d tyrosine released increased to 149 47 15 90 163 52 20 81 μmol m2 in nacl solutions of different concentrations however the difference was not statistically significant according to student s t test the salt ions in the solution increased the ionic strength which led to suppression of electrostatic interactions hu et al 2013 while the changes showed little impact on desorption of d tyrosine assuming all the 0 005 g zeolite was coated on the 35 2 cm2 membrane surface 81 2 of d tyrosine on the d tyr 24 h membrane and 65 5 85 6 of d tyrosine on the d tyr 48 h membrane was released in 9 days the desorption isotherm of d tyrosine from d tyr 24 h and d tyr 48 h membranes was plotted with solid phase concentration assuming all the 0 005 g zeolite was coated on the membrane and liquid phase concentration fig s1 the d tyr 24 h membrane followed a langmuir like desorption isotherm in water while the desorption isotherm of d tyr 48 h membrane was not governed by langmuir equations the large variation in the release was potentially resulted from the restricted exposure to liquid phase due to the uneven coating and particle aggregation as observed in fig 1 future research is needed to characterize the effect of ion concentration and species on the desorption isotherm of the coated membrane 3 3 anti biofouling efficacy of d tyrosine incorporated membranes 3 3 1 effect on initial bacterial attachment the effect of zeolite coatings with or without d tyrosine on initial attachment of bacteria was studied on pristine nf270 zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes the attached cell number on each membrane 2 cm 2 cm after 1 h incubation was normalized by the inoculum cell number the zeolite membrane 0 0971 0 0048 showed similar attachment as the pristine nf270 membrane 0 0889 0 0079 while the d tyr 24 h membrane 0 0686 0 0018 reduced cell attachment by 23 3 3 2 effect on biofilm growth the impact of modified membranes on biofilm formation was studied in 24 h biofilm growth experiments on unmodified nf270 zeolite d tyr 24 h and d tyr regen membranes a thick and dense biofilm developed on the unmodified nf270 membrane after 24 h incubation and there was a large amount of eps fig 4 a the biofilm formed on the zeolite membrane was notably thinner but there was still very high coverage of the membrane surface by p aeruginosa cells fig 4b the zeolite coating increased surface hydrophilicity as well as reduced surface negative charges fig 2 which potentially resulted in the delayed biofilm formation on the contrary very few cells were found on the membranes loaded with d tyrosine either before fig 4c or after fig 4d zeolite attachment to the membrane the d tyrosine loading inhibited biofilm formation highly effectively the similar anti bifouling activity observed on membranes loaded with d tyrosine before or after zeolite attachment suggests that the co valent bonding protocol did not clog zeolite pores viability of cells attached to the membrane surface was assessed using the live dead assay fig 5 consistent with the sem results the fluorescence images showed drastic reduction of biofilm formation on the d tyr 24 h membrane fig 5a compared to either the unmodified nf270 fig 5c or the zeolite membrane fig 5b the few bacterial cells on the d tyr 24 h membrane were sparsely distributed and there was no aggregation there were notably more live bacteria on the zeolite membrane mostly in aggregates the most biofilm was found on the unmodified nf270 membrane the number of dead cells found on the different membranes was comparable these data show that the d tyrosine loaded membrane was able to prevent biofilm formation without inactivation of bacteria and the zeolite coating was not toxic to p aeruginosa 3 3 3 long term anti biofouling efficacy the long term biofilm inhibition efficacy of the d tyrosine loaded membrane was evaluated by repeating the 24 hr biofilm growth experiments using a fresh bacterial suspension for every 24 h cycle which was intended to enhance biofilm formation results are summarized in fig 6 the d tyr 24 h membrane retained its anti biofouling capability over 6 cycles of exposure during which little biomass was found on the membrane this is consistent with the d tyrosine release kinetics data fig 3a which showed non detectable d tyrosine release after 5 days due to the difference in solution chemistry the release of d tyrosine in the growth media could be more complex comparing to ultrapure water the zeolite membrane also showed slightly reduced biofilm formation than nf270 on the first day but the amount of biomass on the zeolite membrane became similar i e no statistically significant difference to the nf270 on the following days this was consistent with that observed in the 24 h biofilm growth experiment and suggested that the zeolite coating affected the initial interaction between the bacteria and the membrane surface but was only able to slightly delay biofilm development it is speculated that over time the attached bacterial cells and biopolymers produced by the bacteria changed the surface properties of the membrane by forming a conditioning layer that was not washed off by the daily cleaning with ultrapure water 3 4 effect on nanofiltration performance the effect of d tyrosine loaded membranes on water permeability and biofouling during nanofiltration operation was evaluated in a bench scale dead end filtration system fig 7 clean water flux through unmodified nf270 zeolite coated and d tyr 24 h membranes at 150 psi was comparable with less than 3 2 difference the zeolite coating and incorporation of d tyrosine showed little impact on water permeability biofouling was studied using feed waters containing high hn and low nutrient ln concentrations sufficient nutrient was supplied to both conditions to accelerate biofilm growth and flux decline during filtration when filtering the low nutrient feed water spiked with bacteria the flux of the zeolite membrane declined by 51 5 in 20 h the flux decline was completely attributed to biofouling as the bacteria free ln feed water did not cause any flux decline during the same period the d tyr 24 h membrane reduced the flux decline to 39 8 with a final flux 22 7 higher than that of the zeolite membrane higher nutrient concentrations in the feed water resulted in faster flux decline due to the higher bacterial growth rate the flux of the zeolite membrane declined by 59 2 at the end of the 20 h filtration while that of the d tyr 24 h membrane declined by 46 0 with a final flux 22 3 higher than the zeolite membrane the effect of the nutrient concentration was consistent with our previously reported research where 3 μm d tyrosine in the feed water reduced flux decline from 64 to 43 in low nutrient feed water and from 67 to 60 in high nutrient water yu et al 2012 compared with the method of dosing d tyrosine into the feed water loading d tyrosine onto the membrane greatly reduced the amount of d tyrosine consumption the total amount of d tyrosine loaded on the d tyr 24 h membranes used in the nanofiltration experiments was 0 244 μmole per membrane and only a fraction of it was released in the 20 h filtration experiments adding 3 μm d tyrosine into the feed water however would consume 6 μmole of d tyrosine for the same 20 h filtration the coating method reduced d tyrosine consumption by at least 96 interestingly examination of the membranes after the filtration experiments revealed drastic difference between the zeolite and the d tyr 24 h membranes fig 8 a light brown fouling layer was clearly visible on the zeolite membrane but not the d tyr 24 h membrane data not shown sem images show a continuous dense biofilm on the zeolite membrane fig 8a and c but very few cells on the d tyr 24 h membrane fig 8b and d the zeolite nanoparticles could be seen clearly on the d tyr 24 h membrane after the filtration experiments suggesting that the coating was robust enough to stand the hydraulic shear stress during the filtration experiment and post treatments flux decline was not completely prevented due to the accumulation of bacteria cells on the membrane surface held by the permeate drag force this was similar to the results from our previous findings where d tyrosine was added into a high nutrient feed water simulating wastewater yu et al 2012 herzberg et al showed that even the cake layer formed by dead cells caused flux decline by enhanced concentration polarization herzberg and elimelech 2007 the cake layer enhanced concentration polarization by hindering back diffusion of salt ion without bacteria only 4 flux decline was observed in the filtration with unmodified nf270 membrane in low nutrient feed water which indicated that sufficient mixing to concur concentration polarization was provided by the magnetic stirrer without cake layer d tyrosine weakened the cell cell and cell surface attachment which resulted in a thinner cake layer and fewer irreversibly attached cells on the membrane surface the fouling layer was almost completely reversible after pressure release to accelerate flux decline caused by biofouling the filtration was performed in elevated bacterial cell and nutrient concentration and dead end operation mode therefore the fact that the d tyrosine incorporated membranes completely inhibited biofilm formation suggests that it will further improve membrane flux in a real nf or ro system operated in cross flow mode 4 conclusions the incorporation of d tyrosine on a commercial polyamide nanofiltration membrane was successfully achieved by using zeolite particles as carriers the d tyrosine loaded membranes effectively inhibited initial bacterial attachment and biofilm growth as well as prevented irreversible biofouling in filtration application the surface modification with zeolite and d tyrosine showed no impact on membrane permeability compared to pristine nf270 while further study is needed to evaluate the impact of membrane selectivity the d tyr 24 h membrane inhibited biofilm formation in 6 biofilm growth cycles the zeolite coated membrane also showed biofilm inhibition effect possibly through increasing surface hydrophilicity but the effect was short lived with 24 h adsorption the d tyr 24 h membrane continuously released d tyrosine for 5 days in ultrapure water the adsorption equilibrium was not reached in 24 h with 48 h adsorption the release time increased to 10 days the presence of na facilitated d tyrosine release the slow release of d tyrosine and the long term anti biofouling efficacy of the membrane showed that d tyrosine loading on zeolite nanoparticle coated membranes is promising as a long lasting strategy for membrane biofouling control since d tyrosine can be loaded after zeolite coating the zeolite incorporated nanocomposite membrane can potentially be regenerated after depletion acknowledgements funding this work was supported by the us national science foundation awards cbet 1134427 and national natural science

19804,strategies to control biofouling without using antimicrobial chemicals are needed to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and disruption of microbial activities in biological treatment this study developed an environmentally friendly biofouling resistant membrane by incorporating d tyrosine onto a commercial nanofiltration membrane using fau type zeolite nanoparticles that covalently bound to the membrane surface as carriers for slow release the d tyrosine loaded membrane had similar water permeability as the unmodified membrane but greatly reduced initial cell attachment and strongly inhibited subsequent biofilm formation without inactivating the bacteria the membrane slowly released d tyrosine in the time course of over 5 days and retained its anti biofouling capability in repeated 24 h efficacy tests for as long as 6 days in nanofiltration operation the d tyrosine incorporated zeolite coating completely inhibited cell adhesion on the membrane surface and significantly alleviated membrane flux decline graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofouling d tyrosine zeolite slow release nanofiltration 1 introduction biofouling is a critical issue in the operation and maintenance of membrane systems used for water and wastewater treatment it causes not only decline in membrane flux but also deterioration of selectivity flemming et al 1997 as a result extensive pretreatment and membrane cleaning are needed to combat membrane biofouling which contributes significantly to operational cost al ahmad et al 2000 membrane surface maintains favorable conditions for microbial growth due to the permeate drag force that facilitates cell attachment and elevated nutrient concentrations caused by concentration polarization herzberg and elimelech 2008 semiao et al 2014 current practices to prevent membrane biofouling use strong oxidizing disinfectants such as chlorine in both pretreatment of the feed water and chemical cleaning to control microbial growth unfortunately in polyamide thin film composite nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro membranes the amide linkage in the membrane active layer is highly susceptible to oxidation therefore no disinfectants can be used in chemical cleaning of nf or ro membranes and residual chlorine in pretreated feed must be carefully removed prior to entering nf or ro modules adding to treatment cost mansouri et al 2010 regardless of cost pretreatment of the feed water is often ineffective because absolute sterilization of large scale treatment systems is technically unachievable and even a small number of residue microbial cells may eventually lead to biofouling flemming et al 1997 in addition the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts during oxidation disinfection treatment is of great concern especially for feed water with high organic concentrations e g reclaimed wastewater krasner et al 2006 the use of antibiotics is also limited due to the increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria michael et al 2013 in some cases such as in membrane bioreactors bacterial inactivation is undesirable drews 2010 extensive research has been done to develop anti biofouling membranes by increasing membrane hydrophilicity or incorporating anti microbial chemicals on membrane surface kang and cao 2012 zhang et al 2013 zirehpour et al 2017 increasing attention has been drawn to biological biofouling control reagents that are benign to membrane material and the environment but also effective in biofilm inhibition or removal malaeb et al 2013 shen et al 2014 including the use of quorum quenchers nahm et al 2017 yeon et al 2009a 2009b energy uncoupler xu and liu 2011b nitric oxide barnes et al 2013 extracellular polymeric substances eps degrading enzymes te poele and van der graaf 2005 bacteria phage goldman et al 2009 wu et al 2017 and d amino acids jiang et al 2017 xu and liu 2011c yu et al 2012 d amino acids were produced by a variety of bacteria and have been shown to inhibit biofilm formation by both gram positive and gram negative bacteria at concentrations as low as 5 nm hochbaum et al 2011 kolodkin gal et al 2010 lam et al 2009 yu et al 2016 providing a new low cost and non germicidal approach for membrane biofouling control because they do not inhibit bacteria growth d amino acids exert low evolutionary pressure for resistance although the mechanisms involved are still unclear their potential for controlling membrane biofouling has been demonstrated in recent studies in a bench scale nf system yu et al demonstrated that d tyrosine in membrane feed water strongly inhibited biological fouling of the nf membrane at concentrations as low as 3 μm in synthetic wastewaters of different water quality yu et al 2012 in another study xu et al reported that 30 μm d tyrosine effectively prevented and removed biofilm on a nylon microfiltration membrane formed by bacteria from activated sludge xu and liu 2011c this was attributed to the reduced production of eps and interspecies quorum sensing signal ai 2 xu and liu 2011a however continuous feeding of d amino acids to the bulk feed water is very costly due to the large volume of water treated by a membrane system instead d amino acids can be supplied to membrane surface where biofouling occurs several methods have been explored to incorporate anti biofouling molecules or nanoparticles into membranes direct blending of the active reagent such as ag nanoparticles in membrane polymer often suffers from fast leaching and limited bioavailability zodrow et al 2009 polymeric slow release materials have been shown to provide more sustainable anti biofouling activity for example zodrow et al 2014 encapsulated natural antibiotics in poly d l lactide co glycolide particles bound to the ro membrane surface the membranes maintained release of kanamycin and cinnamaldehyde for 80 and 20 h respectively wu et al 2015b incorporated a quorum sensing inhibitor brominated furanone into a nafion film coated on glass slides and demonstrated reduced biofilm formation for 3 days however in these studies the anti biofouling activity cannot be regenerated once the loaded chemicals are completely released wu et al 2015a developed a regenerable anti biofouling coating using zeolite nanoparticles as carriers for ag and ag nanoparticles which allowed slow release of ag and reloading of silver upon depletion this paper reports the development of the first regenerable non biocidal anti biofouling membrane coating the regenerable nano zeolite coating was adapted for slow release of d tyrosine from the membrane surface the anti biofouling efficacy of the membrane was evaluated and related to d tyrosine release kinetics the anti biofouling performance of the membrane was also tested in a bench scale nanofiltration system and the d tyrosine consumption was compared with that when d tyrosine is added to membrane feed water 2 experimental

preparation a commercial thin film composite nanofiltration membrane nf270 dow filmtec minneapolis mn was used in all experiments the membrane was received as a dry flat sheet prior to use the membrane was cut into coupons of required sizes rinsed thoroughly and stored in ultrapure water at 4 c until use zeolite nanoparticles with or without d tyrosine loaded were tethered onto the surface of nf270 membranes via covalent binding as previously described wu et al 2015a briefly the zeolite particles were first grafted with amine functional groups by reacting 1 wt zeolite in 5 ml isopropanol with 26 mm apmdes for 24 h at ambient temperature in argon environment the amine functionalized zeolite nanoparticles were then allowed to react with the carboxyl groups on the surface of nf270 with the assist of edc and nhs the membrane surface was exposed to a solution of 4 mm edc 10 mm nhs and 0 5 m nacl at ph 5 buffered by mes for 1 h to activate the carboxyl groups then the solution was discarded and the membrane surface promptly brought in contact with an aqueous suspension containing 0 05 wt amine functionalized zeolite and 0 15 m nacl at ph 7 5 buffered by hepes for 3 h to allow amide bond formation 2 3 2 d tyrosine loading to load d tyrosine onto zeolite nanoparticles 0 03 g zeolite powder was mixed with 30 ml 2 mm d tyrosine solution purged with prepurified nitrogen for 5 min to avoid oxidation of d tyrosine sonicated at 100 w for 20 min in an ultrasonication cup horn and agitated on an orbital shaker at 150 rpm for 24 or 48 h the zeolite nanoparticles were then collected by centrifugation at 14 630 g for 20 min thoroughly washed by ultrapure water and dried in a vacuum oven the concentration of d tyrosine in the aqueous phase before and after adsorption was measured by uv absorbance at 275 nm to determine the d tyrosine loading the d tyrosine loaded zeolite membranes were denoted according to the loading time i e d tyr 24 h and d tyr 48 h membranes the zeolite coated membrane without d tyrosine was denoted as zeolite membrane to assess the potential to reload d tyrosine after depletion d tyrosine adsorption loading capacity of preformed zeolite membrane was determined the zeolite membrane was cut into 2 cm 2 cm coupons and immersed in 20 ml of a 2 mm d tyrosine solution in a petri dish for 24 h on an orbital shaker with gentle agitation at 50 rpm after loading the membrane samples denoted d tyr regen were washed with ultrapure water and dried in air 2 3 3 membrane surface characterization membrane samples were characterized for surface zeta potential hydrophobicity and morphology factors known to influence bacterial attachment membrane surface zeta potential measurements were performed with an electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton paar gmbh austria using a measuring cell for solid planar surfaces adjustable gap cell for each measurement membrane samples of 2 cm 1 cm were fixed on sample holders using double sided adhesive tape the sample holders were inserted into the adjustable gap cell with the membrane surfaces facing each other the gap between the sample surfaces was set at 100 μm measurements were made in 1 mm kcl solution over a ph range of 2 5 11 adjusted using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh before each measurement the samples were thoroughly rinsed with the electrolyte solution membrane surface hydrophobicity was characterized by measuring static water contact angle in air using a ksv cam 200 optical tensiometer ksv instrument ltd helsinki finland for each sample measurements were performed at 3 to 5 locations on the surface to characterize surface morphology of membranes a gold layer of 10 nm was sputter coated on each sample and surface images were taken with an fei quanta 400 feg sem fei hillsboro or 2 4 measurement of d tyrosine release kinetics to determine the release rate and total available d tyrosine the release of d tyrosine from d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes was studied in ultrapure water and nacl solutions with concentrations ranging from 10 mm to 1 8 m to mimic the salinity in municipal wastewater and the m63 media for biofilm growth the d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes were cut into 2 cm 2 cm pieces immersed in 4 ml of test solution in 15 ml centrifuge tubes and shaken at 150 rpm on an orbital shaker for 24 h the d tyrosine concentration in the solution was measured by the bca assay pierce rockford il calibrated with standard solutions prepared using pure d tyrosine the release cycle was repeated in a fresh solution every 24 h until the d tyrosine concentration was below detection limit 0 0906 mg l 2 5 evaluation of anti biofouling performance 2 5 1 quantification of initial bacterial attachment the d tyr 24 h membranes were first tested for their effect on bacterial attachment the initial stage of biofilm formation the membrane samples were cut into 2 cm 2 cm coupons rinsed with 75 ethanol for sterilization and then thoroughly rinsed with sterilized ultrapure water the membrane coupons were then mounted on a 6 well plate and 5 ml of p aeruginosa lb suspension was added to each well to yield a cell concentration of 2 106 cfu ml the samples were then incubated at 37 c at 95 rpm for 1 h six replicates were tested in two independent experiments after incubation the membrane coupons were recovered and rinsed gently with pbs to remove loosely attached cells cells attached to the membrane were harvested by sonicating each membrane coupon in 5 ml pbs for 5 min in an ultrasonic cleaner fs60 fisher scientific hampton nh followed by 10 s mixing on a vortex mixer fisher scientific hampton nh the suspension was collected and the cells quantified by plate counting 2 5 2 biofilm growth the membranes were prepared sterilized and mounted on 6 well plates following the same protocol as in the attachment experiment samples were inoculated to achieve an initial cell concentration of 2 105 cfu ml and incubated statically at 37 c for 24 h in a biofilm inducing media m63 supplemented with 2 glucose all membranes were tested in triplicates after incubation membrane samples were gently washed with pbs for 3 times to remove loosely attached cells each membrane coupon was cut into 4 pieces two were characterized by sem and the other two by live dead fluorescence staining for sem characterization the samples were fixed using 2 5 glutaraldehyde overnight and dehydrated in a series of ethanol gradient solutions 20 40 60 80 90 95 100 100 100 for 10 min in each solution a gold layer of 10 nm was sputter coated on each sample and sem images were then taken with an fei quanta 400 feg sem fei hillsboro or for live dead fluorescence staining each sample was first stained with 50 μg ml pi for 20 min and then 10 μg ml dapi for 10 min the samples were then rinsed with pbs 3 times to remove excessive dye dead cells have damaged cell membrane and are stained by pi while dapi stains both live and dead cells the stained samples were observed with an inverted fluorescence microscope olympus ix71 japan 2 5 3 bench scale nanofiltration experiments the effectiveness of d tyrosine in preventing membrane biofouling during the nanofiltration process was examined with accelerated biofouling conditions as described previously in a bench scale dead end filtration system yu et al 2012 a low nutrient water containing 7 mm nacl 1 mm calcl2 and 0 1 lb and a high nutrient feed water modified synthetic wastewater herzberg et al 2009 containing 4 9 mm nacl 0 5 mm cacl2 1 16 mm trisodium citrate 0 5 mm kh2po4 0 94 mm nh4cl and 0 1 lb were tested the nanofiltration experiment was carried out in three stages compaction conditioning and fouling using ultrapure water feed water and feed water inoculated with bacteria respectively herzberg et al 2009 during the fouling stage the feed water in the stirred cell was inoculated with 4 ml of 5 108 cfu ml freshly harvested p aeruginosa suspension to achieve initial cell concentration of 5 106 cfu ml the fouling experiment was repeated for twice with zeolite membranes and d tyr 24 h membranes in each feed water condition water permeate flux of the pristine nf the zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes was measured the fouling potential of the background feed solution was also evaluated with the unmodified nf270 membranes after each filtration experiment the fouled membrane was carefully recovered and cut into four 1 cm 1 cm pieces the membrane samples were gently rinsed with sterilized pbs to remove unbounded cells two samples were fixed and observed using sem as previously described the other two were stained with 10 μg ml dapi for 10 min and examined using fluorescence microscope 2 6 evaluation of long term anti biofouling efficacy the virgin nf270 zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes were evaluated for long term biofouling resistance twelve 1 cm 1 cm membrane coupons of each type were sterilized with 75 ethanol rinsed thoroughly with sterilized ultrapure water and mounted on 12 well plates two milliliter of bacteria suspension 2 105 cfu ml in m63 media supplemented with 2 glucose was added into each well and the samples were incubated statically at 37 c for 24 h after each 24 h incubation cycle one coupon of each membrane type was retrieved and analyzed by fluorescence imaging each coupon was washed 3 times with pbs and stained with dapi for 10 min before imaging fifteen locations from each coupon were analyzed by the cellsens software olympus japan the rest of the membrane samples were rinsed with ultrapure water to remove visible biofilm and transferred to a new 12 well plate where a fresh bacterial suspension was added for another 24 h incubation cycle nine incubation cycles were performed for each membrane type 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane surface characterization sem images of the membrane surface before and after zeolite coating fig 1 show successful attachment of zeolite nanoparticles on the nf270 membrane the zeolite nanoparticles were well distributed on the membrane surface with some small aggregates the nf270 was highly negatively charged over the ph range tested fig 2 a the zeolite coating notably reduced the negative charge on the membrane surface d tyrosine loading further reduced the negative surface zeta potential at ph below 5 this is consistent with the isoelectric point of d tyrosine 5 6 below which d tyrosine carries net positive charges as a result d tyrosine loading slightly increased the isoelectric point of the membrane from 2 8 to 3 4 contact angle measurements fig 2b suggest that the zeolite coating increased membrane surface hydrophilicity but the loading of d tyrosine showed no impact on the contact angle 3 2 d tyrosine loading and release the adsorption of d tyrosine on zeolite particles loaded for 24 h and 48 h was 48 85 2 25 μmol g and 132 94 4 21 μmol g respectively showing that adsorption did not reach equilibrium within 24 h these results suggest that d tyrosine adsorption in zeolite nanoparticles is diffusion limited and slow due to steric hindrance as the molecular size of d tyrosine is comparable to the pore opening of the fau type zeolite used 7 35 å krohn and tsapatsis 2006 the d tyrosine release kinetics of d tyr 24 h 48 h membranes is shown in fig 3 the d tyr 24 h membrane gradually released d tyrosine for 5 days and became below detection 0 5 μm on day 6 the d tyr 48 h membrane continuously released d tyrosine for 9 days and was depleted on day 10 the total release from the d tyr 24 h membrane into ultrapure water was 56 69 15 59 μmol m2 in 5 days table 1 while that from the d tyr 48 h membrane after 9 days was 124 5 32 97 μmol m2 therefore the longevity of the membrane may be further increased by extending adsorption time for the d tyr 48 h membrane the total amount of d tyrosine released increased to 149 47 15 90 163 52 20 81 μmol m2 in nacl solutions of different concentrations however the difference was not statistically significant according to student s t test the salt ions in the solution increased the ionic strength which led to suppression of electrostatic interactions hu et al 2013 while the changes showed little impact on desorption of d tyrosine assuming all the 0 005 g zeolite was coated on the 35 2 cm2 membrane surface 81 2 of d tyrosine on the d tyr 24 h membrane and 65 5 85 6 of d tyrosine on the d tyr 48 h membrane was released in 9 days the desorption isotherm of d tyrosine from d tyr 24 h and d tyr 48 h membranes was plotted with solid phase concentration assuming all the 0 005 g zeolite was coated on the membrane and liquid phase concentration fig s1 the d tyr 24 h membrane followed a langmuir like desorption isotherm in water while the desorption isotherm of d tyr 48 h membrane was not governed by langmuir equations the large variation in the release was potentially resulted from the restricted exposure to liquid phase due to the uneven coating and particle aggregation as observed in fig 1 future research is needed to characterize the effect of ion concentration and species on the desorption isotherm of the coated membrane 3 3 anti biofouling efficacy of d tyrosine incorporated membranes 3 3 1 effect on initial bacterial attachment the effect of zeolite coatings with or without d tyrosine on initial attachment of bacteria was studied on pristine nf270 zeolite and d tyr 24 h membranes the attached cell number on each membrane 2 cm 2 cm after 1 h incubation was normalized by the inoculum cell number the zeolite membrane 0 0971 0 0048 showed similar attachment as the pristine nf270 membrane 0 0889 0 0079 while the d tyr 24 h membrane 0 0686 0 0018 reduced cell attachment by 23 3 3 2 effect on biofilm growth the impact of modified membranes on biofilm formation was studied in 24 h biofilm growth experiments on unmodified nf270 zeolite d tyr 24 h and d tyr regen membranes a thick and dense biofilm developed on the unmodified nf270 membrane after 24 h incubation and there was a large amount of eps fig 4 a the biofilm formed on the zeolite membrane was notably thinner but there was still very high coverage of the membrane surface by p aeruginosa cells fig 4b the zeolite coating increased surface hydrophilicity as well as reduced surface negative charges fig 2 which potentially resulted in the delayed biofilm formation on the contrary very few cells were found on the membranes loaded with d tyrosine either before fig 4c or after fig 4d zeolite attachment to the membrane the d tyrosine loading inhibited biofilm formation highly effectively the similar anti bifouling activity observed on membranes loaded with d tyrosine before or after zeolite attachment suggests that the co valent bonding protocol did not clog zeolite pores viability of cells attached to the membrane surface was assessed using the live dead assay fig 5 consistent with the sem results the fluorescence images showed drastic reduction of biofilm formation on the d tyr 24 h membrane fig 5a compared to either the unmodified nf270 fig 5c or the zeolite membrane fig 5b the few bacterial cells on the d tyr 24 h membrane were sparsely distributed and there was no aggregation there were notably more live bacteria on the zeolite membrane mostly in aggregates the most biofilm was found on the unmodified nf270 membrane the number of dead cells found on the different membranes was comparable these data show that the d tyrosine loaded membrane was able to prevent biofilm formation without inactivation of bacteria and the zeolite coating was not toxic to p aeruginosa 3 3 3 long term anti biofouling efficacy the long term biofilm inhibition efficacy of the d tyrosine loaded membrane was evaluated by repeating the 24 hr biofilm growth experiments using a fresh bacterial suspension for every 24 h cycle which was intended to enhance biofilm formation results are summarized in fig 6 the d tyr 24 h membrane retained its anti biofouling capability over 6 cycles of exposure during which little biomass was found on the membrane this is consistent with the d tyrosine release kinetics data fig 3a which showed non detectable d tyrosine release after 5 days due to the difference in solution chemistry the release of d tyrosine in the growth media could be more complex comparing to ultrapure water the zeolite membrane also showed slightly reduced biofilm formation than nf270 on the first day but the amount of biomass on the zeolite membrane became similar i e no statistically significant difference to the nf270 on the following days this was consistent with that observed in the 24 h biofilm growth experiment and suggested that the zeolite coating affected the initial interaction between the bacteria and the membrane surface but was only able to slightly delay biofilm development it is speculated that over time the attached bacterial cells and biopolymers produced by the bacteria changed the surface properties of the membrane by forming a conditioning layer that was not washed off by the daily cleaning with ultrapure water 3 4 effect on nanofiltration performance the effect of d tyrosine loaded membranes on water permeability and biofouling during nanofiltration operation was evaluated in a bench scale dead end filtration system fig 7 clean water flux through unmodified nf270 zeolite coated and d tyr 24 h membranes at 150 psi was comparable with less than 3 2 difference the zeolite coating and incorporation of d tyrosine showed little impact on water permeability biofouling was studied using feed waters containing high hn and low nutrient ln concentrations sufficient nutrient was supplied to both conditions to accelerate biofilm growth and flux decline during filtration when filtering the low nutrient feed water spiked with bacteria the flux of the zeolite membrane declined by 51 5 in 20 h the flux decline was completely attributed to biofouling as the bacteria free ln feed water did not cause any flux decline during the same period the d tyr 24 h membrane reduced the flux decline to 39 8 with a final flux 22 7 higher than that of the zeolite membrane higher nutrient concentrations in the feed water resulted in faster flux decline due to the higher bacterial growth rate the flux of the zeolite membrane declined by 59 2 at the end of the 20 h filtration while that of the d tyr 24 h membrane declined by 46 0 with a final flux 22 3 higher than the zeolite membrane the effect of the nutrient concentration was consistent with our previously reported research where 3 μm d tyrosine in the feed water reduced flux decline from 64 to 43 in low nutrient feed water and from 67 to 60 in high nutrient water yu et al 2012 compared with the method of dosing d tyrosine into the feed water loading d tyrosine onto the membrane greatly reduced the amount of d tyrosine consumption the total amount of d tyrosine loaded on the d tyr 24 h membranes used in the nanofiltration experiments was 0 244 μmole per membrane and only a fraction of it was released in the 20 h filtration experiments adding 3 μm d tyrosine into the feed water however would consume 6 μmole of d tyrosine for the same 20 h filtration the coating method reduced d tyrosine consumption by at least 96 interestingly examination of the membranes after the filtration experiments revealed drastic difference between the zeolite and the d tyr 24 h membranes fig 8 a light brown fouling layer was clearly visible on the zeolite membrane but not the d tyr 24 h membrane data not shown sem images show a continuous dense biofilm on the zeolite membrane fig 8a and c but very few cells on the d tyr 24 h membrane fig 8b and d the zeolite nanoparticles could be seen clearly on the d tyr 24 h membrane after the filtration experiments suggesting that the coating was robust enough to stand the hydraulic shear stress during the filtration experiment and post treatments flux decline was not completely prevented due to the accumulation of bacteria cells on the membrane surface held by the permeate drag force this was similar to the results from our previous findings where d tyrosine was added into a high nutrient feed water simulating wastewater yu et al 2012 herzberg et al showed that even the cake layer formed by dead cells caused flux decline by enhanced concentration polarization herzberg and elimelech 2007 the cake layer enhanced concentration polarization by hindering back diffusion of salt ion without bacteria only 4 flux decline was observed in the filtration with unmodified nf270 membrane in low nutrient feed water which indicated that sufficient mixing to concur concentration polarization was provided by the magnetic stirrer without cake layer d tyrosine weakened the cell cell and cell surface attachment which resulted in a thinner cake layer and fewer irreversibly attached cells on the membrane surface the fouling layer was almost completely reversible after pressure release to accelerate flux decline caused by biofouling the filtration was performed in elevated bacterial cell and nutrient concentration and dead end operation mode therefore the fact that the d tyrosine incorporated membranes completely inhibited biofilm formation suggests that it will further improve membrane flux in a real nf or ro system operated in cross flow mode 4 conclusions the incorporation of d tyrosine on a commercial polyamide nanofiltration membrane was successfully achieved by using zeolite particles as carriers the d tyrosine loaded membranes effectively inhibited initial bacterial attachment and biofilm growth as well as prevented irreversible biofouling in filtration application the surface modification with zeolite and d tyrosine showed no impact on membrane permeability compared to pristine nf270 while further study is needed to evaluate the impact of membrane selectivity the d tyr 24 h membrane inhibited biofilm formation in 6 biofilm growth cycles the zeolite coated membrane also showed biofilm inhibition effect possibly through increasing surface hydrophilicity but the effect was short lived with 24 h adsorption the d tyr 24 h membrane continuously released d tyrosine for 5 days in ultrapure water the adsorption equilibrium was not reached in 24 h with 48 h adsorption the release time increased to 10 days the presence of na facilitated d tyrosine release the slow release of d tyrosine and the long term anti biofouling efficacy of the membrane showed that d tyrosine loading on zeolite nanoparticle coated membranes is promising as a long lasting strategy for membrane biofouling control since d tyrosine can be loaded after zeolite coating the zeolite incorporated nanocomposite membrane can potentially be regenerated after depletion acknowledgements funding this work was supported by the us national science foundation awards cbet 1134427 and national natural science
