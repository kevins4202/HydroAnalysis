3885,the soil water retention curve represents the relationship between soil water content θ and matric potential ψ the van genuchten vg model is commonly used to characterize the shape of a θ ψ curve based on the similarities between θ ψ curves and soil thermal conductivity λ versus θ curves lu and dong proposed a unified conceptual λ θ model ld model for estimating λ θ curves from θ ψ curves their work makes it possible to relate the shapes of λ θ curves to θ ψ curves in this study we present an empirical approach to estimate the vg model parameter m from the ld model shape parameter p based on a model calibration with θ ψ and λ θ datasets obtained from 10 soils the saturated water content θs and the vg model parameter α are estimated from selected soil properties i e bulk density particle density particle size distribution and organic carbon content and the residual water content θr is estimated from the ld model parameter θf for model evaluation the θ ψ curves of six soils were estimated from measured λ θ values and selected soil properties and were compared to direct θ ψ measurements the proposed method performed well with root mean square errors of estimated θ values ranging from 0 015 to 0 052 cm3 cm 3 and bias ranging from 0 009 to 0 040 cm3 cm 3 we conclude that the proposed method accurately estimates θ ψ curves from λ θ curves and selected soil properties

applying these relationships is uncertain and requires careful validation for regions or conditions beyond those under which they were originally developed generally there are four regimes i e hydration pendular funicular and capillary defining the θ ψ curve along the path of increasing water content which are dominated by two distinct principal forces adsorption and capillarity tuller et al 1999 kim et al 2015 the hydration regime refers to conditions where water molecules are adsorbed to mineral complexes by van der waals attraction cations and anions or hydrogen bonds of water lu and likos 2004 the pendular regime begins once discrete menisci are formed and individual water bridges are built near particle contacts mitarai and nori 2006 in the funicular regime water bridges around the particles and water filled pores coexist the capillary regime starts when the air phase occludes bubbles and the pore water instead of air occupies most of the voids as θ increases the energy level of pore water increases from hydration through the capillary regime and each of the regimes modify soil thermal conductivity λ differently tarnawski and gori 2002 divided the thermal conductivity water content curve λ θ into four zones representing residual transitory meniscus micro macro pore capillary and superfluous water the range and boundary of each regime depends on the soil and liquid type and micro structures i e particle geometry particle pore size distribution pore water arrangement and interfacial properties which can be identified as the key governing factors for λ θ lipiec et al 2007 côté and konrad 2009 interestingly these factors can also be used to determine θ ψ curves based on the correlation between λ θ curves and θ ψ curves mccumber and pielke 1981 established an exponential equation to relate ψ and λ and reece 1996 developed a λ ψ relationship used to estimate ψ with a line heat dissipation sensor lu et al 2019 presented a generalized λ ψ model for a selected ψ range ψ 1000 cm and he et al 2020 presented an improved λ ψ model covering the entire ψ range recently likos 2014 estimated λ θ from bimodal water retention curves using measurements of θ ψ curves for coarse textured soils considering the similarities between the sigmoidal shapes of the θ ψ curve and the λ θ curve lu and dong 2015 proposed a closed form λ θ model like the van genuchten 1980 θ ψ model the model was fitted to λ θ measurements to determine model parameters this work suggested that it might be possible to estimate θ ψ curves from λ θ curves such an approach has some advantages in that λ can be more easily measured than ψ over a range of conditions particularly in the field ochsner and baker 2008 the objective of this study is to develop a new approach to estimate van genuchten 1980 θ ψ parameters from measured λ θ values and other easily measured soil properties a new model is established based on measurements from 10 soils of varying texture and is evaluated with data representing another six soils 2 model development 2 1 the lu and dong model numerous empirical parametric models have been proposed to describe the θ ψ curves among them the van

can be indirectly estimated from soil properties using empirical equations for λsat the following geometric mean equation has been widely used johansen 1975 3 λ sat λ q q λ o 1 q 1 ϕ λ w ϕ where q is the quartz content λq λo and λw are the thermal conductivities of quartz 7 7 w m 1 k 1 other minerals 2 0 w m 1 k 1 for soils with q greater than 0 2 and 3 0 w m 1 k 1 for soils with q 0 2 and water 0 594 w m 1 k 1 at 20 c respectively in this study we followed the assumption of lu et al 2007 that the quartz content q was equal to the sand content the parameter λdry can be estimated from an empirical linear relationship between λdry and ϕ lu et al 2007 4 λ dry 0 56 ϕ 0 51 lu et al 2007 reported that eqs 3 and 4 provided reliable estimates of λsat and λdry when information about soil texture and porosity is not available λsat and λdry are directly determined by fitting eq 2 to the available soil thermal conductivity versus water content λ θ data 2 2 estimating θ ψ curves from λ θ data the four parameters θs θr α and m in the van genuchten 1980 model can be determined by fitting eq 1 to θ versus ψ measurements in this paper we use the following approach to estimate these parameters from soil properties organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture and λ θ measurements commonly θs is assumed to be equal to the soil porosity ϕ 5 θ s ϕ there may exist an intrinsic relationship between a soil s θ ψ and the λ θ curves such that a quantitative relationship between θf and θr is inherent lu and dong 2015 proposed the following empirical

converted the organic matter contents to f oc values with a factor of 0 58 as soil organic matter contains approximately 58 carbon howard and howard 1990 considering the similarities between the shapes of θ ψ curves and λ θ curves an empirical relationship between the vg model shape parameter m and the ld model shape parameter p was developed details are shown in section 4 3 2 3 statistical analysis in this study we compared θ ψ data estimated from λ θ curves to directly measured θ ψ data the estimated θ values at selected ψ values were evaluated using root mean square error rmse and bias 8 rmse θ estimated θ measured 2 n 9 bias θ estimated θ measured n where n was the number of data pairs and θestimated and θmeasured were the estimated and measured water content values respectively 3 materials and methods in this study 16 soils were divided into calibration and validation groups based on two criteria 1 the calibration group represented a variety of soil textures which was a major factor controlling the θ ψ curves and λ θ curves 2 the soils used in the validation group had available θ ψ and λ θ datasets and known soil properties organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture because they were necessary for verification of the proposed approach thus the θ ψ and λ θ datasets for 10 soils soils 1 10 representing a range of texture were used to calibrate and another six soils soils 11 16 were used to verify the proposed approach for soils 1 5 since their θ ψ and λ θ data were not available we used the fitting parameters from table 1 and fig 6a of lu and dong 2015 tables 1 and 2 present the basic soil physical properties and the sources of the 16 soils for soils 1 2 smits et al 2010 likos 2014 an instrumented hanging column apparatus adapted from smits et al 2010 was used to make concurrent measurements of the θ ψ and λ θ curves the θ values and corresponding λ values were measured with a soil water content sensor ech2o ec 5 decagon devices pullman wa and a thermal property analyzer sh 1 kd 2 pro decagon devices pullman wa respectively the ψ values were measured with a tensiometer connected to a differential pressure transducer model p55d validyne engineering corporation northridge ca the water content thermal conductivity and ψ sensors were installed in soil samples at the same horizontal plane so that ψ λ and θ measurements could be made at selected matric potential and water content conditions transient water desorption and water imbibition methods tdim which have been used to obtain θ ψ curves for various types of soils wayllace and lu 2012 were used to determine the θ ψ curves of soils 3 5 dong et al 2015 lu and dong 2015 thermal sensors sh 1 kd 2 pro decagon devices pullman wa were incorporated into the tdim to facilitate concurrent measurements of both θ ψ and λ θ curves of soils 3 5 for soils 6 8 the θ values at ψ of 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 cm were determined with a tension table 08 01 sandbox eijkelkamp zeitz germany thermo time domain reflectometry thermo tdr sensors were inserted vertically into the samples from the top to determine λ and θ details on thermo tdr sensors were reported by lu et al 2017 and methods for determining λ and θ values from thermo tdr sensor measurements were reported by ren et al 1999 the pressure plate extractor method was used to measure θ values at additional ψ values of 50 100 500 1000 and 1500 kpa and an additional measurement at 30 kpa was also included for soil 10 to obtain λ and θ data corresponding to these conditions a set of soil columns was prepared at θ values corresponding to selected ψ values based on the measured θ ψ data thermo tdr sensors were used to measure λ and θ of each repacked soil column soils 9 16 one from iowa soil 10 and the others from china were collected from the surface and subsurface layers respectively lu et al 2008 the soil samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm screen and then packed as soil columns 50 mm inner diameter and 10 mm high at desired bulk density ρb values the pressure plate extractor method dane and hopmans 2002 was used to measure θ ψ curves for the ψ range 1500 kpa thermo tdr sensors were used to measure the λ and θ values for soils 9 16 4 results and discussion 4 1 similarities between θ ψ curves and λ θ curves the measured θ ψ curves and λ θ curves for soils 6 10 are presented in fig 1 where the θ ψ curves are expressed as s e versus log ψ the common log of absolute ψ values in cm and λ θ curves are plotted as the normalized λ data k e against θ the λ θ curves for these soils are generally sigmoidal in shape which is in line with the reports of lu and dong 2015 in the residual water domain corresponding to large ψ values for θ θr soil water exists as thin films adsorbed to the soil particle surfaces tarnawski and leong 2000 revil and lu 2013 the film thickness is so thin that heat conduction at this stage occurs mainly through the solid mineral phase and λ is relatively constant over the range of these small θ values this trait flat segment of the λ θ curve is smaller in coarse textured soils soils 6 and 9 the larger the clay content of a soil the more pronounced is the flat tail of the λ θ curve at small θ values as ψ decreases or θ increases between θr and θf water menisci form near the particle contacts the surfaces of soil particles are coated gradually and water bridges are formed between solid particles ewing and horton 2007 this significantly expands the heat transfer paths through the water bridges connecting particles and results in a rapidly increasing trend in λ with θ at the inflection point θf the menisci are fully interconnected to each other the θf value is related to clay content fine textured soils e g soils 7 8 and 10 have larger θf values than coarse textured soils e g soils 6 and 9 as θ becomes larger than θf ψ continues to decrease and the retained water enters the funicular regime where water bridges grow and begin to merge with adjacent ones to form a thick connected water film around the soil particles this results in further enhancement of λ but the rate of change in λ with respect to θ gradually decreases eventually ψ becomes small as θ is close to saturation and λ approaches its maximum value λsat within this portion of the water retention regime little change is observed in the λ values because further replacement of air with water does not have a large impact on the conductive heat transfer pathway 4 2 performance of the ld model we first used eqs 3 and 4 to estimate the λsat and λdry respectively then eq 2 was fitted to measured data from soils 6 10 in order to determine p values for a range of soil textures with available λ θ and θ ψ datasets as evident in fig 1 the fitted curves of the ld model capture the flat tail of the λ θ curve and the drastic onset of the pendular regime as indicated by the rapid λ increases with θ increases the slopes of the regression curves and the coefficients of determination r2 for all soils were greater than 0 96 indicating that the ld model fitted the measured values well table 3 error analysis showed that the rmse was within 0 023 0 203 w m 1 k 1 with an average of 0 038 w m 1 k 1 and the bias ranged from 0 065 to 0 021 w m 1 k 1 with a mean of 0 005 w m 1 k 1 additionally experimental results in lu and dong 2015 showed that for soil 1 5 compared to the measured data the fitted results by ld model had an average r2 of 0 96 and an average rmse of 0 133 w m 1 k 1 thus the ld model provided reasonable fits to the measured values the pore fluid conductivity parameter p ranged from 0 41 to 0 69 on soils 1 10 table 4 lu and dong 2015 obtained a similar range 0 41 to 0 79 for 27 soils that covered a wide range of textures this was no coincidence because p reflected the rate of change in λ with θ the influence of parameter p on the shape of the λ θ curve is illustrated in fig 2 where λdry λsat and θf are set at 0 3 w m 1 k 1 2 0 w m 1 k 1 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 respectively and p ranges from 0 3 to 0 9 with increasing p values the sensitivity of λ to the change in θ increased at large θ values and the λ θ curves had more pronounced flat tails at low θ values however the larger the soil clay content the more pronounced the flat tail of the λ θ curve at small θ values and the more gradual the λ response to θ increases most soils had moderate p values 0 4 p 0 8 rather than extreme values 4 3 estimating θ ψ curves from λ θ measurements by fitting eq 1 to θ ψ measurements and fitting eqs 2 4 to measured thermal conductivity data we obtained the vg model parameters θs θr α m and the ld model parameters λsat λdry θf p of soils 6 10 all of the parameters for soils 1 5 are from table 1 and fig 6a of lu and dong 2015 we further examined the paired m and p values of the 10 soils that represented a wide range of soil texture e g clay content ranging from 0 to 100 and bulk density ranging from 1 05 to 1 77 g cm 3 fig 3 shows the m values of the 10 soils soils 1 10 as a function of p because m decreased nonlinearly with increasing p a power function equation was used to describe the relationship the following empirical relationship between m and p was developed for 0 4 p 0 7 10 m 0 056 p 3 099 thus an empirical method to estimate θ ψ curves from measured λ θ data and other soil property values i e soil bulk density texture particle density and organic carbon content is established and it is hereafter denoted as the thermal conductivity water retention tcwr approach eqs 5 6 7 and 10 here we briefly explain the three key steps of the tcwr approach step 1 λsat λdry θs and α are estimated from soil organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture using eqs 3 5 and 7 step 2 fit eq 2 to measured λ θ values while using the estimated λsat and λdry values from step 1 to determine the remaining ld model fitting parameters θf and p step 3 estimate the θr value from eq 6 and calculate the m values from eq 10 4 4 validation of the tcwr approach we evaluated the performance of the new tcwr approach with measurements from soils 11 16 as shown in fig 4 most of the estimated θ ψ curves for the tcwr method followed the patterns of the measured θ ψ curves which indicated that the tcwr method accurately estimated the θ ψ curves an exception was observed for soil 16 the θ ψ curve estimated with the tcwr approach was flatter and gave larger θ estimates for the larger ψ values these deviations implied an underestimation of parameter m with eq 10 because the slope dθ d ψ of the θ ψ curve was determined mainly by parameter m van genuchten et al 1980 despite the errors with soil 16 the tcwr approach generally provided reliable θ ψ estimates on the other five soils fig 5 presents the θ values estimated with the tcwr model at the selected ψ values versus the measured θ data in general the estimated θ values compared well to the measured θ values for all of the soils the coefficients of determination r2 were greater than 0 97 which indicated that the tcwr approach provided reliable estimates the rmse and bias of the estimated values ranged from 0 015 to 0 052 cm3 cm 3 and from 0 009 to 0 040 cm3 cm 3 and the average rmse and bias of estimated values were 0 026 cm3 m 3 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 respectively table 5 thus the tcwr approach provided accurate θ ψ estimates 4 5 further applications the tcwr approach requires measured λ θ data and four soil property values i e organic carbon content bulk density particle density and texture as inputs for a specific soil soil particle density and texture are relatively constant in time and organic carbon content changes slowly thus it can be assumed as constant in the short term and all are generally available from soil survey thus only the dynamic information for λ θ and ρ b are required to estimate dynamic θ ψ curves previous studies have shown that by using the thermo tdr technique it is possible to measure spatial and temporal variations of λ θ and ρ b liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2018 fu et al 2019 2020 2021a thus the tcwr approach has the potential to estimate dynamic θ ψ curves with time and depth under field conditions electrical conductivity σ depends on the same soil properties e g θ ρb and particle size distribution as λ does abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 friedman 2005 based on the similarity between electrical current and water flow fu et al 2021b presented a model to estimate a θ ψ curve from bulk electrical conductivity σ water content measurements although σ data are more readily available than λ measurements because of the widespread use of tdr sensors for monitoring θ and σ the new tcwr approach developed in this study has some advantages first λ has less temperature dependence than does σ at ambient soil temperatures nouveau et al 2016 this is especially crucial in field conditions where soil temperature shows obvious spatial and temporal variations second both models require inputs λ or σ at dry and saturated conditions as mentioned above both λsat and λdry are functions of ρb which can be estimated indirectly in contrast no universal equation is available to estimate indirectly the σ values at dry and saturated conditions which limits certain field applications of the electrical conductivity based approach 5 conclusion a tcwr approach was developed to estimate the parameters of the van genuchten θ ψ model from λ θ measurements and soil properties organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture the new approach was calibrated with data collected on 10 soils representing a wide range of textures and was evaluated with θ ψ data from six additional soils overall the tcwr method performed well the new method has a potential to estimate dynamic field θ ψ curves continuously from dynamic λ θ measurements credit authorship contribution

table 1 and fig 6a of lu and dong 2015 tables 1 and 2 present the basic soil physical properties and the sources of the 16 soils for soils 1 2 smits et al 2010 likos 2014 an instrumented hanging column apparatus adapted from smits et al 2010 was used to make concurrent measurements of the θ ψ and λ θ curves the θ values and corresponding λ values were measured with a soil water content sensor ech2o ec 5 decagon devices pullman wa and a thermal property analyzer sh 1 kd 2 pro decagon devices pullman wa respectively the ψ values were measured with a tensiometer connected to a differential pressure transducer model p55d validyne engineering corporation northridge ca the water content thermal conductivity and ψ sensors were installed in soil samples at the same horizontal plane so that ψ λ and θ measurements could be made at selected matric potential and water content conditions transient water desorption and water imbibition methods tdim which have been used to obtain θ ψ curves for various types of soils wayllace and lu 2012 were used to determine the θ ψ curves of soils 3 5 dong et al 2015 lu and dong 2015 thermal sensors sh 1 kd 2 pro decagon devices pullman wa were incorporated into the tdim to facilitate concurrent measurements of both θ ψ and λ θ curves of soils 3 5 for soils 6 8 the θ values at ψ of 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 80 and 100 cm were determined with a tension table 08 01 sandbox eijkelkamp zeitz germany thermo time domain reflectometry thermo tdr sensors were inserted vertically into the samples from the top to determine λ and θ details on thermo tdr sensors were reported by lu et al 2017 and methods for determining λ and θ values from thermo tdr sensor measurements were reported by ren et al 1999 the pressure plate extractor method was used to measure θ values at additional ψ values of 50 100 500 1000 and 1500 kpa and an additional measurement at 30 kpa was also included for soil 10 to obtain λ and θ data corresponding to these conditions a set of soil columns was prepared at θ values corresponding to selected ψ values based on the measured θ ψ data thermo tdr sensors were used to measure λ and θ of each repacked soil column soils 9 16 one from iowa soil 10 and the others from china were collected from the surface and subsurface layers respectively lu et al 2008 the soil samples were air dried ground and sieved through a 2 mm screen and then packed as soil columns 50 mm inner diameter and 10 mm high at desired bulk density ρb values the pressure plate extractor method dane and hopmans 2002 was used to measure θ ψ curves for the ψ range 1500 kpa thermo tdr sensors were used to measure the λ and θ values for soils 9 16 4 results and discussion 4 1 similarities between θ ψ curves and λ θ curves the measured θ ψ curves and λ θ curves for soils 6 10 are presented in fig 1 where the θ ψ curves are expressed as s e versus log ψ the common log of absolute ψ values in cm and λ θ curves are plotted as the normalized λ data k e against θ the λ θ curves for these soils are generally sigmoidal in shape which is in line with the reports of lu and dong 2015 in the residual water domain corresponding to large ψ values for θ θr soil water exists as thin films adsorbed to the soil particle surfaces tarnawski and leong 2000 revil and lu 2013 the film thickness is so thin that heat conduction at this stage occurs mainly through the solid mineral phase and λ is relatively constant over the range of these small θ values this trait flat segment of the λ θ curve is smaller in coarse textured soils soils 6 and 9 the larger the clay content of a soil the more pronounced is the flat tail of the λ θ curve at small θ values as ψ decreases or θ increases between θr and θf water menisci form near the particle contacts the surfaces of soil particles are coated gradually and water bridges are formed between solid particles ewing and horton 2007 this significantly expands the heat transfer paths through the water bridges connecting particles and results in a rapidly increasing trend in λ with θ at the inflection point θf the menisci are fully interconnected to each other the θf value is related to clay content fine textured soils e g soils 7 8 and 10 have larger θf values than coarse textured soils e g soils 6 and 9 as θ becomes larger than θf ψ continues to decrease and the retained water enters the funicular regime where water bridges grow and begin to merge with adjacent ones to form a thick connected water film around the soil particles this results in further enhancement of λ but the rate of change in λ with respect to θ gradually decreases eventually ψ becomes small as θ is close to saturation and λ approaches its maximum value λsat within this portion of the water retention regime little change is observed in the λ values because further replacement of air with water does not have a large impact on the conductive heat transfer pathway 4 2 performance of the ld model we first used eqs 3 and 4 to estimate the λsat and λdry respectively then eq 2 was fitted to measured data from soils 6 10 in order to determine p values for a range of soil textures with available λ θ and θ ψ datasets as evident in fig 1 the fitted curves of the ld model capture the flat tail of the λ θ curve and the drastic onset of the pendular regime as indicated by the rapid λ increases with θ increases the slopes of the regression curves and the coefficients of determination r2 for all soils were greater than 0 96 indicating that the ld model fitted the measured values well table 3 error analysis showed that the rmse was within 0 023 0 203 w m 1 k 1 with an average of 0 038 w m 1 k 1 and the bias ranged from 0 065 to 0 021 w m 1 k 1 with a mean of 0 005 w m 1 k 1 additionally experimental results in lu and dong 2015 showed that for soil 1 5 compared to the measured data the fitted results by ld model had an average r2 of 0 96 and an average rmse of 0 133 w m 1 k 1 thus the ld model provided reasonable fits to the measured values the pore fluid conductivity parameter p ranged from 0 41 to 0 69 on soils 1 10 table 4 lu and dong 2015 obtained a similar range 0 41 to 0 79 for 27 soils that covered a wide range of textures this was no coincidence because p reflected the rate of change in λ with θ the influence of parameter p on the shape of the λ θ curve is illustrated in fig 2 where λdry λsat and θf are set at 0 3 w m 1 k 1 2 0 w m 1 k 1 and 0 05 cm3 cm 3 respectively and p ranges from 0 3 to 0 9 with increasing p values the sensitivity of λ to the change in θ increased at large θ values and the λ θ curves had more pronounced flat tails at low θ values however the larger the soil clay content the more pronounced the flat tail of the λ θ curve at small θ values and the more gradual the λ response to θ increases most soils had moderate p values 0 4 p 0 8 rather than extreme values 4 3 estimating θ ψ curves from λ θ measurements by fitting eq 1 to θ ψ measurements and fitting eqs 2 4 to measured thermal conductivity data we obtained the vg model parameters θs θr α m and the ld model parameters λsat λdry θf p of soils 6 10 all of the parameters for soils 1 5 are from table 1 and fig 6a of lu and dong 2015 we further examined the paired m and p values of the 10 soils that represented a wide range of soil texture e g clay content ranging from 0 to 100 and bulk density ranging from 1 05 to 1 77 g cm 3 fig 3 shows the m values of the 10 soils soils 1 10 as a function of p because m decreased nonlinearly with increasing p a power function equation was used to describe the relationship the following empirical relationship between m and p was developed for 0 4 p 0 7 10 m 0 056 p 3 099 thus an empirical method to estimate θ ψ curves from measured λ θ data and other soil property values i e soil bulk density texture particle density and organic carbon content is established and it is hereafter denoted as the thermal conductivity water retention tcwr approach eqs 5 6 7 and 10 here we briefly explain the three key steps of the tcwr approach step 1 λsat λdry θs and α are estimated from soil organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture using eqs 3 5 and 7 step 2 fit eq 2 to measured λ θ values while using the estimated λsat and λdry values from step 1 to determine the remaining ld model fitting parameters θf and p step 3 estimate the θr value from eq 6 and calculate the m values from eq 10 4 4 validation of the tcwr approach we evaluated the performance of the new tcwr approach with measurements from soils 11 16 as shown in fig 4 most of the estimated θ ψ curves for the tcwr method followed the patterns of the measured θ ψ curves which indicated that the tcwr method accurately estimated the θ ψ curves an exception was observed for soil 16 the θ ψ curve estimated with the tcwr approach was flatter and gave larger θ estimates for the larger ψ values these deviations implied an underestimation of parameter m with eq 10 because the slope dθ d ψ of the θ ψ curve was determined mainly by parameter m van genuchten et al 1980 despite the errors with soil 16 the tcwr approach generally provided reliable θ ψ estimates on the other five soils fig 5 presents the θ values estimated with the tcwr model at the selected ψ values versus the measured θ data in general the estimated θ values compared well to the measured θ values for all of the soils the coefficients of determination r2 were greater than 0 97 which indicated that the tcwr approach provided reliable estimates the rmse and bias of the estimated values ranged from 0 015 to 0 052 cm3 cm 3 and from 0 009 to 0 040 cm3 cm 3 and the average rmse and bias of estimated values were 0 026 cm3 m 3 and 0 012 cm3 cm 3 respectively table 5 thus the tcwr approach provided accurate θ ψ estimates 4 5 further applications the tcwr approach requires measured λ θ data and four soil property values i e organic carbon content bulk density particle density and texture as inputs for a specific soil soil particle density and texture are relatively constant in time and organic carbon content changes slowly thus it can be assumed as constant in the short term and all are generally available from soil survey thus only the dynamic information for λ θ and ρ b are required to estimate dynamic θ ψ curves previous studies have shown that by using the thermo tdr technique it is possible to measure spatial and temporal variations of λ θ and ρ b liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 tian et al 2018 fu et al 2019 2020 2021a thus the tcwr approach has the potential to estimate dynamic θ ψ curves with time and depth under field conditions electrical conductivity σ depends on the same soil properties e g θ ρb and particle size distribution as λ does abu hamdeh and reeder 2000 friedman 2005 based on the similarity between electrical current and water flow fu et al 2021b presented a model to estimate a θ ψ curve from bulk electrical conductivity σ water content measurements although σ data are more readily available than λ measurements because of the widespread use of tdr sensors for monitoring θ and σ the new tcwr approach developed in this study has some advantages first λ has less temperature dependence than does σ at ambient soil temperatures nouveau et al 2016 this is especially crucial in field conditions where soil temperature shows obvious spatial and temporal variations second both models require inputs λ or σ at dry and saturated conditions as mentioned above both λsat and λdry are functions of ρb which can be estimated indirectly in contrast no universal equation is available to estimate indirectly the σ values at dry and saturated conditions which limits certain field applications of the electrical conductivity based approach 5 conclusion a tcwr approach was developed to estimate the parameters of the van genuchten θ ψ model from λ θ measurements and soil properties organic carbon content bulk density particle density and soil texture the new approach was calibrated with data collected on 10 soils representing a wide range of textures and was evaluated with θ ψ data from six additional soils overall the tcwr method performed well the new method has a potential to estimate dynamic field θ ψ curves continuously from dynamic λ θ measurements credit authorship contribution

3886,pfas are emerging contaminants widespread in the environment as surfactants pfas tend to accumulate at solid water and air water interfaces in the vadose zone which may pose long term threats to groundwater the primary factors that control the long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone remain poorly understood to address this knowledge gap we first use multiple datasets from transport experiments to validate a state of the art mathematical model that incorporates transient variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow and rate limited and nonlinear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption we then employ the validated model to simulate and analyze the primary processes and parameters controlling the retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone at a model fire training area site our simulations show that adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces leads to strong retention of pfas in the vadose zone the strength of retention increases with pfas chain length and porewater ionic strength while it decreases at greater pfas concentrations due to nonlinear adsorption comprehensive parameter sensitivity analyses reveal that model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to the air water interfacial area and pfas interfacial properties when air water interfacial adsorption awia is more important than solid phase adsorption spa predicted pfas leaching rates vary by a wide range resulting from uncertainties in the input parameters but the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas than that of their shorter chain counterparts the simulated arrival times to groundwater were found to follow log normal distributions finally model complexity analysis reveals that nonlinearity in awia and kinetic spa and kinetic awia have a minimal impact on the long term retention of pfas under the wide range of field conditions examined in the present study abbreviations afff aqueous film forming foam awia air water

adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial applications and commercial products due to their unique physicochemical properties over 4 000 pfas have been on the global market since the 1940s cousins et al 2020 oecd 2018 pfas may be released to the environment through various sources including fire training area fta and other sites that use aqueous film forming foams afffs anderson et al 2019 hatton et al 2018 industrial sites that manufacture or use pfas products landfills and wastewater treatment plants and agricultural lands that receive biosolids itrc 2018 most pfas are surfactants kissa 2001 and as a result they tend to adsorb at fluid fluid interfaces such as air water interfaces in water unsaturated soils despite the significant potential to affect human health scientific investigations on the fate and transport of pfas in the environment especially in soils wherein multiple fluid phases and complex fluid fluid interfaces coexist have only begun recently this topic has been deemed a critical research need sharifan et al 2021 sima and jaffé 2021 simon et al 2019 naidu et al 2020 serdp 2017 a growing body of field investigations have demonstrated that the vadose zone can serve as significant source zones of pfas to groundwater even several decades after the contamination events were stopped e g adamson et al 2020 anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a dauchy et al 2019 filipovic et al 2015 høisæter et al 2019 sepulvado et al 2011 shin et al 2011 washington et al 2010 weber et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 field data revealed that the mass fraction of pfas typically changes with depth and chain length e g brusseau et al 2020a dauchy et al 2019 the long chain pfas are generally dominant in the shallow vadose zone while more short chain pfas are present at deeper depths indicating that long chain pfas have stronger retention than their short chain counterparts anderson et al 2019 baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 sepulvado et al 2011 washington et al 2010 the large body of field evidence cited above demonstrates that pfas experience strong retention in the vadose zone and the strength of retention varies among different pfas however the mechanisms that control pfas migration in the vadose zone especially regarding the relative importance of adsorption at air water interfaces and the primary controlling parameters for a large variety of pfas with different physicochemical properties remain unclear the importance of air water interfacial adsorption awia as a significant source of retention for pfos and pfoa two pfas of primary concern was assessed by brusseau 2018 using surface tension data and laboratory measured air water interfacial areas several surface tension based analyses of awia covering a wider range of chain length and solution chemistry have since been reported brusseau 2019a brusseau van glubt 2019 costanza et al 2019 2020 schaefer et al 2019a silva et al 2019 2021 these studies showed that chain length and solution ionic strength enhance awia of anionic pfas the impact of ionic strength pfas concentration and porous media on awia has been examined by water unsaturated miscible displacement experiments using soil packed columns brusseau et al 2019b 2021 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 lyu et al 2020 lyu brusseau 2020 these studies employing steady state flow conditions demonstrated that awia is controlled by the interfacial behaviors of pfas and soil hydraulic properties however time dependent flow boundaries and transient variably saturated flow can lead to a rapid spatial and temporal evolution of air water interfaces which can then strongly influence the transport and retention of pfas in the vadose zone additionally like other surfactants bashir et al 2018 henry et al 2001 karagunduz et al 2015 smith gillham 1994 1999 pfas dissolved in soil water can reduce surface tension and decrease capillary forces which in turn will influence unsaturated water flow and redistribute soil moisture i e surfactant induced flow sif finally prior steady state miscible displacement experiments demonstrated that while the adsorption at solid surfaces can be rate limited the adsorption at air water interfaces can be mostly considered instantaneous under certain experimental conditions brusseau 2020 brusseau et al 2021 yet it is unknown whether the kinetics remain insignificant under dynamic changes in water saturation and air water interfacial area in vadose zone relevant conditions the aforementioned complex coupled flow and transport processes need to be represented to understand and quantify the overall impact of awia on pfas long term retention under time dependent infiltration fluxes in the vadose zone to date only a few modeling studies on pfas transport in the vadose zone have been reported shin et al 2011 2012 simulated pfoa transport in the vadose zone but did not consider awia guo et al 2020 developed a new mathematical model that incorporates a comprehensive set of processes for pfas transport and retention under transient variably saturated flow in the vadose zone the model formulations account for sif and nonlinear and rate limited adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces numerical simulations for a model afff impacted fta site demonstrated the importance of awia on pfas retention in the vadose zone for example they showed that depending on specific conditions such as soil properties and climatic conditions the time scale for a majority of the pfos plume to reach a depth of 5 m can be several decades silva et al 2020 also reported a model that accounts for the processes discussed above kinetic adsorption was not presented and simulated pfas transport in one and two dimensions more recently zeng guo 2021 developed a three dimensional mathematical model to investigate the impact of preferential flow and sif on pfas leaching in heterogeneous vadose zones they suggested that compared to traditional contaminants the acceleration of pfas leaching due to preferential flow is further amplified by the destruction of air water interfaces resulting from greater water saturations along the preferential flow pathways additionally sif was predicted to have a relatively minor impact on both the lateral spreading and long term leaching of pfas in the vadose zone even when pfas are released at higher concentrations at afff impacted sites while the formulations of the above discussed models are well established a thorough experimental validation of the coupled nonlinear processes especially under transient flow conditions that are more relevant to field contamination sites has not been reported in the literature another critical aspect that has been minimally investigated is the relative importance of the various physicochemical processes and parameters controlling pfas retention and leaching as discussed above multiple processes affect pfas retention and their relative importance may change under different field conditions and for different pfas in addition the mathematical models require a wide range of parameters for the properties and conditions for pfas and the soil media in the vadose zone it is of great importance to identify the primary processes and critical parameters that dominantly control the long term leaching of pfas in the vadose zone the insights from which will lead to improved quantitative predictions of pfas leaching and provide practical guidance for managing and mitigating contamination risks at field sites to address the above discussed challenges 1 we use multiple experimental data sets brusseau 2020 karagunduz et al 2015 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 to validate the mathematical model of guo et al 2020 for representing several important processes and conditions including sif solution chemistry and nonlinear and kinetic solid phase adsorption spa and awia 2 we then employ the validated model to conduct a series of simulations to investigate and analyze the primary factors controlling the leaching and retention of pfas in the vadose zone under field conditions specifically we simulate the transport of six representative pfas at a model fta site the simulations consider a 30 year active contamination period followed by a post contamination period lasting 50 years or longer a wide range of conditions are considered including two climatic semiarid vs humid conditions two porous media sand vs soil two different solution chemistries in porewater deionized water diw vs synthetic groundwater sgw and different applied concentrations of pfas these base simulations are then followed by comprehensive parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that examined a total of 12 parameters that may control pfas leaching in the vadose zone our analyses are guided by the following specific questions what are the primary factors controlling the timescale of pfas retention in the vadose zone how does the timescale of retention change for different pfas and what are the conditions under which awia or spa become dominant retention processes 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model we describe the variably saturated water flow in the vadose zone using the one dimensional 1d richards equation richardson 1921

data because the present work focuses on anionic pfas that have a relatively minor impact on the contact angle we assume cos γ cos γ 0 1 and h σ σ 0 h 0 we note that for cationic zwitterionic or nonionic pfas that can interact more strongly with soil grain surfaces the change of contact angle can be more significant and may need to be accounted for especially at higher aqueous concentrations while contact angle measurements for non pfas surfactants exist in the literature desai et al 1992 karagunduz et al 2001 no such data have yet been reported for pfas that allows parameterization in

and boundary conditions is presented in guo et al 2020 2 2 model validation we employ three measured transport datasets reported in the literature to validate the mathematical model presented in section 2 1 based on the conditions examined in these laboratory miscible displacement experiments we focus on validating the following processes 1 sif karagunduz et al 2015 2 solution chemistry li et al 2021 and 3 different pfas input concentrations lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2020 2 2 1 sif karagunduz et al 2015 conducted a set of miscible displacement experiments to study the impact of sif on water flow and the transport of triton x 100 a non pfas surfactant the triton x 100 solution was injected under steady state conditions into five columns packed with unsaturated f70 ottawa sand the input concentration c 0 1 054 mg l was much higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc 150 mg l five different input water fluxes corresponding to five initial water contents were used resulting in different water outflow fluxes and breakthrough curves btcs for the surfactant and a non reactive solute nrs all of which were measured in the experiments the original simulations reported in karagunduz et al 2015 accounted for sif and equilibrium solid phase adsorption but adsorption at the air water interfaces was not represented it was reported that the simulations deviated from the measured experiment data at lower water saturations when awia becomes more important here we account for a set of comprehensive processes in the simulations including sif and rate limited and nonlinear spa and nonlinear awia awia was assumed to be effectively instantaneous because kinetics were determined to be of minor importance under the given experimental conditions we employ the independently determined soil hydraulic parameters and solid phase adsorption isotherm from karagunduz et al 2015 and surface tension data from janczuk et al 1995 to parameterize the model the measured surface tension σ as a function of the aqueous concentration c of the surfactant is fitted using the szyszkowski model fig s1 of supporting information si note that σ and kaw become approximately constant when the aqueous concentration exceeds the cmc we also account for the impact of kinetic spa the kinetic spa parameters are obtained by calibrating the model simulation to exp1 that has the highest water saturation for which awia would be least relevant the obtained kinetic spa parameters are then used for simulating the other four experiments because aaw as a function of water saturation sw was not measured for the f70 ottawa sand we approximate aaw sw using the dataset from a similar sand i e accusand that is well characterized in the literature e g guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2019b the detailed input parameters for the model simulations are summarized in table s1 in si very good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental measurements we observe that a ratio ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 is needed to scale aaw for the model predictions to match the measured btcs and the required scaling ratio decreases for smaller water saturations this appears to indicate that the amount of accessible air water interfaces may depend on water saturation additionally the results show that kinetic spa has a limited impact on improving the match between the simulated and measured outflow water flux and the surfactant breakthrough curves comparisons for two of the experiments i e exp2 and exp3 are presented in fig 1 as examples the comparisons for the other three experiments and additional information for the experiments and numerical simulations are provided in section s1 1 of si the measured perturbations in the water outflow flux caused by the sif are well captured by the simulations fig 1 the outflow flux first increases due to enhanced drainage when the surfactant is applied later on the outflow flux abruptly decreases when the surfactant arrives at the outlet and then recovers as the surfactant solution reaches a steady state these behaviors are consistent with the original analysis by karagunduz et al 2015 finally outflow water flux experiences a further perturbation when the surfactant solution is replaced by clean water comparison between the btcs for the surfactants and nrs shows that the surfactant experiences significant retention resulting from adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces both of which appear to be well captured by the model simulations overall the good agreement between the simulations and measurements demonstrates that the mathematical model of guo et al 2020 is capable of representing the impact of sif on variably saturated flow and surfactant transport 2 2 2 solution chemistry to validate our model for representing the impact of solution chemistry on pfas transport we simulate the transport experiments by li et al 2021 that employed different solution chemistries in these experiments 4 6 pore volumes of pfoa solution at 1 ml min and 6 8 µg l were injected into an unsaturated sand column accusand sw 0 64 after that the injection was switched to a background electrolyte solution an nrs was also employed and measured for comparison the experiments employed six background electrolyte solutions comprising three different ionic strengths i e 1 5 10 and 30 mm and two salts i e nacl and cacl2 to examine the impact of ionic strength and cation valency mathematical modeling of these experiments was not reported in the original work we simulate the experiments using both equilibrium and kinetic adsorption models basic properties including column dimensions bulk density porosity and water saturation were reported in the source paper kd was determined from experiments reported for saturated flow conditions soil hydraulic properties and the aaw as a function of sw are obtained from measured data reported by brusseau and colleagues for accusand because the sand used here is accusand parameters for kinetic spa and kinetic awia determined for pfoa in accusand from lyu et al 2018 and brusseau 2020 are employed for the kinetic simulations see section 2 2 3 all parameters used for modeling are determined independently our simulations suggest that the simulated btcs are sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity α l α l 0 35 cm determined from the inverse modeling of the btc for an nrs under the same unsaturated condition is employed in the simulations presented in fig 2 more simulated btcs as influenced by different α l are presented in fig s5 of si additional details for the parameters and model setup are given in section s1 2 of si comparisons between the predicted and measured btcs show that the model simulations with and without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia are close to each other fig 2 indicating that the kinetics associated with spa and awia are insignificant under the specific conditions employed in these experiments we note that because spa is much smaller than awia see the fractional retardation factors in table s2 in si the relatively small difference between the equilibrium and kinetic simulations is mainly caused by kinetic awia comparisons among the btcs corresponding to different solution chemistry also show that stronger ionic strength leads to stronger retention which is well captured by the numerical simulations similarly because spa is very small the increased retention of pfas observed at stronger ionic strengths is mainly a result of greater awia 2 2 3 different pfas input concentrations we simulate the experimental data reported in lyu et al 2018 and brusseau 2020 to validate our model for simulating pfas transport under different input concentrations to test the impact of potential nonlinear adsorption and transient flow caused by sif the original simulations presented in brusseau 2020 assumed steady state flow and did not account for sif the simulations here account for variably saturated flow and potential sif in the presence of pfas in the solution the experiments were conducted at three different input concentration for pfoa c 0 0 01 mg l 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l and four different water saturations sw 1 0 865 0 76 and 0 68 the data for an nrs is used to obtain the longitudinal dispersivity all parameters used in the simulations were determined independently thus the model simulations represent direct predictions of the experiments the list of parameters used and the setup of the numerical model are provided in section s1 3 of si comparisons between the model predictions and the experimental data are presented in fig 3 which show very good agreement for all of the five breakthrough curves covering pfoa input concentrations from 0 01 to 1 mg l the results for the nrs are presented for reference simulations assuming equilibrium spa and awia are also presented the results suggest that kinetic spa and kinetic awia have a relatively small impact on the simulated btcs for all of the pfoa experiments and the kinetics were mainly caused by kinetic spa with a minimal contribution from kinetic awia i e turning off kinetic awia has a minimal impact on the simulated btcs we note that because the elution tailing data for the presented experiments were not measured the kinetic adsorption was only evaluated based on tailing for the arrival front more rigorous evaluation of the kinetic adsorption will require the elution tailing data additionally simulations accounting for sif and nonlinear awia and spa are very similar to those without including sif and assumed linear awia and spa results not shown which indicates that the influence of sif and nonlinearity in adsorption are both minimal for the range of concentrations examined in the experiments these results are consistent with the simulation results presented in brusseau et al 2021 for pfoa pfos and genx transport in unsaturated sand overall the detailed comparisons between model simulations and measured datasets presented in sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 for miscible displacement experiments conducted under a wide range of conditions represent a comprehensive validation of the pfas specific flow and transport processes incorporated in the mathematical model introduced in section 2 1 additionally the results suggest that while kinetic spa and kinetic awia may influence the transport of surfactants and pfas their impact is of relatively small significance under the specific conditions employed in the above discussed miscible displacement experiments this is consistent with the prior studies by brusseau 2020 and brusseau et al 2021 the significance of the kinetics associated with spa and awia under vadose zone relevant conditions will be quantified and discussed in section 3 1 3 in the next section we employ the validated model to conduct detailed simulations at a model fta site to delineate the primary factors that control the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone under field relevant conditions 2 3 simulating the long term leaching and retention of pfas at an fta site 2 3 1 general description of the model fta site to focus on examining the complex physical and chemical processes for pfas transport we assume that the vadose zone of the model fta site is homogeneous and is composed of one of the two soil media that have different hydraulic and geochemical properties accusand natural quartz sand or vinton soil sandy loam we use long term rainfall and evapotranspiration data measured at two sites in arizona az and new jersey nj to represent a semi arid climate and a humid climate respectively this gives a combination of four sets of conditions two soil media combined with two climatic conditions for the base simulations we assume that regular fire training operations lasted for 30 years at the site moody and field 2000 1999 after which no pfas were released to the site i e post contamination the vadose zone is assumed to be pfas free before the site was converted for fire training based on a report by the federal aviation administration faa 2010 and the information for the volume of afff solutions used at fta sites dauchy et al 2019 moody and field 1999 2000 we estimate that 50 to 150 gallons 189 3 to 567 8 l of diluted afff solution is applied to a burning area of 385 m2 to 1 318 m2 per training session guo et al 2020 assuming that all of the released afff solutions enter the vadose zone this leads to a total infiltration of approximately 0 0458 cm afff solution per training session fire training activities are assumed to occur every 10 days with each training session lasting for 30 min which are consistent with the standard fire training practices reported in the literature e g rotander et al 2015 apex 2017 moody field 1999 2000 2 3 2 data and parameters 1 pfas properties pfas composition in commercial afff formulations varies by year of production and manufacturer houtz et al 2013 place and field 2012 for illustrative purposes we consider six pfas including three perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas i e pfbs pfhxs and pfos and three perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas i e pfpea pfoa and pftrda pfbs and pfpea are short chain and the remaining four are long chain based on the terminology proposed by buck et al 2011 in our study chain length refers specifically to the fluorinated carbon chain length these six pfas are among the representative fluorocarbon components of a commercial afff concentrate in this 1 100 diluted afff product the concentrations c 0 for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda are 1 4 0 23 7 1 0 9 100 and 0 00012 mg l respectively høisæter et al 2019 which will be employed in our simulations the molecular weight mw molar volume vm szyszkowski fitting parameters for surface tension a and b freundlich parameters for solid phase adsorption kf and n and molecular diffusivity d 0 for the six pfas are presented in table 1 the surface tension data measured in diw and sgw brusseau and van glubt 2019 campbell et al 2009 costanza et al 2019 are plotted in fig 4 a specifically the data for pfpea sgw pfoa sgw pftrda sgw and pfos sgw are from brusseau van glubt 2019 pfbs diw and pfhxs diw are from campbell et al 2009 and pfos diw are from costanza et al 2019 the sgw employed in brusseau and van glubt 2019 included na 50 mg l ca2 36 mg l mg2 25 mg l n o 3 6 mg l cl 60 mg l c o 3 2 h c o 3 133 mg l and s o 4 2 99 mg l the ph and ionic strength were 7 7 and 0 01 m respectively the awi adsorption coefficient for each compound kaw is computed based on the surface tension data and the gibbs adsorption equation fig 4 b the molecular diffusion coefficients d 0 for all compounds except for pftrda are measured values from schaefer et al 2019b d 0 for pftrda is estimated by relating it to the molar volume using the regression ln d 0 2 5623 ln v m 1 5528 schaefer et al 2019b the freundlich spa parameters kf and n for pfos in accusand and vinton soil and pfoa in accusand were reported in prior studies van glubt et al 2021 brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 for other pfas because no measured spa isotherms are available for the two porous media we estimate kf and n as follows we assume that the nonlinear coefficient n for pfbs and pfhxs is the same as that for pfos in the same medium that is n is 0 81 for accusand and 0 77 for vinton soil similarly we assume n for pfpea and pftrda in both media is the same as that for pfoa in accusand i e n 0 87 we employ this simple estimation for n partly because the nonlinearity for solid phase adsorption was reported to be weak for a wide range of sediments guelfo higgins 2013 higgins luthy 2006 and also specifically for the two media we use brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 for kf we estimate the values for the other two pfsas by scaling the kf for pfos based on the pfsa organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients koc reported in the literature brusseau 2019b higgins and luthy 2006 the kf for pfoa in the vinton soil is estimated by scaling kf for pfoa in the accusand based on the kf values for pfos in the two media similar to the pfsas the kf for the other two pfcas are then estimated by scaling kf for pfoa based on the reported pfca koc values brusseau 2019b guelfo and higgins 2013 the molar volumes vm are obtained from the pubchem database url pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov parameters for kinetic spa and kinetic awia are only available for pfoa we estimate the first order rate constants for the other pfas from that of pfoa assuming that the first order rate constants scale with the molecular diffusion coefficients for example α s p f p e a α s p f o a d 0 p f p e a d 0 p f o a and α aw p f p e a α aw p f o a d 0 p f p e a d 0 p f o a e g brusseau 2020 the estimated αs and αaw are presented in table 1 to estimate the uncertainty associated with the measured surface tension data we collect 11 data sets for pfoa in diw from the literature an et al 1996 downes et al 1995 jin et al 2005 lópez fontán et al 2005 lunkenheimer et al 2015 2017 lyu et al 2018 shinoda et al 1972 tamaki et al 1989 vecitis et al 2008 dmowski 1990 the original data and the fitted curves are presented in fig s8 a the szyszkowski equation is fitted separately to each of the datasets note that the curve using the parameters averaged from the separately fitted parameters agrees well with that fitted with all measured data see a comparison in fig s9 the computed kaw as a function of c is presented in fig s8 b the variations in these measured data may be caused by differences in the forms of pfoa e g acid vs different salt forms and the employed experimental conditions e g temperature the status of instruments or expertise of an operator there is a wide range of uncertainty in the fitted parameters for pfoa as shown in fig s8 specifically σ 0 ranges from 70 0 to 73 75 dyn cm with a mean value of 71 45 dyn cm and a coefficient of variation cv 0 0146 a ranges from 0 945 to 3 145 µmol cm3 with a mean value of 1 884 µmol cm3 and cv 0 382 b ranges from 0 187 to 0 312 with a mean value of 0 231 and cv of 0 185 the resulting maximum kaw in fig s8 b ranges from 0 13 10 3 to 0 29 10 3 cm3 cm2 with a mean value of 0 196 10 3 cm3 cm2 and cv 0 27 in our study cv σ μ where σ is the standard deviation the cvs and correlation coefficients obtained for pfoa see table 2 are then used to represent the uncertainties associated with the surface tension parameters for all pfas we assume that σ 0 a and b follow normal distributions based on the datasets we use though more measured data would be needed to further confirm this assumption 2 soil properties two porous media accusand and vinton soil are used as the base media in the present work the accusand is a commercially available natural quartz sand unimin corp which has a median grain diameter of 0 35 mm it has a total organic carbon content of 0 04 the fe mn and al oxide contents are 14 2 5 and 12 µg g respectively the vinton soil is a loamy sand collected locally in tucson arizona the hydraulic properties solid phase adsorption behavior and measured air water interfacial area as a function of water saturation for the two media are reported in guo et al 2020 and the references therein here we summarize the soil parameters in table 3 α cm 1 and n are the parameters in the van genuchten mualem empirical model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the air water interfacial area aaw was measured by aqueous interfacial tracer experiments which was shown to represent the total hydraulically accessible air water interfacial area consisting of capillary interfaces associated with menisci between bulk air and water and film associated interfaces associated with wetting films surrounding grain surfaces additionally the aaw data used in our study also agrees well with several other awi data sets measured using low concentrations of surfactant tracers wherein sif was negligible by design brusseau et al 2020b the measured aaw was fitted to a second degree polynomial function of water saturation sw aaw x 2 sw 2 x 1 sw x 0 where x 2 x 1 and x 0 are the fitting parameters for accusand x 2 548 54 x 1 1 182 5 and x 0 633 96 while for vinton soil x 2 1 305 0 x 1 2 848 6 and x 0 1 543 6 guo et al 2020 α l is the longitudinal dispersivity cm that is approximated using the empirical function α l 83 log l 100 2 414 xu and eckstein 1995 where l cm is the apparent length scale which is set to the depth of the vadose zone in our study l 400 cm we note that the approximation employed here assumes saturated condition and hence does not account for the impact of water saturation on α l we use the vinton soil as the base porous medium and perturb its parameters for the sensitivity and uncertainty simulations in table 4 we provide the uncertainty of soil parameters described by cv and correlation coefficient that will be used for the parameter uncertainty analyses later we assume that these soil parameters follow normal or log normal distributions the cvs for the soil hydraulic parameters ln k s θs θr ln α and n were obtained from field measurements russo bouton 1992 the correlation coefficients for the majority of these parameters are measured from undisturbed soils at the field site russo bouton 1992 the cvs for kf and n are obtained from parameters measured by van glubt et al 2021 kf and n are assumed to be independent the range of uncertainty for ln α l is estimated based on a statistical study xu eckstein 1995 the bulk density ρ b exhibits a narrow range from field measurement russo bouton 1992 and is thus assumed a constant 3 precipitation and evapotranspiration we consider two climatic conditions semiarid az vs humid nj to examine the impact of climate on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone the semiarid climate is represented by the walnut gulch kendall grasslands site scott 2016 in arizona usa while the humid climate is represented by the silas little site clark 2016 in new jersey usa precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the two sites for 10 years 01 01 2005 12 31 2014 at a 30 min temporal resolution is downloaded from the ameriflux database url https ameriflux lbl gov the data are repeated every 10 years to generate multidecadal data sets the 10 year annual average precipitation is 293 mm and 1 066 mm for the two sites respectively note that our model does not account for transpiration through plants the measured evapotranspiration data were used as the potential evapotranspiration to determine the surface evaporation rate the original data at a 30 min resolution are smoothed to a 24 hour resolution and employed for the long term simulations 2 3 3 design of numerical experiments in this section we introduce the overall design of the numerical experiments which include 1 a set of base simulations that focus on examining the relative importance of several retention and transport processes and 2 a series of additional simulations that focus on analyzing the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters that control the long term leaching and retention of pfas in the vadose zone the specific methods employed for conducting the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also introduced 1 overview we first conduct a set of numerical experiments that employ the default parameters and conditions described in section 2 3 2 these base cases consider two soil media accusand vs vinton two climatic conditions az vs nj and six pfas pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda we then conduct additional simulations to probe the influence of different parameters and conditions on transport the additional simulations allow us 1 to analyze the impact of several factors i e soil porewater solution chemistry chain length nonlinear adsorption and kinetic adsorption on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone 2 to identify the primary parameters that control the predicted leaching behavior by performing sensitivity analysis for 12 parameters used in the simulations and 3 to conduct monte carlo simulations to analyze the uncertainties in the model predictions propagated from the uncertainty in the input parameters 2 estimating the air water interfacial area a aw for a random soil perturbations on soil parameters may introduce significant variations in a aw the a aw of a random soil may be related to the soil water characteristic curve based on the thermodynamic approach bradford et al 2015 bradford and leij 1997 leverett 1941 morrow 1970 5 a aw thermo θ 1 σ 0 θ θ s p c d θ where p c is the capillary pressure parameterized as a function of θ p c ρ w g h where ρ w is the density of water g cm3 g is the gravitational constant cm s2 for the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 p c ρ w g α s e 1 m 1 1 n g cm s2 where s e is the effective water saturation substituting s e θ θ r θ s θ r to eq 5 yields 6 a aw thermo s e θ s θ r ρ w g σ 0 α s e 1 s e 1 m 1 1 n d s e however the thermodynamic based a aw thermo was reported to significantly underestimate the tracer based a aw tracer jiang et al 2020 which has been considered to be more transport relevant lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019b brusseau and guo 2021 assuming that the ratio between the thermodynamic based a aw thermo and the tracer based a aw tracer remains the same for all soils we estimate the tracer based a aw tracer for a random soil based on the thermodynamic based a aw thermo and measured tracer based a aw tracer from the vinton soil that is 7 a aw r a n d o m estimated s e ω s e a aw r a n d o m thermo s e where ω s e a aw v i n t o n tracer s e a aw v i n t o n thermo s e is the scaling ratio computed from the tracer based a aw v i n t o n tracer s e and the thermodynamic based a aw v i n t o n thermo s e for the vinton soil the integral in eq 6 can be evaluated by numerical integration because the variation of ω is relatively small for different s e we approximate it using the ratio ω 4 2 evaluated at s e 0 5 for our simulations 3 morris sensitivity analysis we employ the morris method morris 1991 for the parameter sensitivity analysis the morris method quantifies the global sensitivity using local derivatives of the model predictions in the parameter space i e only a single parameter is perturbed at a time in our sensitivity analysis we use the arrival time to the bottom of the domain to represent the speed of predicted pfas migration we define the arrival time ta for each pfas as the time when 0 1 of the total mass of this pfas has exited the bottom boundary of the domain suppose η i is the perturbed parameter η i μ i 1 c v i μ i 1 c v i where μ i denotes the mean of η i i e the original measured mean value and c v i is the estimated coefficient of variation for parameter η i we define the normalized parameter as p i η i μ i furthermore we denote ta i and ta 0 as the arrival times for the simulations with the perturbed parameter and the base case respectively and define the normalized arrival time as s i t a i t a 0 then the local sensitivity measured as elementary effects ee i has the following form 8 ee i s i p i s η i s μ i p η i p μ i the mean value of eei for all of the m perturbations performed to η i is then defined as the morris sensitivity m i 1 m k 1 m ee i k for η i where k 1 2 m is the index for different simulated perturbations for our problem specifically we denote the parameter space by η i σ 0 a b log k s θ s θ r log α n log α l kf and n where i 1 2 11 additionally the boundary condition parameter log c 0 is used to quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to the applied concentration based on laboratory measurements and field investigations see section 2 3 2 the parameters are all assumed to follow normal distributions note that this means ks α and αl follow log normal distributions the mean value μ i is the reference value measured or estimated for the original soil or pfas we conduct the sensitivity analysis for each pfas which gives a total of 6 sets of simulations in each set of simulations we conduct simulations by uniformly changing each of the 12 parameters within the designated range when one of the parameters is being perturbed the remaining parameters are fixed to their mean values the applied pfas concentration ranging from 0 1c 0 to 10c 0 is used to investigate the model predictions as influenced by the applied concentration the above perturbations are conducted for the prediction of long term leaching for all six pfas using the base case of vinton soil under nj climate 4 monte carlo simulations we employ monte carlo simulations to quantify the uncertainties in model predictions propagated from the uncertainties in the model parameters 200 combinations of randomized parameters for vinton soil and the six pfas are generated see section 2 3 2 specifically the randomly perturbed surfacial properties of 200 pfas based on the measured parameters for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda in sgw are presented in fig s10 of si these parameters i e σ 0 a and b follow normal distributions their mean values cv and correlation coefficients are provided in table 2 the corresponding randomly generated kaw as a function of aqueous concentration is presented in fig s11 of si the 200 realizations of the randomly generated soil parameters are presented in fig s12 of si these parameters i e log ks θs θr log α n aaw kf n and log αl follow normal distributions and have mean values cv and correlation coefficients reported in table 4 it is important to note that not all of the 12 parameters are independent several of them are correlated and their correlation is taken into account in our sensitivity and uncertainty analyses 1 the szyskowski parameters σ 0 a and b are correlated based on measured data for pfoa in diw see table 2 2 the soil hydraulic parameters are correlated based on field measurement for 417 undisturbed soil samples russo bouton 1992 see table 4 3 aaw is related to soil hydraulic properties using the thermodynamic based method discussed in subsection 2 above bradford et al 2015 bradford and leij 1997 leverett 1941 morrow 1970 finally the parameters for kinetic spa and awia are kept as constants in the simulations for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses because the impact of kinetic adsorption on the predicted long term pfas is relatively minor see section 3 1 3 2 3 4 setup of the numerical model we consider a 1d domain along the vertical dimension of a 4 m deep vadose zone the 1d domain is discretized using a uniform grid δz 2 cm for the newton raphson iterative solver all of the following absolute tolerances have to be met for convergence at each time step δ h 1 10 3 cm δ θ 1 10 4 cm3 cm3 and δ c 1 10 7 μmol cm3 the initial conditions are set as h z t 0 100 cm and c z t 0 0 the top boundary is represented by measured rainfall infiltration and surface evaporation during the fire training sessions an inward pfas solution lasting 30 min enters the top numerical cell the infiltration rate and applied pfas concentrations c 0 for each pfas are provided in section 2 3 1 a zero gradient condition is assigned for both water flow h z z 4 m 0 and pfas transport c z z 4 m 0 at the bottom boundary of the domain 3 results and discussion the results and analyses are organized as follows we first examine the impact of several primary factors including solution chemistry pfas chain length and nonlinear spa and awia on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone based on the set of base simulations then we present detailed analyses on the impact of parameter sensitivity and uncertainty on long term model predictions based on the morris sensitivity and monte carlo simulations 3 1 primary factors 3 1 1 the impact of solution chemistry chain length we conduct simulations using surface tension parameters for the six pfas determined in solutions with different ionic strengths diw vs sgw to quantify the impact of solution chemistry and chain length on long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone note that while the ionic strengths vary among simulations they do not dynamically change over time in each simulation fig 5 presents the simulated spatial concentration profiles over time for six pfas under two different ionic strengths diw vs sgw the vinton soil nj climate scenario is shown as an example the results show that pfas retention in the vadose zone increases with both ionic strength and chain length comparing the simulated retention using diw vs sgw surface activities significantly enhanced retention is observed for pfhxs pfoa and pfos for instance the ta arrival time for pfhxs increases from 2 5 years for diw to 15 years for sgw similarly the ta for pfoa increases from 8 years for diw to 19 years for sgw the ta for pfos for diw is 12 years while pfos reached the bottom of the domain 64 years later for sgw it is noted that employing diw as the representative low ionic strength solution does not reflect natural soil conditions and is used to illustrate extreme differences the range of ionic strengths relevant for soil porewater will typically be less disparate and therefore the impact on pfas retention will be of lesser significance e g brusseau and van glubt 2019 lyu brusseau 2020 silva et al 2019 conversely a relatively minor increase is observed in fig 5 for the retention of pfbs pfpea and pftrda in sgw this is because the significance of spa is comparable to or greater than awia for these three pfas for example at a simulated representative aqueous concentration for pftrda in the vadose zone 6 10 7 mg l the spa is 10 times greater than the awia such that the retention of pftrda is completely dominated by spa we note that prior batch and miscible displacement experiments have shown that spa can also increase with ionic strength li et al 2021 lyu brusseau 2020 our simulations have not accounted for the impact of ionic strength on the spa due to a lack of data for the pfas and soil media considered in the present study at the same ionic strength the retention follows the same order of chain length as pfbs pfhxs pfos and pfpea pfoa pftrda the disparity in the speed of migration for pfas with different chain lengths is consistent with concentration depth profiles reported at many afff impacted fta sites baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 specifically the cited field studies showed that long chain pfas were typically the dominant compounds near the surface in the vadose zone while short chain pfas represented the majority of pfas mass at deeper depths the concentrations of long chain pfas in the soil were consistently the highest near the surface of the vadose zone and decreased exponentially along depth albeit the sites were contaminated by different sources at various periods conversely the short chain pfas were much more uniformly distributed along depth and had reached much deeper locations more quantitatively the maximum concentrations of pfos in our simulations on the order of 104 μg kg are within the range of those reported at the afff impacted fta sites 103 105 μg kg baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson and chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 one of the few studies that reported measured pftrda is that of dauchy et al 2019 who measured pfas soil concentrations for an afff impacted site that had been used as an fta for more than 30 years they observed that pftrda was only detected above the depth of 0 25 m indicating much stronger retention of pftrda in the vadose zone compared to pfoa and pfos this is in agreement with our simulated results where pftrda remains above the depth of 0 5 m even 50 years after the pfas release contamination events have ceased the direct implication of the above analysis is that unlike short chain pfas leaching of long chain pfas from the vadose zone to groundwater will likely persist for several decades or longer after the pfas release events have been stopped 3 1 2 the impact of nonlinear adsorption to examine the impact of nonlinearity in spa and awia on long term pfas retention in the vadose zone we conduct additional simulations assuming linear spa and awia and compare the results with the full process model where nonlinear spa and awia are accounted for for linear spa and awia k d and k aw for a pfas need to be computed at a given aqueous concentration for our simulations we computed k d and k aw at c c max 2 where c max is the simulated maximum aqueous concentration from the full process model for the example scenario of vinton soil nj climate the maximal concentrations for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda are c max 0 12 mg l 0 019 mg l 0 29 mg l 0 032 mg l 3 9 mg l and 0 34 ng l respectively to isolate the impact of nonlinear spa and awia we construct simulation cases involving three levels of nonlinearity 1 nonlinear spa and awia full model 2 linear awia but nonlinear spa constant k aw and 3 linear spa and linear awia constant k d k aw the results show that nonlinear spa has a notable impact on the retention of some of the pfas fig 6 this is because pfas concentrations vary greatly within the plume and over time which leads to relatively strong variations in the equivalent kd for example within the majority of the plume where c greater than 0 1 cmax the equivalent kd kfcn 1 varies from 0 07 to 0 33 cm3 g for pfbs and from 0 22 to 1 1 cm3 g for pfpea during the simulation however the impact of nonlinear spa varies among the pfas it has a stronger impact on the retention of pfbs pfpea and pftrda than on that of pfhxs pfoa and pfos because spa is comparable with or greater than awia for the former conversely nonlinearity in awia has a minimal impact for all pfas except for pfos close inspection reveals that the aqueous concentrations for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa and pftrda are all very low so that the corresponding kaw approaches the maximum kaw the kaw at c c max 2 are 2 08 10 4 5 78 10 5 5 90 10 3 5 93 10 3 and 0 146 cm3 cm2 and the maximum kaw are 2 08 10 4 5 78 10 5 5 94 10 3 5 93 10 3 and 0 146 cm3 cm2 for these five pfas the aqueous concentration of pfos is much higher than the other pfas and the nonlinearity leads to a greater variation in kaw the simulated kaw varies from 0 043 to 0 022 cm3 cm2 in the full model which is not represented adequately by the model with linear awia i e constant kaw a log scale version of fig 6 is presented in fig s6 of the si to better visualize the differences between the model simulations at lower concentrations the above analyses predicted that the impact of nonlinearity of adsorption on pfas leaching is concentration dependent to further examine the dependence of nonlinear spa and awia on concentration we conduct additional simulations for pfos at a wide range of applied concentrations including 0 001c 0 0 01c 0 0 1c 0 c 0 5c 0 and 10c 0 the results suggest that the retention decreases as the applied concentration increases the time for the peak concentration of the plume to reach a depth of 1 m is approximately 64 60 56 43 22 and 14 years for the increasing applied concentrations 0 001c 0 0 01c 0 0 1c 0 c 0 5c 0 and 10c 0 the vertical migration velocity of the pfos plume represented by the slope of the red curve in fig 7 increases rapidly as the release concentration increases for the soil media considered in the present study the spa is always smaller than awia for pfos under all applied concentrations thus the nonlinear spa does not play a major role in affecting the overall retention and leaching in the vadose zone our simulations suggest that the nonlinearity in the awia is minor for all of the pfas except for pfos that is applied at a much greater concentration than the others this is consistent with the findings reported by brusseau et al 2021 where nonlinearity in awia was estimated to be insignificant at concentrations sufficiently lower than the critical reference concentration defined as the concentration corresponding to a reduction of 2 5 in the surface tension for the simulations presented in the present study that are relevant to field conditions even though the applied concentrations can be quite high e g 100 mg l for pfos the aqueous concentrations of pfas decrease significantly well below 3 8 mg l after entering the vadose zone due to strong adsorption at the solid water and especially air water interfaces this implies that the actual porewater concentrations in the vadose zone rather than the applied concentrations of pfas need to be used when evaluating the importance of the nonlinearity of awia at the field sites when nonlinearity in awia is insignificant the awia isotherm can be simplified by using a constant k aw and there is no need to employ the szyszkowski and gibbs equations to compute the concentration dependent k aw in the model finally we note that the issue of whether air water interfacial adsorption follows the langmuir isotherm and becomes linear at low concentrations is still under debate arshadi et al 2020 schaefer et al 2019a 2020 additional data and analyses reported recently indicated that k aw approaches a constant at relatively high concentrations and remains constant at concentrations down to 1 μ g l for pfoa brusseau et al 2021 and approximately 5 10 6 m for two hydrocarbon surfactants sdbs and sds brusseau 2021 3 1 3 the impact of kinetic adsorption we examine the impact of kinetic adsorption by comparing the simulation results with or without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia the parameters for kinetic adsorption are obtained from the miscible displacement experiments in section 2 2 2 table 1 and from batch experiments conducted on pfas contaminated soils collected from a historically afff impacted site schaefer et al 2021 the parameters are reported in note 5 of table 1 the latter was suggested to have more pronounced kinetics in spa especially for the shorter chain pfas in the soils collected from the shallow vadose zone schaefer et al 2021 two soils and two climatic conditions are considered for all six pfas in the simulations note that the results of the batch experiments reported in schaefer et al 2021 suggested that kinetic spa is much stronger for the short chain than that for the long chain pfas we thus only employ the measured kinetic spa parameters for the three shorter chain pfas pfbs pfpea and pfhxs in our simulations the simulated cumulative mass discharge out of the domain with and without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia is presented in fig 8 overall the difference between the simulations with and without accounting for kinetic adsorption is quite small a log scale version of fig 8 is presented in fig s7 of the si but the difference remains small even at much lower values of mass discharge this is also true for the simulations that employed the kinetic parameters from pfas contaminated soils collected from a historically afff impacted site that exhibit much stronger kinetics in spa schaefer et al 2021 these simulations suggest that the impact of kinetic spa and kinetic awia on the predicted long term pfas leaching is minimal under the field relevant conditions examined in the present study a close inspection reveals that the simulated mean porewater velocities in the field scale simulations are at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than those employed in the miscible displacement experiments in addition the retardation factor is also generally much greater in the field scale simulations due to much lower water saturations and hence stronger awia in our study we define the damköhler numbers for kinetic spa and kinetic awia as da s α s l q and da aw α aw l q where q is the mean darcy flux the fractional retardation factors contributed by spa and awia are r s ρ b θ c s c n ρ b k f c n 1 θ and r aw 1 θ c aw c k aw a aw θ we define the total retardation factor as r tot 1 r s r aw these retardation factors are spatially averaged within the plume where c 0 1 c max and during the first 30 year active contamination period the retardation factors and the damköhler numbers computed for the simulations presented in fig 8 are summarized in table 5 for the same kinetic spa and kinetic awia parameters the damköhler numbers computed for the field scale simulations are several orders of magnitude greater than those computed from the miscible displacement experiments see tables s2 and s3 the da s computed from the simulations that employed the kinetic spa parameters determined from the historically afff impacted soil samples are smaller due to the stronger kinetics but they are still mostly greater than 10 see da s in the parentheses for the three shorter chain pfas while the da s for pfhxs can be smaller than 10 the spa is much less important than awia for pfhxs such that the kinetic spa plays a minor role in influencing the overall leaching in contrast the miscible displacement experiments have much greater porewater velocity and smaller retardation factors the damköhler numbers for those experiments which are generally much smaller are reported in tables s2 and s3 in si in addition awia is also less significant due to the much smaller air water interfacial area at greater water saturations taking the experiment with pfoa input at c 0 1 mg l and sw 0 76 as an example section 2 2 3 the porewater velocity is 837 5 cm d note that the mean value is as low as 0 5 11 3 cm d under the simulated field conditions and the fractional retardation factors are r s 0 38 and r aw 0 57 the resulting damköhler numbers da s and da aw are 9 27 and 7 70 respectively the above analyses imply that it may be reasonable to assume equilibrium adsorption when the focus is on predicting pfas leaching at long time scales which would allow for simplifying the governing equations and parameters for the numerical simulations however we caution that the analyses presented here are based on the kinetic parameters obtained from a limited number of miscible displacement experiments conducted in a sand media and field contaminated soil samples from only one historical afff impacted site the importance of kinetic adsorption under a wider range of conditions for different kinds of field contaminated sites and different pfas needs further investigation 3 2 parameter sensitivity and uncertainty 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis in this section we conduct morris sensitivity analysis to determine the importance of each parameter in fig 9 we group the perturbed model parameters into five relatively independent categories 1 solid phase adsorption n and kf 2 hydraulic properties log k s θ s θ r log α and n 3 dispersion log α l 4 interfacial properties σ 0 a and b and 5 applied concentration log c 0 the morris sensitivity m provides the relative sensitivity of the normalized arrival time ta ta 0 to the five groups of parameters the specific rank of the most sensitive parameters differs among different pfas the top five dominant parameters for each pfas are provided below for pfos and pfhxs they are log α log α l θ s a and b or n for pfoa they are n log α log α l θ s and a for pfbs they are n log α θ s log α l and σ 0 for pfpea they are n log α l kf log α and log c 0 for pftrda they are n kf log α log c 0 and θ s a close inspection of fig 9 reveals that the rank of the most sensitive parameters is controlled by the relative importance of spa and awia which depends on the chain length and the applied concentration when spa is more important e g pfpea and pftrda the model predictions are most sensitive to changes in the spa parameters especially n due to nonlinear spa conversely when awia is dominant i e for those longer chain pfas at relatively greater concentrations e g pfhxs pfoa and pfos the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to aaw log α and interfacial properties σ 0 a and b for pfbs spa and awia are comparable e g 30 vs 43 of mass are partitioned to solid water and air water interfaces for the vinton nj scenario thus the model predictions are sensitive to both the spa and awia finally the model predictions for most of the pfas are sensitive to dispersivity which is expected because dispersivity controls the overall spreading of the plume 3 2 2 parameter uncertainty analysis in this section 11 of the 12 parameters i e σ 0 a b log k s θ s θ r log α n log α l kf and n are randomly perturbed within the uncertainty ranges provided in section 2 3 2 for each pfas there are 200 realizations based on the case with vinton soil and under nj climate fig 10 presents the cumulative mass discharge out of the domain from the monte carlo simulations the results indicate that the leaching rate and the associated range of uncertainty vary strongly among pfas with different chain lengths the short chain pfas pfbs and pfpea arrive at the bottom of the domain early and the majority of the mass is removed shortly after the contamination was stopped even with randomized parameters the variation among the different realizations is relatively insignificant this is because spa and awia are generally weak for the short chain pfas and the mass discharge is mainly controlled by hydrologic conditions such as rainfall intensity conversely the breakthroughs of the long chain pfas are much later and the mass discharge can last several decades during the post contamination period however the variation among the realizations is also much greater the variation is so wide that the realizations for the long chain pfas with the fastest leaching are even comparable to those of the short chain pfas for example the majority of the mass is removed 1 2 years after the pfas application has ceased for the pfos realizations with the most rapid leaching for pftrda it is 170 years we note that these fastest leaching cases are well beyond the 95 confidence interval ci the arrival times within the 95 cis are reported in the following paragraph another way to examine the uncertainty in the model predictions is to analyze the statistical distribution of the arrival time ta among the monte carlo realizations which are shown in fig 11 the computed arrival times for the base cases are also presented i e 1 7 years 2 4 years 12 years 17 years 63 years and 1 783 years for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda respectively interestingly ta among the monte carlo realizations appear to follow log normal distributions for all pfas the range of uncertainties among the pfas with different chain lengths are consistent with those observed in fig 10 i e the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas for example the 95 ci of ta is 497 14 571 years for pftrda 10 414 years for pfos 5 87 years for pfoa and 6 112 years for pfhxs conversely the 95 ci of ta ranges from 0 7 to 4 5 years for pfbs 0 9 to 6 years for pfpea the wide range of uncertainties shown in the model predictions resulting from the parameter uncertainties implies that it is important to quantify the uncertainty when limited information and parameters are available at contamination sites especially for the long chain pfas the distribution of the arrival times computed from the monte carlo simulations also illustrates that depending on the specific parameters employed in the simulations the arrival time for a certain pfas can vary by one or two orders of magnitude even within the 95 ci this again suggests that it is critical to quantify the uncertainty associated with any numerical predictions especially when the input parameters are uncertain the log normal distributions of the arrival times ta may be caused by the parameters that follow log normal distributions i e α α l and k s based on the morris sensitivity analysis in section 3 2 1 we speculate that the parameter α is likely most responsible for the log normal distributions of ta for the long chain pfas for which awia dominates the retention except for pftrda for the short chain pfas and pftrda both the parameters α and α l are primary controls on pfas leaching 3 3 assumptions and limitations in this section we summarize the assumptions employed in our study and discuss their potential impact on pfas leaching in the vadose zone the model simulations have not accounted for interactions e g competitive adsorption among pfas hydrocarbon surfactants and co solvents in afff change of contact angle between porewater and soil grain surfaces the dependence of spa on solution chemistry the transformation of pfas precursors and soil heterogeneity we discuss each of these assumptions below and identify their impact on the long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone interactions among different pfas can potentially deviate their behavior from what would be observed as a single pfas an example would be competitive adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces guelfo and higgins 2013 show that competitive spa is minor for multiple pfas below the concentration of 1 mg l for the pfas and porous media tested our simulated maximum c is lower than 3 8 mg l for pfos for all scenarios and is much lower for other pfas the actual aqueous concentrations are relatively low because most of the mass is adsorbed either at solid water and air water interfaces the presence of pfas mixtures can also influence surface tension and awia though limited data are available in the literature vecitis et al 2008 reported surface tension data for a 1 1 mixture of pfos and pfoa and brusseau van glubt 2019 presented surface tension data for a mixture of pfoa and pftrda with ratios of 8 2 and 2 8 more comprehensive surface tension data for multiple pfas mixtures were recently reported by silva et al 2021 all of the studies showed that the pfas with greater surface activity dominates the overall surface activity of the mixture our model simulations do not consider interactions among pfas mixtures and other hydrocarbon surfactants or co solvents the impact of such interactions on pfas retention and leaching will depend upon the nature and magnitude of the interactions huang et al 2021 ji et al 2021 interaction between soil grain surfaces and chemical components i e pfas hydrocarbon surfactants or co solvents can also increase the contact angle of porewater at the soil grain surfaces especially for the cationic zwitterionic or nonionic surfactants to date no experimental data for the dependence of contact angle on the aqueous concentration of pfas have been reported measured data for other surfactants are also limited desai et al 1992 the change of contact angle by pfas may be quantified when experimental data become available similarly the impact of solution chemistry on spa is not considered in our model simulations presented in section 3 1 1 due to a lack of measured data the impact of solution chemistry on pfas spa will depend on the properties of the pfas and the soil pfas precursors are important components of many afff concentrates e g houtz et al 2013 and they can be transformed through either biotic or abiotic reactions to pfsas and pfcas in the environment e g avendano and liu 2015 we have not accounted for these transformations in the present work but our modeling framework can be extended to include transformations of precursors when detailed reaction pathways and kinetics become available in the future the non fickian transport caused by immobile water observed in several prior experimental and numerical studies for non pfas solutes under water unsaturated conditions e g de gennes 1983 hasan et al 2020 padilla et al 1999 raoof hassanizadeh 2013 stults et al 2021 has not been considered in our study this immobile water caused non fickian behavior could be an important factor that can influence long term pfas leaching especially at relatively lower water saturation finally soil heterogeneity such as soil layering macropores and fractures may strongly influence pfas leaching in the vadose zone we considered vadose zones represented by homogeneous soils to focus on analyzing the physical and chemical processes influencing retention future investigations are needed to fully delineate the impact of soil heterogeneity on pfas leaching which may strongly influence the long term leaching as suggested by zeng guo 2021 4 conclusion we present a modeling study that focuses on analyzing the primary processes and parameters controlling the long term pfas leaching and retention in the vadose zone we first use multiple experimental data sets to validate a mathematical model that represents variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow advection dispersion as well as nonlinear and rate limited adsorption of pfas at the solid water and air water interfaces then we employ the validated mathematical model to investigate the primary factors and parameters controlling the long term leaching and retention behavior by conducting simulations and parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses under a wide range of conditions our specific conclusions are summarized below 1 the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone are primarily controlled by chain length soil properties solution chemistry and the applied concentration due to enhanced spa and awia pfas retention in the vadose zone increases for longer chain pfas higher ionic strengths and lower applied concentrations 2 parameter sensitivity analysis reveals that the parameters to which the model simulations are most sensitive differ among different pfas the rank of these parameters i e relative sensitivity is mainly controlled by the relative importance of spa and awia when spa is more important the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters for spa especially the freundlich exponent n due to its nonlinearity conversely when awia is dominant e g for long chain pfas at relatively greater concentrations e g pfhxs pfoa and pfos the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to the air water interfacial area and pfas interfacial properties dispersivity is a primary parameter for all pfas as it controls the overall spreading of the plume 3 parameter uncertainty analysis suggests that the model simulations involve a wide range of uncertainties due to uncertainties propagated from the model parameters the time for pfas to break through i e arrival time appears to follow log normal distributions for all pfas however the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas compared to that of their shorter chain counterparts this suggests that it is important to quantify uncertainties for the simulated pfas leaching when limited site information and parameters are available at contamination sites especially for the long chain pfas 4 nonlinearity in awia is insignificant under the field conditions examined in the present study and may be simplified for practical application at many legacy pfas contamination sites because the afff impacted fta sites are among the contamination sites that have the highest pfas concentrations assuming linear awia is expected to be even more appropriate for other contamination sites with lower pfas concentrations such as agricultural lands that received pfas contaminated biosolids and irrigation water 5 both kinetic spa and kinetic awia are generally insignificant under the field conditions examined in the present study we note that the importance of kinetic spa and kinetic awia was only determined based on kinetic parameters obtained from a limited number of miscible displacement experiments conducted in a sand media and field contaminated soil samples from only one historical afff impacted site therefore the general importance of kinetic spa and kinetic awia under a wider range of conditions for different kinds of field contaminated sites and different pfas needs further investigation credit authorship contribution statement jicai zeng methodology investigation software formal analysis visualization data curation writing original draft

3886,pfas are emerging contaminants widespread in the environment as surfactants pfas tend to accumulate at solid water and air water interfaces in the vadose zone which may pose long term threats to groundwater the primary factors that control the long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone remain poorly understood to address this knowledge gap we first use multiple datasets from transport experiments to validate a state of the art mathematical model that incorporates transient variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow and rate limited and nonlinear solid phase and air water interfacial adsorption we then employ the validated model to simulate and analyze the primary processes and parameters controlling the retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone at a model fire training area site our simulations show that adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces leads to strong retention of pfas in the vadose zone the strength of retention increases with pfas chain length and porewater ionic strength while it decreases at greater pfas concentrations due to nonlinear adsorption comprehensive parameter sensitivity analyses reveal that model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to the air water interfacial area and pfas interfacial properties when air water interfacial adsorption awia is more important than solid phase adsorption spa predicted pfas leaching rates vary by a wide range resulting from uncertainties in the input parameters but the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas than that of their shorter chain counterparts the simulated arrival times to groundwater were found to follow log normal distributions finally model complexity analysis reveals that nonlinearity in awia and kinetic spa and kinetic

adsorption 1 introduction per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas are synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial applications and commercial products due to their unique physicochemical properties over 4 000 pfas have been on the global market since the 1940s cousins et al 2020 oecd 2018 pfas may be released to the environment through various sources including fire training area fta and other sites that use aqueous film forming foams afffs anderson et al 2019 hatton et al 2018 industrial sites that manufacture or use pfas products landfills and wastewater treatment plants and agricultural lands that receive biosolids itrc 2018 most pfas are surfactants kissa 2001 and as a result they tend to adsorb at fluid fluid interfaces such as air water interfaces in water unsaturated soils despite the significant potential to affect human health scientific investigations on the fate and transport of pfas in the environment especially in soils wherein multiple fluid phases and complex fluid fluid interfaces coexist have only begun recently this topic has been deemed a critical research need sharifan et al 2021 sima and jaffé 2021 simon et al 2019 naidu et al 2020 serdp 2017 a growing body of field investigations have demonstrated that the vadose zone can serve as significant source zones of pfas to groundwater even several decades after the contamination events were stopped e g adamson et al 2020 anderson et al 2019 brusseau et al 2020a dauchy et al 2019 filipovic et al 2015 høisæter et al 2019 sepulvado et al 2011 shin et al 2011 washington et al 2010 weber et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 field data revealed that the mass fraction of pfas typically changes with depth and chain length e g brusseau et al 2020a dauchy et al 2019 the long chain pfas are generally dominant in the shallow vadose zone while more short chain pfas are present at deeper depths indicating that long chain pfas have stronger retention than their short chain counterparts anderson et al 2019 baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 sepulvado et al 2011 washington et al 2010 the large body of field evidence cited above demonstrates that pfas experience strong retention in the vadose zone and the strength of retention varies among different pfas however the mechanisms that control pfas migration in the vadose zone especially regarding the relative importance of adsorption at air water interfaces and the primary controlling parameters for a large variety of pfas with different physicochemical properties remain unclear the importance of air water interfacial adsorption awia as a significant source of retention for pfos and pfoa two pfas of primary concern was assessed by brusseau 2018 using surface tension data and laboratory measured air water interfacial areas several surface tension based analyses of awia covering a wider range of chain length and solution chemistry have since been reported brusseau 2019a brusseau van glubt 2019 costanza et al 2019 2020 schaefer et al 2019a silva et al 2019 2021 these studies showed that chain length and solution ionic strength enhance awia of anionic pfas the impact of ionic strength pfas concentration and porous media on awia has been examined by water unsaturated miscible displacement experiments using soil packed columns brusseau et al 2019b 2021 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 lyu et al 2020 lyu brusseau 2020 these studies employing steady state flow conditions demonstrated that awia is controlled by the interfacial behaviors of pfas and soil hydraulic properties however time dependent flow boundaries and transient variably saturated flow can lead to a rapid spatial and temporal evolution of air water interfaces which can then strongly influence the transport and retention of pfas in the vadose zone additionally like other surfactants bashir et al 2018 henry et al 2001 karagunduz et al 2015 smith gillham 1994 1999 pfas dissolved in soil water can reduce surface tension and decrease capillary forces which in turn will influence unsaturated water flow and redistribute soil moisture i e surfactant induced flow sif finally prior steady state miscible displacement experiments demonstrated that while the adsorption at solid surfaces can be rate limited the adsorption at air water interfaces can be mostly considered instantaneous under certain experimental conditions brusseau 2020 brusseau et al 2021 yet it is unknown whether the kinetics remain insignificant under dynamic changes in water saturation and air water interfacial area in vadose zone relevant conditions the aforementioned complex coupled flow and transport processes need to be represented to understand and quantify the overall impact of awia on pfas long term retention under time dependent infiltration fluxes in the vadose zone to date only a few modeling studies on pfas transport in the vadose zone have been reported shin et al 2011 2012 simulated pfoa transport in the vadose zone but did not consider awia guo et al 2020 developed a new mathematical model that incorporates a comprehensive set of processes for pfas transport and retention under transient variably saturated flow in the vadose zone the model formulations account for sif and nonlinear and rate limited adsorption at the solid water and air water interfaces numerical simulations for a model afff impacted fta site demonstrated the importance of awia on pfas retention in the vadose zone for example they showed that depending on specific conditions such as soil properties and climatic conditions the time scale for a majority of the pfos plume to reach a depth of 5 m can be several decades silva et al 2020 also reported a model that accounts for the processes discussed above kinetic adsorption was not presented and simulated pfas transport in one and two dimensions more recently zeng guo 2021 developed a three dimensional mathematical model to investigate the impact of preferential flow and sif on pfas leaching in heterogeneous vadose zones they suggested that compared to traditional contaminants the acceleration of pfas leaching due to preferential flow is further amplified by the destruction of air water interfaces resulting from greater water saturations along the preferential flow pathways additionally sif was predicted to have a relatively minor impact on both the lateral spreading and long term leaching of pfas in the vadose zone even when pfas are released at higher concentrations at afff impacted sites while the formulations of the above discussed models are well established a thorough experimental validation of the coupled nonlinear processes especially under transient flow conditions that are more relevant to field contamination sites has not been reported in the literature another critical aspect that has been minimally investigated is the relative importance of the various physicochemical processes and parameters controlling pfas retention and leaching as discussed above multiple processes affect pfas retention and their relative importance may change under different field conditions and for different pfas in addition the mathematical models require a wide range of parameters for the properties and conditions for pfas and the soil media in the vadose zone it is of great importance to identify the primary processes and critical parameters that dominantly control the long term leaching of pfas in the vadose zone the insights from which will lead to improved quantitative predictions of pfas leaching and provide practical guidance for managing and mitigating contamination risks at field sites to address the above discussed challenges 1 we use multiple experimental data sets brusseau 2020 karagunduz et al 2015 li et al 2021 lyu et al 2018 to validate the mathematical model of guo et al 2020 for representing several important processes and conditions including sif solution chemistry and nonlinear and kinetic solid phase adsorption spa and awia 2 we then employ the validated model to conduct a series of simulations to investigate and analyze the primary factors controlling the leaching and retention of pfas in the vadose zone under field conditions specifically we simulate the transport of six representative pfas at a model fta site the simulations consider a 30 year active contamination period followed by a post contamination period lasting 50 years or longer a wide range of conditions are considered including two climatic semiarid vs humid conditions two porous media sand vs soil two different solution chemistries in porewater deionized water diw vs synthetic groundwater sgw and different applied concentrations of pfas these base simulations are then followed by comprehensive parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses that examined a total of 12 parameters that may control pfas leaching in the vadose zone our analyses are guided by the following specific questions what are the primary factors controlling the timescale of pfas retention in the vadose zone how does the timescale of retention change for different pfas and what are the conditions under which awia or spa become dominant retention processes 2 methodology 2 1 mathematical model we describe the variably saturated water flow in the vadose zone using the one dimensional 1d richards equation richardson 1921

nonionic pfas that can interact more strongly with soil grain surfaces the change of contact angle can be more significant and may need to be accounted for especially at higher aqueous concentrations while contact angle measurements for non pfas surfactants exist in the literature desai et al 1992 karagunduz et al 2001 no such data have yet been reported for pfas that allows parameterization in mathematical models h 0 is parameterized as a function of water content using the soil water characteristic function proposed by van genuchten 1980 the four unknowns in eqs 1 4 h c c s 2 and c aw 2 are solved simultaneously using a fully implicit newton raphson iteration solver detailed information for the spatial and temporal discretization iteration schemes as well as the treatment of initial and boundary conditions is presented in guo et al 2020 2 2 model validation we employ three measured transport datasets reported in the literature to validate the mathematical model presented in section 2 1 based on the conditions examined in these laboratory miscible displacement experiments we focus on validating the following processes 1 sif karagunduz et al 2015 2 solution chemistry li et al 2021 and 3 different pfas input concentrations lyu et al 2018 brusseau 2020 2 2 1 sif karagunduz et al 2015 conducted a set of miscible displacement experiments to study the impact of sif on water flow and the transport of triton x 100 a non pfas surfactant the triton x 100 solution was injected under steady state conditions into five columns packed with unsaturated f70 ottawa sand the input concentration c 0 1 054 mg l was much higher than the critical micelle concentration cmc 150 mg l five different input water fluxes corresponding to five initial water contents were used resulting in different water outflow fluxes and breakthrough curves btcs for the surfactant and a non reactive solute nrs all of which were measured in the experiments the original simulations reported in karagunduz et al 2015 accounted for sif and equilibrium solid phase adsorption but adsorption at the air water interfaces was not represented it was reported that the simulations deviated from the measured experiment data at lower water saturations when awia becomes more important here we account for a set of comprehensive processes in the simulations including sif and rate limited and nonlinear spa and nonlinear awia awia was assumed to be effectively instantaneous because kinetics were determined to be of minor importance under the given experimental conditions we employ the independently determined soil hydraulic parameters and solid phase adsorption isotherm from karagunduz et al 2015 and surface tension data from janczuk et al 1995 to parameterize the model the measured surface tension σ as a function of the aqueous concentration c of the surfactant is fitted using the szyszkowski model fig s1 of supporting information si note that σ and kaw become approximately constant when the aqueous concentration exceeds the cmc we also account for the impact of kinetic spa the kinetic spa parameters are obtained by calibrating the model simulation to exp1 that has the highest water saturation for which awia would be least relevant the obtained kinetic spa parameters are then used for simulating the other four experiments because aaw as a function of water saturation sw was not measured for the f70 ottawa sand we approximate aaw sw using the dataset from a similar sand i e accusand that is well characterized in the literature e g guo et al 2020 brusseau et al 2019b the detailed input parameters for the model simulations are summarized in table s1 in si very good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental measurements we observe that a ratio ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 is needed to scale aaw for the model predictions to match the measured btcs and the required scaling ratio decreases for smaller water saturations this appears to indicate that the amount of accessible air water interfaces may depend on water saturation additionally the results show that kinetic spa has a limited impact on improving the match between the simulated and measured outflow water flux and the surfactant breakthrough curves comparisons for two of the experiments i e exp2 and exp3 are presented in fig 1 as examples the comparisons for the other three experiments and additional information for the experiments and numerical simulations are provided in section s1 1 of si the measured perturbations in the water outflow flux caused by the sif are well captured by the simulations fig 1 the outflow flux first increases due to enhanced drainage when the surfactant is applied later on the outflow flux abruptly decreases when the surfactant arrives at the outlet and then recovers as the surfactant solution reaches a steady state these behaviors are consistent with the original analysis by karagunduz et al 2015 finally outflow water flux experiences a further perturbation when the surfactant solution is replaced by clean water comparison between the btcs for the surfactants and nrs shows that the surfactant experiences significant retention resulting from adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces both of which appear to be well captured by the model simulations overall the good agreement between the simulations and measurements demonstrates that the mathematical model of guo et al 2020 is capable of representing the impact of sif on variably saturated flow and surfactant transport 2 2 2 solution chemistry to validate our model for representing the impact of solution chemistry on pfas transport we simulate the transport experiments by li et al 2021 that employed different solution chemistries in these experiments 4 6 pore volumes of pfoa solution at 1 ml min and 6 8 µg l were injected into an unsaturated sand column accusand sw 0 64 after that the injection was switched to a background electrolyte solution an nrs was also employed and measured for comparison the experiments employed six background electrolyte solutions comprising three different ionic strengths i e 1 5 10 and 30 mm and two salts i e nacl and cacl2 to examine the impact of ionic strength and cation valency mathematical modeling of these experiments was not reported in the original work we simulate the experiments using both equilibrium and kinetic adsorption models basic properties including column dimensions bulk density porosity and water saturation were reported in the source paper kd was determined from experiments reported for saturated flow conditions soil hydraulic properties and the aaw as a function of sw are obtained from measured data reported by brusseau and colleagues for accusand because the sand used here is accusand parameters for kinetic spa and kinetic awia determined for pfoa in accusand from lyu et al 2018 and brusseau 2020 are employed for the kinetic simulations see section 2 2 3 all parameters used for modeling are determined independently our simulations suggest that the simulated btcs are sensitive to the longitudinal dispersivity α l α l 0 35 cm determined from the inverse modeling of the btc for an nrs under the same unsaturated condition is employed in the simulations presented in fig 2 more simulated btcs as influenced by different α l are presented in fig s5 of si additional details for the parameters and model setup are given in section s1 2 of si comparisons between the predicted and measured btcs show that the model simulations with and without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia are close to each other fig 2 indicating that the kinetics associated with spa and awia are insignificant under the specific conditions employed in these experiments we note that because spa is much smaller than awia see the fractional retardation factors in table s2 in si the relatively small difference between the equilibrium and kinetic simulations is mainly caused by kinetic awia comparisons among the btcs corresponding to different solution chemistry also show that stronger ionic strength leads to stronger retention which is well captured by the numerical simulations similarly because spa is very small the increased retention of pfas observed at stronger ionic strengths is mainly a result of greater awia 2 2 3 different pfas input concentrations we simulate the experimental data reported in lyu et al 2018 and brusseau 2020 to validate our model for simulating pfas transport under different input concentrations to test the impact of potential nonlinear adsorption and transient flow caused by sif the original simulations presented in brusseau 2020 assumed steady state flow and did not account for sif the simulations here account for variably saturated flow and potential sif in the presence of pfas in the solution the experiments were conducted at three different input concentration for pfoa c 0 0 01 mg l 0 1 mg l and 1 mg l and four different water saturations sw 1 0 865 0 76 and 0 68 the data for an nrs is used to obtain the longitudinal dispersivity all parameters used in the simulations were determined independently thus the model simulations represent direct predictions of the experiments the list of parameters used and the setup of the numerical model are provided in section s1 3 of si comparisons between the model predictions and the experimental data are presented in fig 3 which show very good agreement for all of the five breakthrough curves covering pfoa input concentrations from 0 01 to 1 mg l the results for the nrs are presented for reference simulations assuming equilibrium spa and awia are also presented the results suggest that kinetic spa and kinetic awia have a relatively small impact on the simulated btcs for all of the pfoa experiments and the kinetics were mainly caused by kinetic spa with a minimal contribution from kinetic awia i e turning off kinetic awia has a minimal impact on the simulated btcs we note that because the elution tailing data for the presented experiments were not measured the kinetic adsorption was only evaluated based on tailing for the arrival front more rigorous evaluation of the kinetic adsorption will require the elution tailing data additionally simulations accounting for sif and nonlinear awia and spa are very similar to those without including sif and assumed linear awia and spa results not shown which indicates that the influence of sif and nonlinearity in adsorption are both minimal for the range of concentrations examined in the experiments these results are consistent with the simulation results presented in brusseau et al 2021 for pfoa pfos and genx transport in unsaturated sand overall the detailed comparisons between model simulations and measured datasets presented in sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 for miscible displacement experiments conducted under a wide range of conditions represent a comprehensive validation of the pfas specific flow and transport processes incorporated in the mathematical model introduced in section 2 1 additionally the results suggest that while kinetic spa and kinetic awia may influence the transport of surfactants and pfas their impact is of relatively small significance under the specific conditions employed in the above discussed miscible displacement experiments this is consistent with the prior studies by brusseau 2020 and brusseau et al 2021 the significance of the kinetics associated with spa and awia under vadose zone relevant conditions will be quantified and discussed in section 3 1 3 in the next section we employ the validated model to conduct detailed simulations at a model fta site to delineate the primary factors that control the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone under field relevant conditions 2 3 simulating the long term leaching and retention of pfas at an fta site 2 3 1 general description of the model fta site to focus on examining the complex physical and chemical processes for pfas transport we assume that the vadose zone of the model fta site is homogeneous and is composed of one of the two soil media that have different hydraulic and geochemical properties accusand natural quartz sand or vinton soil sandy loam we use long term rainfall and evapotranspiration data measured at two sites in arizona az and new jersey nj to represent a semi arid climate and a humid climate respectively this gives a combination of four sets of conditions two soil media combined with two climatic conditions for the base simulations we assume that regular fire training operations lasted for 30 years at the site moody and field 2000 1999 after which no pfas were released to the site i e post contamination the vadose zone is assumed to be pfas free before the site was converted for fire training based on a report by the federal aviation administration faa 2010 and the information for the volume of afff solutions used at fta sites dauchy et al 2019 moody and field 1999 2000 we estimate that 50 to 150 gallons 189 3 to 567 8 l of diluted afff solution is applied to a burning area of 385 m2 to 1 318 m2 per training session guo et al 2020 assuming that all of the released afff solutions enter the vadose zone this leads to a total infiltration of approximately 0 0458 cm afff solution per training session fire training activities are assumed to occur every 10 days with each training session lasting for 30 min which are consistent with the standard fire training practices reported in the literature e g rotander et al 2015 apex 2017 moody field 1999 2000 2 3 2 data and parameters 1 pfas properties pfas composition in commercial afff formulations varies by year of production and manufacturer houtz et al 2013 place and field 2012 for illustrative purposes we consider six pfas including three perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids pfsas i e pfbs pfhxs and pfos and three perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids pfcas i e pfpea pfoa and pftrda pfbs and pfpea are short chain and the remaining four are long chain based on the terminology proposed by buck et al 2011 in our study chain length refers specifically to the fluorinated carbon chain length these six pfas are among the representative fluorocarbon components of a commercial afff concentrate in this 1 100 diluted afff product the concentrations c 0 for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda are 1 4 0 23 7 1 0 9 100 and 0 00012 mg l respectively høisæter et al 2019 which will be employed in our simulations the molecular weight mw molar volume vm szyszkowski fitting parameters for surface tension a and b freundlich parameters for solid phase adsorption kf and n and molecular diffusivity d 0 for the six pfas are presented in table 1 the surface tension data measured in diw and sgw brusseau and van glubt 2019 campbell et al 2009 costanza et al 2019 are plotted in fig 4 a specifically the data for pfpea sgw pfoa sgw pftrda sgw and pfos sgw are from brusseau van glubt 2019 pfbs diw and pfhxs diw are from campbell et al 2009 and pfos diw are from costanza et al 2019 the sgw employed in brusseau and van glubt 2019 included na 50 mg l ca2 36 mg l mg2 25 mg l n o 3 6 mg l cl 60 mg l c o 3 2 h c o 3 133 mg l and s o 4 2 99 mg l the ph and ionic strength were 7 7 and 0 01 m respectively the awi adsorption coefficient for each compound kaw is computed based on the surface tension data and the gibbs adsorption equation fig 4 b the molecular diffusion coefficients d 0 for all compounds except for pftrda are measured values from schaefer et al 2019b d 0 for pftrda is estimated by relating it to the molar volume using the regression ln d 0 2 5623 ln v m 1 5528 schaefer et al 2019b the freundlich spa parameters kf and n for pfos in accusand and vinton soil and pfoa in accusand were reported in prior studies van glubt et al 2021 brusseau 2020 guo et al 2020 for other pfas because no measured spa isotherms are available for the two porous media we estimate kf and n as follows we assume that the nonlinear coefficient n for pfbs and pfhxs is the same as that for pfos in the same medium that is n is 0 81 for accusand and 0 77 for vinton soil similarly we assume n for pfpea and pftrda in both media is the same as that for pfoa in accusand i e n 0 87 we employ this simple estimation for n partly because the nonlinearity for solid phase adsorption was reported to be weak for a wide range of sediments guelfo higgins 2013 higgins luthy 2006 and also specifically for the two media we use brusseau et al 2019 brusseau 2020 for kf we estimate the values for the other two pfsas by scaling the kf for pfos based on the pfsa organic carbon normalized distribution coefficients koc reported in the literature brusseau 2019b higgins and luthy 2006 the kf for pfoa in the vinton soil is estimated by scaling kf for pfoa in the accusand based on the kf values for pfos in the two media similar to the pfsas the kf for the other two pfcas are then estimated by scaling kf for pfoa based on the reported pfca koc values brusseau 2019b guelfo and higgins 2013 the molar volumes vm are obtained from the pubchem database url pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov parameters for kinetic spa and kinetic awia are only available for pfoa we estimate the first order rate constants for the other pfas from that of pfoa assuming that the first order rate constants scale with the molecular diffusion coefficients for example α s p f p e a α s p f o a d 0 p f p e a d 0 p f o a and α aw p f p e a α aw p f o a d 0 p f p e a d 0 p f o a e g brusseau 2020 the estimated αs and αaw are presented in table 1 to estimate the uncertainty associated with the measured surface tension data we collect 11 data sets for pfoa in diw from the literature an et al 1996 downes et al 1995 jin et al 2005 lópez fontán et al 2005 lunkenheimer et al 2015 2017 lyu et al 2018 shinoda et al 1972 tamaki et al 1989 vecitis et al 2008 dmowski 1990 the original data and the fitted curves are presented in fig s8 a the szyszkowski equation is fitted separately to each of the datasets note that the curve using the parameters averaged from the separately fitted parameters agrees well with that fitted with all measured data see a comparison in fig s9 the computed kaw as a function of c is presented in fig s8 b the variations in these measured data may be caused by differences in the forms of pfoa e g acid vs different salt forms and the employed experimental conditions e g temperature the status of instruments or expertise of an operator there is a wide range of uncertainty in the fitted parameters for pfoa as shown in fig s8 specifically σ 0 ranges from 70 0 to 73 75 dyn cm with a mean value of 71 45 dyn cm and a coefficient of variation cv 0 0146 a ranges from 0 945 to 3 145 µmol cm3 with a mean value of 1 884 µmol cm3 and cv 0 382 b ranges from 0 187 to 0 312 with a mean value of 0 231 and cv of 0 185 the resulting maximum kaw in fig s8 b ranges from 0 13 10 3 to 0 29 10 3 cm3 cm2 with a mean value of 0 196 10 3 cm3 cm2 and cv 0 27 in our study cv σ μ where σ is the standard deviation the cvs and correlation coefficients obtained for pfoa see table 2 are then used to represent the uncertainties associated with the surface tension parameters for all pfas we assume that σ 0 a and b follow normal distributions based on the datasets we use though more measured data would be needed to further confirm this assumption 2 soil properties two porous media accusand and vinton soil are used as the base media in the present work the accusand is a commercially available natural quartz sand unimin corp which has a median grain diameter of 0 35 mm it has a total organic carbon content of 0 04 the fe mn and al oxide contents are 14 2 5 and 12 µg g respectively the vinton soil is a loamy sand collected locally in tucson arizona the hydraulic properties solid phase adsorption behavior and measured air water interfacial area as a function of water saturation for the two media are reported in guo et al 2020 and the references therein here we summarize the soil parameters in table 3 α cm 1 and n are the parameters in the van genuchten mualem empirical model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 the air water interfacial area aaw was measured by aqueous interfacial tracer experiments which was shown to represent the total hydraulically accessible air water interfacial area consisting of capillary interfaces associated with menisci between bulk air and water and film associated interfaces associated with wetting films surrounding grain surfaces additionally the aaw data used in our study also agrees well with several other awi data sets measured using low concentrations of surfactant tracers wherein sif was negligible by design brusseau et al 2020b the measured aaw was fitted to a second degree polynomial function of water saturation sw aaw x 2 sw 2 x 1 sw x 0 where x 2 x 1 and x 0 are the fitting parameters for accusand x 2 548 54 x 1 1 182 5 and x 0 633 96 while for vinton soil x 2 1 305 0 x 1 2 848 6 and x 0 1 543 6 guo et al 2020 α l is the longitudinal dispersivity cm that is approximated using the empirical function α l 83 log l 100 2 414 xu and eckstein 1995 where l cm is the apparent length scale which is set to the depth of the vadose zone in our study l 400 cm we note that the approximation employed here assumes saturated condition and hence does not account for the impact of water saturation on α l we use the vinton soil as the base porous medium and perturb its parameters for the sensitivity and uncertainty simulations in table 4 we provide the uncertainty of soil parameters described by cv and correlation coefficient that will be used for the parameter uncertainty analyses later we assume that these soil parameters follow normal or log normal distributions the cvs for the soil hydraulic parameters ln k s θs θr ln α and n were obtained from field measurements russo bouton 1992 the correlation coefficients for the majority of these parameters are measured from undisturbed soils at the field site russo bouton 1992 the cvs for kf and n are obtained from parameters measured by van glubt et al 2021 kf and n are assumed to be independent the range of uncertainty for ln α l is estimated based on a statistical study xu eckstein 1995 the bulk density ρ b exhibits a narrow range from field measurement russo bouton 1992 and is thus assumed a constant 3 precipitation and evapotranspiration we consider two climatic conditions semiarid az vs humid nj to examine the impact of climate on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone the semiarid climate is represented by the walnut gulch kendall grasslands site scott 2016 in arizona usa while the humid climate is represented by the silas little site clark 2016 in new jersey usa precipitation and evapotranspiration data for the two sites for 10 years 01 01 2005 12 31 2014 at a 30 min temporal resolution is downloaded from the ameriflux database url https ameriflux lbl gov the data are repeated every 10 years to generate multidecadal data sets the 10 year annual average precipitation is 293 mm and 1 066 mm for the two sites respectively note that our model does not account for transpiration through plants the measured evapotranspiration data were used as the potential evapotranspiration to determine the surface evaporation rate the original data at a 30 min resolution are smoothed to a 24 hour resolution and employed for the long term simulations 2 3 3 design of numerical experiments in this section we introduce the overall design of the numerical experiments which include 1 a set of base simulations that focus on examining the relative importance of several retention and transport processes and 2 a series of additional simulations that focus on analyzing the sensitivity and uncertainty of parameters that control the long term leaching and retention of pfas in the vadose zone the specific methods employed for conducting the parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also introduced 1 overview we first conduct a set of numerical experiments that employ the default parameters and conditions described in section 2 3 2 these base cases consider two soil media accusand vs vinton two climatic conditions az vs nj and six pfas pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda we then conduct additional simulations to probe the influence of different parameters and conditions on transport the additional simulations allow us 1 to analyze the impact of several factors i e soil porewater solution chemistry chain length nonlinear adsorption and kinetic adsorption on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone 2 to identify the primary parameters that control the predicted leaching behavior by performing sensitivity analysis for 12 parameters used in the simulations and 3 to conduct monte carlo simulations to analyze the uncertainties in the model predictions propagated from the uncertainty in the input parameters 2 estimating the air water interfacial area a aw for a random soil perturbations on soil parameters may introduce significant variations in a aw the a aw of a random soil may be related to the soil water characteristic curve based on the thermodynamic approach bradford et al 2015 bradford and leij 1997 leverett 1941 morrow 1970 5 a aw thermo θ 1 σ 0 θ θ s p c d θ where p c is the capillary pressure parameterized as a function of θ p c ρ w g h where ρ w is the density of water g cm3 g is the gravitational constant cm s2 for the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 p c ρ w g α s e 1 m 1 1 n g cm s2 where s e is the effective water saturation substituting s e θ θ r θ s θ r to eq 5 yields 6 a aw thermo s e θ s θ r ρ w g σ 0 α s e 1 s e 1 m 1 1 n d s e however the thermodynamic based a aw thermo was reported to significantly underestimate the tracer based a aw tracer jiang et al 2020 which has been considered to be more transport relevant lyu et al 2018 brusseau et al 2019b brusseau and guo 2021 assuming that the ratio between the thermodynamic based a aw thermo and the tracer based a aw tracer remains the same for all soils we estimate the tracer based a aw tracer for a random soil based on the thermodynamic based a aw thermo and measured tracer based a aw tracer from the vinton soil that is 7 a aw r a n d o m estimated s e ω s e a aw r a n d o m thermo s e where ω s e a aw v i n t o n tracer s e a aw v i n t o n thermo s e is the scaling ratio computed from the tracer based a aw v i n t o n tracer s e and the thermodynamic based a aw v i n t o n thermo s e for the vinton soil the integral in eq 6 can be evaluated by numerical integration because the variation of ω is relatively small for different s e we approximate it using the ratio ω 4 2 evaluated at s e 0 5 for our simulations 3 morris sensitivity analysis we employ the morris method morris 1991 for the parameter sensitivity analysis the morris method quantifies the global sensitivity using local derivatives of the model predictions in the parameter space i e only a single parameter is perturbed at a time in our sensitivity analysis we use the arrival time to the bottom of the domain to represent the speed of predicted pfas migration we define the arrival time ta for each pfas as the time when 0 1 of the total mass of this pfas has exited the bottom boundary of the domain suppose η i is the perturbed parameter η i μ i 1 c v i μ i 1 c v i where μ i denotes the mean of η i i e the original measured mean value and c v i is the estimated coefficient of variation for parameter η i we define the normalized parameter as p i η i μ i furthermore we denote ta i and ta 0 as the arrival times for the simulations with the perturbed parameter and the base case respectively and define the normalized arrival time as s i t a i t a 0 then the local sensitivity measured as elementary effects ee i has the following form 8 ee i s i p i s η i s μ i p η i p μ i the mean value of eei for all of the m perturbations performed to η i is then defined as the morris sensitivity m i 1 m k 1 m ee i k for η i where k 1 2 m is the index for different simulated perturbations for our problem specifically we denote the parameter space by η i σ 0 a b log k s θ s θ r log α n log α l kf and n where i 1 2 11 additionally the boundary condition parameter log c 0 is used to quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to the applied concentration based on laboratory measurements and field investigations see section 2 3 2 the parameters are all assumed to follow normal distributions note that this means ks α and αl follow log normal distributions the mean value μ i is the reference value measured or estimated for the original soil or pfas we conduct the sensitivity analysis for each pfas which gives a total of 6 sets of simulations in each set of simulations we conduct simulations by uniformly changing each of the 12 parameters within the designated range when one of the parameters is being perturbed the remaining parameters are fixed to their mean values the applied pfas concentration ranging from 0 1c 0 to 10c 0 is used to investigate the model predictions as influenced by the applied concentration the above perturbations are conducted for the prediction of long term leaching for all six pfas using the base case of vinton soil under nj climate 4 monte carlo simulations we employ monte carlo simulations to quantify the uncertainties in model predictions propagated from the uncertainties in the model parameters 200 combinations of randomized parameters for vinton soil and the six pfas are generated see section 2 3 2 specifically the randomly perturbed surfacial properties of 200 pfas based on the measured parameters for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda in sgw are presented in fig s10 of si these parameters i e σ 0 a and b follow normal distributions their mean values cv and correlation coefficients are provided in table 2 the corresponding randomly generated kaw as a function of aqueous concentration is presented in fig s11 of si the 200 realizations of the randomly generated soil parameters are presented in fig s12 of si these parameters i e log ks θs θr log α n aaw kf n and log αl follow normal distributions and have mean values cv and correlation coefficients reported in table 4 it is important to note that not all of the 12 parameters are independent several of them are correlated and their correlation is taken into account in our sensitivity and uncertainty analyses 1 the szyskowski parameters σ 0 a and b are correlated based on measured data for pfoa in diw see table 2 2 the soil hydraulic parameters are correlated based on field measurement for 417 undisturbed soil samples russo bouton 1992 see table 4 3 aaw is related to soil hydraulic properties using the thermodynamic based method discussed in subsection 2 above bradford et al 2015 bradford and leij 1997 leverett 1941 morrow 1970 finally the parameters for kinetic spa and awia are kept as constants in the simulations for sensitivity and uncertainty analyses because the impact of kinetic adsorption on the predicted long term pfas is relatively minor see section 3 1 3 2 3 4 setup of the numerical model we consider a 1d domain along the vertical dimension of a 4 m deep vadose zone the 1d domain is discretized using a uniform grid δz 2 cm for the newton raphson iterative solver all of the following absolute tolerances have to be met for convergence at each time step δ h 1 10 3 cm δ θ 1 10 4 cm3 cm3 and δ c 1 10 7 μmol cm3 the initial conditions are set as h z t 0 100 cm and c z t 0 0 the top boundary is represented by measured rainfall infiltration and surface evaporation during the fire training sessions an inward pfas solution lasting 30 min enters the top numerical cell the infiltration rate and applied pfas concentrations c 0 for each pfas are provided in section 2 3 1 a zero gradient condition is assigned for both water flow h z z 4 m 0 and pfas transport c z z 4 m 0 at the bottom boundary of the domain 3 results and discussion the results and analyses are organized as follows we first examine the impact of several primary factors including solution chemistry pfas chain length and nonlinear spa and awia on the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone based on the set of base simulations then we present detailed analyses on the impact of parameter sensitivity and uncertainty on long term model predictions based on the morris sensitivity and monte carlo simulations 3 1 primary factors 3 1 1 the impact of solution chemistry chain length we conduct simulations using surface tension parameters for the six pfas determined in solutions with different ionic strengths diw vs sgw to quantify the impact of solution chemistry and chain length on long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone note that while the ionic strengths vary among simulations they do not dynamically change over time in each simulation fig 5 presents the simulated spatial concentration profiles over time for six pfas under two different ionic strengths diw vs sgw the vinton soil nj climate scenario is shown as an example the results show that pfas retention in the vadose zone increases with both ionic strength and chain length comparing the simulated retention using diw vs sgw surface activities significantly enhanced retention is observed for pfhxs pfoa and pfos for instance the ta arrival time for pfhxs increases from 2 5 years for diw to 15 years for sgw similarly the ta for pfoa increases from 8 years for diw to 19 years for sgw the ta for pfos for diw is 12 years while pfos reached the bottom of the domain 64 years later for sgw it is noted that employing diw as the representative low ionic strength solution does not reflect natural soil conditions and is used to illustrate extreme differences the range of ionic strengths relevant for soil porewater will typically be less disparate and therefore the impact on pfas retention will be of lesser significance e g brusseau and van glubt 2019 lyu brusseau 2020 silva et al 2019 conversely a relatively minor increase is observed in fig 5 for the retention of pfbs pfpea and pftrda in sgw this is because the significance of spa is comparable to or greater than awia for these three pfas for example at a simulated representative aqueous concentration for pftrda in the vadose zone 6 10 7 mg l the spa is 10 times greater than the awia such that the retention of pftrda is completely dominated by spa we note that prior batch and miscible displacement experiments have shown that spa can also increase with ionic strength li et al 2021 lyu brusseau 2020 our simulations have not accounted for the impact of ionic strength on the spa due to a lack of data for the pfas and soil media considered in the present study at the same ionic strength the retention follows the same order of chain length as pfbs pfhxs pfos and pfpea pfoa pftrda the disparity in the speed of migration for pfas with different chain lengths is consistent with concentration depth profiles reported at many afff impacted fta sites baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 specifically the cited field studies showed that long chain pfas were typically the dominant compounds near the surface in the vadose zone while short chain pfas represented the majority of pfas mass at deeper depths the concentrations of long chain pfas in the soil were consistently the highest near the surface of the vadose zone and decreased exponentially along depth albeit the sites were contaminated by different sources at various periods conversely the short chain pfas were much more uniformly distributed along depth and had reached much deeper locations more quantitatively the maximum concentrations of pfos in our simulations on the order of 104 μg kg are within the range of those reported at the afff impacted fta sites 103 105 μg kg baduel et al 2017 brusseau et al 2020a casson and chiang 2018 dauchy et al 2019 one of the few studies that reported measured pftrda is that of dauchy et al 2019 who measured pfas soil concentrations for an afff impacted site that had been used as an fta for more than 30 years they observed that pftrda was only detected above the depth of 0 25 m indicating much stronger retention of pftrda in the vadose zone compared to pfoa and pfos this is in agreement with our simulated results where pftrda remains above the depth of 0 5 m even 50 years after the pfas release contamination events have ceased the direct implication of the above analysis is that unlike short chain pfas leaching of long chain pfas from the vadose zone to groundwater will likely persist for several decades or longer after the pfas release events have been stopped 3 1 2 the impact of nonlinear adsorption to examine the impact of nonlinearity in spa and awia on long term pfas retention in the vadose zone we conduct additional simulations assuming linear spa and awia and compare the results with the full process model where nonlinear spa and awia are accounted for for linear spa and awia k d and k aw for a pfas need to be computed at a given aqueous concentration for our simulations we computed k d and k aw at c c max 2 where c max is the simulated maximum aqueous concentration from the full process model for the example scenario of vinton soil nj climate the maximal concentrations for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda are c max 0 12 mg l 0 019 mg l 0 29 mg l 0 032 mg l 3 9 mg l and 0 34 ng l respectively to isolate the impact of nonlinear spa and awia we construct simulation cases involving three levels of nonlinearity 1 nonlinear spa and awia full model 2 linear awia but nonlinear spa constant k aw and 3 linear spa and linear awia constant k d k aw the results show that nonlinear spa has a notable impact on the retention of some of the pfas fig 6 this is because pfas concentrations vary greatly within the plume and over time which leads to relatively strong variations in the equivalent kd for example within the majority of the plume where c greater than 0 1 cmax the equivalent kd kfcn 1 varies from 0 07 to 0 33 cm3 g for pfbs and from 0 22 to 1 1 cm3 g for pfpea during the simulation however the impact of nonlinear spa varies among the pfas it has a stronger impact on the retention of pfbs pfpea and pftrda than on that of pfhxs pfoa and pfos because spa is comparable with or greater than awia for the former conversely nonlinearity in awia has a minimal impact for all pfas except for pfos close inspection reveals that the aqueous concentrations for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa and pftrda are all very low so that the corresponding kaw approaches the maximum kaw the kaw at c c max 2 are 2 08 10 4 5 78 10 5 5 90 10 3 5 93 10 3 and 0 146 cm3 cm2 and the maximum kaw are 2 08 10 4 5 78 10 5 5 94 10 3 5 93 10 3 and 0 146 cm3 cm2 for these five pfas the aqueous concentration of pfos is much higher than the other pfas and the nonlinearity leads to a greater variation in kaw the simulated kaw varies from 0 043 to 0 022 cm3 cm2 in the full model which is not represented adequately by the model with linear awia i e constant kaw a log scale version of fig 6 is presented in fig s6 of the si to better visualize the differences between the model simulations at lower concentrations the above analyses predicted that the impact of nonlinearity of adsorption on pfas leaching is concentration dependent to further examine the dependence of nonlinear spa and awia on concentration we conduct additional simulations for pfos at a wide range of applied concentrations including 0 001c 0 0 01c 0 0 1c 0 c 0 5c 0 and 10c 0 the results suggest that the retention decreases as the applied concentration increases the time for the peak concentration of the plume to reach a depth of 1 m is approximately 64 60 56 43 22 and 14 years for the increasing applied concentrations 0 001c 0 0 01c 0 0 1c 0 c 0 5c 0 and 10c 0 the vertical migration velocity of the pfos plume represented by the slope of the red curve in fig 7 increases rapidly as the release concentration increases for the soil media considered in the present study the spa is always smaller than awia for pfos under all applied concentrations thus the nonlinear spa does not play a major role in affecting the overall retention and leaching in the vadose zone our simulations suggest that the nonlinearity in the awia is minor for all of the pfas except for pfos that is applied at a much greater concentration than the others this is consistent with the findings reported by brusseau et al 2021 where nonlinearity in awia was estimated to be insignificant at concentrations sufficiently lower than the critical reference concentration defined as the concentration corresponding to a reduction of 2 5 in the surface tension for the simulations presented in the present study that are relevant to field conditions even though the applied concentrations can be quite high e g 100 mg l for pfos the aqueous concentrations of pfas decrease significantly well below 3 8 mg l after entering the vadose zone due to strong adsorption at the solid water and especially air water interfaces this implies that the actual porewater concentrations in the vadose zone rather than the applied concentrations of pfas need to be used when evaluating the importance of the nonlinearity of awia at the field sites when nonlinearity in awia is insignificant the awia isotherm can be simplified by using a constant k aw and there is no need to employ the szyszkowski and gibbs equations to compute the concentration dependent k aw in the model finally we note that the issue of whether air water interfacial adsorption follows the langmuir isotherm and becomes linear at low concentrations is still under debate arshadi et al 2020 schaefer et al 2019a 2020 additional data and analyses reported recently indicated that k aw approaches a constant at relatively high concentrations and remains constant at concentrations down to 1 μ g l for pfoa brusseau et al 2021 and approximately 5 10 6 m for two hydrocarbon surfactants sdbs and sds brusseau 2021 3 1 3 the impact of kinetic adsorption we examine the impact of kinetic adsorption by comparing the simulation results with or without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia the parameters for kinetic adsorption are obtained from the miscible displacement experiments in section 2 2 2 table 1 and from batch experiments conducted on pfas contaminated soils collected from a historically afff impacted site schaefer et al 2021 the parameters are reported in note 5 of table 1 the latter was suggested to have more pronounced kinetics in spa especially for the shorter chain pfas in the soils collected from the shallow vadose zone schaefer et al 2021 two soils and two climatic conditions are considered for all six pfas in the simulations note that the results of the batch experiments reported in schaefer et al 2021 suggested that kinetic spa is much stronger for the short chain than that for the long chain pfas we thus only employ the measured kinetic spa parameters for the three shorter chain pfas pfbs pfpea and pfhxs in our simulations the simulated cumulative mass discharge out of the domain with and without accounting for kinetic spa and kinetic awia is presented in fig 8 overall the difference between the simulations with and without accounting for kinetic adsorption is quite small a log scale version of fig 8 is presented in fig s7 of the si but the difference remains small even at much lower values of mass discharge this is also true for the simulations that employed the kinetic parameters from pfas contaminated soils collected from a historically afff impacted site that exhibit much stronger kinetics in spa schaefer et al 2021 these simulations suggest that the impact of kinetic spa and kinetic awia on the predicted long term pfas leaching is minimal under the field relevant conditions examined in the present study a close inspection reveals that the simulated mean porewater velocities in the field scale simulations are at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than those employed in the miscible displacement experiments in addition the retardation factor is also generally much greater in the field scale simulations due to much lower water saturations and hence stronger awia in our study we define the damköhler numbers for kinetic spa and kinetic awia as da s α s l q and da aw α aw l q where q is the mean darcy flux the fractional retardation factors contributed by spa and awia are r s ρ b θ c s c n ρ b k f c n 1 θ and r aw 1 θ c aw c k aw a aw θ we define the total retardation factor as r tot 1 r s r aw these retardation factors are spatially averaged within the plume where c 0 1 c max and during the first 30 year active contamination period the retardation factors and the damköhler numbers computed for the simulations presented in fig 8 are summarized in table 5 for the same kinetic spa and kinetic awia parameters the damköhler numbers computed for the field scale simulations are several orders of magnitude greater than those computed from the miscible displacement experiments see tables s2 and s3 the da s computed from the simulations that employed the kinetic spa parameters determined from the historically afff impacted soil samples are smaller due to the stronger kinetics but they are still mostly greater than 10 see da s in the parentheses for the three shorter chain pfas while the da s for pfhxs can be smaller than 10 the spa is much less important than awia for pfhxs such that the kinetic spa plays a minor role in influencing the overall leaching in contrast the miscible displacement experiments have much greater porewater velocity and smaller retardation factors the damköhler numbers for those experiments which are generally much smaller are reported in tables s2 and s3 in si in addition awia is also less significant due to the much smaller air water interfacial area at greater water saturations taking the experiment with pfoa input at c 0 1 mg l and sw 0 76 as an example section 2 2 3 the porewater velocity is 837 5 cm d note that the mean value is as low as 0 5 11 3 cm d under the simulated field conditions and the fractional retardation factors are r s 0 38 and r aw 0 57 the resulting damköhler numbers da s and da aw are 9 27 and 7 70 respectively the above analyses imply that it may be reasonable to assume equilibrium adsorption when the focus is on predicting pfas leaching at long time scales which would allow for simplifying the governing equations and parameters for the numerical simulations however we caution that the analyses presented here are based on the kinetic parameters obtained from a limited number of miscible displacement experiments conducted in a sand media and field contaminated soil samples from only one historical afff impacted site the importance of kinetic adsorption under a wider range of conditions for different kinds of field contaminated sites and different pfas needs further investigation 3 2 parameter sensitivity and uncertainty 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis in this section we conduct morris sensitivity analysis to determine the importance of each parameter in fig 9 we group the perturbed model parameters into five relatively independent categories 1 solid phase adsorption n and kf 2 hydraulic properties log k s θ s θ r log α and n 3 dispersion log α l 4 interfacial properties σ 0 a and b and 5 applied concentration log c 0 the morris sensitivity m provides the relative sensitivity of the normalized arrival time ta ta 0 to the five groups of parameters the specific rank of the most sensitive parameters differs among different pfas the top five dominant parameters for each pfas are provided below for pfos and pfhxs they are log α log α l θ s a and b or n for pfoa they are n log α log α l θ s and a for pfbs they are n log α θ s log α l and σ 0 for pfpea they are n log α l kf log α and log c 0 for pftrda they are n kf log α log c 0 and θ s a close inspection of fig 9 reveals that the rank of the most sensitive parameters is controlled by the relative importance of spa and awia which depends on the chain length and the applied concentration when spa is more important e g pfpea and pftrda the model predictions are most sensitive to changes in the spa parameters especially n due to nonlinear spa conversely when awia is dominant i e for those longer chain pfas at relatively greater concentrations e g pfhxs pfoa and pfos the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to aaw log α and interfacial properties σ 0 a and b for pfbs spa and awia are comparable e g 30 vs 43 of mass are partitioned to solid water and air water interfaces for the vinton nj scenario thus the model predictions are sensitive to both the spa and awia finally the model predictions for most of the pfas are sensitive to dispersivity which is expected because dispersivity controls the overall spreading of the plume 3 2 2 parameter uncertainty analysis in this section 11 of the 12 parameters i e σ 0 a b log k s θ s θ r log α n log α l kf and n are randomly perturbed within the uncertainty ranges provided in section 2 3 2 for each pfas there are 200 realizations based on the case with vinton soil and under nj climate fig 10 presents the cumulative mass discharge out of the domain from the monte carlo simulations the results indicate that the leaching rate and the associated range of uncertainty vary strongly among pfas with different chain lengths the short chain pfas pfbs and pfpea arrive at the bottom of the domain early and the majority of the mass is removed shortly after the contamination was stopped even with randomized parameters the variation among the different realizations is relatively insignificant this is because spa and awia are generally weak for the short chain pfas and the mass discharge is mainly controlled by hydrologic conditions such as rainfall intensity conversely the breakthroughs of the long chain pfas are much later and the mass discharge can last several decades during the post contamination period however the variation among the realizations is also much greater the variation is so wide that the realizations for the long chain pfas with the fastest leaching are even comparable to those of the short chain pfas for example the majority of the mass is removed 1 2 years after the pfas application has ceased for the pfos realizations with the most rapid leaching for pftrda it is 170 years we note that these fastest leaching cases are well beyond the 95 confidence interval ci the arrival times within the 95 cis are reported in the following paragraph another way to examine the uncertainty in the model predictions is to analyze the statistical distribution of the arrival time ta among the monte carlo realizations which are shown in fig 11 the computed arrival times for the base cases are also presented i e 1 7 years 2 4 years 12 years 17 years 63 years and 1 783 years for pfbs pfpea pfhxs pfoa pfos and pftrda respectively interestingly ta among the monte carlo realizations appear to follow log normal distributions for all pfas the range of uncertainties among the pfas with different chain lengths are consistent with those observed in fig 10 i e the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas for example the 95 ci of ta is 497 14 571 years for pftrda 10 414 years for pfos 5 87 years for pfoa and 6 112 years for pfhxs conversely the 95 ci of ta ranges from 0 7 to 4 5 years for pfbs 0 9 to 6 years for pfpea the wide range of uncertainties shown in the model predictions resulting from the parameter uncertainties implies that it is important to quantify the uncertainty when limited information and parameters are available at contamination sites especially for the long chain pfas the distribution of the arrival times computed from the monte carlo simulations also illustrates that depending on the specific parameters employed in the simulations the arrival time for a certain pfas can vary by one or two orders of magnitude even within the 95 ci this again suggests that it is critical to quantify the uncertainty associated with any numerical predictions especially when the input parameters are uncertain the log normal distributions of the arrival times ta may be caused by the parameters that follow log normal distributions i e α α l and k s based on the morris sensitivity analysis in section 3 2 1 we speculate that the parameter α is likely most responsible for the log normal distributions of ta for the long chain pfas for which awia dominates the retention except for pftrda for the short chain pfas and pftrda both the parameters α and α l are primary controls on pfas leaching 3 3 assumptions and limitations in this section we summarize the assumptions employed in our study and discuss their potential impact on pfas leaching in the vadose zone the model simulations have not accounted for interactions e g competitive adsorption among pfas hydrocarbon surfactants and co solvents in afff change of contact angle between porewater and soil grain surfaces the dependence of spa on solution chemistry the transformation of pfas precursors and soil heterogeneity we discuss each of these assumptions below and identify their impact on the long term retention of pfas in the vadose zone interactions among different pfas can potentially deviate their behavior from what would be observed as a single pfas an example would be competitive adsorption at solid water and air water interfaces guelfo and higgins 2013 show that competitive spa is minor for multiple pfas below the concentration of 1 mg l for the pfas and porous media tested our simulated maximum c is lower than 3 8 mg l for pfos for all scenarios and is much lower for other pfas the actual aqueous concentrations are relatively low because most of the mass is adsorbed either at solid water and air water interfaces the presence of pfas mixtures can also influence surface tension and awia though limited data are available in the literature vecitis et al 2008 reported surface tension data for a 1 1 mixture of pfos and pfoa and brusseau van glubt 2019 presented surface tension data for a mixture of pfoa and pftrda with ratios of 8 2 and 2 8 more comprehensive surface tension data for multiple pfas mixtures were recently reported by silva et al 2021 all of the studies showed that the pfas with greater surface activity dominates the overall surface activity of the mixture our model simulations do not consider interactions among pfas mixtures and other hydrocarbon surfactants or co solvents the impact of such interactions on pfas retention and leaching will depend upon the nature and magnitude of the interactions huang et al 2021 ji et al 2021 interaction between soil grain surfaces and chemical components i e pfas hydrocarbon surfactants or co solvents can also increase the contact angle of porewater at the soil grain surfaces especially for the cationic zwitterionic or nonionic surfactants to date no experimental data for the dependence of contact angle on the aqueous concentration of pfas have been reported measured data for other surfactants are also limited desai et al 1992 the change of contact angle by pfas may be quantified when experimental data become available similarly the impact of solution chemistry on spa is not considered in our model simulations presented in section 3 1 1 due to a lack of measured data the impact of solution chemistry on pfas spa will depend on the properties of the pfas and the soil pfas precursors are important components of many afff concentrates e g houtz et al 2013 and they can be transformed through either biotic or abiotic reactions to pfsas and pfcas in the environment e g avendano and liu 2015 we have not accounted for these transformations in the present work but our modeling framework can be extended to include transformations of precursors when detailed reaction pathways and kinetics become available in the future the non fickian transport caused by immobile water observed in several prior experimental and numerical studies for non pfas solutes under water unsaturated conditions e g de gennes 1983 hasan et al 2020 padilla et al 1999 raoof hassanizadeh 2013 stults et al 2021 has not been considered in our study this immobile water caused non fickian behavior could be an important factor that can influence long term pfas leaching especially at relatively lower water saturation finally soil heterogeneity such as soil layering macropores and fractures may strongly influence pfas leaching in the vadose zone we considered vadose zones represented by homogeneous soils to focus on analyzing the physical and chemical processes influencing retention future investigations are needed to fully delineate the impact of soil heterogeneity on pfas leaching which may strongly influence the long term leaching as suggested by zeng guo 2021 4 conclusion we present a modeling study that focuses on analyzing the primary processes and parameters controlling the long term pfas leaching and retention in the vadose zone we first use multiple experimental data sets to validate a mathematical model that represents variably saturated flow surfactant induced flow advection dispersion as well as nonlinear and rate limited adsorption of pfas at the solid water and air water interfaces then we employ the validated mathematical model to investigate the primary factors and parameters controlling the long term leaching and retention behavior by conducting simulations and parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses under a wide range of conditions our specific conclusions are summarized below 1 the long term retention and leaching of pfas in the vadose zone are primarily controlled by chain length soil properties solution chemistry and the applied concentration due to enhanced spa and awia pfas retention in the vadose zone increases for longer chain pfas higher ionic strengths and lower applied concentrations 2 parameter sensitivity analysis reveals that the parameters to which the model simulations are most sensitive differ among different pfas the rank of these parameters i e relative sensitivity is mainly controlled by the relative importance of spa and awia when spa is more important the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters for spa especially the freundlich exponent n due to its nonlinearity conversely when awia is dominant e g for long chain pfas at relatively greater concentrations e g pfhxs pfoa and pfos the model predictions are most sensitive to parameters related to the air water interfacial area and pfas interfacial properties dispersivity is a primary parameter for all pfas as it controls the overall spreading of the plume 3 parameter uncertainty analysis suggests that the model simulations involve a wide range of uncertainties due to uncertainties propagated from the model parameters the time for pfas to break through i e arrival time appears to follow log normal distributions for all pfas however the uncertainty range is much greater for longer chain pfas compared to that of their shorter chain counterparts this suggests that it is important to quantify uncertainties for the simulated pfas leaching when limited site information and parameters are available at contamination sites especially for the long chain pfas 4 nonlinearity in awia is insignificant under the field conditions examined in the present study and may be simplified for practical application at many legacy pfas contamination sites because the afff impacted fta sites are among the contamination sites that have the highest pfas concentrations assuming linear awia is expected to be even more appropriate for other contamination sites with lower pfas concentrations such as agricultural lands that received pfas contaminated biosolids and irrigation water 5 both kinetic spa and kinetic awia are generally insignificant under the field conditions examined in the present study we note that the importance of kinetic spa and kinetic awia was only determined based on kinetic parameters obtained from a limited number of miscible displacement experiments conducted in a sand media and field contaminated soil samples from only one historical afff impacted site therefore the general importance of kinetic spa and kinetic awia under a wider range of conditions for different kinds of field contaminated sites and different pfas needs further investigation credit authorship contribution statement jicai zeng methodology investigation software formal analysis visualization data curation writing original draft

3887,we suggest a quantitative predictive approach based on meta modeling techniques for long term forecasting in hydrology we apply our scalable methodological framework to a representative

the probabilistic behavior of the qoi at selected sensitive locations keywords meta modeling polynomial chaos expansion nitrate contamination climate change groundwater 1 introduction long term forecasting in hydrology is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables that plagues every effort to model flow and transport processes the use of probabilistic approaches is necessary to provide predictions with an appropriate level of confidence but is hampered in practical applications by the high computational cost typically associated with high fidelity models such as groundwater flow and transport models e g tartakovsky 2013 here we handle this problem by focusing on the effect of climate change on nitrate contamination of groundwater groundwater plays a critical role in freshwater supply and supporting surface water bodies and groundwater dependent ecosystems at the global scale an increasing number of countries is provided with regulations that require risk assessment as a basis for the planning of a program of measures to meet the prescribed environmental objectives for groundwater bodies at the river basin scale and minimize possible hazards for human health and the environment at the regulatory level it is also recognizable the increasing awareness on the importance of an integrated approach of analysis being water availability the result of meeting quantitative and qualitative targets at the same time e g ep 2000 ep 2006 among the different sources of concern about groundwater in the long term impacts of climate change which remain largely unknown are receiving more attention as demonstrated by several recent studies on this topic e g amanambu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 a major issue is the prediction of the combined effect of climate change overexploitation and contamination processes on future groundwater availability e g alam et al 2019 xu and su 2019 wu et al 2020 mendieta mendoza et al 2021 by affecting the hydrological cycle climate change impacts transport phenomena as well especially those related to diffuse contamination processes among these processes nitrate contamination of groundwater is a worldwide problem closely linked to the extensive use of fertilizers in agriculture e g arauzo 2017 groundwater nitrate response to climate change is challenging to predict given the uncertainty in long term projections of precipitation and temperature and their impact on nitrate load and leaching some studies suggest that nitrate leaching may increase under future climate scenarios as a result of changes in soil processes and agricultural productivity e g stuart et al 2011 nevertheless these changes may be balanced by improved agricultural practices and a decrease in the infiltration rate due to the temperature rise here we propose a scalable methodological framework able to handle the uncertainty associated with future climate scenarios and to provide an affordable way for long term forecasting we exemplify our approach by means of a case study related to climate change s impact on groundwater nitrate concentration we first build a long term climate scenario referred to the 30 years 2061 2090 by defining a set of random variables that characterize changes in i the natural recharge to groundwater ii the baseflow of rivers connected to groundwater and iii the rate of nitrate leaching propagation of the uncertainty from these random variables to the quantity of interest qoi i e the long term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration relies on a physically based flow and transport model pbm of the case study the high number of simulations required to obtain a full probabilistic description of the qoi is practically prohibitive on the pbm for computational reasons to avoid a tradeoff between an adequate number of simulations and an accurate conceptualization of the physical processes we develop a meta modeling strategy that drastically reduces the runs on the pbm to an optimum set of simulations used to define the meta models among the families of meta models we resort to the polynomial chaos expansion pce technique e g wiener 1938 ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 that already demonstrated to provide accurate approximations of groundwater flow and transport processes in several recent studies e g oladyshkin et al 2012 ciriello et al 2015 rajabi et al 2015 ciriello et al 2019 ciriello and barros 2020 the pce meta models provide a polynomial approximation of the qoi in the random variable space thus allowing to simulate a high number of climate scenarios each scenario is given by a combination of values of the selected random variables at a negligible computational cost as such we can i analyze the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the qoi over the study area ii perform a global sensitivity analysis gsa to understand the relative influence on the qoi of each random variable related to the future climate scenario and iii compute the pdf of the qoi at selected locations in the study area through monte carlo simulations mcs with this study we extend the use of meta modeling specifically of pce to approximate a long term forecasting of a qoi under the uncertainty of the future climate scenario and using a representative case study we also provide a view to better understanding the possible impact of climate change on nitrate contamination of groundwater the paper is organized as follow section 2 describes the study area and the pbm and provides a collection and processing of climate data while section 3 is devoted to the methodology section 4 reports results and discussion and a set of conclusions is given in section 5 2 data collection and modeling this section is devoted to the description of the case study used to exemplify our approach 2 1 study area the trebbia alluvial fan is located in the northwestern part of emilia romagna region of italy and is characterized by a phreatic and a confined aquifer fig 1 the phreatic aquifer has the greatest extension at the regional scale and a good renewal capacity due to the presence of highly permeable deposits close to the apennines margin moving northwards the lower confined aquifer progressively develops below the phreatic one which recharges it indirectly rer 2015 rer 2009 the trebbia alluvial fan has a key role in regional water resources management it is associated with widespread water withdrawals for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes land use transform is almost negligible over the study area the agricultural area is predominant on the territory a slight increase of urban soil use is detected which is in line with the estimated trend of population growth atersir 2015 the environmental status of the aquifers is currently good from a quantitative point of view but an increasing concern is related to nitrate concentration especially in the phreatic compartment rer 2015 as a consequence well fields for civil use are being redistributed currently civil pumping wells are concentrated in a well field close to the piacenza municipality hereinafter well field 1 these wells derive water from the trebbia alluvial fan with a flow rate extraction of 350 l s on average due to nitrate concentration water withdrawals have been reduced from this well field of 150 l s and a new well field in mortizza hereinafter well field 2 has been activated and derives about 200 l s from the aquifer originated by the po river alluvial plain a second well field in calendasco hereinafter well field 3 that will derive from the trebbia alluvial fan about 200 l s is expected to be activated in 2030 with the consequent complete shutdown of the well field in piacenza fig 1 2 2 physically based model we realize a physically based model pbm in modflow harbaugh 1990 harbaugh 2005 and mt3d tonkin et al 2016 to mimic flow and nitrate transport in the trebbia alluvial fan the model is built upon hydrogeological data provided by the environmental protection agency of emilia romagna region arpae rer 2007 rer 2009 the model is calibrated over 10 years from 2002 to 2011 and then validated in 2012 2019 against data collected at the observation wells during calibration values of the hydraulic conductivity and storativity have been modified in order to optimize the performance of the regional scale estimate provided by arpae over the study area the model which includes also the adjacent groundwater bodies to account for lateral flow exchanges with the trebbia alluvial fan is discretized into 1516 cells of 1 km2 fig 1 and vertically into five layers of variable thickness see table 1 and fig 2 the first three layers correspond to the phreatic aquifer in the first one water level fluctuations are appreciated while the fourth and fifth to the confined one each layer is set in modflow to simulate a convertible aquifer phreatic confined before the calibration a transient flow and transport model is run for 40 years from 1962 to 2002 in order to obtain initial conditions for the hydraulic head and nitrate concentration in 2002 as for the flow boundary conditions the hydraulic head is imposed along the contour defined by the po river which is simulated with the general head boundary package while a no flow condition is set along the apennines margin the model is run with a 1 day time step and yearly time series of pumping rates and recharge as well as the boundary condition at the po river are averaged over four stress periods spi i 1 4 per year that mimic the different seasons the average baseflow value of rivers in the study area namely tidone trebbia and nure is simulated in modflow using the stream package that allows mimicking surface water groundwater interaction prudic 1989 the analysis of the flow duration curves suggests that q 274 and q 355 are able to mimic the annual baseflow of the rivers in particular we use a flow value equal to q 274 in autumn and winter on average in 2002 2019 0 12 4 83 and 0 79 m3 s for tidone trebbia and nure respectively and q 355 in spring and summer on average in 2002 2019 0 04 1 55 and 0 14 m3 s respectively the hydraulic connection among layers as well as with the rivers is governed by the vertical conductance derived by the thickness and vertical permeability of the layers themselves the vertical permeability is assumed to be a hundredth of the horizontal one pumping wells are modeled in modflow as analytic elements and are divided into civil agricultural and industrial uses on average in 2002 2011 the civil use weighs about 34 of total water withdrawals in the area against the 20 and 46 of the industrial and agricultural uses respectively the 10 of the overall yearly pumping equal about to 87 mm3 year is concentrated in sp1 january march while 25 54 and 11 are registered during sp2 april june sp3 july september and sp4 october december respectively the overall yearly pumping increases in 2012 2019 till about 97 mm3 year while sensibly preserving the same percentages per use and sp about 72 of water withdrawals are concentrated in the phreatic aquifer 32 in the 2nd layer in the confined aquifer withdrawals are divided in half among the 4th and 5th layers natural recharge is estimated as a result of a simplified water balance equation in which evapotranspiration is computed following hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1982 the crop coefficient k c is defined for each sp based on the analysis of the agricultural soil use in the study area similarly to pumping rates the recharge exhibits a significant variability during the year in 2002 2011 the overall yearly recharge is on average about 108 mm3 year with the 62 concentrated in sp4 and the 27 in sp1 in sp2 and sp4 the 9 and 2 are registered respectively with the most of the years associated with negligible values during these seasons the total recharge decreases in 2012 2019 to about 88 mm3 year on average mainly due to a significant reduction during sp4 of almost 20 mm3 we employ the mt3d package tonkin et al 2016 to mimic nitrate transport in the aquifers nitrates enter groundwater by leaching while we neglect the contribution from the rivers we use linear correlations as derived from experimental studies available for the study area at each sp to estimate the leaching rate as a function of the recharge and soil texture based on these correlations the leaching rate increases with the recharge weakly in case of fine textured soils and progressively more for coarse textured soils similar to flow predictions validation of the transport model is performed with available data in 2012 2019 fig 3 shows values of nitrate concentration computed through the pbm at the second phreatic aquifer and fourth confined aquifer layers for the year 2019 we indicate this concentration as c n 0 x being used as an initial condition to model the future scenario statistics of c n 0 x are summarized in table 2 2 3 climate scenario a probabilistic scenario is built here to apply the methodological framework described in section 3 five random variables are defined to mimic changes in the natural recharge to groundwater the baseflow of the main rivers and the rate of nitrate leaching this scenario can t be considered exhaustive of all the possible implications of climate change at the selected case study but is aimed at capturing the principal effects and exemplifying our approach we use climate projections provided by four regional climate models for the 30 year 2061 2090 according to the rcp 8 5 emission scenario ispra 2015 climate change projections are applied to the monthly average precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures registered in the study area over the 30 year 1971 2000 we model precipitation and temperature changes as normal random variables with a mean and a standard deviation correspondent to the sample mean and standard deviation of climate projections provided by the selected regional models to reduce the random dimension of the problem we develop monte carlo simulations mcs to propagate uncertainty in changes of precipitation and temperature towards the recharge of each sp through the simplified water balance equation suggested by hargreaves and samani 1982 as a result we define two new random variables i e future recharges related to the 30 year 2061 2090 associated with sp1 and sp4 hereinafter r 1 r 4 respectively given that the recharge in the other two sp is sensibly negligible we set r 2 r 3 0 when modeling the future scenario the histogram of the mcs results not shown here reveals the two new random variables to be approximately normal table 3 on average comparing with 2002 2011 the effect of climate change determines a redistribution of the natural recharge over the year so that the reduction during spring and summer corresponds to an increase of about 33 and 3 in winter and autumn respectively as for the baseflow of rivers in the study area available data over the 50 year 1971 2019 show a negative trend of both q 274 and q 355 values the general decrease of flow in the po river basin is caused by the increase in temperatures the maximum yearly temperature increased by about 2 5 c in the 30 years 1975 2006 and the contemporary decrease in precipitations the average yearly precipitation decreased by about 20 in the same years 35 if we focus on the average precipitation in january august here we assume to extrapolate trends of both q 274 and q 355 till the 30 year 2061 2090 and we model q 274 and q 355 referred to the years 2002 2019 and 2061 2090 as normal random variables in 2002 2019 we resort to available data while for 2061 2090 we use the extrapolated data by uncertainty propagation we come up with two random variables in terms of percentage reduction coefficients of baseflow values through the following equations rc q 274 1 q 274 2061 2090 q 274 2002 2019 and rc q 355 1 q 355 2061 2090 q 355 2002 2019 rc q 274 and rc q 355 exhibit a normal behavior in turn see table 3 as for the po river modeled as a head boundary condition the decrease in baseflow is transformed into a reduction of the hydrometric level finally we consider the effect of climate change on the rate of nitrate leaching to groundwater predictions provided by different studies show that the leaching rate may increase under future climate scenarios due to the impact on soil processes and agricultural productivity and as a consequence on the agricultural nitrate source term in turn e g stuart et al 2011 however these changes may be balanced by improved agricultural practices for this reason we introduce a random variable representing a percentage variation coefficient namely vc rnl to be applied to the rate of nitrate leaching we assume vc rnl to be normally distributed with zero mean and a standard deviation of 10 to account for both the possibility of a decreasing or increasing in the rate of nitrate leaching in 2061 2090 with respect to 2002 2019 see table 3 as for pumping rates we assume a business as usual scenario in which industrial and agricultural water demands as well as the irrigated areas remain constant civil water withdrawals are increased in 2061 2090 by about 1 5 mm3 year only due to the redistribution of pumping wells fields from 2020 which brings to an additional 50 l s of water extractions see section 2 1 3 methodology the generalized polynomial chaos expansion pce technique is typically applied to approximate the response surface of a physically based model pbm in the random variable space wiener 1938 ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 this allows to obtain a surrogate model i e a polynomial relationship explaining the model response of interest as a function of the uncertain inputs properly represented as independent random variables e g for more details ciriello et al 2019 different input distributions can be accommodated within the generalized pce framework according to the wiener askey scheme xiu and karniadakis 2002 in our case study the pce is obtained against the pbm described in section 2 2 using a non intrusive regression based approach sudret 2008 the probabilistic collocation method webster et al 1996 is used to select the optimum set of regression points in the random variable space see table 3 the quantity of interest qoi is the nitrate concentration within the study area i e at a given cell of the pbm hereinafter c n x as predicted by the pbm for the future scenario defined in section 2 3 the approximation of the qoi provided by the pce is as follows 1 c n x i 0 p 1 s i x ψ i p p m q m q where p is the vector of standard normal random variables related to those collected in table 3 through an isoprobabilistic transform sudret 2008 m dim p ψ i are multivariate hermite polynomials which constitute an orthonormal basis with respect to the joint pdf of p q is the maximum degree of the expansion here we select a 2nd order expansion i e q 2 and coefficients s i are the deterministic coordinates of the spectral decomposition xiu and karniadakis 2002 moments of the qoi are estimated as follows see e g sudret 2008 2 m c n x s 0 x v c n x i 1 p 1 s i 2 x ψ i 2 p similarly computation of global sensitivity metrics such as the sobol indices sobol 2001 consists in analytical post processing of the pce coefficients see for more details sudret 2008 thus drastically reducing the associated computational cost in addition the use of the surrogate 1 sensibly accelerates mcs for risk analysis purposes thus allowing for the estimate of the probabilistic behavior of the qoi 4 results and discussion this section is devoted to the discussion of the results obtained by employing our methodological framework note that these results are influenced by distributions selected for the five random variables defined in section 2 3 we first compute the total sensitivity indices of sobol hereinafter tsi for the qoi c n x see section 3 fig 4 depicts the results for the 2nd and 4th layers that are associated with the phreatic and confined aquifers respectively our findings reveal the primary role played by the uncertainty associated with r 4 in explaining the variance of the qoi i e v c n x throughout the study area uncertainty in r 1 and vc rnl affect less v c n x r 1 exerts influence especially in the south eastern corner of the study area close to the apennines margin where highly permeable deposits are present thus emphasizing the role of variation in the recharge vc rnl is conversely relevant on the plain in the north of the study area where agricultural activities are concentrated conversely a negligible influence is played by the uncertainty in rc q 274 and rc q 355 though interaction between rivers and groundwater is relevant in the study area this result reveals that the degree of variability estimated for the reduction coefficients of river baseflow does not impact significantly v c n x this is probably linked to the fact that nitrates enter into the system only by leaching because we consider negligible nitrate contribution from rivers as such the impact of the variability of river baseflow is only associated with a potential dilution effect that is not comparable under the selected scenario with the influence of the other uncertain quantities that directly impact nitrate leaching table 4 provides values of tsi averaged within the phreatic and confined aquifer boundaries the sum of tsi is slightly higher than unity thus indicating negligible second order effects i e sensitivity indices associated with random variable interactions are not significant the first two moments of the qoi i e m c n x and v c n x computed with 2 are depicted for the 2nd and 4th layers in fig 5 considering m c n x fig 5a b as expected very low concentrations are registered in the proximity of the northern and southern model boundaries the po river and appennines margin respectively and the trebbia river the rivers provide a dilution effect while close to the appennines nitrate leaching is negligible the 50 of the concentration values are between 20 and 50 mg l in the 2nd layer with the 14 above 50 mg l this percentage decreases to the 39 in the 4th layer with the 1 above 50 mg l as for v c n x fig 5c d in the 2nd layer values show a wide range of variation and spatial differences trace those observed for m c n x conversely in the 4th layer v c n x depicts lower and comparable values especially in the center of the study area where the trebbia alluvial fan is located comparing fig 5a b with fig 3a b provides an indication on the variation of nitrate concentration occurring in the study area from the initial condition c n 0 x to the average future scenario m c n x to facilitate this comparison fig 6 shows the difference between these two values our results predict a generalized increase of nitrate concentration over the study area both for the 2nd and 4th layers with large zones affected by a rise 10 mg l 31 of values for the 2nd layer and 25 for the 4th layer the percentages of the study area where a no positive variation of nitrate concentration is registered are 36 and 21 for the 2nd and 4th layers respectively in general the dilution capacity around the main rivers shows a decrease at the same time the rise in concentration values propagates also towards the southern zone near the appennines margin where agriculture is not practiced focusing on the trebbia alluvial fan a positive variation of nitrate concentration involves about the 85 of values in both the phreatic and confined aquifers with a rise 10 mg l associated with the 38 and 21 of values for the former and latter respectively fig 6 if in 2019 the 53 of concentration values in the phreatic aquifer are below 20 mg l this percentage decreases to 36 in 2061 2090 similarly in the confined aquifer the same percentage goes from the 87 in 2019 to 64 in 2061 2090 with more detail spatial statistics of m c n x and v c n x for the phreatic and confined aquifers are collected in table 5 while a boxplot of c n 0 x and m c n x values is shown in fig 7 comparing table 3 and table 5 it is observed that the spatial average of nitrate concentration in the phreatic aquifer increases from μ c n 0 x 17 8 mg l to μ m c n x 24 4 mg l the spatial variability is expected to slightly increase as well with the 90 of values below 35 9 mg l in 2019 and 41 7 mg l in 2016 2090 as for the confined aquifer the spatial average of nitrate concentration goes from μ c n 0 x 11 1 mg l to μ m c n x 16 5 mg l the spatial variability remain sensibly constant with the 90 of values below 21 7 mg l in 2019 and 25 9 mg l in 2016 2090 spatial statistics of v c n x table 5 confirm what we observe by analyzing the map of variance of the overall study area fig 5c d in the phreatic aquifer the variance is sensibly higher being μ v c n x 48 9 instead of 14 7 as for the confined one where also σ v c n x is low on the opposite in the phreatic aquifer v c n x exhibits a significant spatial variability with higher values on the left side of the trebbia river as a summary of these results fig 7a b reveal the central tendency and the 25th and 75th percentiles of c n 0 x and m c n x within the phreatic and confined aquifers respectively finally we focus on the sensitive locations interested by the presence of the civil well fields on average well field locations are also associated with an increase in nitrate concentration at the 2nd layer passing from c n 0 x to m c n x an increase of 7 1 mg l 2 9 mg l and 18 4 mg l are expected at well fields 1 3 respectively while at the 4th layer we predict an increase of 2 6 mg l 0 3 mg l and 9 9 mg l at well fields 1 3 respectively the major increase of nitrate concentration at well field 3 is considered related to water withdrawals activated in 2030 with the contemporary complete shutdown of well field 1 see section 2 1 we then perform mcs on eq 1 to compute the pdf of c n as depicted in fig 8 the full description of the probabilistic behavior of the qoi as a result of the uncertainty associated with climate scenario variables allows quantifying the risk to exceed a threshold value for nitrate concentration that regulations set at 50 mg l fig 8a depicts the pdfs at the selected locations for the 2nd layer and shows that the new well fields i e well fields 2 and 3 are associated with lower nitrate concentrations under the future scenario if compared to those predicted at well field 1 the same happens when the 4th layer is considered as depicted in fig 8b thus supporting the redistribution of civil water withdrawals see section 2 1 in particular at well field 2 the probabilities of exceeding 10 mg l and 5 mg l are sensibly null for the 2nd and 4th layer respectively when considering well field 3 values are more disperse and nitrate concentration is higher but the probabilities of exceeding 40 mg l and 20 mg l are sensibly null for the 2nd and 4th layer respectively overall our results indicate that a possible redistribution of the natural recharge over the year due to climate change with an increase during the winter and autumn seasons with a contemporary decrease of the river baseflow is able to produce higher values of nitrate concentration both in the shallow and deep aquifer this increase may be exacerbated by changes in soil processes and agricultural productivity under future climate conditions thus asking for an improvement of agricultural practices and sustainable use of groundwater resources 5 conclusions we propose a scalable methodological framework based on polynomial chaos meta models to handle the uncertainty associated with long term forecasting in hydrology while preserving an accurate description of the physical processes at the same time we test this method against a case study related to the effect of climate change on nitrate concentration for a representative groundwater body in emilia romagna region of italy we build a probabilistic climate scenario by defining five random variables to mimic changes in the natural recharge to groundwater the baseflow of the main rivers and the rate of nitrate leaching through a limited number of simulations performed on a physically based model pbm that mimic subsurface flow and transport in the study area we extrapolate the behavior of future groundwater nitrate concentration we perform time consuming analysis such as global sensitivity analysis gsa to quantify and characterize the variability of the qoi and we compute its moments over the study area in addition the full probabilistic description of the qoi is derived at selected sensitive locations to account for the exceedance probability of threshold concentration values set by the regulations all the results would be computationally prohibitive to obtain if all the simulations were performed on the pbm as such we believe that the meta modeling strategy we suggested is promising in this

3887,we suggest a quantitative predictive approach based on meta modeling techniques for long term forecasting in hydrology we apply our scalable methodological framework to a representative groundwater body in emilia romagna region of italy to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on groundwater nitrate concentration the approach allows to i handle the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables ii preserve an accurate description of flow and transport processes and iii drastically accelerate computationally intensive simulations at a time a long term climate scenario i e referred to the 30 years 2061 2090 is developed for the study area by considering changes in the natural recharge to groundwater the baseflow of the main rivers and the rate of nitrate leaching global sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the relative influence of these factors on the quantity of interest qoi i e the long term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration our analysis enables also us to compute the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the qoi over the study area and to perform monte carlo simulations to fully characterize the probabilistic behavior of the qoi at selected sensitive locations keywords meta modeling polynomial chaos expansion nitrate contamination climate change groundwater 1 introduction long term forecasting in hydrology is challenging due to the uncertainty associated with the projection of climate variables that plagues every effort to model flow and transport processes the use of probabilistic approaches is necessary to provide predictions with an appropriate level of confidence but is hampered in practical applications by the high computational cost typically associated with high fidelity models such as groundwater flow and transport models e g tartakovsky 2013 here we handle this problem by focusing on the effect of climate change on nitrate contamination of groundwater groundwater plays a critical role in freshwater supply and supporting surface water bodies and groundwater dependent ecosystems at the global scale an increasing number of countries is provided with regulations that require risk assessment as a basis for the planning of a program of measures to meet the prescribed environmental objectives for groundwater bodies at the river basin scale and minimize possible hazards for human health and the environment at the regulatory level it is also recognizable the increasing awareness on the importance of an integrated approach of analysis being water availability the result of meeting quantitative and qualitative targets at the same time e g ep 2000 ep 2006 among the different sources of concern about groundwater in the long term impacts of climate change which remain largely unknown are receiving more attention as demonstrated by several recent studies on this topic e g amanambu et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 a major issue is the prediction of the combined effect of climate change overexploitation and contamination processes on future groundwater availability e g alam et al 2019 xu and su 2019 wu et al 2020 mendieta mendoza et al 2021 by affecting the hydrological cycle climate change impacts transport phenomena as well especially those related to diffuse contamination processes among these processes nitrate contamination of groundwater is a worldwide problem closely linked to the extensive use of fertilizers in agriculture e g arauzo 2017 groundwater nitrate response to climate change is challenging to predict given the uncertainty in long term projections of precipitation and temperature and their impact on nitrate load and leaching some studies suggest that nitrate leaching may increase under future climate scenarios as a result of changes in soil processes and agricultural productivity e g stuart et al 2011 nevertheless these changes may be balanced by improved agricultural practices and a decrease in the infiltration rate due to the temperature rise here we propose a scalable methodological framework able to handle the uncertainty associated with future climate scenarios and to provide an affordable way for long term forecasting we exemplify our approach by means of a case study related to climate change s impact on groundwater nitrate concentration we first build a long term climate scenario referred to the 30 years 2061 2090 by defining a set of random variables that characterize changes in i the natural recharge to groundwater ii the baseflow of rivers connected to groundwater and iii the rate of nitrate leaching propagation of the uncertainty from these random variables to the quantity of interest qoi i e the long term prediction of groundwater nitrate concentration relies on a physically based flow and transport model pbm of the case study the high number of simulations required to obtain a full probabilistic description of the qoi is practically prohibitive on the pbm for computational reasons to avoid a tradeoff between an adequate number of simulations and an accurate conceptualization of the physical processes we develop a meta modeling strategy that drastically reduces the runs on the pbm to an optimum set of simulations used to define the meta models among the families of meta models we resort to the polynomial chaos expansion pce technique e g wiener 1938 ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 that already demonstrated to provide accurate approximations of groundwater flow and transport processes in several recent studies e g oladyshkin et al 2012 ciriello et al 2015 rajabi et al 2015 ciriello et al 2019 ciriello and barros 2020 the pce meta models provide a polynomial approximation of the qoi in the random variable space thus allowing to simulate a high number of climate scenarios each scenario is given by a combination of values of the selected random variables at a negligible computational cost as such we can i analyze the spatial statistics and variability of the moments of the qoi over the study area ii perform a global sensitivity analysis gsa to understand the relative influence on the qoi of each random variable related to the future climate scenario and iii compute the pdf of the qoi at selected locations in the study area through monte carlo simulations mcs with this study we extend the use of meta modeling specifically of pce to approximate a long term forecasting of a qoi under the uncertainty of the future climate scenario and using a representative case study we also provide a view to better understanding the possible impact of climate change on nitrate contamination of groundwater the paper is organized as follow section 2 describes the study area and the pbm and provides a collection and processing of climate data while section 3 is devoted to the methodology section 4 reports results and discussion and a set of conclusions is given in section 5 2 data collection and modeling this section is devoted to the description of the case study used to exemplify our approach 2 1 study area the trebbia alluvial fan is located in the northwestern part of emilia romagna region of italy and is characterized by a phreatic and a confined aquifer fig 1 the phreatic aquifer has the greatest extension at the regional scale and a good renewal capacity due to the presence of highly permeable deposits close to the apennines margin moving northwards the lower confined aquifer progressively develops below the phreatic one which recharges it indirectly rer 2015 rer 2009 the trebbia alluvial fan has a key role in regional water resources management it is associated with widespread water withdrawals for drinking agricultural and industrial purposes land use transform is almost negligible over the study area the agricultural area is predominant on the territory a slight increase of urban soil use is detected which is in line with the estimated trend of population growth atersir 2015 the environmental status of the aquifers is currently good from a quantitative point of view but an increasing concern is related to nitrate concentration especially in the phreatic compartment rer 2015 as a consequence well fields for civil use are being redistributed currently civil pumping wells are concentrated in a well field close to the piacenza municipality hereinafter well field 1 these wells derive water from the trebbia alluvial fan with a flow rate extraction of 350 l s on average due to nitrate concentration water withdrawals have been reduced from this well field of 150 l s and a new well field in mortizza hereinafter well field 2 has been activated and derives about 200 l s from the aquifer originated by the po river alluvial plain a second well field in calendasco hereinafter well field 3 that will derive from the trebbia alluvial fan about 200 l s is expected to be activated in 2030 with the consequent complete shutdown of the well field in piacenza fig 1 2 2 physically based model we realize a physically based model pbm in modflow harbaugh 1990 harbaugh 2005 and mt3d tonkin et al 2016 to mimic flow and nitrate transport in the trebbia alluvial fan the model is built upon hydrogeological data provided by the environmental protection agency of emilia romagna region arpae rer 2007 rer 2009 the model is calibrated over 10 years from 2002 to 2011 and then validated in 2012 2019 against data collected at the observation wells during calibration values of the hydraulic conductivity and storativity have been modified in order to optimize the performance of the regional scale estimate provided by arpae over the study area the model which includes also the adjacent groundwater bodies to account for lateral flow exchanges with the trebbia alluvial fan is discretized into 1516 cells of 1 km2 fig 1 and vertically into five layers of variable thickness see table 1 and fig 2 the first three layers correspond to the phreatic aquifer in the first one water level fluctuations are appreciated while the fourth and fifth to the confined one each layer is set in modflow to simulate a convertible aquifer phreatic confined before the calibration a transient flow and transport model is run for 40 years from 1962 to 2002 in order to obtain initial conditions for the hydraulic head and nitrate concentration in 2002 as for the flow boundary conditions the hydraulic head is imposed along the contour defined by the po river which is simulated with the general head boundary package while a no flow condition is set along the apennines margin the model is run with a 1 day time step and yearly time series of pumping rates and recharge as well as the boundary condition at the po river are averaged over four stress periods spi i 1 4 per year that mimic the different seasons the average baseflow value of rivers in the study area namely tidone trebbia and nure is simulated in modflow using the stream package that allows mimicking surface water groundwater interaction prudic 1989 the analysis of the flow duration curves suggests that q 274 and q 355 are able to mimic the annual baseflow of the rivers in particular we use a flow value equal to q 274 in autumn and winter on average in 2002 2019 0 12 4 83 and 0 79 m3 s for tidone trebbia and nure respectively and q 355 in spring and summer on average in 2002 2019 0 04 1 55 and 0 14 m3 s respectively the hydraulic connection among layers as well as with the rivers is governed by the vertical conductance derived by the thickness and vertical permeability of the layers themselves the vertical permeability is assumed to be a hundredth of the horizontal one pumping wells are modeled in modflow as analytic elements and are divided into civil agricultural and industrial uses on average in 2002 2011 the civil use weighs about 34 of total water withdrawals in the area against the 20 and 46 of the industrial and agricultural uses respectively the 10 of the overall yearly pumping equal about to 87 mm3 year is concentrated in sp1 january march while 25 54 and 11 are registered during sp2 april june sp3 july september and sp4 october december respectively the overall yearly pumping increases in 2012 2019 till about 97 mm3 year while sensibly preserving the same percentages per use and sp about 72 of water withdrawals are concentrated in the phreatic aquifer 32 in the 2nd layer in the confined aquifer withdrawals are divided in half among the 4th and 5th layers natural recharge is estimated as a result of a simplified water balance equation in which evapotranspiration is computed following hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1982 the crop coefficient k c is defined for each sp based on the analysis of the agricultural soil use in the study area similarly to pumping rates the recharge exhibits a significant variability during the year in 2002 2011 the overall yearly recharge is on average about 108 mm3 year with the 62 concentrated in sp4 and the 27 in sp1 in sp2 and sp4 the 9 and 2 are registered respectively with the most of the years associated with negligible values during these seasons the total recharge decreases in 2012 2019 to about 88 mm3 year on average mainly due to a significant reduction during sp4 of almost 20 mm3 we employ the mt3d package tonkin et al 2016 to mimic nitrate transport in the aquifers nitrates enter groundwater by leaching while we neglect the contribution from the rivers we use linear correlations as derived from experimental studies available for the study area at each sp to estimate the leaching rate as a function of the recharge and soil texture based on these correlations the leaching rate increases with the recharge weakly in case of fine textured soils and progressively more for coarse textured soils similar to flow predictions validation of the transport model is performed with available data in 2012 2019 fig 3 shows values of nitrate concentration computed through the pbm at the second phreatic aquifer and fourth confined aquifer layers for the year 2019 we indicate this concentration as c n 0 x being used as an initial condition to model the future scenario statistics of c n 0 x are summarized in table 2 2 3 climate scenario a probabilistic scenario is built here to apply the methodological framework described in section 3 five random variables are defined to mimic changes in the natural recharge to groundwater the baseflow of the main rivers and the rate of nitrate leaching this scenario can t be considered exhaustive of all the possible implications of climate change at the selected case study but is aimed at capturing the principal effects and exemplifying our approach we use climate projections provided by four regional climate models for the 30 year 2061 2090 according to the rcp 8 5 emission scenario ispra 2015 climate change projections are applied to the monthly average precipitation minimum and maximum temperatures registered in the study area over the 30 year 1971 2000 we model precipitation and temperature changes as normal random variables with a mean and a standard deviation correspondent to the sample mean and standard deviation of climate projections provided by the selected regional models to reduce the random dimension of the problem we develop monte carlo simulations mcs to propagate uncertainty in changes of precipitation and temperature towards the recharge of each sp through the simplified water balance equation suggested by hargreaves and samani 1982 as a result we define two new random variables i e future recharges related to the 30 year 2061 2090 associated with sp1 and sp4 hereinafter r 1 r 4 respectively given that the recharge in the other two sp is sensibly negligible we set r 2 r 3 0 when modeling the future scenario the histogram of the mcs results not shown here reveals the two new random variables to be approximately normal table 3 on average comparing with 2002 2011 the effect of climate change determines a redistribution of the natural recharge over the year so that the reduction during spring and summer corresponds to an increase of about 33 and 3 in winter and autumn respectively as for the baseflow of rivers in the study area available data over the 50 year 1971 2019 show a negative trend of both q 274 and q 355 values the general decrease of flow in the po river basin is caused by the increase in temperatures the maximum yearly temperature increased by about 2 5 c in the 30 years 1975 2006 and the contemporary decrease in precipitations the average yearly precipitation decreased by about 20 in the same years 35 if we focus on the average precipitation in january august here we assume to extrapolate trends of both q 274 and q 355 till the 30 year 2061 2090 and we model q 274 and q 355 referred to the years 2002 2019 and 2061 2090 as normal random variables in 2002 2019 we resort to available data while for 2061 2090 we use the extrapolated data by uncertainty propagation we come up with two random variables in terms of percentage reduction coefficients of baseflow values through the following equations rc q 274 1 q 274 2061 2090 q 274 2002 2019 and rc q 355 1 q 355 2061 2090 q 355 2002 2019 rc q 274 and rc q 355 exhibit a normal behavior in turn see table 3 as for the po river modeled as a head boundary condition the decrease in baseflow is transformed into a reduction of the hydrometric level finally we consider the effect of climate change on the rate of nitrate leaching to groundwater predictions provided by different studies show that the leaching rate may increase under future climate scenarios due to the impact on soil processes and agricultural productivity and as a consequence on the agricultural nitrate source term in turn e g stuart et al 2011 however these changes may be balanced by improved agricultural practices for this reason we introduce a random variable representing a percentage variation coefficient namely vc rnl to be applied to the rate of nitrate leaching we assume vc rnl to be normally distributed with zero mean and a standard deviation of 10 to account for both the possibility of a decreasing or increasing in the rate of nitrate leaching in 2061 2090 with respect to 2002 2019 see table 3 as for pumping rates we assume a business as usual scenario in which industrial and agricultural water demands as well as the irrigated areas remain constant civil water withdrawals are increased in 2061 2090 by about 1 5 mm3 year only due to the redistribution of pumping wells fields from 2020 which brings to an additional 50 l s of water extractions see section 2 1 3 methodology the generalized polynomial chaos expansion pce technique is typically applied to approximate the response surface of a physically based model pbm in the random variable space wiener 1938 ghanem and spanos 1991 xiu and karniadakis 2002 this allows to obtain a surrogate model i e a polynomial relationship explaining the model response of interest as a function of the uncertain inputs properly represented as independent random variables e g for more details ciriello et al 2019 different input distributions can be accommodated within the generalized pce framework according to the wiener askey scheme xiu and karniadakis 2002 in our case study the pce is obtained against the pbm described in section 2 2 using a non intrusive regression based approach sudret 2008 the probabilistic collocation method webster et al 1996 is used to select the optimum set of regression points in the random variable space see table 3 the quantity of interest qoi is the nitrate concentration within the study area i e at a given cell of the pbm hereinafter c n x as predicted by the pbm for the future scenario defined in section 2 3 the approximation of the qoi provided by the pce is as follows 1 c n x i 0 p 1 s i x ψ i p p m q m q where p is the vector of standard normal random variables related to those collected in table 3 through an isoprobabilistic transform sudret 2008 m dim p ψ i are multivariate hermite polynomials which constitute an orthonormal basis with respect to the joint pdf of p q is the maximum degree of the expansion here we select a 2nd order expansion i e q 2 and coefficients s i are the deterministic coordinates of the spectral decomposition xiu and karniadakis 2002 moments of the qoi are estimated as follows see e g sudret 2008 2 m c n x s 0 x v c n x i 1 p 1 s i 2 x ψ i 2 p similarly computation of global sensitivity metrics such as the sobol indices sobol 2001 consists in analytical post processing of the pce coefficients see for more details sudret 2008 thus drastically reducing the associated computational cost in addition the use of the surrogate 1 sensibly accelerates mcs for risk analysis purposes thus allowing for the estimate of the probabilistic behavior of the qoi 4 results and discussion this section is devoted to the discussion of the results obtained by employing our methodological framework note that these results are influenced by distributions selected for the five random variables defined in section 2 3 we first compute the total sensitivity indices of sobol hereinafter tsi for the qoi c n x see section 3 fig 4 depicts the results for the 2nd and 4th layers that are associated with the phreatic and confined aquifers respectively our findings reveal the primary role played by the uncertainty associated with r 4 in explaining the variance of the qoi i e v c n x throughout the study area uncertainty in r 1 and vc rnl affect less v c n x r 1 exerts influence especially in the south eastern corner of the study area close to the apennines margin where highly permeable deposits are present thus emphasizing the role of variation in the recharge vc rnl is conversely relevant on the plain in the north of the study area where agricultural activities are concentrated conversely a negligible influence is played by the uncertainty in rc q 274 and rc q 355 though interaction between rivers and groundwater is relevant in the study area this result reveals that the degree of variability estimated for the reduction coefficients of river baseflow does not impact significantly v c n x this is probably linked to the fact that nitrates enter into the system only by leaching because we consider negligible nitrate contribution from rivers as such the impact of the variability of river baseflow is only associated with a potential dilution effect that is not comparable under the selected scenario with the influence of the other uncertain quantities that directly impact nitrate leaching table 4 provides values of tsi averaged within the phreatic and confined aquifer boundaries the sum of tsi is slightly higher than unity thus indicating negligible second order effects i e sensitivity indices associated with random variable interactions are not significant the first two moments of the qoi i e m c n x and v c n x computed with 2 are depicted for the 2nd and 4th layers in fig 5 considering m c n x fig 5a b as expected very low concentrations are registered in the proximity of the northern and southern model boundaries the po river and appennines margin respectively and the trebbia river the rivers provide a dilution effect while close to the appennines nitrate leaching is negligible the 50 of the concentration values are between 20 and 50 mg l in the 2nd layer with the 14 above 50 mg l this percentage decreases to the 39 in the 4th layer with the 1 above 50 mg l as for v c n x fig 5c d in the 2nd layer values show a wide range of variation and spatial differences trace those observed for m c n x conversely in the 4th layer v c n x depicts lower and comparable values especially in the center of the study area where the trebbia alluvial fan is located comparing fig 5a b with fig 3a b provides an indication on the variation of nitrate concentration occurring in the study area from the initial condition c n 0 x to the average future scenario m c n x to facilitate this comparison fig 6 shows the difference between these two values our results predict a generalized increase of nitrate concentration over the study area both for the 2nd and 4th layers with large zones affected by a rise 10 mg l 31 of values for the 2nd layer and 25 for the 4th layer the percentages of the study area where a no positive variation of nitrate concentration is registered are 36 and 21 for the 2nd and 4th layers respectively in general the dilution capacity around the main rivers shows a decrease at the same time the rise in concentration values propagates also towards the southern zone near the appennines margin where agriculture is not practiced focusing on the trebbia alluvial fan a positive variation of nitrate concentration involves about the 85 of values in both the phreatic and confined aquifers with a rise 10 mg l associated with the 38 and 21 of values for the former and latter respectively fig 6 if in 2019 the 53 of concentration values in the phreatic aquifer are below 20 mg l this percentage decreases to 36 in 2061 2090 similarly in the confined aquifer the same percentage goes from the 87 in 2019 to 64 in 2061 2090 with more detail spatial statistics of m c n x and v c n x for the phreatic and confined aquifers are collected in table 5 while a boxplot of c n 0 x and m c n x values is shown in fig 7 comparing table 3 and table 5 it is observed that the spatial average of nitrate concentration in the phreatic aquifer increases from μ c n 0 x 17 8 mg l to μ m c n x 24 4 mg l the spatial variability is expected to slightly increase as well with the 90 of values below 35 9 mg l in 2019 and 41 7 mg l in 2016 2090 as for the confined aquifer the spatial average of nitrate concentration goes from μ c n 0 x 11 1 mg l to μ m c n x 16 5 mg l the spatial variability remain sensibly constant with the 90 of values below 21 7 mg l in 2019 and 25 9 mg l in 2016 2090 spatial statistics of v c n x table 5 confirm what we observe by analyzing the map of variance of the overall study area fig 5c d in the phreatic aquifer the variance is sensibly higher being μ v c n x 48 9 instead of 14 7 as for the confined one where also σ v c n x is low on the opposite in the phreatic aquifer v c n x exhibits a significant spatial variability with higher values on the left side of the trebbia river as a summary of these results fig 7a b reveal the central tendency and the 25th and 75th percentiles of c n 0 x and m c n x within the phreatic and confined aquifers respectively finally we focus on the sensitive locations interested by the presence of the civil well fields on average well field locations are also associated with an increase in nitrate concentration at the 2nd layer passing from c n 0 x to m c n x an increase of 7 1 mg l 2 9 mg l and 18 4 mg l are expected at well fields 1 3 respectively while at the 4th layer we predict an increase of 2 6 mg l 0 3 mg l and 9 9 mg l at well fields 1 3 respectively the major increase of nitrate concentration at well field 3 is considered related to water withdrawals activated in 2030 with the contemporary complete shutdown of well field 1 see section 2 1 we then perform mcs on eq 1 to compute the pdf of c n as depicted in fig 8 the full description of the probabilistic behavior of the qoi as a result of the uncertainty associated with climate scenario variables allows quantifying the risk to exceed a threshold value for nitrate concentration that regulations set at 50 mg l fig 8a depicts the pdfs at the selected locations for the 2nd layer and shows that the new well fields i e well fields 2 and 3 are associated with lower nitrate concentrations under the future scenario if compared to those predicted at well field 1 the same happens when the 4th layer is considered as depicted in fig 8b thus supporting the redistribution of civil water withdrawals see section 2 1 in particular at well field 2 the probabilities of exceeding 10 mg l and 5 mg l are sensibly null for the 2nd and 4th layer respectively when considering well field 3 values are more disperse and nitrate concentration is higher but the probabilities of exceeding 40 mg l and 20 mg l are sensibly null for the 2nd and 4th layer respectively overall our results indicate that a possible redistribution of the natural recharge over the year due to climate change with an increase during the winter and autumn seasons with a contemporary decrease of the river baseflow is able to produce higher values of nitrate concentration both in the shallow and deep aquifer this increase may be exacerbated by changes in soil processes and agricultural productivity under future climate conditions thus asking for an improvement of agricultural practices and sustainable use of groundwater resources 5 conclusions we propose a scalable methodological framework based on polynomial chaos meta models to handle the uncertainty associated with long term forecasting in hydrology while preserving an accurate description of the physical processes at the same time we test this method against a case study related to the effect of climate change on nitrate concentration for a representative groundwater body in emilia romagna region of italy we build a probabilistic climate scenario by defining five random variables to mimic changes in the natural recharge to groundwater the baseflow of the main rivers and the rate of nitrate leaching through a limited number of simulations performed on a physically based model pbm that mimic subsurface flow and transport in the study area we extrapolate the behavior of future groundwater nitrate concentration we perform time consuming analysis such as global sensitivity analysis gsa to quantify and characterize the variability of the qoi and we compute its moments over the study area in addition the full probabilistic description of the qoi is derived at selected sensitive locations to account for the exceedance probability of threshold concentration values set by the regulations all the results would be computationally prohibitive to obtain if all the simulations were performed on the pbm as such we believe that the meta modeling strategy we suggested is promising in this

basin scales this study aims to develop a methodological framework to generate hybrid precipitation datasets based on the model performance of streamflow simulations that are spatially representative

wfdei augmented by climatic research unit wfdei cru and global precipitation climatology centre wfdei gpcc north american regional reanalysis narr and canadian precipitation analysis capa were included as candidates in this study results indicate that the generation of a hybrid dataset based on hydrological evaluation was useful for improving h lsm modelling skills hybrid datasets showed a similar or better model performance compared to that of the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually performed better downstream and at the basin outlet when multiple products are combined model performance can be further enhanced by considering seasonality with respect to the hydrological regime of the river basin this study demonstrates the usefulness of hybrid datasets in a large scale river basin with low climate station network density keywords precipitation combination precipitation datasets hydrological modelling large scale basins canada 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important climate input forcing variable for driving hydrologic land surface models h lsms with the increasing sophistication of distributed hydrological modelling the demand for better and more reliable gridded precipitation estimates at finer spatial and temporal resolutions continues to grow however it is argued that precipitation is the most difficult variable to estimate not only because of its spatiotemporal heterogeneity herold et al 2016 stephens et al 2010 but also its changing characteristics in a warming climate trenberth et al 2003 obtaining reliable precipitation measurements with accurate spatiotemporal representation remains a challenging task for improved hydrological simulations and predictions this study aims to address this issue by proposing a framework that combines multiple existing precipitation products and assessing the usefulness of the combined precipitation dataset for hydrological modelling there are three fundamental methods for estimating precipitation michaelides et al 2009 1 ground observations including rain gauges and radar networks 2 satellite remote sensing and 3 numerical retrospective analysis models these methods strengths and weaknesses are well documented by numerous studies e g beck et al 2017a chen et al 2019 hazra et al 2019 maggioni and massari 2018 sun et al 2018 wong et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2010 given the limitations of each measurement the calls for combining information from gauges radars satellites and models are increasing ebert et al 2007 as a result products that merge precipitation estimates from different sources have emerged over the last decades e g beck et al 2017a huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 mesinger et al 2006 sheffield et al 2006 weedon et al 2014 however when evaluating the multi source precipitation datasets against ground observations and assessing their impacts on hydrological simulations researchers often conclude that different precipitation products have variable accuracy and distinct hydrological utility over different regions in different seasons hazra et al 2019 jiang et al 2012 moazami et al 2016 to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimation for hydrological applications the idea of generating a hybrid dataset by combining existing precipitation products has attracted considerable interest in recent years various combination methods have been proposed and generally can be classified into two approaches the first approach generates the hybrid dataset by evaluating the individual products against the climate stations assigning weights rankings for each product based on error statistics and assessing the performance of the hybrid dataset through a hydrological model for instance beck et al 2017a combined information from gauge satellite and reanalysis data by weighting different satellite and reanalysis based products using 3 day correlation coefficients and the dataset was validated using a conceptual hydrological model hbv at a global scale similarly eum and gupta 2019 generated a hybrid dataset by ranking various precipitation products based on their comparative performances using five metrics and the performance of the hybrid dataset was then compared to that of these individual products through the hydrological model vic in the athabasca river basin canada alternatively other studies have explored various techniques of data fusion algorithm in assigning weights for individual products including the nonparametric statistical method e g baez villanueva et al 2020 bhuiyan et al 2018 bayesian methods e g ma et al 2018a ma et al 2018b qi et al 2018 verdin et al 2015 geospatial estimation e g li et al 2015 shi et al 2017 xie and xiong 2011 and among others regardless of the mathematical theory these algorithms were designed to remove biases in the precipitation estimates and sometimes to blend the bias corrected estimates with climate stations to further reduce the random error their results indicated that the hybrid dataset was able to perform better in streamflow simulations with respect to the individual precipitation products the second approach generates the hybrid dataset by assigning different weights for each individual product based on minimizing the errors between the simulated and the observed hydrological variables yilmaz et al 2010 used the downhill simplex method to estimate the relative weights of different precipitation products at each time step by minimizing the land surface flux errors in the noah lsm over the red arkansas river basin us more recently using oklahoma us as a test site hazra et al 2019 proposed an optimal combination of weights for three different types of precipitation product at each grid point by focusing on minimizing the errors in the surface soil moisture and maximizing the correlation between the simulated and observed soil moisture their studies showed that the hybrid dataset improved model simulation skills better than did the individual precipitation products despite the advantages of the hybrid dataset over the individual precipitation products each combination approach faces some limitations that might restrict its usage and subsequently the usefulness of the hybrid dataset for hydrological modelling the first approach directly evaluates the dataset against the precipitation gauge observations that are usually regarded as ground truth however the robustness of this approach highly depends on the density of the climate station network regardless of the advancements in meteorological monitoring networks over the past few decades network density across the world remains poor kidd et al 2017 this is especially true in high latitude regions such as canada where the precipitation gauge stations are sparsely distributed usually 500 700 km apart in northern areas north of 60 n and over mountainous regions wang and lin 2015 meanwhile the frequent addition and subtraction of precipitation gauge stations not only affects the spatial coverage of the existing station network but also the availability of long term precipitation measurements mekis and hogg 1999 metcalfe et al 1997 rapaic et al 2015 wang et al 2017 while the hybrid dataset generated using the second approach is able to provide better hydrological simulations the dataset does not necessarily have the true precipitation information because its generation is based on optimized weights from error minimization of hydrological variables and the dataset is not validated against the precipitation gauge stations in addition regardless of the approach previous studies e g beck et al 2017b behrangi et al 2011 essou et al 2016 eum and gupta 2019 ma et al 2018b often evaluated the performance of precipitation products using lumped or conceptual hydrological models at basin outlets for large scale river basins however the best model performance at basin outlets does not usually show the same or similar high performance in internal gauge stations as a result more attention should be paid to the internal spatial heterogeneity of the river basin characteristics and the use of distributed physically based hydrological models mazzoleni et al 2019 to address the limitations of each approach the objective of this study is to develop a methodological framework that combines multiple precipitation products based on evaluation against not only precipitation gauge stations but also streamflow stations for improving the h lsm skills it is essential to identify the strengths of the existing precipitation products in terms of hydrological simulations rather than comparing them only with inadequate precipitation gauge observations streamflow stations are used to compensate for the limited spatial representativeness of precipitation gauge stations point measurement because streamflow at a gauge represents the integrated response of the whole catchment locations of streamflow stations can potentially cover areas where precipitation gauge stations are non existent and streamflow data are more readily available moreover compared to other water balance components the uncertainties of streamflow are relatively small and are found to be 5 10 under normal conditions hamilton and moore 2012 herschy 1999 mcmillan et al 2012 although estimates in rivers subject to icing could be 15 45 under the worst conditions shiklomanov et al 2006 the hypothesis of the combination method in this study shifts away from the idea of merging multiple existing products via some statistical techniques to generate one optimal dataset that is applicable for the areas of interest to the idea of identifying existing products that are locally performing best at lower level sub basin scale based on the physical interpretation of streamflow response to precipitation this hypothesis is tested over the saskatchewan river basin canada where a mosaic of landscapes exists and more precipitation gauge and streamflow stations can be found than in northern canada the successful application of the framework in this river basin could build the foundation and confidence for applying the combination method to river basins in the north sections 2 and 3 briefly describe the study area and precipitation and streamflow data respectively section 4 provides a brief description of the h lsm used in this study while section 5 describes the proposed methodological framework sections 6 and 7 present the results of the combined precipitation dataset and discussion of the evaluation on hydrological simulations respectively section 8 summarizes the research and offers concluding remarks on the usefulness of this combination method for hydrological applications 2 study area the saskatchewan river basin saskrb is located in western canada 98 118 w and 48 56 n and encompasses portions of the canadian provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba and a small portion of the us state of montana fig 1 its total drainage area is 406 000 km2 the source of the saskrb originates on the eastern slope of the canadian rockies in alberta and its two main tributaries are the south and north saskatchewan rivers both rivers flow east and northeast through the saskatchewan prairies to form the saskatchewan river flowing through the saskatchewan river delta and draining into lake winnipeg in manitoba according to the standard drainage area classification brooks et al 2002 pearse et al 1985 the two tributary river systems are subdivided into nine sub basins of the bow red deer battle upper north central north lower north upper south oldman and a small watershed draining from montana us lower south and eastern saskatchewan rivers the nine sub basins can be further subdivided into 79 sub sub basins the saskrb presents a complex system characterized by hydrologically distinct regions which include the rocky mountains on the far western side boreal forest in the north and the prairies in the remaining parts of the basin the topography of the basin varies from 218 to 3487 m above sea level according to the national ecological framework for canada ecological stratification working group 1996 marshall et al 1999 the saskrb consists of four ecozones montane cordillera prairie boreal plain and boreal shield covering 6 58 33 and 3 of the basin area respectively based on the köppen climate classification in general the saskrb climate is classified as cold semi arid and humid over the prairies and as a cool and humid continental climate over the remaining parts with a long cold winter and a short warm summer the mean annual precipitation ranges from 601 to 800 mm in the montane cordillera to 201 600 mm in the prairie and boreal ecozones ecological stratification working group 1996 most of the precipitation comes as rainfall between april and august and snowfall occurs in winter between october and april much of the annual runoff is generated from snowmelt in early spring from the prairies and in summer from the mountains pomeroy et al 2005 3 data 3 1 precipitation gauge stations due to the lack of an adjusted daily gridded precipitation product in canada this study used station precipitation extracted from the latest version version 2019 of the adjusted daily rainfall and snowfall adjdlyrs dataset wang et al 2017 of the national climate data archive of environment and climate change canada eccc this dataset is available from the canadian open data portal https open canada ca data en dataset d8616c52 a812 44ad 8754 7bcc0d8de305 the adjdlyrs dataset accounts for different measurement issues and has been corrected for gauge undercatch and evaporation due to wind effect and for gauge specific wetting loss mekis and hogg 1999 mekis and vincent 2011 as a result the total adjustments were more than 25 of the total annual precipitation in northern canada and 10 15 in most of southern canada wang et al 2017 these adjusted values are considered the best estimates of actual precipitation and thus are used as the reference for all gridded precipitation product evaluations there are 424 stations across the saskrb because each station has different time spans and each precipitation product has different temporal coverage the overlapping period between january 1 2002 and december 31 2010 was selected for analysis for this period only 194 out of 424 stations were available and any of the 194 stations where the percentage of missing values exceeded 20 in the time series were removed this resulted in 53 stations for evaluation see fig 2 a for locations and table a1 for basic information 3 2 gridded precipitation products different types of gridded precipitation products including satellite derived and model reanalysis products are increasing available for hydrological applications the potential of satellite precipitation products spps were not considered in this study mainly because 1 the spps are known for their difficulties in identifying solid precipitation estimating snow and rain on snow are often poorly quantified tian et al 2014 2 the spps are not able to capture large scale weather systems well during winter seasons which represent the dominant source of precipitation in remote northern regions north of 60 n and cold regions like our study area beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b and 3 owing to complex topography and large weather and climate variability the spps are shown not to perform well in high mountain regions such as the canadian rockies where the source of the saskrb originates maggioni and massari 2018 conversely since model reanalysis data are the primary source and only choice in remote northern regions this study focused on the reanalysis based multiple source precipitation products that have complete coverage of canada with a minimum of sub daily temporal and 0 5 50 km spatial resolutions as well as complete data for the study period 2002 2010 as a result five precipitation products were chosen for assessment these products are summarized in table 1 a brief description is provided below and more details are available in wong et al 2017 the terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university has created a global dataset of 3 hourly meteorological data at a 1 0 spatial resolution 120 km from 1948 to 2000 sheffield et al 2006 this product hereafter called princeton combined the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis with a set of different global observation based data princeton has been updated and this study used version 2 at 0 5 at 3 hourly time steps for driving the h lsm the european union water and global change watch forcing data methodology applied to the era interim wfdei was developed to produce datasets of sub daily 3 hourly and daily meteorological data with global coverage at a 0 5 spatial resolution 50 km from 1979 to 2012 weedon et al 2014 wfdei has been updated to provide datasets up to 2016 this product is similar to princeton in that the data were derived from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis interim product and combined with the climate research unit cru monthly data and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly variables thus wfdei has two sets of precipitation totals generated by using either cru or gpcc the current study used both sets of data for brevity they are referred to as wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc respectively the north american regional reanalysis narr was generated to provide datasets of 3 hourly meteorological data for the north american domain at a 32 km 0 3 spatial resolution covering the period 1979 to 2015 mesinger et al 2006 narr combined the ncep department of energy ncep doe reanalysis with the ncep regional eta model the noah land surface model and various additional data sources note that for canada the assimilation of station observations was discontinued in 2003 the canadian precipitation analysis capa was developed to provide a dataset of 6 hourly precipitation accumulations over north america at a 15 km spatial resolution from 2002 onwards mahfouf et al 2007 for canada the product was generated using an optimum interpolation technique in which the initial guess from the regional global environmental multiscale gem model was updated by the rain gauge measurements capa has updated its statistical interpolation method increased its spatial resolution to 10 km and assimilated precipitation estimates from the canadian weather radar network and us radars near the border fortin et al 2015 fortin et al 2018 3 3 streamflow stations the daily streamflow data were obtained from the hydat database of the national water data archive of the water survey of canada https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity monitoring survey data products services national archive hydat html this database includes information on station number and name latitude and longitude of the station status active or discontinued operating mode continuous or intermittent length of data and drainage area gross and effective information on peaks extremes and ice influenced conditions for some stations are also available the stations chosen for this study were based on the following criteria 1 the hydrometric status of the gauge station was active 2 its operating mode was continuous 3 the length of data was sufficient to cover the study period 2002 2012 4 the percentage of missing values was small 5 and 5 the sub sub basin was represented by at least one independent and un nested gauge station as a result 54 stations across the saskrb were used for evaluation in this study fig 2b and table a2 3 4 hydrological information from remote sensing data 3 4 1 evapotranspiration fluxes the global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam is a set of algorithms that provide datasets of daily evaporation at the global scale and 0 25 spatial resolution 25 km from 1984 to 2011 miralles et al 2011 the components in generating gleam include a modified priestly taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 an evaporative stress module and a gash analytical model of rainfall interception miralles et al 2010 driven by various remote sensing products for precipitation net radiation surface air temperature surface soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow depth miralles et al 2011 gleam has been updated to include a new soil moisture data assimilation system martens et al 2016 miralles et al 2014 a revised evaporative stress formula and an optimized drainage algorithm martens et al 2017 the datasets are available in different versions and the 1980 2016 version 3 1a data at 0 25 at daily time steps were used in this study 3 4 2 total water storage the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites were launched in march 2002 to provide a dataset of monthly measurements of changes in earth s gravity field with global coverage at a spatial resolution of 200 km swenson and wahr 2002 tapley et al 2004 the changes in gravity anomalies were post processed at 1 spatial resolution 100 km by different centers to estimate the changes in total water storage tws at each grid cell over time and the grace tws anomaly data processed by the natural resources canada huang et al 2012 lambert et al 2013 were used in this study this product hereafter known as grace nrcan was developed as a result of a reevaluation of the tws anomaly in north america from 2002 to 2011 except june 2006 january 2011 and june 2011 that are missing taking advantage of several observational and computational improvements 1 grace data were processed using a two step method huang et al 2012 to minimize the loss of the signal amplitude while extracting the gravity change signal 2 grace data were empirically corrected using gps vertical velocities for the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment and 3 grace data were locally verified by observational wells in deep confined aquifers in southwest saskatchewan 4 hydrologic land surface model h lsm the canadian h lsm mesh modélisation environmentale communautaire surface hydrology model pietroniro et al 2007 developed by eccc was adopted in this study to perform the hydrological simulations mesh was chosen because it is physically based best suited for large scale river basins and can simulate cold region hydrological processes e g snowmelt blowing snow frozen soil glaciers haghnegahdar et al 2017 pietroniro et al 2007 yassin et al 2017 mesh configures the landscape using regular grids and represents sub grid heterogeneity by dividing each grid into tiles that are usually defined by land covers the vertical processes in mesh follow the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 to calculate water and energy balances for vegetation soil and snow at the tile scale the lateral sub surface and surface water movement within a grid cell are computed by either watrof soulis et al 2000 or pdmrof mekonnen et al 2014 watrof enhances the representation of hillslope hydrology while pdmrof is designed to calculate the dynamic behavior of the contributing area in the prairies the grid to grid routing in mesh uses the watroute module from the watflood hydrological model kouwen et al 1993 to route the flows based on the continuity and manning s equations that relate the outflow from channels with storage recent developments in mesh have also included reservoir operation yassin et al 2019a irrigation and flow diversion modules yassin et al 2019b following the model setup in yassin et al 2019b this study ran the mesh model in offline mode at a 10 km spatial resolution and half hourly time steps the gridded precipitation products mentioned in section 3 2 were individually used to drive mesh with six other meteorological forcing variables including air temperature k wind speed m s incoming shortwave radiation w m2 incoming longwave radiation w m2 specific humidity kg kg and barometric pressure pa these six variables were derived from the gem model estimates which were considered a reasonable option mainly because of their finer temporal resolution 1 hourly although each precipitation product except capa has its own meteorological variables there might be potential inconsistencies between the precipitation fields of the products and these six variables from the gem model however checking for these inconsistencies was not within the scope of this study which focused on generating a hybrid precipitation dataset for improving hydrological simulations it is also important to note that default parameterization was used in the current setting of the mesh model although the model might not perform optimally no calibration was done for the saskrb to avoid over fitting of the model and error compensation during the calibration process this setting is still justified because many of the mesh parameters were chosen from a direct physical interpretation of these parameters i e according to the class manual or from the available literature on the model e g haghnegahdar et al 2017 yassin et al 2017 and were derived from geophysical data using geospatial analysis it is acknowledged that simulating accurate streamflow could still be challenging with a default parameter set however considering the role of parameter calibration would greatly shift the focus of this study to a modelling exercise that examines the hydrological performance of precipitation products and its interaction with parameter uncertainty while it would be interesting to explore this issue calibrating a large scale river basin such as the saskrb is non trivial when the internal spatial heterogeneity of the river basin characteristics has to be considered i e multi stations calibration together with the highly dimensional parameter space table a3 and large computational demand of running a distributed hydrological model like mesh a thorough calibration strategy is needed which by itself could be an independent research to work on therefore given the purpose of this study the current setup of the model was regarded as adequate 5 methodology the fundamental idea of the combination method in this study is to explore and identify existing products that are locally performing best based on the physical interpretation of rainfall runoff response in cold regions while minimizing the use of sophisticated statistical techniques in manipulating and altering the statistical properties of the precipitation products the framework consists of three components fig 3 1 a benchmarking component to evaluate each precipitation candidate against the precipitation gauge stations and to assess the overall streamflow performance in each streamflow station 2 a generation component to identify the best performing candidates based on the ranking for each sub sub basin at an annual or seasonal scale and 3 a validation component to assess the performance of the hybrid dataset at downstream gauge stations along the mainstream and other hydrological fluxes and storage for comparison with the performance of the candidate datasets the details of each component are provided below 5 1 benchmarking component the benchmarking component has two steps the first step is to examine the error characteristics of the precipitation candidates and assess how these products perform in the saskrb at annual and seasonal scales following the methods in wong et al 2017 the gridded precipitation estimates of each candidate were interpolated at the coordinates of the precipitation gauge stations from the adjdlyrs dataset using inverse distance square weighting and the interpolations were carried out on an individual ecodistrict basis an ecodistrict is the smallest ecologically distinct area characterized by a distinctive assemblages of relief landforms geology soil and vegetation and is delineated under the four hierarchical levels of generalization in the national ecological framework for canada ecological stratification working group 1996 marshall et al 1999 when doing the interpolation within an ecodistrict using inverse distance square weighting the interpolated point is assumed to be solely influenced by the nearby gridded points that are within the ecodistrict in question and the weights are based on the inverse of the distance between the interpolated point and the gridded points this has an advantage over other interpolation methods e g bi linear interpolation when the interpolated point is located at the foothill in case of bi linear interpolation the four nearest gridded points are chosen in which two gridded points could be on a hill and the other two could be in a valley bottom the precipitation amounts in such cases could be greatly overestimated at the interpolated point especially when the elevation differences are large among the gridded points however the ecodistrict helps identify the numbers of gridded points that have the same physiographic characteristics this in turns provides a more representative estimation of precipitation amounts at the interpolated point four performance measures were calculated by comparing the interpolated values with the adjdlyrs station data these measures were used to assess the ability of the products to represent the daily variability of precipitation amounts percentage of bias p bias p root mean square error rmse mm correlation coefficient r p and standard deviation ratio σ g σ r as shown by eqs 1 4 respectively 1 p bias p i n g i r i i n r i 100 2 rmse i n g i r i 2 n 3 r p i n g i g i n r i r i n g i g 2 i n r i r 2 4 σ g σ r i n g i g 2 n i n r i r 2 n where g and r are the spatial average of the daily gridded precipitation product and the reference observation dataset adjdlyrs g and r are the daily mean of the gridded precipitation product and point station data over the study period respectively i is the i th day of the season or year and n is the total number of days in the season or year an overall performance measure grand p was also calculated by weighting equally the above four performance measures to identify the best basin wide precipitation product over the saskrb as shown by equation 5 5 grand p min r m s e a b s p bias p 1 r 1 σ g σ r since there are no reliable empirical evidences of how the four performance measures should be weighted equal weighting is assumed to provide the least biases due to subjectivity as the four performance measures examine different aspects of the precipitation products with p bias p for accuracy of product estimation rmse for magnitude of errors r p for strength and direction of the linear relationship between precipitation products and observed data and σ g σ r for amplitude of the variations a balanced performance among the four aspects was chosen to be the criteria for the identification of the best basin wide precipitation product in this study the second step is to examine the model performance of the precipitation candidates and assess how these products perform in streamflow simulations at annual and seasonal scales all precipitation products were spatially rescaled to the mesh model scale of 10 km via bi linear interpolation and temporally rescaled to the half hour by linear interpolation it is acknowledged that rescaling products onto model resolution using simple interpolation methods might introduce errors and uncertainties on simulation results however such rescaling is a necessary data processing step for running a model and so is common practice in hydrological modelling regarding temporal rescaling linear and uniform interpolations were tested and no major differences were seen on simulation results and the hydrological performance of each precipitation product therefore it is assumed that the impacts of the uncertainties due to the rescaling methods are minimal as compared to other uncertainties arising from data input model structure and parameters after rescaling each individual precipitation product was used to drive mesh with default parameterization for the years 2002 2010 the first year was used as a spin up period for model stability and the remaining years were used for model evaluation three performance measures were used to examine the goodness of fit on streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe on the logarithm of streamflow nse ln and percentage of bias p bias q as shown by eqs 6 8 respectively 6 nse 1 q sim q obs 2 q obs q obs 2 7 nse ln 1 ln q sim ln q obs 2 l n q obs l n q obs 2 8 p bias q q sim q obs q obs 100 where q sim and q obs are simulated and observed streamflow respectively and q obs is the daily mean of observed streamflow the value of nse varies between and 1 0 with an optimal value of one whereas the value of p bias q ranges between 100 to with an optimal value of 0 5 2 generation component the generation component was used to identify the best performing precipitation candidates based on their strengths in hydrological performance of streamflow simulations instead of determining the weights for each precipitation candidate based on its error characteristic the precipitation products were ranked by each performance measure the best performing precipitation product could be identified by choosing the performance measure that is fit for the modelling purpose for instance if the modelling application is to capture the low flow the nse ln can be used to find the best performing precipitation product unlike the analyses of previous studies that were computed for each grid cell and for each time step e g hazra et al 2019 yilmaz et al 2010 the ranking was conducted for each sub sub basin and on a seasonal or an annual basis because this is the spatial unit to which mesh integrates runoff to produce streamflow to illustrate the generation procedure the best candidate was selected based on nse only in this study at an annual scale for instance if capa had the highest nse value in a particular sub sub basin the entire time series of capa would be used for grids within this sub sub basin at a seasonal scale the best candidate would be selected for the individual seasons for instance if capa ranked first in spring and narr first in summer the generation procedure would use the capa time series covering every spring and the narr time series covering every summer the same practice was done for autumn and winter and the entire process was repeated for each sub sub basin the reason for using a sub sub basin as the target unit rather than a grid cell is to consider the spatial consistency over an area unless spatial correlation is added as a constraint or preserving spatial precipitation field is considered in the assessment assigning the best precipitation candidate on a grid by grid basis might disturb the spatial structure of a precipitation event also since the assessment is based on streamflow which represents the integrated hydrological response of a sub sub basin it is sensible to select the best precipitation candidate for that sub sub basin so that the runoff response could be maintained similarly applying the time series on a seasonal or an annual basis is to consider the time continuity that corresponds to the hydrological regime of a sub sub basin in cold continental regions like the saskrb streamflow is characterized by distinct hydrological processes such as snow accumulation in winter resulting in low flow and snowmelt in spring leading to typical peak flow by choosing the time periods of the best precipitation candidate that match the seasonal or annual streamflow regimes of the sub sub basin the respective hydrological characteristics could be retained 5 3 validation component the purpose of the validation component is to evaluate the model performance of the hybrid dataset using hydrological information e g streamflow and other hydrological fluxes and storage in this study streamflow information was primarily used as the main target for evaluation the best basin wide precipitation product was first identified by the lowest grand p and this was used as a benchmark to compare the streamflow simulations of the hybrid dataset an interpolated gauge based precipitation product could be more accurate than the basin wide product and be chosen as the benchmark however its accuracy is highly dependent on the representativeness of the locations of the precipitation gauge stations and requires a dense station network over the study area for the saskrb the network density is very low 0 001 station km2 as there are only 424 stations across the 406 000 km2 river basin and most of the stations are located at lower elevations in mountain valleys and foothills and so will not be able to represent precipitation amounts in the high mountains very well furthermore the anusplin precipitation product hopkinson et al 2011 hutchinson et al 2009 which is a daily gridded station based precipitation dataset across canada has been identified for its dry bias in the prairies wong et al 2017 therefore the best basin wide precipitation product was chosen as the benchmark to minimize the above issues the best precipitation product and hybrid dataset were used to re run the mesh model with the same model settings the comparison was done at the saskrb outlet and at the sub basin streamflow stations the three performance measures used to assess the goodness of fit on streamflow in the first component were calculated evapotranspiration fluxes and total water storage from remote sensing data were used as a supplement to further evaluate the model performance of the hybrid datasets the assessment was done by calculating and comparing the monthly basin scale average in particular the simulated tws anomaly was obtained by calculating the monthly simulated tws minus the average of tws time series for period 2003 2009 which is consistent with grace nrcan product two performance measures were used to examine the goodness of fit on the hydrological information percentage of bias p bias h and correlation coefficient r h as shown by eqs 9 and 10 respectively 9 p bias h h sim h obs h obs 100 10 r h j n h sim j h sim j n h obs j h obs j n h sim j h sim 2 j n h obs j h obs 2 where h refers to evapotranspiration fluxes et and total water storage tws when evaluating against gleam and grace nrcan anomaly data respectively h sim and h obs are the spatial average of the monthly simulated hydrological components and the reference observation dataset h sim and h obs are the monthly mean of the simulations and remote sensing data over the study period respectively j is the j th month of the year and n is the total number of months 6 results 6 1 evaluation of precipitation candidates the temporal variability of the gridded precipitation candidates was evaluated using the observations from the precipitation gauge stations across the saskrb the error characteristics of the precipitation candidates at seasonal and annual scales were first assessed in terms of accuracy p bias p magnitude of errors rmse correlation between the candidates and precipitation gauge stations r p and amplitude of the variations σ g σ r according to equations 1 to 4 respectively fig 4 in terms of accuracy all candidates generally showed an overall underestimation of precipitation amounts at an annual scale except for narr which provided a positive p bias p of 8 7 specifically princeton greatly underestimated the precipitation amounts in spring and winter by 18 7 and 27 0 respectively and capa in summer by 23 4 wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc shared a similar seasonal p bias p ranging from 15 5 to 2 3 regarding the magnitude of errors and correlation with observations princeton generally showed the overall highest rmse and lowest r p at both annual and seasonal scales whereas capa showed the reverse the overall lowest rmse and highest r p the performance of wfdei cru wfdei gpcc and narr were in between princeton and capa when the amplitude of variations were examined with the exception of princeton the variations of the candidates were all much smaller than those of the observed at an annual scale in which σ g σ r ranged from 0 73 capa to 0 79 wfdei gpcc the simulated streamflow generated by the precipitation candidates based on mesh h lsm was further evaluated using the 54 streamflow stations across the saskrb as reference points figs 5 and a1 as for the predictive power of the model fig 5a capa generally provided the best streamflow performance in more than half the stations with an average nse of 0 25 while wfdei gpcc had the second highest average nse of 0 17 similarly capa and wfdei gpcc performed better than the other precipitation candidates in simulating low flow fig 5b in particular capa and wfdei gpcc had good model performance in the upper south saskatchewan river basin stations 1 to 8 and the lower bow river basin stations 15 to 18 in summer fig a1 regarding the accuracy of the model performance fig 5c the underestimation of precipitation amounts of all precipitation candidates except for narr generally propagated through the model and revealed in the percentage of flow volume bias princeton and capa provided an average negative p bias q of 25 7 and 22 3 respectively whereas narr showed an average positive p bias q of 4 2 in particular all precipitation candidates generally overestimated the streamflow in the bow red deer and upper north saskatchewan river basins stations 9 to 33 in summer fig a1 6 2 generation of hybrid dataset the hybrid dataset was generated by choosing the best performing precipitation candidate for each sub sub basin based on the highest nse values fig 6 at an annual scale capa generally performed better than other precipitation candidates in several sub basins including the lower bow red deer battle upper north and lower upper south saskatchewan river basins whereas wfdei gpcc outperformed the others in the upper bow upper lower north and lower part of the lower south saskatchewan river basins fig 6e at a seasonal scale well mixed precipitation candidates were seen in each individual season for each precipitation candidate similar numbers of sub sub basins ranked first in spring and winter on the other hand capa had the highest nse values in 42 out of 79 sub sub basins in autumn when the precipitation candidates in summer periods were ranked capa tended to be the first in the north saskatchewan river basin whereas wfdei gpcc performed the best in the south saskatchewan river basin based on these combinations two hybrid datasets were created hybrid annual and hybrid seasonal which were used to run the mesh h lsm for model evaluation 6 3 comparison of model performance the best basin wide precipitation product was identified by calculating grand p at annual and seasonal scales table 2 capa outperformed other precipitation candidates with the lowest grand p at both temporal scales and was therefore used as a benchmark to compare the streamflow simulations of the hybrid datasets fig 7 shows the differences in model performance using nse between capa and the hybrid datasets generated based on annual evaluation fig 7a hybrid annual generally showed an overall improvement of model performance across the saskrb the performance of the south saskatchewan river basin noticeably improved nse difference 0 1 while that of the north saskatchewan river basin improved even more nse difference greater than 0 2 especially downstream of the river however hybrid seasonal did not consistently perform better than capa across the saskrb combinations of the best precipitation candidates in each season did not necessarily provide a better model performance than the best individual candidate in some regions where degradation of nse values were seen fig 7b although hybrid seasonal performed better than capa and even better than hybrid annual along the south saskatchewan river basin its performance tended to worsen in the headwaters of the upper north red deer and bow river basins this poor performance could be due to the response delay of rainfall runoff generation in cold regions the runoff mechanism is not only driven by the amount of precipitation in the concurrent season but also depended on the antecedent condition of previous seasons since most of the headwaters of the saskrb are of the nivo glacial regime the streamflow in spring and summer is highly reliant on the onset time of snowfall in the previous autumn the amount of snow accumulation in the previous winter and the amount of glacier snow melt in spring therefore in addition to the combination of hybrid datasets at a seasonal scale a new hybrid dataset hybrid bi seasonal was generated by grouping the individual seasons into two summer including june july and august and winter including the remaining months figure not shown hybrid bi seasonal was found to not only resolve the degradation of nse values as seen in hybrid seasonal but also to perform better and improve more than hybrid annual as shown in fig 7c fig 8 shows the comparison of mean annual hydrographs at sub basin outlets between capa and the hybrid datasets both hybrid datasets were able to better capture the peak flow than capa in the old man and bow river basins stations 6 and 20 respectively because capa dominated in the red deer battle and upper north saskatchewan river basins the differences in streamflow simulations between capa and the hybrid datasets were not visible however more obvious improvements of the hybrid datasets over capa were seen further downstream at stations 45 and 54 where significant reductions of peak flow 72 9 and 26 0 respectively were observed improvements of the hybrid datasets over capa were also seen in terms of streamflow volume fig 9 with well mixed precipitation candidates in the old man river basin station 6 both hybrid datasets were able to reduce the underestimation of streamflow volume from 27 3 capa to 5 9 hybrid annual and 2 8 hybrid bi seasonal similarly when going further downstream in the south saskatchewan river basin at station 48 capa provided a negative p bias q of 24 1 and the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal were able to decrease the p bias q to 18 9 and 23 4 respectively the model performance of the hybrid datasets in other hydrological components was evaluated at a basin scale using the observations from gleam fig 10 and grace nrcan fig 11 the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal captured the seasonal cycles of the evapotranspiration fluxes very well with r et of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively fig 10a while capa showed an overall underestimation of et of 5 7 both hybrid datasets were generally able to reduce the p bias e t to 5 4 and 5 2 respectively with slightly better estimations of the fluxes than capa in summer when larger values were observed fig 10b regarding the total water storage component fig 11 the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal generally followed the grace tws with r tws of 0 82 and 0 84 respectively both hybrid datasets were better in capturing the positive tws anomalies than capa however they showed larger underestimation of the negative tws anomalies than capa fig 11b overall the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal provided a lower average positive p bias t w s of 41 7 and 40 2 than that of capa 45 7 7 discussion the evaluation of precipitation products in terms of streamflow simulations can provide a different insight on the quality of the precipitation products our results show that the best basin wide precipitation product capa in this case evaluated against the precipitation gauge stations did not necessarily have the best streamflow performance across the saskrb although capa performed the best of the precipitation candidates at the basin outlet station 54 poorer annual and seasonal performance was seen in some internal gauge stations this poor performance highlights that using precipitation gauge stations alone for evaluation is limited by the density of the station network and the spatial distribution of the stations the inadequacy of such traditional and common approaches is further magnified in large scale river basins especially when the need to accurately evaluate internal variations of the basin characteristics is increasing in this regard hydrological evaluation of the precipitation products can be viewed as a supplement for the limitations of direct evaluation to precipitation gauge stations the use of streamflow rather than other hydrological information e g evapotranspiration fluxes total water storage snow water equivalent is believed to be better because of its relatively smaller uncertainties however caution is still needed when using streamflow stations in cold regions owing to the ice conditions the impacts of observational uncertainties could be explored in future research the generation of hybrid datasets based on hydrological evaluation was shown to be useful for improving h lsm modelling skills the hybrid datasets performed better than the best basin wide precipitation products with similar or higher nse values and were better at capturing the peak flows in several stations while the hybrid datasets were able to maintain a good performance in the headwaters of the saskrb and the internal sub basins the cumulative effect of having locally best performing precipitation candidates was more evident further downstream and at the basin outlet there are clear advantages of generating hybrid datasets which are potentially more beneficial than the individual products for hydrological modelling in large scale river basins such as the one in this study however the value of combining multiple precipitation products may decrease when one individual product dominates over the area of interest this is especially true when the generation of a hybrid dataset is based on evaluation against a limited number of in situ precipitation gauge stations if generated in this way the hybrid dataset can resemble the dataset of the individual product e g eum and gupta 2019 the hybrid datasets generated in eum and gupta 2019 were dominated by the two best performing precipitation products over the athabasca river basin resulting in marginal improvements differences between the hybrid and the best precipitation product similar situations were seen in our study where capa the best basin wide precipitation product generally performed the best in some saskrb sub basins however we argue that using additional information streamflow in our case when generating the hybrid dataset could largely reduce the dominance of one individual precipitation product when multiple precipitation products are combined seasonality should be properly considered in relation to hydrological processes in assessing precipitation candidates at a seasonal scale it is intuitive to expect the combination of the best performing candidates for each individual season to give better hydrological simulations than the individual products however our results show that these combinations were not necessarily the best performers across the whole river basin some regions experienced a decline in model performance as compared to the best basin wide precipitation product we found that one precipitation candidate that consistently performed the best across autumn winter and spring was better than the three best candidates for the respective seasons this result implies that aligning the assessment of the precipitation products with the rain snow regime and the cold region hydrological processes would provide a more sensible hybrid dataset for cold region river basins especially in headwaters where the model performance was shown to be more sensitive the proposed framework provides a systematic and flexible way to generate hybrid datasets based on the users needs the fundamental idea behind such a framework is that different precipitation products have the best hydrological performance over different regions in different seasons of a large scale river basin unlike the single optimal hybrid dataset predetermined by certain criteria the hybrid datasets generated in this framework are dynamic in the sense that the combinations change according to the modelling purposes the use of performance measures and the number of precipitation candidates this framework is designed for modelling the historical records by recognizing and maximizing the strengths of each individual precipitation product in simulating the observed streamflow during the generation process therefore the current application mainly focuses on regions historical conditions with limited climate station data and hydrological simulations of streamflow and the modelling driven by the hybrid dataset offers the potential to deal with multi dimensional water security issues e g flooding drought and the combination of both under changing climate however it is important to note that our approach is not intended to make future precipitation estimates as the combination method may change the underlying precipitation statistics and the hybrid dataset may present different statistical properties in terms of frequency distribution timing of the wet dry seasons and extreme values despite the proposed framework s flexibility the hydrological performance s robustness could be hindered by uncertainties arising from various sources differences in streamflow simulations across the river basin and deviations among the precipitation products could be seen and this could mainly result from the interaction between the quality of the precipitation products and the model itself qi et al 2016 the uncertainties and errors from streamflow observation could also contribute to the variations yet the impact is possibly minimal conversely the uncertainties and errors in the precipitation products could be amplified or dampened in the streamflow simulations due to the highly non linear nature of the hydrological process interactions also variations in streamflow performance among the precipitation candidates are generally larger for small basin areas revealing the accuracy of the precipitation products reduces with decreasing size of the considered basins camici et al 2018 on the other hand compensation by model parameters for the precipitation errors is minimal in this study since the parameter values were not calibrated to any of the precipitation candidates however this comes as a cost of potentially having not optimal hydrological performance e g low nse values otherwise the interaction of parameter uncertainties with other uncertainties could overshadow the combination process calibration through optimization might reduce input and modelling limitations likewise the systematic deviations of each precipitation product could be minimized by using p bias q as the selection criteria for the best performing precipitation candidate or by doing bias correction first before combining the products to properly consider bias correction the interdependence of precipitation and temperature is crucial for modelling hydrological processes in cold regions such as our study area because the precipitation temperature correlation can influence the transition between rainfall and snowfall and also the snowmelt process chen et al 2018 meyer et al 2019 however bias correction and calibration are not always sufficient to achieve satisfying performances and improve hydrological simulations camici et al 2018 further research is needed to examine the usefulness of different multiplicative bias correction methods and to account for parameter uncertainty with a thorough calibration strategy 8 conclusions obtaining reliable and accurate gridded precipitation estimates to meet the growing demand for better hydrological simulations and predictions remains a challenge existing precipitation products are often shown to have various degrees of accuracy over different regions and their robustness decreases when they are evaluated against only sparse in situ precipitation gauge station networks this study thus proposed a methodological framework to combine multiple precipitation products based on ranking the hydrological performance of each product at a sub sub basin scale three conclusions can be drawn based on the above analysis 1 the best basin wide precipitation product evaluated using the precipitation gauge stations as a reference point does not necessarily show the best hydrological performance across a large scale river basin owing to the sparse and unevenly distributed station network 2 hybrid datasets show equally good or better model performance as compared to the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually perform better further downstream and at the basin outlet given the cumulative effect of combining the best performing precipitation candidates in sub sub basins and 3 better streamflow simulations of the hybrid dataset generated at a bi seasonal scale as compared to a seasonal scale in the headwaters indicate the importance of seasonality with respect to the hydrological regime of the river basin when generating the hybrid dataset this study demonstrated the applicability of the proposed methodological framework over the saskatchewan river basin and showed the advantages of hybrid datasets in a large scale river basin with a sparse precipitation gauge station network further research could assess the framework in regions with different hydro climatic regimes at a continental global scale while considering observational uncertainties of the additional information used to assess the precipitation products credit authorship contribution statement jefferson s wong conceptualization methodology formal analysis

basin scales this study aims to develop a methodological framework to generate hybrid precipitation datasets based on the model performance of streamflow simulations that are spatially representative across large river basins the framework is illustrated using a canadian h lsm known as mesh modélisation environmentale communautaire surface hydrology in the saskatchewan river basin canada for the

included as candidates in this study results indicate that the generation of a hybrid dataset based on hydrological evaluation was useful for improving h lsm modelling skills hybrid datasets showed a similar or better model performance compared to that of the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually performed better downstream and at the basin outlet when multiple products are combined model performance can be further enhanced by considering seasonality with respect to the hydrological regime of the river basin this study demonstrates the usefulness of hybrid datasets in a large scale river basin with low climate station network density keywords precipitation combination precipitation datasets hydrological modelling large scale basins canada 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most important climate input forcing variable for driving hydrologic land surface models h lsms with the increasing sophistication of distributed hydrological modelling the demand for better and more reliable gridded precipitation estimates at finer spatial and temporal resolutions continues to grow however it is argued that precipitation is the most difficult variable to estimate not only because of its spatiotemporal heterogeneity herold et al 2016 stephens et al 2010 but also its changing characteristics in a warming climate trenberth et al 2003 obtaining reliable precipitation measurements with accurate spatiotemporal representation remains a challenging task for improved hydrological simulations and predictions this study aims to address this issue by proposing a framework that combines multiple existing precipitation products and assessing the usefulness of the combined precipitation dataset for hydrological modelling there are three fundamental methods for estimating precipitation michaelides et al 2009 1 ground observations including rain gauges and radar networks 2 satellite remote sensing and 3 numerical retrospective analysis models these methods strengths and weaknesses are well documented by numerous studies e g beck et al 2017a chen et al 2019 hazra et al 2019 maggioni and massari 2018 sun et al 2018 wong et al 2017 yilmaz et al 2010 given the limitations of each measurement the calls for combining information from gauges radars satellites and models are increasing ebert et al 2007 as a result products that merge precipitation estimates from different sources have emerged over the last decades e g beck et al 2017a huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 mesinger et al 2006 sheffield et al 2006 weedon et al 2014 however when evaluating the multi source precipitation datasets against ground observations and assessing their impacts on hydrological simulations researchers often conclude that different precipitation products have variable accuracy and distinct hydrological utility over different regions in different seasons hazra et al 2019 jiang et al 2012 moazami et al 2016 to improve the accuracy of precipitation estimation for hydrological applications the idea of generating a hybrid dataset by combining existing precipitation products has attracted considerable interest in recent years various combination methods have been proposed and generally can be classified into two approaches the first approach generates the hybrid dataset by evaluating the individual products against the climate stations assigning weights rankings for each product based on error statistics and assessing the performance of the hybrid dataset through a hydrological model for instance beck et al 2017a combined information from gauge satellite and reanalysis data by weighting different satellite and reanalysis based products using 3 day correlation coefficients and the dataset was validated using a conceptual hydrological model hbv at a global scale similarly eum and gupta 2019 generated a hybrid dataset by ranking various precipitation products based on their comparative performances using five metrics and the performance of the hybrid dataset was then compared to that of these individual products through the hydrological model vic in the athabasca river basin canada alternatively other studies have explored various techniques of data fusion algorithm in assigning weights for individual products including the nonparametric statistical method e g baez villanueva et al 2020 bhuiyan et al 2018 bayesian methods e g ma et al 2018a ma et al 2018b qi et al 2018 verdin et al 2015 geospatial estimation e g li et al 2015 shi et al 2017 xie and xiong 2011 and among others regardless of the mathematical theory these algorithms were designed to remove biases in the precipitation estimates and sometimes to blend the bias corrected estimates with climate stations to further reduce the random error their results indicated that the hybrid dataset was able to perform better in streamflow simulations with respect to the individual precipitation products the second approach generates the hybrid dataset by assigning different weights for each individual product based on minimizing the errors between the simulated and the observed hydrological variables yilmaz et al 2010 used the downhill simplex method to estimate the relative weights of different precipitation products at each time step by minimizing the land surface flux errors in the noah lsm over the red arkansas river basin us more recently using oklahoma us as a test site hazra et al 2019 proposed an optimal combination of weights for three different types of precipitation product at each grid point by focusing on minimizing the errors in the surface soil moisture and maximizing the correlation between the simulated and observed soil moisture their studies showed that the hybrid dataset improved model simulation skills better than did the individual precipitation products despite the advantages of the hybrid dataset over the individual precipitation products each combination approach faces some limitations that might restrict its usage and subsequently the usefulness of the hybrid dataset for hydrological modelling the first approach directly evaluates the dataset against the precipitation gauge observations that are usually regarded as ground truth however the robustness of this approach highly depends on the density of the climate station network regardless of the advancements in meteorological monitoring networks over the past few decades network density across the world remains poor kidd et al 2017 this is especially true in high latitude regions such as canada where the precipitation gauge stations are sparsely distributed usually 500 700 km apart in northern areas north of 60 n and over mountainous regions wang and lin 2015 meanwhile the frequent addition and subtraction of precipitation gauge stations not only affects the spatial coverage of the existing station network but also the availability of long term precipitation measurements mekis and hogg 1999 metcalfe et al 1997 rapaic et al 2015 wang et al 2017 while the hybrid dataset generated using the second approach is able to provide better hydrological simulations the dataset does not necessarily have the true precipitation information because its generation is based on optimized weights from error minimization of hydrological variables and the dataset is not validated against the precipitation gauge stations in addition regardless of the approach previous studies e g beck et al 2017b behrangi et al 2011 essou et al 2016 eum and gupta 2019 ma et al 2018b often evaluated the performance of precipitation products using lumped or conceptual hydrological models at basin outlets for large scale river basins however the best model performance at basin outlets does not usually show the same or similar high performance in internal gauge stations as a result more attention should be paid to the internal spatial heterogeneity of the river basin characteristics and the use of distributed physically based hydrological models mazzoleni et al 2019 to address the limitations of each approach the objective of this study is to develop a methodological framework that combines multiple precipitation products based on evaluation against not only precipitation gauge stations but also streamflow stations for improving the h lsm skills it is essential to identify the strengths of the existing precipitation products in terms of hydrological simulations rather than comparing them only with inadequate precipitation gauge observations streamflow stations are used to compensate for the limited spatial representativeness of precipitation gauge stations point measurement because streamflow at a gauge represents the integrated response of the whole catchment locations of streamflow stations can potentially cover areas where precipitation gauge stations are non existent and streamflow data are more readily available moreover compared to other water balance components the uncertainties of streamflow are relatively small and are found to be 5 10 under normal conditions hamilton and moore 2012 herschy 1999 mcmillan et al 2012 although estimates in rivers subject to icing could be 15 45 under the worst conditions shiklomanov et al 2006 the hypothesis of the combination method in this study shifts away from the idea of merging multiple existing products via some statistical techniques to generate one optimal dataset that is applicable for the areas of interest to the idea of identifying existing products that are locally performing best at lower level sub basin scale based on the physical interpretation of streamflow response to precipitation this hypothesis is tested over the saskatchewan river basin canada where a mosaic of landscapes exists and more precipitation gauge and streamflow stations can be found than in northern canada the successful application of the framework in this river basin could build the foundation and confidence for applying the combination method to river basins in the north sections 2 and 3 briefly describe the study area and precipitation and streamflow data respectively section 4 provides a brief description of the h lsm used in this study while section 5 describes the proposed methodological framework sections 6 and 7 present the results of the combined precipitation dataset and discussion of the evaluation on hydrological simulations respectively section 8 summarizes the research and offers concluding remarks on the usefulness of this combination method for hydrological applications 2 study area the saskatchewan river basin saskrb is located in western canada 98 118 w and 48 56 n and encompasses portions of the canadian provinces of alberta saskatchewan and manitoba and a small portion of the us state of montana fig 1 its total drainage area is 406 000 km2 the source of the saskrb originates on the eastern slope of the canadian rockies in alberta and its two main tributaries are the south and north saskatchewan rivers both rivers flow east and northeast through the saskatchewan prairies to form the saskatchewan river flowing through the saskatchewan river delta and draining into lake winnipeg in manitoba according to the standard drainage area classification brooks et al 2002 pearse et al 1985 the two tributary river systems are subdivided into nine sub basins of the bow red deer battle upper north central north lower north upper south oldman and a small watershed draining from montana us lower south and eastern saskatchewan rivers the nine sub basins can be further subdivided into 79 sub sub basins the saskrb presents a complex system characterized by hydrologically distinct regions which include the rocky mountains on the far western side boreal forest in the north and the prairies in the remaining parts of the basin the topography of the basin varies from 218 to 3487 m above sea level according to the national ecological framework for canada ecological stratification working group 1996 marshall et al 1999 the saskrb consists of four ecozones montane cordillera prairie boreal plain and boreal shield covering 6 58 33 and 3 of the basin area respectively based on the köppen climate classification in general the saskrb climate is classified as cold semi arid and humid over the prairies and as a cool and humid continental climate over the remaining parts with a long cold winter and a short warm summer the mean annual precipitation ranges from 601 to 800 mm in the montane cordillera to 201 600 mm in the prairie and boreal ecozones ecological stratification working group 1996 most of the precipitation comes as rainfall between april and august and snowfall occurs in winter between october and april much of the annual runoff is generated from snowmelt in early spring from the prairies and in summer from the mountains pomeroy et al 2005 3 data 3 1 precipitation gauge stations due to the lack of an adjusted daily gridded precipitation product in canada this study used station precipitation extracted from the latest version version 2019 of the adjusted daily rainfall and snowfall adjdlyrs dataset wang et al 2017 of the national climate data archive of environment and climate change canada eccc this dataset is available from the canadian open data portal https open canada ca data en dataset d8616c52 a812 44ad 8754 7bcc0d8de305 the adjdlyrs dataset accounts for different measurement issues and has been corrected for gauge undercatch and evaporation due to wind effect and for gauge specific wetting loss mekis and hogg 1999 mekis and vincent 2011 as a result the total adjustments were more than 25 of the total annual precipitation in northern canada and 10 15 in most of southern canada wang et al 2017 these adjusted values are considered the best estimates of actual precipitation and thus are used as the reference for all gridded precipitation product evaluations there are 424 stations across the saskrb because each station has different time spans and each precipitation product has different temporal coverage the overlapping period between january 1 2002 and december 31 2010 was selected for analysis for this period only 194 out of 424 stations were available and any of the 194 stations where the percentage of missing values exceeded 20 in the time series were removed this resulted in 53 stations for evaluation see fig 2 a for locations and table a1 for basic information 3 2 gridded precipitation products different types of gridded precipitation products including satellite derived and model reanalysis products are increasing available for hydrological applications the potential of satellite precipitation products spps were not considered in this study mainly because 1 the spps are known for their difficulties in identifying solid precipitation estimating snow and rain on snow are often poorly quantified tian et al 2014 2 the spps are not able to capture large scale weather systems well during winter seasons which represent the dominant source of precipitation in remote northern regions north of 60 n and cold regions like our study area beck et al 2017a beck et al 2017b and 3 owing to complex topography and large weather and climate variability the spps are shown not to perform well in high mountain regions such as the canadian rockies where the source of the saskrb originates maggioni and massari 2018 conversely since model reanalysis data are the primary source and only choice in remote northern regions this study focused on the reanalysis based multiple source precipitation products that have complete coverage of canada with a minimum of sub daily temporal and 0 5 50 km spatial resolutions as well as complete data for the study period 2002 2010 as a result five precipitation products were chosen for assessment these products are summarized in table 1 a brief description is provided below and more details are available in wong et al 2017 the terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university has created a global dataset of 3 hourly meteorological data at a 1 0 spatial resolution 120 km from 1948 to 2000 sheffield et al 2006 this product hereafter called princeton combined the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis with a set of different global observation based data princeton has been updated and this study used version 2 at 0 5 at 3 hourly time steps for driving the h lsm the european union water and global change watch forcing data methodology applied to the era interim wfdei was developed to produce datasets of sub daily 3 hourly and daily meteorological data with global coverage at a 0 5 spatial resolution 50 km from 1979 to 2012 weedon et al 2014 wfdei has been updated to provide datasets up to 2016 this product is similar to princeton in that the data were derived from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis interim product and combined with the climate research unit cru monthly data and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc monthly variables thus wfdei has two sets of precipitation totals generated by using either cru or gpcc the current study used both sets of data for brevity they are referred to as wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc respectively the north american regional reanalysis narr was generated to provide datasets of 3 hourly meteorological data for the north american domain at a 32 km 0 3 spatial resolution covering the period 1979 to 2015 mesinger et al 2006 narr combined the ncep department of energy ncep doe reanalysis with the ncep regional eta model the noah land surface model and various additional data sources note that for canada the assimilation of station observations was discontinued in 2003 the canadian precipitation analysis capa was developed to provide a dataset of 6 hourly precipitation accumulations over north america at a 15 km spatial resolution from 2002 onwards mahfouf et al 2007 for canada the product was generated using an optimum interpolation technique in which the initial guess from the regional global environmental multiscale gem model was updated by the rain gauge measurements capa has updated its statistical interpolation method increased its spatial resolution to 10 km and assimilated precipitation estimates from the canadian weather radar network and us radars near the border fortin et al 2015 fortin et al 2018 3 3 streamflow stations the daily streamflow data were obtained from the hydat database of the national water data archive of the water survey of canada https www canada ca en environment climate change services water overview quantity monitoring survey data products services national archive hydat html this database includes information on station number and name latitude and longitude of the station status active or discontinued operating mode continuous or intermittent length of data and drainage area gross and effective information on peaks extremes and ice influenced conditions for some stations are also available the stations chosen for this study were based on the following criteria 1 the hydrometric status of the gauge station was active 2 its operating mode was continuous 3 the length of data was sufficient to cover the study period 2002 2012 4 the percentage of missing values was small 5 and 5 the sub sub basin was represented by at least one independent and un nested gauge station as a result 54 stations across the saskrb were used for evaluation in this study fig 2b and table a2 3 4 hydrological information from remote sensing data 3 4 1 evapotranspiration fluxes the global land evaporation the amsterdam methodology gleam is a set of algorithms that provide datasets of daily evaporation at the global scale and 0 25 spatial resolution 25 km from 1984 to 2011 miralles et al 2011 the components in generating gleam include a modified priestly taylor model priestley and taylor 1972 an evaporative stress module and a gash analytical model of rainfall interception miralles et al 2010 driven by various remote sensing products for precipitation net radiation surface air temperature surface soil moisture vegetation optical depth and snow depth miralles et al 2011 gleam has been updated to include a new soil moisture data assimilation system martens et al 2016 miralles et al 2014 a revised evaporative stress formula and an optimized drainage algorithm martens et al 2017 the datasets are available in different versions and the 1980 2016 version 3 1a data at 0 25 at daily time steps were used in this study 3 4 2 total water storage the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellites were launched in march 2002 to provide a dataset of monthly measurements of changes in earth s gravity field with global coverage at a spatial resolution of 200 km swenson and wahr 2002 tapley et al 2004 the changes in gravity anomalies were post processed at 1 spatial resolution 100 km by different centers to estimate the changes in total water storage tws at each grid cell over time and the grace tws anomaly data processed by the natural resources canada huang et al 2012 lambert et al 2013 were used in this study this product hereafter known as grace nrcan was developed as a result of a reevaluation of the tws anomaly in north america from 2002 to 2011 except june 2006 january 2011 and june 2011 that are missing taking advantage of several observational and computational improvements 1 grace data were processed using a two step method huang et al 2012 to minimize the loss of the signal amplitude while extracting the gravity change signal 2 grace data were empirically corrected using gps vertical velocities for the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment and 3 grace data were locally verified by observational wells in deep confined aquifers in southwest saskatchewan 4 hydrologic land surface model h lsm the canadian h lsm mesh modélisation environmentale communautaire surface hydrology model pietroniro et al 2007 developed by eccc was adopted in this study to perform the hydrological simulations mesh was chosen because it is physically based best suited for large scale river basins and can simulate cold region hydrological processes e g snowmelt blowing snow frozen soil glaciers haghnegahdar et al 2017 pietroniro et al 2007 yassin et al 2017 mesh configures the landscape using regular grids and represents sub grid heterogeneity by dividing each grid into tiles that are usually defined by land covers the vertical processes in mesh follow the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy 1991 verseghy et al 1993 to calculate water and energy balances for vegetation soil and snow at the tile scale the lateral sub surface and surface water movement within a grid cell are computed by either watrof soulis et al 2000 or pdmrof mekonnen et al 2014 watrof enhances the representation of hillslope hydrology while pdmrof is designed to calculate the dynamic behavior of the contributing area in the prairies the grid to grid routing in mesh uses the watroute module from the watflood hydrological model kouwen et al 1993 to route the flows based on the continuity and manning s equations that relate the outflow from channels with storage recent developments in mesh have also included reservoir operation yassin et al 2019a irrigation and flow diversion modules yassin et al 2019b following the model setup in yassin et al 2019b this study ran the mesh model in offline mode at a 10 km spatial resolution and half hourly time steps the gridded precipitation products mentioned in section 3 2 were individually used to drive mesh with six other meteorological forcing variables including air temperature k wind speed m s incoming shortwave radiation w m2 incoming longwave radiation w m2 specific humidity kg kg and barometric pressure pa these six variables were derived from the gem model estimates which were considered a reasonable option mainly because of their finer temporal resolution 1 hourly although each precipitation product except capa has its own meteorological variables there might be potential inconsistencies between the precipitation fields of the products and these six variables from the gem model however checking for these inconsistencies was not within the scope of this study which focused on generating a hybrid precipitation dataset for improving hydrological simulations it is also important to note that default parameterization was used in the current setting of the mesh model although the model might not perform optimally no calibration was done for the saskrb to avoid over fitting of the model and error compensation during the calibration process this setting is still justified because many of the mesh parameters were chosen from a direct physical interpretation of these parameters i e according to the class manual or from the available literature on the model e g haghnegahdar et al 2017 yassin et al 2017 and were derived from geophysical data using geospatial analysis it is acknowledged that simulating accurate streamflow could still be challenging with a default parameter set however considering the role of parameter calibration would greatly shift the focus of this study to a modelling exercise that examines the hydrological performance of precipitation products and its interaction with parameter uncertainty while it would be interesting to explore this issue calibrating a large scale river basin such as the saskrb is non trivial when the internal spatial heterogeneity of the river basin characteristics has to be considered i e multi stations calibration together with the highly dimensional parameter space table a3 and large computational demand of running a distributed hydrological model like mesh a thorough calibration strategy is needed which by itself could be an independent research to work on therefore given the purpose of this study the current setup of the model was regarded as adequate 5 methodology the fundamental idea of the combination method in this study is to explore and identify existing products that are locally performing best based on the physical interpretation of rainfall runoff response in cold regions while minimizing the use of sophisticated statistical techniques in manipulating and altering the statistical properties of the precipitation products the framework consists of three components fig 3 1 a benchmarking component to evaluate each precipitation candidate against the precipitation gauge stations and to assess the overall streamflow performance in each streamflow station 2 a generation component to identify the best performing candidates based on the ranking for each sub sub basin at an annual or seasonal scale and 3 a validation component to assess the performance of the hybrid dataset at downstream gauge stations along the mainstream and other hydrological fluxes and storage for comparison with the performance of the candidate datasets the details of each component are provided below 5 1 benchmarking component the benchmarking component has two steps the first step is to examine the error characteristics of the precipitation candidates and assess how these products perform in the saskrb at annual and seasonal scales following the methods in wong et al 2017 the gridded precipitation estimates of each candidate were interpolated at the coordinates of the precipitation gauge stations from the adjdlyrs dataset using inverse distance square weighting and the interpolations were carried out on an individual ecodistrict basis an ecodistrict is the smallest ecologically distinct area characterized by a distinctive assemblages of relief landforms geology soil and vegetation and is delineated under the four hierarchical levels of generalization in the national ecological framework for canada ecological stratification working group 1996 marshall et al 1999 when doing the interpolation within an ecodistrict using inverse distance square weighting the interpolated point is assumed to be solely influenced by the nearby gridded points that are within the ecodistrict in question and the weights are based on the inverse of the distance between the interpolated point and the gridded points this has an advantage over other interpolation methods e g bi linear interpolation when the interpolated point is located at the foothill in case of bi linear interpolation the four nearest gridded points are chosen in which two gridded points could be on a hill and the other two could be in a valley bottom the precipitation amounts in such cases could be greatly overestimated at the interpolated point especially when the elevation differences are large among the gridded points however the ecodistrict helps identify the numbers of gridded points that have the same physiographic characteristics this in turns provides a more representative estimation of precipitation amounts at the interpolated point four performance measures were calculated by comparing the interpolated values with the adjdlyrs station data these measures were used to assess the ability of the products to represent the daily variability of precipitation amounts percentage of bias p bias p root mean square error rmse mm correlation coefficient r p and standard deviation ratio σ g σ r as shown by eqs 1 4 respectively 1 p bias p i n g i r i i n r i 100 2 rmse i n g i r i 2 n 3 r p i n g i g i n r i r i n g i g 2 i n r i r 2 4 σ g σ r i n g i g 2 n i n r i r 2 n where g and r are the spatial average of the daily gridded precipitation product and the reference observation dataset adjdlyrs g and r are the daily mean of the gridded precipitation product and point station data over the study period respectively i is the i th day of the season or year and n is the total number of days in the season or year an overall performance measure grand p was also calculated by weighting equally the above four performance measures to identify the best basin wide precipitation product over the saskrb as shown by equation 5 5 grand p min r m s e a b s p bias p 1 r 1 σ g σ r since there are no reliable empirical evidences of how the four performance measures should be weighted equal weighting is assumed to provide the least biases due to subjectivity as the four performance measures examine different aspects of the precipitation products with p bias p for accuracy of product estimation rmse for magnitude of errors r p for strength and direction of the linear relationship between precipitation products and observed data and σ g σ r for amplitude of the variations a balanced performance among the four aspects was chosen to be the criteria for the identification of the best basin wide precipitation product in this study the second step is to examine the model performance of the precipitation candidates and assess how these products perform in streamflow simulations at annual and seasonal scales all precipitation products were spatially rescaled to the mesh model scale of 10 km via bi linear interpolation and temporally rescaled to the half hour by linear interpolation it is acknowledged that rescaling products onto model resolution using simple interpolation methods might introduce errors and uncertainties on simulation results however such rescaling is a necessary data processing step for running a model and so is common practice in hydrological modelling regarding temporal rescaling linear and uniform interpolations were tested and no major differences were seen on simulation results and the hydrological performance of each precipitation product therefore it is assumed that the impacts of the uncertainties due to the rescaling methods are minimal as compared to other uncertainties arising from data input model structure and parameters after rescaling each individual precipitation product was used to drive mesh with default parameterization for the years 2002 2010 the first year was used as a spin up period for model stability and the remaining years were used for model evaluation three performance measures were used to examine the goodness of fit on streamflow nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe on the logarithm of streamflow nse ln and percentage of bias p bias q as shown by eqs 6 8 respectively 6 nse 1 q sim q obs 2 q obs q obs 2 7 nse ln 1 ln q sim ln q obs 2 l n q obs l n q obs 2 8 p bias q q sim q obs q obs 100 where q sim and q obs are simulated and observed streamflow respectively and q obs is the daily mean of observed streamflow the value of nse varies between and 1 0 with an optimal value of one whereas the value of p bias q ranges between 100 to with an optimal value of 0 5 2 generation component the generation component was used to identify the best performing precipitation candidates based on their strengths in hydrological performance of streamflow simulations instead of determining the weights for each precipitation candidate based on its error characteristic the precipitation products were ranked by each performance measure the best performing precipitation product could be identified by choosing the performance measure that is fit for the modelling purpose for instance if the modelling application is to capture the low flow the nse ln can be used to find the best performing precipitation product unlike the analyses of previous studies that were computed for each grid cell and for each time step e g hazra et al 2019 yilmaz et al 2010 the ranking was conducted for each sub sub basin and on a seasonal or an annual basis because this is the spatial unit to which mesh integrates runoff to produce streamflow to illustrate the generation procedure the best candidate was selected based on nse only in this study at an annual scale for instance if capa had the highest nse value in a particular sub sub basin the entire time series of capa would be used for grids within this sub sub basin at a seasonal scale the best candidate would be selected for the individual seasons for instance if capa ranked first in spring and narr first in summer the generation procedure would use the capa time series covering every spring and the narr time series covering every summer the same practice was done for autumn and winter and the entire process was repeated for each sub sub basin the reason for using a sub sub basin as the target unit rather than a grid cell is to consider the spatial consistency over an area unless spatial correlation is added as a constraint or preserving spatial precipitation field is considered in the assessment assigning the best precipitation candidate on a grid by grid basis might disturb the spatial structure of a precipitation event also since the assessment is based on streamflow which represents the integrated hydrological response of a sub sub basin it is sensible to select the best precipitation candidate for that sub sub basin so that the runoff response could be maintained similarly applying the time series on a seasonal or an annual basis is to consider the time continuity that corresponds to the hydrological regime of a sub sub basin in cold continental regions like the saskrb streamflow is characterized by distinct hydrological processes such as snow accumulation in winter resulting in low flow and snowmelt in spring leading to typical peak flow by choosing the time periods of the best precipitation candidate that match the seasonal or annual streamflow regimes of the sub sub basin the respective hydrological characteristics could be retained 5 3 validation component the purpose of the validation component is to evaluate the model performance of the hybrid dataset using hydrological information e g streamflow and other hydrological fluxes and storage in this study streamflow information was primarily used as the main target for evaluation the best basin wide precipitation product was first identified by the lowest grand p and this was used as a benchmark to compare the streamflow simulations of the hybrid dataset an interpolated gauge based precipitation product could be more accurate than the basin wide product and be chosen as the benchmark however its accuracy is highly dependent on the representativeness of the locations of the precipitation gauge stations and requires a dense station network over the study area for the saskrb the network density is very low 0 001 station km2 as there are only 424 stations across the 406 000 km2 river basin and most of the stations are located at lower elevations in mountain valleys and foothills and so will not be able to represent precipitation amounts in the high mountains very well furthermore the anusplin precipitation product hopkinson et al 2011 hutchinson et al 2009 which is a daily gridded station based precipitation dataset across canada has been identified for its dry bias in the prairies wong et al 2017 therefore the best basin wide precipitation product was chosen as the benchmark to minimize the above issues the best precipitation product and hybrid dataset were used to re run the mesh model with the same model settings the comparison was done at the saskrb outlet and at the sub basin streamflow stations the three performance measures used to assess the goodness of fit on streamflow in the first component were calculated evapotranspiration fluxes and total water storage from remote sensing data were used as a supplement to further evaluate the model performance of the hybrid datasets the assessment was done by calculating and comparing the monthly basin scale average in particular the simulated tws anomaly was obtained by calculating the monthly simulated tws minus the average of tws time series for period 2003 2009 which is consistent with grace nrcan product two performance measures were used to examine the goodness of fit on the hydrological information percentage of bias p bias h and correlation coefficient r h as shown by eqs 9 and 10 respectively 9 p bias h h sim h obs h obs 100 10 r h j n h sim j h sim j n h obs j h obs j n h sim j h sim 2 j n h obs j h obs 2 where h refers to evapotranspiration fluxes et and total water storage tws when evaluating against gleam and grace nrcan anomaly data respectively h sim and h obs are the spatial average of the monthly simulated hydrological components and the reference observation dataset h sim and h obs are the monthly mean of the simulations and remote sensing data over the study period respectively j is the j th month of the year and n is the total number of months 6 results 6 1 evaluation of precipitation candidates the temporal variability of the gridded precipitation candidates was evaluated using the observations from the precipitation gauge stations across the saskrb the error characteristics of the precipitation candidates at seasonal and annual scales were first assessed in terms of accuracy p bias p magnitude of errors rmse correlation between the candidates and precipitation gauge stations r p and amplitude of the variations σ g σ r according to equations 1 to 4 respectively fig 4 in terms of accuracy all candidates generally showed an overall underestimation of precipitation amounts at an annual scale except for narr which provided a positive p bias p of 8 7 specifically princeton greatly underestimated the precipitation amounts in spring and winter by 18 7 and 27 0 respectively and capa in summer by 23 4 wfdei cru and wfdei gpcc shared a similar seasonal p bias p ranging from 15 5 to 2 3 regarding the magnitude of errors and correlation with observations princeton generally showed the overall highest rmse and lowest r p at both annual and seasonal scales whereas capa showed the reverse the overall lowest rmse and highest r p the performance of wfdei cru wfdei gpcc and narr were in between princeton and capa when the amplitude of variations were examined with the exception of princeton the variations of the candidates were all much smaller than those of the observed at an annual scale in which σ g σ r ranged from 0 73 capa to 0 79 wfdei gpcc the simulated streamflow generated by the precipitation candidates based on mesh h lsm was further evaluated using the 54 streamflow stations across the saskrb as reference points figs 5 and a1 as for the predictive power of the model fig 5a capa generally provided the best streamflow performance in more than half the stations with an average nse of 0 25 while wfdei gpcc had the second highest average nse of 0 17 similarly capa and wfdei gpcc performed better than the other precipitation candidates in simulating low flow fig 5b in particular capa and wfdei gpcc had good model performance in the upper south saskatchewan river basin stations 1 to 8 and the lower bow river basin stations 15 to 18 in summer fig a1 regarding the accuracy of the model performance fig 5c the underestimation of precipitation amounts of all precipitation candidates except for narr generally propagated through the model and revealed in the percentage of flow volume bias princeton and capa provided an average negative p bias q of 25 7 and 22 3 respectively whereas narr showed an average positive p bias q of 4 2 in particular all precipitation candidates generally overestimated the streamflow in the bow red deer and upper north saskatchewan river basins stations 9 to 33 in summer fig a1 6 2 generation of hybrid dataset the hybrid dataset was generated by choosing the best performing precipitation candidate for each sub sub basin based on the highest nse values fig 6 at an annual scale capa generally performed better than other precipitation candidates in several sub basins including the lower bow red deer battle upper north and lower upper south saskatchewan river basins whereas wfdei gpcc outperformed the others in the upper bow upper lower north and lower part of the lower south saskatchewan river basins fig 6e at a seasonal scale well mixed precipitation candidates were seen in each individual season for each precipitation candidate similar numbers of sub sub basins ranked first in spring and winter on the other hand capa had the highest nse values in 42 out of 79 sub sub basins in autumn when the precipitation candidates in summer periods were ranked capa tended to be the first in the north saskatchewan river basin whereas wfdei gpcc performed the best in the south saskatchewan river basin based on these combinations two hybrid datasets were created hybrid annual and hybrid seasonal which were used to run the mesh h lsm for model evaluation 6 3 comparison of model performance the best basin wide precipitation product was identified by calculating grand p at annual and seasonal scales table 2 capa outperformed other precipitation candidates with the lowest grand p at both temporal scales and was therefore used as a benchmark to compare the streamflow simulations of the hybrid datasets fig 7 shows the differences in model performance using nse between capa and the hybrid datasets generated based on annual evaluation fig 7a hybrid annual generally showed an overall improvement of model performance across the saskrb the performance of the south saskatchewan river basin noticeably improved nse difference 0 1 while that of the north saskatchewan river basin improved even more nse difference greater than 0 2 especially downstream of the river however hybrid seasonal did not consistently perform better than capa across the saskrb combinations of the best precipitation candidates in each season did not necessarily provide a better model performance than the best individual candidate in some regions where degradation of nse values were seen fig 7b although hybrid seasonal performed better than capa and even better than hybrid annual along the south saskatchewan river basin its performance tended to worsen in the headwaters of the upper north red deer and bow river basins this poor performance could be due to the response delay of rainfall runoff generation in cold regions the runoff mechanism is not only driven by the amount of precipitation in the concurrent season but also depended on the antecedent condition of previous seasons since most of the headwaters of the saskrb are of the nivo glacial regime the streamflow in spring and summer is highly reliant on the onset time of snowfall in the previous autumn the amount of snow accumulation in the previous winter and the amount of glacier snow melt in spring therefore in addition to the combination of hybrid datasets at a seasonal scale a new hybrid dataset hybrid bi seasonal was generated by grouping the individual seasons into two summer including june july and august and winter including the remaining months figure not shown hybrid bi seasonal was found to not only resolve the degradation of nse values as seen in hybrid seasonal but also to perform better and improve more than hybrid annual as shown in fig 7c fig 8 shows the comparison of mean annual hydrographs at sub basin outlets between capa and the hybrid datasets both hybrid datasets were able to better capture the peak flow than capa in the old man and bow river basins stations 6 and 20 respectively because capa dominated in the red deer battle and upper north saskatchewan river basins the differences in streamflow simulations between capa and the hybrid datasets were not visible however more obvious improvements of the hybrid datasets over capa were seen further downstream at stations 45 and 54 where significant reductions of peak flow 72 9 and 26 0 respectively were observed improvements of the hybrid datasets over capa were also seen in terms of streamflow volume fig 9 with well mixed precipitation candidates in the old man river basin station 6 both hybrid datasets were able to reduce the underestimation of streamflow volume from 27 3 capa to 5 9 hybrid annual and 2 8 hybrid bi seasonal similarly when going further downstream in the south saskatchewan river basin at station 48 capa provided a negative p bias q of 24 1 and the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal were able to decrease the p bias q to 18 9 and 23 4 respectively the model performance of the hybrid datasets in other hydrological components was evaluated at a basin scale using the observations from gleam fig 10 and grace nrcan fig 11 the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal captured the seasonal cycles of the evapotranspiration fluxes very well with r et of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively fig 10a while capa showed an overall underestimation of et of 5 7 both hybrid datasets were generally able to reduce the p bias e t to 5 4 and 5 2 respectively with slightly better estimations of the fluxes than capa in summer when larger values were observed fig 10b regarding the total water storage component fig 11 the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal generally followed the grace tws with r tws of 0 82 and 0 84 respectively both hybrid datasets were better in capturing the positive tws anomalies than capa however they showed larger underestimation of the negative tws anomalies than capa fig 11b overall the hybrid annual and hybrid bi seasonal provided a lower average positive p bias t w s of 41 7 and 40 2 than that of capa 45 7 7 discussion the evaluation of precipitation products in terms of streamflow simulations can provide a different insight on the quality of the precipitation products our results show that the best basin wide precipitation product capa in this case evaluated against the precipitation gauge stations did not necessarily have the best streamflow performance across the saskrb although capa performed the best of the precipitation candidates at the basin outlet station 54 poorer annual and seasonal performance was seen in some internal gauge stations this poor performance highlights that using precipitation gauge stations alone for evaluation is limited by the density of the station network and the spatial distribution of the stations the inadequacy of such traditional and common approaches is further magnified in large scale river basins especially when the need to accurately evaluate internal variations of the basin characteristics is increasing in this regard hydrological evaluation of the precipitation products can be viewed as a supplement for the limitations of direct evaluation to precipitation gauge stations the use of streamflow rather than other hydrological information e g evapotranspiration fluxes total water storage snow water equivalent is believed to be better because of its relatively smaller uncertainties however caution is still needed when using streamflow stations in cold regions owing to the ice conditions the impacts of observational uncertainties could be explored in future research the generation of hybrid datasets based on hydrological evaluation was shown to be useful for improving h lsm modelling skills the hybrid datasets performed better than the best basin wide precipitation products with similar or higher nse values and were better at capturing the peak flows in several stations while the hybrid datasets were able to maintain a good performance in the headwaters of the saskrb and the internal sub basins the cumulative effect of having locally best performing precipitation candidates was more evident further downstream and at the basin outlet there are clear advantages of generating hybrid datasets which are potentially more beneficial than the individual products for hydrological modelling in large scale river basins such as the one in this study however the value of combining multiple precipitation products may decrease when one individual product dominates over the area of interest this is especially true when the generation of a hybrid dataset is based on evaluation against a limited number of in situ precipitation gauge stations if generated in this way the hybrid dataset can resemble the dataset of the individual product e g eum and gupta 2019 the hybrid datasets generated in eum and gupta 2019 were dominated by the two best performing precipitation products over the athabasca river basin resulting in marginal improvements differences between the hybrid and the best precipitation product similar situations were seen in our study where capa the best basin wide precipitation product generally performed the best in some saskrb sub basins however we argue that using additional information streamflow in our case when generating the hybrid dataset could largely reduce the dominance of one individual precipitation product when multiple precipitation products are combined seasonality should be properly considered in relation to hydrological processes in assessing precipitation candidates at a seasonal scale it is intuitive to expect the combination of the best performing candidates for each individual season to give better hydrological simulations than the individual products however our results show that these combinations were not necessarily the best performers across the whole river basin some regions experienced a decline in model performance as compared to the best basin wide precipitation product we found that one precipitation candidate that consistently performed the best across autumn winter and spring was better than the three best candidates for the respective seasons this result implies that aligning the assessment of the precipitation products with the rain snow regime and the cold region hydrological processes would provide a more sensible hybrid dataset for cold region river basins especially in headwaters where the model performance was shown to be more sensitive the proposed framework provides a systematic and flexible way to generate hybrid datasets based on the users needs the fundamental idea behind such a framework is that different precipitation products have the best hydrological performance over different regions in different seasons of a large scale river basin unlike the single optimal hybrid dataset predetermined by certain criteria the hybrid datasets generated in this framework are dynamic in the sense that the combinations change according to the modelling purposes the use of performance measures and the number of precipitation candidates this framework is designed for modelling the historical records by recognizing and maximizing the strengths of each individual precipitation product in simulating the observed streamflow during the generation process therefore the current application mainly focuses on regions historical conditions with limited climate station data and hydrological simulations of streamflow and the modelling driven by the hybrid dataset offers the potential to deal with multi dimensional water security issues e g flooding drought and the combination of both under changing climate however it is important to note that our approach is not intended to make future precipitation estimates as the combination method may change the underlying precipitation statistics and the hybrid dataset may present different statistical properties in terms of frequency distribution timing of the wet dry seasons and extreme values despite the proposed framework s flexibility the hydrological performance s robustness could be hindered by uncertainties arising from various sources differences in streamflow simulations across the river basin and deviations among the precipitation products could be seen and this could mainly result from the interaction between the quality of the precipitation products and the model itself qi et al 2016 the uncertainties and errors from streamflow observation could also contribute to the variations yet the impact is possibly minimal conversely the uncertainties and errors in the precipitation products could be amplified or dampened in the streamflow simulations due to the highly non linear nature of the hydrological process interactions also variations in streamflow performance among the precipitation candidates are generally larger for small basin areas revealing the accuracy of the precipitation products reduces with decreasing size of the considered basins camici et al 2018 on the other hand compensation by model parameters for the precipitation errors is minimal in this study since the parameter values were not calibrated to any of the precipitation candidates however this comes as a cost of potentially having not optimal hydrological performance e g low nse values otherwise the interaction of parameter uncertainties with other uncertainties could overshadow the combination process calibration through optimization might reduce input and modelling limitations likewise the systematic deviations of each precipitation product could be minimized by using p bias q as the selection criteria for the best performing precipitation candidate or by doing bias correction first before combining the products to properly consider bias correction the interdependence of precipitation and temperature is crucial for modelling hydrological processes in cold regions such as our study area because the precipitation temperature correlation can influence the transition between rainfall and snowfall and also the snowmelt process chen et al 2018 meyer et al 2019 however bias correction and calibration are not always sufficient to achieve satisfying performances and improve hydrological simulations camici et al 2018 further research is needed to examine the usefulness of different multiplicative bias correction methods and to account for parameter uncertainty with a thorough calibration strategy 8 conclusions obtaining reliable and accurate gridded precipitation estimates to meet the growing demand for better hydrological simulations and predictions remains a challenge existing precipitation products are often shown to have various degrees of accuracy over different regions and their robustness decreases when they are evaluated against only sparse in situ precipitation gauge station networks this study thus proposed a methodological framework to combine multiple precipitation products based on ranking the hydrological performance of each product at a sub sub basin scale three conclusions can be drawn based on the above analysis 1 the best basin wide precipitation product evaluated using the precipitation gauge stations as a reference point does not necessarily show the best hydrological performance across a large scale river basin owing to the sparse and unevenly distributed station network 2 hybrid datasets show equally good or better model performance as compared to the best basin wide precipitation product in the headwaters and gradually perform better further downstream and at the basin outlet given the cumulative effect of combining the best performing precipitation candidates in sub sub basins and 3 better streamflow simulations of the hybrid dataset generated at a bi seasonal scale as compared to a seasonal scale in the headwaters indicate the importance of seasonality with respect to the hydrological regime of the river basin when generating the hybrid dataset this study demonstrated the applicability of the proposed methodological framework over the saskatchewan river basin and showed the advantages of hybrid datasets in a large scale river basin with a sparse precipitation gauge station network further research could assess the framework in regions with different hydro climatic regimes at a continental global scale while considering observational uncertainties of the additional information used to assess the precipitation products credit authorship contribution statement jefferson s wong conceptualization methodology formal analysis

3889,accurate and timely flood forecasts are critical for protecting people and infrastructure in a changing climate satellite remote sensing provides the necessary wide area coverage and period revisits to measure episodic heavy precipitation and resultant urban floods we propose two methods to assimilate satellite observed precipitation into hydrologic models in real time to update flood forecasts bypassing two previous barriers in this technology infrequent satellite overpasses and long model run times constellations of small satellites overcomes the first barrier by providing frequent flights over an area of interest however these constellations require coordination and planning to capture precipitation data where it is most needed to inform flood forecasts the primary purpose of this paper is to address the second barrier that is high computational costs that make it infeasible to run flood forecast models on board these satellites so that they can re orient to measure where most needed we develop a simple regression based approach and a machine learning framework long short term memory lstm models to provide reliable flood forecasts using satellite observed precipitation at a fraction of the computational cost of physics based hydrologic models we apply these approaches to a test case for the atlanta metropolitan region using the weather research and forecasting model hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro to simulate flooding across the model domain for several precipitation events we compare the accuracy of our proposed approaches to the wrf hydro model using different spatial extents and temporal frequencies of precipitation observations to examine different plausible satellite constellation scenarios the lstm approach trades performance accuracy and adaptability for computational efficiency which can be important in a time and resource constrained scenario the lstm model reduces total error up to 38 from an initial flood forecast additionally this approach correctly classified flooding to within one flood magnitude category in 90 of cases these new forecasting algorithms can be used onboard constellations of small satellites to observe ongoing flood events update short term predictions and schedule observations to maximize useful measurements and thereby improve flood warning systems for protecting residents and properties keywords wrf hydro lstm urban flooding adaptive sensing remote sensing 1 introduction remotely sensed observations from satellites play a critical role in today s disaster forecast systems the observations made by satellites along with those made by terrestrial sensors are assimilated into global and regional numerical weather prediction nwp models to provide improved forecasts and give actionable intelligence to the local authorities satellites and their corresponding instruments are expensive resources for example the soil moisture active passive smap mission nasa 2020 which consists of a single satellite with a radar and radiometer instrument radar unit currently non functional costs nearly 1 billion usd and takes 3 days to map the entire world efforts are underway to develop cheaper observational platforms consisting of several smaller satellites in a distributed layout where constellations are the most common geometric configuration examples of hydrology relevant constellation missions are the cygnss ruf et al 2018 in orbit tempest reising et al 2018 in development tropics blackwell et al 2018 in development and raincube peral et al 2015 in orbit the schedule of locations and times for the observations to be made by a satellite is calculated by ground computers with human input and is uploaded to the satellites via ground stations during intermittent overpasses currently many satellites can obtain infrequent data and coverage of specific areas for example the geos 5 model uses amalgamated data from a variety of sources such as noaa s polar orbiting weather satellites as well as the aqua and ssm i instruments which have a spatial resolution of upwards of tens to hundreds of km depending on the backscatter frequency rienecker et al 2008 the satellites that carry these instruments are multi generational governmental assets and thus are few in number allowing them to take only precise localized observations due to orbital constraints with the advent of satellite swarms and constellations it has become possible to observe different regions and to gather data globally at larger spatial extents while sacrificing some of the precision afforded by highly calibrated instrumentation although the latter characteristic lends itself poorly to detailed modeling the highly parallel nature of distributed satellite operations allows for quick reaction and agile maneuvering that were previously not possible due to the dynamic nature of satellite and ground point access opportunities observations made by satellites are expected to be sparse even as constellations grow given this sparse opportunity and cost of resources to make observations power data limits it is always more efficient to capture data which has been predicted to be useful rather than to first capture an observation and later determine its utility ravindra et al 2020 this motivates the concept of adaptive sensing nag et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 1 wherein past observations are processed and information extracted from them is used to forecast the utility of future observations which then informs the observation planner all onboard the satellite without humans or ground stations in the loop while this basic framework is relevant to remote observation of a variety of phenomena e g tropical storms forest fires etc this paper focuses on transient precipitation and urban floods generally adaptive sensing requires a simulator of the phenomenon of interest which can rapidly perform data assimilation and forecasting so that the observation plan of the satellites can be updated with minimal latency physics based nwp hydrological models such as the weather research and forecasting hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro provide state of art accurate forecasts but in turn require larger computing resources than those available onboard satellites the most rapidly adaptive set up would be a simulator onboard the satellite which can assimilate the previous observations on the fly and produce updated forecasts which dictate the next set of observations to be made to enable adaptive sensing by future satellites onboard autonomy is required in processing instrumental data in predicting future observables and in planning and implementing observation schedules to maximize science utility such a sense plan act feedback loop would run in real time i e make the satellite completely autonomous and is thus constrained by limited satellite resources as well as physical processes such as orbital dynamics nag et al 2019 it is also possible to run the sense plan act in conjunction with the ground station wherein the satellite observations would be downlinked to the ground station which can process them extract information assimilate the data issue forecasts and update the observation plan for the satellite the new plan would be uplinked to the satellite upon the next overpass while moving the bulk of the computation to ground computers reduces the need for onboard resources and still keeps the human out of the loop this sense plan act loop has much longer delay times due to the sparsity of satellite ground station contacts this paper focuses on the forecast module of the adaptive sensing loop the box in fig 1 for the presented application satellites make radar based precipitation measurements as they fly over urban regions and use these measurements as direct input to predict flood levels in small to medium sized streams which are otherwise not directly observable from space onboard planners can then use these flood predictions to schedule and focus satellites observations upon areas of higher urgency e g more flooding and save the opportunity cost of observing locations with negligible flood activity previously large spacecraft e g eo 1 have been tasked to observe large floods e g in thailand using ground based infrastructure for processing assimilation and scheduling chien et al 2019 recently improvements in onboard autonomy on smaller satellites doubleday et al 2015 and full body re orientation agility on larger satellites have created the potential to run the scheduler on the satellites themselves followed by re orientation of the instruments or entire satellite to track scheduled ground points nag et al 2018 while ground support will always remain as a backup for planning onboard operations the limited contact frequency is better utilized in communicating high level goals and data a few times a day while lower level decisions in observational planning can be migrated to the satellites discretion over time the benefits further amplify when multiple satellites can coordinate their observations by communicating inferences and plans nag et al 2020b thus circumventing the lengthy delay of communicating with ground based relays while observing fast evolving or transient phenomena linnabary et al 2019 such as urban floods this paper has two objectives propose and investigate alternative flood simulation models that are less computationally expensive than a standard physics based model wrf hydro such that these models can run on satellites as part of the onboard predictor and scheduler that enable adaptive and responsive remote sensing compare the prediction accuracy of these alternative flood models to wrf hydro for a range of satellite observation frequencies and spatial coverages with the goal to show that loss in accuracy is within acceptable levels that justify the benefits of near real time planning and execution the document is organized as follows in section 2 we provide background on flood forecasting and machine learning techniques in section 3 we discuss the test case application to modeling riverine flooding in the atlanta metropolitan region including the development of two computationally efficient flood prediction approaches section 4 describes the results of this modeling and section 5 discusses the significance of these findings and suggests areas for improvement 2 background 2 1 flood forecasting flooding is one of the most common and expensive natural disasters worldwide and flood risks are increasing due to climate change development and population growth andersen and shepherd 2013 traditionally flood monitoring is achieved using networks of real time stream gaging stations such as the network operated by the u s geological survey these data are also used in conjunction with hydrologic models to forecast river discharge and flood risk at a variety of temporal scales i e hours days or weeks these hydrologic models require recent and forecasted precipitation as an input data that may come from a variety of sensors and weather models observed precipitation data are typically obtained from gauges radar or satellite sensors li et al 2016 regardless of the source these data can be used to update flood forecast models over time and improve accuracy flood forecasting using coupled atmospheric hydrologic hydraulic modeling is maturing and can be applied at a variety of scales for example the global flood monitoring system uses satellite based precipitation and a hydrologic model to simulate river flooding for most of the globe wu et al 2014 at a coarse spatial 12 km and temporal scale 3 h that may miss short flood events on small and medium sized streams in the u s the national weather service continuously updates streamflow forecasts at millions of points throughout the country salas et al 2018 while another system uses radar derived precipitation data to simulate flash floods gourley et al 2017 these tools tend to be complex and data intensive requiring significant resources to run of particular concern is the availability of reliable precipitation data to generate initial flood forecasts and to update those forecasts as additional precipitation data become available satellite derived precipitation estimates can be useful for this purpose and are especially important for developing countries without the resources to develop extensive ground based sensor networks to monitor both precipitation and river flooding rahman and di 2017 2 2 neural networks in the last decade neural networks have been at the forefront of machine learning ml and artificial intelligence research their successful application in a wide range of problems from image classification krizhevsky et al 2012 to self enabled reinforcement learning mnih et al 2013 have paved the way for widespread adoption of these methods and have started to influence data driven methods within earth science as well chen et al 2016 li et al 2020 we will provide here an overview of artificial neural networks particularly long short term memory lstm models which will form the basis of our ml methodology neural networks are loosely modelled after the structure of the human brain by mimicking layers of cascading neurons transporting electrical signals neurons that activate together tend increasingly to do so over time which gives rise to complex capabilities such as pattern recognition and perception the basic equation for each neuron within a neural network is described as 1 z f w x b where z is the output w the weights to be learned x the input and b the bias with the symbol representing multiplication although this can be extended to the hadamard product or convolution generally w can also represent a tensor with a set number of filters k such that if x is a vector of length n and w is of size k n the resulting z will be of length k the nonlinear activation function f relates the importance of the linear output and although historically the sigmoid function has be utilized to bound the output between 0 and 1 the rectified linear unit rlu is more widely adopted due to its numerical and backpropagation properties nair and hinton 2010 often these neurons are stacked in layers such that the output of one layer acts as the input to the next layer of particular interest is the recurrent neural network rnn and its variant the lstm depicted in fig 2 the structure of the rnn works well for sequential data and one of the more successful applications of this was in language translation tasks wu et al 2016 at its core the rnn allows for chain like structures consisting of identical recurring cell blocks a which takes an input x and outputs a result h however an additional output c known as the cell state is also generated which is passed into the next recurring block and is meant to retain some of the memory that lingers from previous cell blocks in this way certain features from previous states that might be important are encoded within the cell state which may affect later outputs the lstm is an improvement on the original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 by incorporating additional interactions per cell block namely we include the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions to the equations such that we can manipulate the importance of the input allow for previous cell states to expire or be forgotten add to the existing cell states and to generate an output relevant to the current input olah 2015 further variants of the lstm have been developed such as the gated recurrent unit gru which increases the complexity of each cell chung et al 2015 however the adaptation of this network structure can be readily obvious given the inputs x precipitation and static physical characteristics we can generate flood outputs h per time step while keeping the internal weights and biases of each cell state identical across all time steps furthermore if we can generalize the model of the river flow encapsulated and described by cell a then we can apply the lstm across all river flows furthermore concepts such as water retention and delayed flows can be represented by the cell state c while not perfect this model is much simpler than physics based hydrological models and thus has the potential to be ported onto satellite systems which are resource constrained the idea of utilizing rnns and lstms for modelling hydrological processes is not a new one a variety of machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to forecast river flows yaseen et al 2019 including lstm models kratzert et al 2018 however in many cases lstms have been used to forecast flows in larger rivers over long time scales e g daily or monthly flows kao et al 2020 le et al 2019 one study applied lstms to short flash flood events through a large mountainous watershed song et al 2020 while others have incorporated lstms into an urban flood warning system lee et al 2020 lstms have also been used to improve rainfall forecasts which were then fed into a hydrologic model for flood prediction nguyen and bae 2020 in our work we applied lstms to forecast sub hourly streamflow in an urban setting using a bare bones approach requiring minimal computational complexity it is our goal to demonstrate the validity and potential for fast and reliable onboard prediction of flash flooding events on satellites without ground based communication allowing for agile maneuvering of satellite resources in a time sensitive environment 3 methodology this section proposes methods for data assimilation and forecasting to inform the satellite scheduler s future plans the models are built to enable adaptive sensing such that the location of future satellite observations can be determined as a function of past observations furthermore these models can either be run in a centralized ground based location with the results uplinked to the constellations or run on every satellite in the constellation instead the spatial resolution is a function of the geographic extent of locations of interest and the instrument field of view e g rain radar the temporal resolution or re run cadence is a function of the size of the constellation since more satellites allow more measurements and therefore more updates our proposed methods are generalizable to many natural phenomena where satellite observations of ongoing events can be incorporated into forecast models e g wildfires or hurricanes the subsections below use representative examples of a constellation adaptively sensing a flood event in a single city they are also easily extendable to multiple floods in various locations around the globe 3 1 observing system simulations the goal of this paper is to report the accuracy of forecast algorithms that can run near real time onboard satellites specifically we are looking to predict river flooding as a function of observed transient precipitation over a specific city over a predefined duration of time wherein parts of the city can be sporadically observed by satellite overpasses to decouple satellite dynamics from the predictor problem the proposed flood forecasting models are applied for custom variable samples in space and time from a satellite s perspective all regions of interests across the globe can be spatially discretized into grid cells of any spatial resolution any of these grid cells can be observed any time a satellite overpasses onboard autonomy models can then be updated with new predictions for every set of observations while the results presented in this paper are unique to our chosen test case the basic sampling approach is generalizable across any urban region with small streams and can be adapted to any combination of sampling frequency and spatial extent i e any constellation topology we chose the atlanta metropolitan area as our test case we modeled riverine flooding using the wrf hydro hydrologic model version 5 gochis et al 2018 fig 3 wrf hydro is a distributed hydrologic model that links a land surface model noah mp niu et al 2011 with terrain and channel flow routing modules to simulate streamflow while wrf hydro can be coupled to the weather research and forecasting wrf weather model skamarock et al 2008 we ran wrf hydro in uncoupled mode instead supplying it with meteorological forcing data primarily precipitation from the north american land data assimilation system nldas hourly time step 4 4 km spatial resolution the model was run for a 72 72 km area with a grid resolution of 900 m for the land surface model and 30 m for the terrain and channel routing while this grid resolution is relatively coarse especially for urban areas we were in part limited by the resolution of model inputs e g digital elevation model land cover furthermore terrain and channel routing resolutions as coarse as 250 m have been shown to be adequate for modeling flooding in urban areas kim et al 2021 we incorporated both surface and subsurface flow routing and used the muskingum cunge cunge 1969 gochis et al 2018 reach based channel routing option model streamflow was output at 15 minute time steps this temporal resolution was chosen because a satellite overpass for any ground target can be as frequent as every 15 min for a constellation with dozens of satellites in low earth orbit most major model inputs e g soil parameters land use and land surface model variables were obtained from the wrf preprocessing system wps data download website ncar 2020 hydro enforced digital elevation models dem representing local topography were obtained from the usgs national hydrography dataset v2 nhd v2 we manually edited some of this dem to remove bridges and allow accurate flow routing wrf hydro was calibrated by trial and error by adjusting several static landscape and soil variables table 1 all parameters except refkdt were simply scaled higher or lower from their starting value a function of land use or soil type refkdt was calibrated in a spatially explicit way based on average percent impervious cover for each grid cell estimated from 2016 national land cover database nlcd data yang et al 2018 areas with higher imperviousness were given lower refkdt values less infiltration we therefore account for some of the high spatial variability in land cover present in urban areas we use wrf hydro s results to train computationally efficient models that can run onboard satellites introduced in the next section this paper does not seek to verify the accuracy of or improve wrf hydro and our approach would hold if we replaced wrf hydro with a different physics based model with better forecast accuracy because our simpler forecasting methods could be trained on that instead the purpose of the wrf hydro model was to provide a test case for which we could develop and apply these alternative simpler flood forecasting approaches the goal was not to perfectly simulate a specific flood event but instead to capture physically realistic spatial and temporal patterns of flooding in an urban area we could use only observed river discharge data for this analysis however these data are available only at a few discrete monitoring sites modeling on the other hand provides simulated river discharge at all points along the entire stream network still the wrf hydro model does not account for many hydrologic complexities in urban areas such as stormwater pipes reservoirs or other infrastructure despite this simplification the model results provide a useful and physically realistic flood case based on model calibration and verification that enables us to test our proposed flood forecasting methods wrf hydro was calibrated on a single storm event during april 5 6 2017 modeled streamflow was compared to hydrographs from nine u s geologic survey usgs gages in the atlanta metro area table s1 details on usgs stream gaging methods can be found in carter and davidian 1968 the calibrated model was then validated on a separate storm event on june 20 21 2017 for both model calibration and validation a roughly 4 month model spin up period was used model performance was assessed using two metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias nse is a common measure of hydrologic model performance and ranges from worst to one best 2 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 is the mean of observed discharges q m t is the modeled discharge at time t and q 0 t is the observed discharge at time t percent bias ranges from to with negative values indicating under prediction of discharge positive values indicating over prediction of discharge 3 pbias t 1 t q m t q 0 t t 1 t q 0 t 100 the calibrated model results were also used to develop flood values to be used by the satellite scheduling optimizer this flood value was representative of the areas where satellite measured precipitation would be most valuable for assessing flood risk modeled channel discharge was scaled by an estimate of what constituted a flood at each location for simplicity we used the 2 year recurrence interval flow rate q2 the flow that has a 50 chance of happening in any year as this is a rough estimate of the flow that completely fills a river channel williams 1978 for each stream reach q2 was estimated from the usgs regional regression equations for urban streams in the region feaster et al 2014 flood value was thus defined as 4 flood v a l q m q 2 each stream reach has a single value of q 2 based on watershed area and percent of impervious cover however the modeled flow rate q m is output every 15 min for each stream reach therefore both q m and flood v a l vary through time at each location we also examined categorical flood magnitude the national weather service nws defines four flood stages based on impacts to surrounding infrastructure and property action minor moderate and major floods for all active stream gages in georgia with nws flood stages we converted these stages to discharges based on the published usgs gage rating curve and then calculated their corresponding flood v a l using these gage derived values we estimated flood v a l cutoffs that corresponded to each of these nws flood stages this provided a more realistic assessment of relative flood impacts separation of the flooding values based upon the nws categorization of flood intensity into categories is as follows 0 q m q 2 0 7 n o f l o o d 0 7 q m q 2 1 a c t i o n 1 q m q 2 1 6 m i n o r 1 6 q m q 2 2 4 m o d e r a t e 5 2 4 q m q 2 m a j o r we used the output from the wrf hydro model to develop two simplified models to update flood predictions with the satellite observed precipitation data the first is a simple regression based approach and the second uses a machine learning framework results from both methods were compared to the calibrated results of wrf hydro which is taken as the true flood magnitudes for the study area 3 2 prediction using a regression model initially we developed a simple linear regression model to update flood values across the model domain based on new precipitation data to explore the relationship between precipitation and flood value several wrf hydro simulations were run the precipitation from the april 5 6 2017 event was taken as baseline rainfall and was varied artificially to give several sets of precipitation inputs precipitation was uniformly scaled by values from 2 to 10 and 1 2 10 e g 1 10 1 9 1 8 8 9 10 the original precipitation this captured how increasing or decreasing rainfall would translate to changes in river discharge and flood magnitude and provided a larger dataset to fit the regression model there was a clear non linear relationship between change in precipitation and changes in flood magnitude across the stream network with all reductions in precipitation below ½ essentially reducing discharge to the same low value e g scaling precipitation by 1 3 or 1 5 essentially resulted in no flooding therefore further analysis focused only on cases where precipitation was scaled by 1 2 or greater for the cases where precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 a simple regression function was fit to the data to predict new flood v a l based on the old flood v a l the magnitude of the precipitation change and the static watershed characteristics da drainage area refkdt infiltration parameter and ksat saturated hydraulic conductivity for cases where precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 flood v a l n e w is assumed to be simply precip o b s precip m o d times flood v a l o l d the equations that describe this regression model are as follows 6 flood v a l n e w f l o o d v a l o l d precip o b s precip m o d 1 1 746 f l o o d v a l o l d 5 63 x 10 4 d a 3 6 x 10 2 r e f k d t 4 26 x 10 5 k s a t f o r precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 7 flood v a l n e w precip o b s precip m o d f l o o d v a l o l d f o r precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 in all cases precip m o d is the initial estimate forecast of precipitation and precip o b s is the observed precipitation the ratio precip o b s precip m o d represents the ratio of how much higher or lower this observed precipitation is compared to the initial estimate this regression model requires an initial prediction of flooding flood v a l o l d that is it takes some forecast of streamflow and updates this forecasted value based on differences in observed and forecasted precipitation this is different than the machine learning approach see below which predicts stream discharge through successively iterating upon the cell state requiring an initial condition of no previous precipitation and streamflow for the very first timestep 3 3 prediction using machine learning the overarching goal for developing ml based models for flood prediction was that this simpler approach could produce comparable outputs to that of high fidelity hydrology models such as wrf hydro but with only a fraction of the necessary computational resources and runtime our models do not aim to be as accurate as wrf hydro rather the aim is to produce results that are good enough and are able to be run on constrained satellite platforms these quick onboard estimates can direct satellites to observe locations where additional data are most valuable without the need for ground based planning and delayed data transfers the general framework for the model is such that each stream is represented as a node each node takes an input i consisting of the precipitation and any stream specific domain parameters table 2 and outputs the flow rate q subscripts u and d represent upstream and downstream respectively wrf hydro reports the total flow rate q total which consists of all upstream flows as well as the flow within the current stream due to local precipitation thus we are able to create a graph network structure for the entire river system each node represents the local flow q due to local precipitation which when combined with other local flows generate q total the building blocks of this network structure is shown in fig 4 during training the nodes are trained upon a randomized selection of streams from wrf hydro using the average precipitation over the grid points where the stream flows through initially we recognize there are two types of streams headwaters and non headwaters headwater nodes are essentially where the entire streamflow network begins and thus have no input flow apart from possible groundwater and minute sources which we ignore whereas all other nodes are non headwater the distinction is important since wrf hydro does not report q for headwater nodes and thus their output must be inferred continuing to organize the entire streamflow structure we separate the types of inflow combinations into three types hh nh or nn where h represents headwater nodes and n represents non headwater nodes i e nh would represent a non headwater node combining with a headwater node the difference between these three combinations is mainly due to the training structure hh will require three sets of inputs nh will require two sets of inputs while nn will only require one set of inputs in addition hh will only require q total for the downstream node while nh and nn will also require wrf generated q total values for the respective upstream nodes during training continuing this logic one can construct the entire stream flow network from these basic building blocks as a graph network shown in fig 5 here we make an important definition the order of a stream node is the maximum distance of the node to any headwater node including itself thus as the network flows downstream the order continuously increases with large rivers associated with higher order values each stream node is modeled as an lstm block containing 128 filters followed by 2 dense layers of filter sizes 16 and 1 respectively applied upon the lstm output shown in fig 6 in total this constitutes 71 201 total trainable parameters a total of roughly 300 kb in size it is also important to note that all stream nodes are represented as identically structured lstms across all types of stream flow structures the reasoning behind this is to only require saving one set of variables that can be applied across all stream flows being as general as possible while keeping the overall memory and computational requirements manageable however due to the availability of output data recall that wrf does not produce q for headwater nodes training the lstm is accomplished by considering the three types of stream flow structures separately each with its own appropriate number of inputs outputs for example the case with no headwaters is arguably the simplest as both q t o t a l u 1 and q t o t a l u 2 from upstream nodes can be taken directly from wrf and only one set of inputs is required for the node to generate its own q before summation and comparison to the wrf output q total the lstm we applied consists of 40 time steps i e 10 h at 15 min time steps for the purposes of training starting from an initial condition of no precipitation and ideally no or low stream flow theoretically we are not limited to a set number of time steps since we can continue to add lstm nodes per additional timestep as necessary we randomly select portions of the entire stream flow network during training taking note and feeding relevant stream parameters into its corresponding stream flow structure all inputs are normalized against their respective maximum and minimum values such that they ideally range from 1 to 1 the only exception here is q since the summation of two negative values will yield a larger negative value and so it is instead normalized from 0 to 1 the final error is defined as the difference between the wrf generated q total and the lstm model generated q total since the problem is one of regression we tested both mean squared error as well as absolute squared error as error metrics during prediction we added an artificial lag of one timestep 15 min to the downflow q during summation for every five stream nodes such that it mimicked the nature of downstream flow although this is a simplification encoding such a step within the lstm would require training a larger lstm that can capture this type of delay as well as scaling flood flows accordingly between two very different streams as such we opted for a simpler solution here that does not require additional training 3 4 simulation setup to assess the prediction accuracy of the update models regression and lstm we must first standardize the method in which we discretize the landscape from the satellite s perspective the regression model is run for every modeled stream reach based on average observed parameters i e precipitation saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat infiltration parameter refkdt in the contributing watershed similarly every stream reach is treated as its own lstm neural network while this can yield detailed results the satellite needs to be scheduled to point toward a vector of spatial points at scheduled times the landscape is therefore discretized into equally spaced regular grid cells of a size comparable to the satellite s field of view we assigned the stream reach based predictions of flood magnitude from the regression and lstm models to the appropriate grid cell or cells nearest to this reach if more than one stream reach intersects a grid point the highest predicted flood value is used these grid based flood values would then be sent to the satellites to inform where to make future observations note that satellites can only observe the amount of precipitation falling over an area and thus must infer the flow rate q from models we created an initial precipitation forecast for the region and subsequent flood forecast from wrf hydro but with every observation in space and time this precipitation map is updated and fed to either the regression or lstm model to predict new river flood values the stream network consists of a total of 7 013 reaches spread over a total of 79 79 high resolution grid cells 0 9 0 9 km fig 7 the satellite is scheduled to observe a low resolution version of the area with approximately 8 8 km cells thereby the entire map is spread over 11 11 grid cells when the satellite observes one of these 11 11 gridpoints all high resolution gridpoints within the larger satellite observation area observed and may have different precipitation rates satellites may be scheduled to observe a varying number of grid cells each time they pass over an area as well as varying timing between these observation cycles since we treat every 15 min as one timestep within our forecast simulation the highest observable scenario is one in which every one of the 121 grid cells are observed every 15 min varying these observational parameters we discretize our simulation to observe a varying 30 50 75 100 or 121 grid cells per observation cycle with observation intervals occurring either 15 30 60 120 or 180 min apart observed grid cells were randomly selected but remained consistent among all models tested the lower bound of sampling frequency is limited to once every 3 h because ground stations of commercial satellite constellations are able to establish space ground contact between their assets every 4 6 h and we wanted to demonstrated the benefits of onboard autonomy if updates can be made at higher frequency the prediction accuracy of the simple regression and machine learning approaches was assessed based on precipitation observations at the various number of grid cells and observation cycles these two approaches were also compared to flood forecast updates using the wrf hydro model at these same update frequencies e g these updated precipitation forecasts were fed through the wrf hydro model to generate new flood forecasts at each time step these tests were run on the same april 5 6 2017 rainfall event used in the wrf hydro calibration the nldas precipitation data was taken to be the true precipitation values for this event we developed a synthetic initial forecast of precipitation for this event by perturbing the true values using a gaussian random filter both these precipitation data were run through wrf hydro to yield a true flood scenario and an initial flood forecast fig 8 the error between the forecast and true flooding is the initial error the simple regression and lstm update approaches should then reduce this error by incorporating different amounts of observed true precipitation areas that were not observed by the satellite are assigned their initial forecasted precipitation values we applied our update methods to a 10 h period april 5 10 00 april 5 20 00 where most of the flooding occurred error was quantified based on differences in predicted and true categorical flood magnitudes based on nws flood categories eq 5 as well as calculated flood values q m q 2 using normalized values is useful when comparing streams of different sizes and behaviors since large rivers will consistently have higher flow rate q when compared to smaller streams furthermore using flood categories allows us to generalize the importance of different degrees of flooding while ignoring the smaller errors that exist within the prediction of the raw stream flow itself finally flood categories are most representative of the severity of flood impacts and are standard forecast communication tools used in the u s while categorical data should generally not be treated as numeric flood categories are ordered and are nearly linearly related eq 5 computing average categorical errors see below is therefore an appropriate and useful metric for comparing performance between our models these errors can be calculated on stream based or grid based results stream based error is calculated for every stream reach simulated in the model grid based error is calculated based on flood values assigned from these modeled stream reaches to the 79 79 model grid both stream based and grid based error is calculated as follows 8 e x t f x t f x t where e x t is error and f and f represent the predicted e g lstm and real categorical or numeric flood values respectively this provides error for every location x either stream reach or grid cell and time step t we can also average error over time and or location mean flood error at each time step can be calculated as follows 9 e t 1 n x f x t f x t where n is the total number of stream reaches or grid cells we can average across both space and time to get a single error metric for a given model scenario this mean flood error is calculated as 10 e 1 tn t x f x t f x t where t is the total number of prediction cycles we use this average error metric to compare model errors across different satellite observation parameters i e number of cells observed and observation frequency 4 results 4 1 wrf hydro model calibration and validation the wrf hydro model was calibrated to match observed hydrographs from nine usgs stream gages in the atlanta metro area for a storm event on april 5 6 2017 mean nse was 0 33 and mean percent bias was 32 fig 9 modeled flows matched observed flows well for some gages but under or over predicted peak flow rates at others gages with multiple peaks were reasonably well captured by wrf hydro validation performance was similar june 20 21 2017 storm event with a mean nse of 0 51 and percent bias of 42 fig s1 in both the calibration and validation negative bias indicates a consistent under prediction of discharge this is primarily because the model seems to be under predicting runoff volume i e area under the hydrograph even if the peak flow rates were relatively well simulated for most sites model errors may be a result of simplifications in the model itself or incorrect parameterization wrf hydro is a relatively coarse scale model 30 30 m resolution for overland flow routing and we do not incorporate any stormwater infrastructure reservoirs or other complexity in this highly urban area that affects runoff rates and volumes additionally the under prediction of runoff volume may suggest that too much infiltration is being simulated however additional tuning of calibration parameters did not result in significantly improved model performance despite this systematic under prediction of runoff volume and errors in the absolute value of flood peaks the calibrated wrf hydro predicts the relative magnitude of flooding for most gages the model captures where high flows occur and where they do not especially visible in the validation results which is important for our interests of determining when and where floods are occurring although accuracy would ideally be higher these model results still serve as a useful realistic test case for comparison to our proposed flood forecasting methods 4 2 flood forecast update performance we compared the performance of the simple regression model update and the lstm update approach to the performance of the wrf hydro model for forecasting flooding for the april 5 6 2017 storm event the accuracy of the flood update function generally improved as more precipitation data were incorporated fig 10 the grid based categorical flood error averaged over space and time decreased as the spatial and temporal coverage of satellite observed precipitation increased overall improvement however was small for the regression model update especially if 50 or fewer grid cells were observed the wrf hydro update as expected showed considerable reduction in flood errors especially as more observed precipitation data were incorporated the lstm update showed moderate error reduction with much better performance than the regression update but not as good as the wrf hydro update fig s2 shows similar results but using mean flood value q m q 2 error instead of flood categories the error reductions are lower for both the regression update and lstm update using this metric but the general trends are the same we also examined how error changes over the course of the simulation i e averaged over space but not time fig 11 shows grid averaged flood categorical error over time for different update frequencies if all 121 grid cells are observed by the satellite all update approaches showed little error initially with a peak around time step 23 which coincides with the greatest observed modeled flooding across the study domain the full wrf hydro update displayed the lowest error especially as more observed precipitation data are incorporated 15 min update frequency the simple regression update only marginally reduced error although the improvement from the no update scenario was highest at the flooding peak where reducing error was the most important notably there was a small spike in error around time step 10 where the regression update was forecasting flooding before it actually occurred since the update function used a precipitation ratio it was sensitive to small differences in precipitation that may have resulted in a large ratio again the lstm update performed better than the simple update but cannot reduce error as much as the full wrf hydro update for all updates error increased as more precipitation falls but decreased again once precipitation and flooding abated while the results shown so far are all averaged across all grid cells because the satellite breaks the landscape into a grid for observation the update methods themselves are applied to stream reaches looking at categorical fig 10 bottom and numeric fig s2 bottom flood error averaged over time and all modeled stream reaches shows slightly better performance for the lstm update compared to the grid based results the maximum error reductions i e lowest error value from fig 10 compared to no update using this stream based averaging was 9 for the regression update and 38 for the lstm update these are slightly better than the maximum error reductions using the grid based averaging 8 for the regression update and 30 for the lstm update maximum error reduction for the wrf hydro update was slightly better for the grid based averaging 99 compared to the stream based averaging 95 since the lstm update approach performed better than the regression update we will examine this approach in more detail since our error metrics are based on categorical flood values it was useful to construct a confusion matrix of the lstm update results for both stream and grid based results 15 min update frequency all 121 grid cells observed shown in fig 12 the lstm correctly classified flood categories for 81 7 stream based update and 85 8 grid based update of cases if we assume that it was acceptable to be at most one flood category off from our predictions for satellite tasking purposes we can recalculate our metrics for only situations when a flood was actually occurring since the majority of streams over most of the time had no flooding using this approach the lstm model had an accuracy of 89 8 stream based update and 96 3 grid based update that is the lstm approach accurately predicted flooding within one category for at least 90 of cases time steps and locations however the accuracy of the lstm approach was not the same for all streams fig s3 shows sample predictions from lstm compared to wrf hydro outputs for low order streams close to headwaters the lstm models tracked those of wrf fairly closely as least for streams of lower order the results tended to diverge for larger higher order streams and rivers since they have different rainfall runoff dynamics compared to small streams to evaluate the ability of the lstm to handle varying scenarios we applied it to several artificial precipitation events first we doubled the amount of observed precipitation from the base test case april 5 6 2017 event fig s4 although the error increased compared to the original case the average categorical error was still relatively low similarly we also applied the lstm to a case where input precipitation was ½ of the original error overall is lower fig s5 likely because flooding magnitude was also lower the lstm performs particularly well if it has the most possible precipitation data 15 min update frequency yellow lines both of these cases are for the same basic storm event that the lstm was trained on albeit with different total amounts of rainfall we also applied the lstm to the june 20 21 2017 storm event that was used to validate the original wrf hydro model and which was not used at all to train the lstm for this storm event the lstm approximated the wrf hydro hydrographs in most cases fig s6 looking only at the categorical predictions the results show it performed almost identically to wrf hydro the mean absolute categorical error of the lstm method lstm prediction compared to the observed gage was 0 37 identical to the wrf hydro error at most the lstm predicts flood categories no worse than that of wrf at a fraction of the runtime 5 discussion this paper builds out a predictor or forecast module for automated scheduling of satellite constellations which can adaptively observe global urban floods caused due to transient precipitation events small satellites with precipitation radars can measure rain through space and time e g raincube but they need to infer flood severity in observed locations in the absence of direct measurements forecasting flood severity is a key input to the satellite s scheduler so that it can prioritize observations of areas with maximum flooding for more accurate measurements better understanding of the evolving phenomena and thereby improved disaster management the predictor module is important for adaptive sensing even when physical parameters are directly observable but dynamic e g soil moisture because future plans will be a function of the rapidly changing environment and their forecasts we proposed and compared three tools for predicting flood severity across a metropolitan area using dynamic precipitation measurements by satellites a simple regression based update model a lstm machine learning algorithm and a fully distributed hydrologic model wrf hydro for the purpose of forecasting and adaptive sensing these tools range from low to high complexity and low to high computational cost the simple regression model can produce flood updates quickly on the order of seconds but only marginally reduces error from an initial flood forecast the lstm produces much less error but does require more computational time on the order of minutes finally the full wrf hydro has the least error but has by far the highest run times on the order of hours which is currently infeasible for onboard satellite platforms to update flood forecasts in real time based on the latest available precipitation data it is important to balance performance error reduction with computational cost this is especially important for running these flood forecast models on board a satellite which has limited computational power given these competing constraints it appears the lstm approach represents an appropriate balance by providing reasonably accurate flood forecasts relatively rapidly the simple regression update does have the lowest cost but it cannot adequately reduce flood forecast error this perhaps is not surprising since it is a relatively naïve modeling approach that attempts to relate changes in flood magnitude to only relative differences in cumulative observed precipitation albeit with some adjustment for watershed characteristics complex rainfall runoff processes are not mechanistically accounted for in this approach the lstm approach was also shown to be relatively robust performing well when precipitation depth was increased and decreased figs s4 and s5 and when applied to a different rainfall event than was used in model training fig s6 for this validation event the lstm predicted actual flood categories with similar accuracy as wrf hydro percent error for wrf hydro compared to gage measured flood peak was lower median 7 than for the lstm median 40 comparatively lstms used by other flood models kao et al 2020 le et al 2019 display maximum percentage errors of up to 28 2 and 50 respectively for 3 and 6 timesteps away from the point of prediction we note that our lstm does not have access to upstream inflows like these other models and must predict 40 timesteps of highly dynamical flow scenarios over many different types of streams furthermore the lstm showed appreciable error reduction in predicting flood categories with increasing precipitation data fig 10 even if numeric flood value error reduction was smaller fig s2 overall these results suggest that the lstm model can predict the general flood severity as flood category but has difficulty predicting the exact flood discharge comparing the confusion matrices fig 12 of categorical error from the lstm also yields some interesting insights we note that for at least 90 of relevant flooding cases the lstm predicts flooding that is at most one category away from the actual flooding category while not perfectly accurate most of the predictions are not far off from the actual event the no flooding case does dominate our statistics but is still important to the prediction effort given limited satellite passes and observation opportunities it is critical that we do not overestimate flooding scenarios such that it diverts these resources away from areas that are flooding from a flood warning perspective on the other hand it is better to overestimate a flooding case than the underestimate it particularly for any category above minor flooding the lstm did perform significantly better than the simple regression approach however it did not perform equally well across all streams to visualize where error is highest it is useful to split the categorical error per stream into their own order groups shown in fig 13 it can be seen that as the streams turn into larger rivers the error increases the reason for this is twofold first because there are only a few large streams within the training data the lstm does a poor job of capturing the different dynamics that dominates the larger flows second any error in the flow rate q propagates downstream compounding many small errors into several large errors especially when thousands of small streams eventually flow into a few large rivers as a result the lstm tends to overestimate the flow rate q in larger rivers since local precipitation has a smaller effect on these slow moving streams than the faster flows encountered near headwaters these challenges were also observed when training the lstm on large rivers because of the different dynamics between streams of different sizes it was difficult for the models to converge the weights would oscillate if one trained on small streams then on large rivers and vice versa as a result much of the training was focused on double or singular headwater flows since these were most common this works well even for non headwater flows in the beginning but eventually the errors accumulate especially for downstream flows to remedy this problem we propose that separate lstm models need to be trained depending upon the order of the stream in question additionally summing tributary inflows although simple may be inadequate for predicting flows in larger streams quick and accurate flood prediction in smaller streams is more important to satellite adaptive sensing than in larger rivers small streams tend to respond quickly to rainfall and this fast hydrologic response can be damaging but does not have the same breadth of flood forecasting tools as larger rivers gourley et al 2017 lag times for flooding in large rivers are longer and therefore allows for more computationally intensive and accurate flood modeling to be run on ground based computers and for adaptive sensing strategies to be uplinked to satellites during overpasses on the other hand rapid onboard updating of flood forecasts for small streams using satellite derived precipitation could be extremely beneficial flood prediction accuracy increases with more observations of precipitation for all three update methods thereby quantifying sensitivity to the adaptiveness of adaptive sensing we examined this effect both spatially number of grid cells the satellite observed and temporally time between satellite observations for the wrf hydro update the satellite needs to observe over half of the available grid cells before we see significant reductions in error in comparison the lstm seems to actually have greater error reduction at these low numbers of observed grid cells for the grid based errors at least as long as observation frequency is high fig 10 in our framework observation scale and frequency are constrained by satellite availability our results are useful for scheduling satellite passes over the study area to obtain the necessary frequency and spatial distribution of precipitation to reduce error in flood forecasts below an acceptable level importantly we quantify the value of recurring observations to overall predictive capability and at what point additional satellite passes may have diminishing returns this is especially relevant because parallel studies have shown that single satellite overpasses over the atlanta urban region allow enough time to observe less than 30 of the grid cells sin et al 2021 therefore predicting their relative value and scheduling to observe the most valuable areas maximizes mission value this observation constraint is due to precipitation radars being narrow field of view sensors which can observe small fractions of atlanta in a single image the primary focus of this paper was the prediction module portion of fig 1 however it is useful to provide more details of satellite constellation topologies as this is relevant to the results discussed above low earth orbit satellites are dynamic with respect to grid cells on the earth and rain radars onboard can observe any ground point over an access duration of 10 15 min it can take several days for a single satellite to revisit that ground point depending on its orbit and latitude of the ground point flying a constellation of satellites improves revisit significantly but with marginal benefits after a certain number as discussed in a parallel study nag et al 2019 a 24 satellite can provide revisits as frequently as every 15 min and a maximum gap duration of a few hours when arranged in 3 orbital plans an example of revisit frequencies for different satellite constellations is shown in fig 14 a single plane constellation gives a minimum observation gap of 12 min following by a long 10 12 h gap before the constellation can revisit the region of interest additional constellations decrease these revisit gaps providing more relevant observation data small satellite companies have demonstrated commercial success in flying large constellations of satellites foster et al 2018 stringham et al 2019 and commercial launch providers can deploy dozens of satellites as rideshare options e g spacex reducing the satellites or orbital planes increases the time gap between revisits allowing less frequent re planning cycles based on the previously collected round of measurements therefore we demonstrate the performance of the forecast models as a function of measurement update frequency varying from 15 min to 3 h in fig 10 to capture the variability of various constellation abilities make measurements at said cadence regardless of the observation frequency the scheduling of satellites is based on conceptualizing the landscape as a grid however our update methods performed at least marginally better at the stream reach scale compared to the grid based approach taking the maximum observed flooding in each cell due to the loss in information during the transfer supplying grid based values makes the scheduling problem more tractable for satellites but exploring the best ways to make this conversion to minimize errors is an important area of further research the lstm update approach can and will be applied to other regions to determine its applicability outside of our one model domain so that the predictive models can be extended to global adaptive sensing this would require training a new set of lstms based on regional topography soils stream network and other local characteristics as discussed previously lstm approaches have been applied to forecast flooding in other regions kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 there is therefore growing evidence that the basic structure of lstms is suitable for flood prediction in a variety of situations however each of these models are trained for specific locations and it remains to be seen whether more generalizable lstm models can be developed that can be rapidly applied to a variety of locations with minimal site specific data and training there are several opportunities to improve lstm accuracy in future work for example we used a single lstm model structure for all interactions between streams one improvement would be to develop a separate lstm model based on stream type i e size or number of tributaries additionally more model parameters could be incorporated e g more complex urban land cover and stormwater infrastructure in both cases there is a risk of overtraining the models reducing the ability to predict flooding for a variety of storm events we attempted some of these approaches including separating the double headwaters single headwaters and no headwaters scenarios into their own separate models as well as including additional domain variables i e elevation and flow accretion but the results were on par with our original lstm model the results presented in this paper successfully demonstrate the development of methods to accurately predict riverine flooding using space based measurements of precipitation and an approach that could be run on board a satellite constellation this has some major advantages over more computationally intensive and centralized approaches for updating predictions of flood events which is especially important in regions without ground based precipitation and streamflow sensors as long as sufficient data are available to train a lstm model the proposed approach deserves further testing to determine when and where it can replace or complement existing flood forecasting approaches our results also add to growing evidence that machine learning approaches in general yaseen et al 2019 and lstm in particular kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 are promising methods for accurately and efficiently predicting river flows and flooding without the need for data intensive and computationally demanding process based modeling 6 conclusion this paper proposes two simplified flood forecast models that are computationally efficient enough to run onboard a constellation of satellites providing an approach to prioritize where satellite observed precipitation data will be most informative during ongoing flood events we show that one method the lstm model is able to mimic the more complicated physics based wrf hydro model relatively well correctly classifying flooding within one flood category in 90 of cases the lstm approach runs orders of magnitude faster than wrf hydro making it more suitable to run quickly on board resource limited satellites additional testing showed the lstm model was robust to changes in precipitation and associated flood severity finally we demonstrated continuous reductions in flood prediction error as the spatial extent and temporal frequency of satellite precipitation observations increased these findings together suggest that lstm models are appropriate for informing responsive scheduling of satellite constellations directing these satellites to observe precipitation where it will be most useful for updating flood forecasts during an ongoing flood event future work can help refine this approach and develop more general lstm models that are applicable beyond our study region credit authorship contribution statement roderick lammers conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing

3889,accurate and timely flood forecasts are critical for protecting people and infrastructure in a changing climate satellite remote sensing provides the necessary wide area coverage and period revisits to measure episodic heavy precipitation and resultant urban floods we propose two methods to assimilate satellite observed precipitation into hydrologic models in real time to update flood forecasts bypassing two previous barriers in this technology infrequent satellite overpasses and long model run times constellations of small satellites overcomes the first barrier by providing frequent flights over an area of interest however these constellations require coordination and planning to capture precipitation data where it is most needed to inform flood forecasts the primary purpose of this paper is to address the second barrier that is high computational costs that make it infeasible to run flood forecast models on board these satellites so that they can re orient to measure where most needed we develop a simple regression based approach and a machine learning framework long short term memory lstm models to provide reliable flood forecasts using satellite observed precipitation at a fraction of the computational cost of physics based hydrologic models we apply these approaches to a test case for the atlanta metropolitan region using the weather research and forecasting model hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro to simulate flooding across the model domain for several precipitation events we compare the accuracy of our proposed approaches to the wrf hydro model using different spatial extents and temporal frequencies of precipitation observations to examine different plausible satellite constellation scenarios the lstm approach trades performance accuracy and adaptability for computational efficiency which can be important in a time and resource constrained scenario the lstm model reduces total error up to 38 from an initial flood forecast additionally this approach correctly classified flooding to within one flood magnitude category in 90 of cases these new forecasting algorithms can be used onboard constellations of small satellites to observe ongoing flood events update short term predictions and schedule observations to maximize useful measurements and thereby improve flood warning systems for protecting residents and properties keywords wrf hydro lstm urban flooding adaptive sensing remote sensing 1 introduction remotely sensed observations from satellites play a critical role in today s disaster forecast systems the observations made by satellites along with those made by terrestrial sensors are assimilated into global and regional numerical weather prediction nwp models to provide improved forecasts and give actionable intelligence to the local authorities satellites and their corresponding instruments are expensive resources for example the soil moisture active passive smap mission nasa 2020 which consists of a single satellite with a radar and radiometer instrument radar unit currently non functional costs nearly 1 billion usd and takes 3 days to map the entire world efforts are underway to develop cheaper observational platforms consisting of several smaller satellites in a distributed layout where constellations are the most common geometric configuration examples of hydrology relevant constellation missions are the cygnss ruf et al 2018 in orbit tempest reising et al 2018 in development tropics blackwell et al 2018 in development and raincube peral et al 2015 in orbit the schedule of locations and times for the observations to be made by a satellite is calculated by ground computers with human input and is uploaded to the satellites via ground stations during intermittent overpasses currently many satellites can obtain infrequent data and coverage of specific areas for example the geos 5 model uses amalgamated data from a variety of sources such as noaa s polar orbiting weather satellites as well as the aqua and ssm i instruments which have a spatial resolution of upwards of tens to hundreds of km depending on the backscatter frequency rienecker et al 2008 the satellites that carry these instruments are multi generational governmental assets and thus are few in number allowing them to take only precise localized observations due to orbital constraints with the advent of satellite swarms and constellations it has become possible to observe different regions and to gather data globally at larger spatial extents while sacrificing some of the precision afforded by highly calibrated instrumentation although the latter characteristic lends itself poorly to detailed modeling the highly parallel nature of distributed satellite operations allows for quick reaction and agile maneuvering that were previously not possible due to the dynamic nature of satellite and ground point access opportunities observations made by satellites are expected to be sparse even as constellations grow given this sparse opportunity and cost of resources to make observations power data limits it is always more efficient to capture data which has been predicted to be useful rather than to first capture an observation and later determine its utility ravindra et al 2020 this motivates the concept of adaptive sensing nag et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 1 wherein past observations are processed and information extracted from them is used to forecast the utility of future observations which then informs the observation planner all onboard the satellite without humans or ground stations in the loop while this basic framework is relevant to remote observation of a variety of phenomena e g tropical storms forest fires etc this paper focuses on transient precipitation and urban floods generally adaptive sensing requires a simulator of the phenomenon of interest which can rapidly perform data assimilation and forecasting so that the observation plan of the satellites can be updated with minimal latency physics based nwp hydrological models such as the weather research and forecasting hydrologic modeling system wrf hydro provide state of art accurate forecasts but in turn require larger computing resources than those available onboard satellites the most rapidly adaptive set up would be a simulator onboard the satellite which can assimilate the previous observations on the fly and produce updated forecasts which dictate the next set of observations to be made to enable adaptive sensing by future satellites onboard autonomy is required in processing instrumental data in predicting future observables and in planning and implementing observation schedules to maximize science utility such a sense plan act feedback loop would run in real time i e make the satellite completely autonomous and is thus constrained by limited satellite resources as well as physical processes such as orbital dynamics nag et al 2019 it is also possible to run the sense plan act in conjunction with the ground station wherein the satellite observations would be downlinked to the ground station which can process them extract information assimilate the data issue forecasts and update the observation plan for the satellite the new plan would be uplinked to the satellite upon the next overpass while moving the bulk of the computation to ground computers reduces the need for onboard resources and still keeps the human out of the loop this sense plan act loop has much longer delay times due to the sparsity of satellite ground station contacts this paper focuses on the forecast module of the adaptive sensing loop the box in fig 1 for the presented application satellites make radar based precipitation measurements as they fly over urban regions and use these measurements as direct input to predict flood levels in small to medium sized streams which are otherwise not directly observable from space onboard planners can then use these flood predictions to schedule and focus satellites observations upon areas of higher urgency e g more flooding and save the opportunity cost of observing locations with negligible flood activity previously large spacecraft e g eo 1 have been tasked to observe large floods e g in thailand using ground based infrastructure for processing assimilation and scheduling chien et al 2019 recently improvements in onboard autonomy on smaller satellites doubleday et al 2015 and full body re orientation agility on larger satellites have created the potential to run the scheduler on the satellites themselves followed by re orientation of the instruments or entire satellite to track scheduled ground points nag et al 2018 while ground support will always remain as a backup for planning onboard operations the limited contact frequency is better utilized in communicating high level goals and data a few times a day while lower level decisions in observational planning can be migrated to the satellites discretion over time the benefits further amplify when multiple satellites can coordinate their observations by communicating inferences and plans nag et al 2020b thus circumventing the lengthy delay of communicating with ground based relays while observing fast evolving or transient phenomena linnabary et al 2019 such as urban floods this paper has two objectives propose and investigate alternative flood simulation models that are less computationally expensive than a standard physics based model wrf hydro such that these models can run on satellites as part of the onboard predictor and scheduler that enable adaptive and responsive remote sensing compare the prediction accuracy of these alternative flood models to wrf hydro for a range of satellite observation frequencies and spatial coverages with the goal to show that loss in accuracy is within acceptable levels that justify the benefits of near real time planning and execution the document is organized as follows in section 2 we provide background on flood forecasting and machine learning techniques in section 3 we discuss the test case application to modeling riverine flooding in the atlanta metropolitan region including the development of two computationally efficient flood prediction approaches section 4 describes the results of this modeling and section 5 discusses the significance of these findings and suggests areas for improvement 2 background 2 1 flood forecasting flooding is one of the most common and expensive natural disasters worldwide and flood risks are increasing due to climate change development and population growth andersen and shepherd 2013 traditionally flood monitoring is achieved using networks of real time stream gaging stations such as the network operated by the u s geological survey these data are also used in conjunction with hydrologic models to forecast river discharge and flood risk at a variety of temporal scales i e hours days or weeks these hydrologic models require recent and forecasted precipitation as an input data that may come from a variety of sensors and weather models observed precipitation data are typically obtained from gauges radar or satellite sensors li et al 2016 regardless of the source these data can be used to update flood forecast models over time and improve accuracy flood forecasting using coupled atmospheric hydrologic hydraulic modeling is maturing and can be applied at a variety of scales for example the global flood monitoring system uses satellite based precipitation and a hydrologic model to simulate river flooding for most of the globe wu et al 2014 at a coarse spatial 12 km and temporal scale 3 h that may miss short flood events on small and medium sized streams in the u s the national weather service continuously updates streamflow forecasts at millions of points throughout the country salas et al 2018 while another system uses radar derived precipitation data to simulate flash floods gourley et al 2017 these tools tend to be complex and data intensive requiring significant resources to run of particular concern is the availability of reliable precipitation data to generate initial flood forecasts and to update those forecasts as additional precipitation data become available satellite derived precipitation estimates can be useful for this purpose and are especially important for developing countries without the resources to develop extensive ground based sensor networks to monitor both precipitation and river flooding rahman and di 2017 2 2 neural networks in the last decade neural networks have been at the forefront of machine learning ml and artificial intelligence research their successful application in a wide range of problems from image classification krizhevsky et al 2012 to self enabled reinforcement learning mnih et al 2013 have paved the way for widespread adoption of these methods and have started to influence data driven methods within earth science as well chen et al 2016 li et al 2020 we will provide here an overview of artificial neural networks particularly long short term memory lstm models which will form the basis of our ml methodology neural networks are loosely modelled after the structure of the human brain by mimicking layers of cascading neurons transporting electrical signals neurons that activate together tend increasingly to do so over time which gives rise to complex capabilities such as pattern recognition and perception the basic equation for each neuron within a neural network is described as 1 z f w x b where z is the output w the weights to be learned x the input and b the bias with the symbol representing multiplication although this can be extended to the hadamard product or convolution generally w can also represent a tensor with a set number of filters k such that if x is a vector of length n and w is of size k n the resulting z will be of length k the nonlinear activation function f relates the importance of the linear output and although historically the sigmoid function has be utilized to bound the output between 0 and 1 the rectified linear unit rlu is more widely adopted due to its numerical and backpropagation properties nair and hinton 2010 often these neurons are stacked in layers such that the output of one layer acts as the input to the next layer of particular interest is the recurrent neural network rnn and its variant the lstm depicted in fig 2 the structure of the rnn works well for sequential data and one of the more successful applications of this was in language translation tasks wu et al 2016 at its core the rnn allows for chain like structures consisting of identical recurring cell blocks a which takes an input x and outputs a result h however an additional output c known as the cell state is also generated which is passed into the next recurring block and is meant to retain some of the memory that lingers from previous cell blocks in this way certain features from previous states that might be important are encoded within the cell state which may affect later outputs the lstm is an improvement on the original rnn hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 by incorporating additional interactions per cell block namely we include the sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent functions to the equations such that we can manipulate the importance of the input allow for previous cell states to expire or be forgotten add to the existing cell states and to generate an output relevant to the current input olah 2015 further variants of the lstm have been developed such as the gated recurrent unit gru which increases the complexity of each cell chung et al 2015 however the adaptation of this network structure can be readily obvious given the inputs x precipitation and static physical characteristics we can generate flood outputs h per time step while keeping the internal weights and biases of each cell state identical across all time steps furthermore if we can generalize the model of the river flow encapsulated and described by cell a then we can apply the lstm across all river flows furthermore concepts such as water retention and delayed flows can be represented by the cell state c while not perfect this model is much simpler than physics based hydrological models and thus has the potential to be ported onto satellite systems which are resource constrained the idea of utilizing rnns and lstms for modelling hydrological processes is not a new one a variety of machine learning approaches have been successfully applied to forecast river flows yaseen et al 2019 including lstm models kratzert et al 2018 however in many cases lstms have been used to forecast flows in larger rivers over long time scales e g daily or monthly flows kao et al 2020 le et al 2019 one study applied lstms to short flash flood events through a large mountainous watershed song et al 2020 while others have incorporated lstms into an urban flood warning system lee et al 2020 lstms have also been used to improve rainfall forecasts which were then fed into a hydrologic model for flood prediction nguyen and bae 2020 in our work we applied lstms to forecast sub hourly streamflow in an urban setting using a bare bones approach requiring minimal computational complexity it is our goal to demonstrate the validity and potential for fast and reliable onboard prediction of flash flooding events on satellites without ground based communication allowing for agile maneuvering of satellite resources in a time sensitive environment 3 methodology this section proposes methods for data assimilation and forecasting to inform the satellite scheduler s future plans the models are built to enable adaptive sensing such that the location of future satellite observations can be determined as a function of past observations furthermore these models can either be run in a centralized ground based location with the results uplinked to the constellations or run on every satellite in the constellation instead the spatial resolution is a function of the geographic extent of locations of interest and the instrument field of view e g rain radar the temporal resolution or re run cadence is a function of the size of the constellation since more satellites allow more measurements and therefore more updates our proposed methods are generalizable to many natural phenomena where satellite observations of ongoing events can be incorporated into forecast models e g wildfires or hurricanes the subsections below use representative examples of a constellation adaptively sensing a flood event in a single city they are also easily extendable to multiple floods in various locations around the globe 3 1 observing system simulations the goal of this paper is to report the accuracy of forecast algorithms that can run near real time onboard satellites specifically we are looking to predict river flooding as a function of observed transient precipitation over a specific city over a predefined duration of time wherein parts of the city can be sporadically observed by satellite overpasses to decouple satellite dynamics from the predictor problem the proposed flood forecasting models are applied for custom variable samples in space and time from a satellite s perspective all regions of interests across the globe can be spatially discretized into grid cells of any spatial resolution any of these grid cells can be observed any time a satellite overpasses onboard autonomy models can then be updated with new predictions for every set of observations while the results presented in this paper are unique to our chosen test case the basic sampling approach is generalizable across any urban region with small streams and can be adapted to any combination of sampling frequency and spatial extent i e any constellation topology we chose the atlanta metropolitan area as our test case we modeled riverine flooding using the wrf hydro hydrologic model version 5 gochis et al 2018 fig 3 wrf hydro is a distributed hydrologic model that links a land surface model noah mp niu et al 2011 with terrain and channel flow routing modules to simulate streamflow while wrf hydro can be coupled to the weather research and forecasting wrf weather model skamarock et al 2008 we ran wrf hydro in uncoupled mode instead supplying it with meteorological forcing data primarily precipitation from the north american land data assimilation system nldas hourly time step 4 4 km spatial resolution the model was run for a 72 72 km area with a grid resolution of 900 m for the land surface model and 30 m for the terrain and channel routing while this grid resolution is relatively coarse especially for urban areas we were in part limited by the resolution of model inputs e g digital elevation model land cover furthermore terrain and channel routing resolutions as coarse as 250 m have been shown to be adequate for modeling flooding in urban areas kim et al 2021 we incorporated both surface and subsurface flow routing and used the muskingum cunge cunge 1969 gochis et al 2018 reach based channel routing option model streamflow was output at 15 minute time steps this temporal resolution was chosen because a satellite overpass for any ground target can be as frequent as every 15 min for a constellation with dozens of satellites in low earth orbit most major model inputs e g soil parameters land use and land surface model variables were obtained from the wrf preprocessing system wps data download website ncar 2020 hydro enforced digital elevation models dem representing local topography were obtained from the usgs national hydrography dataset v2 nhd v2 we manually edited some of this dem to remove bridges and allow accurate flow routing wrf hydro was calibrated by trial and error by adjusting several static landscape and soil variables table 1 all parameters except refkdt were simply scaled higher or lower from their starting value a function of land use or soil type refkdt was calibrated in a spatially explicit way based on average percent impervious cover for each grid cell estimated from 2016 national land cover database nlcd data yang et al 2018 areas with higher imperviousness were given lower refkdt values less infiltration we therefore account for some of the high spatial variability in land cover present in urban areas we use wrf hydro s results to train computationally efficient models that can run onboard satellites introduced in the next section this paper does not seek to verify the accuracy of or improve wrf hydro and our approach would hold if we replaced wrf hydro with a different physics based model with better forecast accuracy because our simpler forecasting methods could be trained on that instead the purpose of the wrf hydro model was to provide a test case for which we could develop and apply these alternative simpler flood forecasting approaches the goal was not to perfectly simulate a specific flood event but instead to capture physically realistic spatial and temporal patterns of flooding in an urban area we could use only observed river discharge data for this analysis however these data are available only at a few discrete monitoring sites modeling on the other hand provides simulated river discharge at all points along the entire stream network still the wrf hydro model does not account for many hydrologic complexities in urban areas such as stormwater pipes reservoirs or other infrastructure despite this simplification the model results provide a useful and physically realistic flood case based on model calibration and verification that enables us to test our proposed flood forecasting methods wrf hydro was calibrated on a single storm event during april 5 6 2017 modeled streamflow was compared to hydrographs from nine u s geologic survey usgs gages in the atlanta metro area table s1 details on usgs stream gaging methods can be found in carter and davidian 1968 the calibrated model was then validated on a separate storm event on june 20 21 2017 for both model calibration and validation a roughly 4 month model spin up period was used model performance was assessed using two metrics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias nse is a common measure of hydrologic model performance and ranges from worst to one best 2 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 is the mean of observed discharges q m t is the modeled discharge at time t and q 0 t is the observed discharge at time t percent bias ranges from to with negative values indicating under prediction of discharge positive values indicating over prediction of discharge 3 pbias t 1 t q m t q 0 t t 1 t q 0 t 100 the calibrated model results were also used to develop flood values to be used by the satellite scheduling optimizer this flood value was representative of the areas where satellite measured precipitation would be most valuable for assessing flood risk modeled channel discharge was scaled by an estimate of what constituted a flood at each location for simplicity we used the 2 year recurrence interval flow rate q2 the flow that has a 50 chance of happening in any year as this is a rough estimate of the flow that completely fills a river channel williams 1978 for each stream reach q2 was estimated from the usgs regional regression equations for urban streams in the region feaster et al 2014 flood value was thus defined as 4 flood v a l q m q 2 each stream reach has a single value of q 2 based on watershed area and percent of impervious cover however the modeled flow rate q m is output every 15 min for each stream reach therefore both q m and flood v a l vary through time at each location we also examined categorical flood magnitude the national weather service nws defines four flood stages based on impacts to surrounding infrastructure and property action minor moderate and major floods for all active stream gages in georgia with nws flood stages we converted these stages to discharges based on the published usgs gage rating curve and then calculated their corresponding flood v a l using these gage derived values we estimated flood v a l cutoffs that corresponded to each of these nws flood stages this provided a more realistic assessment of relative flood impacts separation of the flooding values based upon the nws categorization of flood intensity into categories is as follows 0 q m q 2 0 7 n o f l o o d 0 7 q m q 2 1 a c t i o n 1 q m q 2 1 6 m i n o r 1 6 q m q 2 2 4 m o d e r a t e 5 2 4 q m q 2 m a j o r we used the output from the wrf hydro model to develop two simplified models to update flood predictions with the satellite observed precipitation data the first is a simple regression based approach and the second uses a machine learning framework results from both methods were compared to the calibrated results of wrf hydro which is taken as the true flood magnitudes for the study area 3 2 prediction using a regression model initially we developed a simple linear regression model to update flood values across the model domain based on new precipitation data to explore the relationship between precipitation and flood value several wrf hydro simulations were run the precipitation from the april 5 6 2017 event was taken as baseline rainfall and was varied artificially to give several sets of precipitation inputs precipitation was uniformly scaled by values from 2 to 10 and 1 2 10 e g 1 10 1 9 1 8 8 9 10 the original precipitation this captured how increasing or decreasing rainfall would translate to changes in river discharge and flood magnitude and provided a larger dataset to fit the regression model there was a clear non linear relationship between change in precipitation and changes in flood magnitude across the stream network with all reductions in precipitation below ½ essentially reducing discharge to the same low value e g scaling precipitation by 1 3 or 1 5 essentially resulted in no flooding therefore further analysis focused only on cases where precipitation was scaled by 1 2 or greater for the cases where precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 a simple regression function was fit to the data to predict new flood v a l based on the old flood v a l the magnitude of the precipitation change and the static watershed characteristics da drainage area refkdt infiltration parameter and ksat saturated hydraulic conductivity for cases where precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 flood v a l n e w is assumed to be simply precip o b s precip m o d times flood v a l o l d the equations that describe this regression model are as follows 6 flood v a l n e w f l o o d v a l o l d precip o b s precip m o d 1 1 746 f l o o d v a l o l d 5 63 x 10 4 d a 3 6 x 10 2 r e f k d t 4 26 x 10 5 k s a t f o r precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 7 flood v a l n e w precip o b s precip m o d f l o o d v a l o l d f o r precip o b s precip m o d 0 5 in all cases precip m o d is the initial estimate forecast of precipitation and precip o b s is the observed precipitation the ratio precip o b s precip m o d represents the ratio of how much higher or lower this observed precipitation is compared to the initial estimate this regression model requires an initial prediction of flooding flood v a l o l d that is it takes some forecast of streamflow and updates this forecasted value based on differences in observed and forecasted precipitation this is different than the machine learning approach see below which predicts stream discharge through successively iterating upon the cell state requiring an initial condition of no previous precipitation and streamflow for the very first timestep 3 3 prediction using machine learning the overarching goal for developing ml based models for flood prediction was that this simpler approach could produce comparable outputs to that of high fidelity hydrology models such as wrf hydro but with only a fraction of the necessary computational resources and runtime our models do not aim to be as accurate as wrf hydro rather the aim is to produce results that are good enough and are able to be run on constrained satellite platforms these quick onboard estimates can direct satellites to observe locations where additional data are most valuable without the need for ground based planning and delayed data transfers the general framework for the model is such that each stream is represented as a node each node takes an input i consisting of the precipitation and any stream specific domain parameters table 2 and outputs the flow rate q subscripts u and d represent upstream and downstream respectively wrf hydro reports the total flow rate q total which consists of all upstream flows as well as the flow within the current stream due to local precipitation thus we are able to create a graph network structure for the entire river system each node represents the local flow q due to local precipitation which when combined with other local flows generate q total the building blocks of this network structure is shown in fig 4 during training the nodes are trained upon a randomized selection of streams from wrf hydro using the average precipitation over the grid points where the stream flows through initially we recognize there are two types of streams headwaters and non headwaters headwater nodes are essentially where the entire streamflow network begins and thus have no input flow apart from possible groundwater and minute sources which we ignore whereas all other nodes are non headwater the distinction is important since wrf hydro does not report q for headwater nodes and thus their output must be inferred continuing to organize the entire streamflow structure we separate the types of inflow combinations into three types hh nh or nn where h represents headwater nodes and n represents non headwater nodes i e nh would represent a non headwater node combining with a headwater node the difference between these three combinations is mainly due to the training structure hh will require three sets of inputs nh will require two sets of inputs while nn will only require one set of inputs in addition hh will only require q total for the downstream node while nh and nn will also require wrf generated q total values for the respective upstream nodes during training continuing this logic one can construct the entire stream flow network from these basic building blocks as a graph network shown in fig 5 here we make an important definition the order of a stream node is the maximum distance of the node to any headwater node including itself thus as the network flows downstream the order continuously increases with large rivers associated with higher order values each stream node is modeled as an lstm block containing 128 filters followed by 2 dense layers of filter sizes 16 and 1 respectively applied upon the lstm output shown in fig 6 in total this constitutes 71 201 total trainable parameters a total of roughly 300 kb in size it is also important to note that all stream nodes are represented as identically structured lstms across all types of stream flow structures the reasoning behind this is to only require saving one set of variables that can be applied across all stream flows being as general as possible while keeping the overall memory and computational requirements manageable however due to the availability of output data recall that wrf does not produce q for headwater nodes training the lstm is accomplished by considering the three types of stream flow structures separately each with its own appropriate number of inputs outputs for example the case with no headwaters is arguably the simplest as both q t o t a l u 1 and q t o t a l u 2 from upstream nodes can be taken directly from wrf and only one set of inputs is required for the node to generate its own q before summation and comparison to the wrf output q total the lstm we applied consists of 40 time steps i e 10 h at 15 min time steps for the purposes of training starting from an initial condition of no precipitation and ideally no or low stream flow theoretically we are not limited to a set number of time steps since we can continue to add lstm nodes per additional timestep as necessary we randomly select portions of the entire stream flow network during training taking note and feeding relevant stream parameters into its corresponding stream flow structure all inputs are normalized against their respective maximum and minimum values such that they ideally range from 1 to 1 the only exception here is q since the summation of two negative values will yield a larger negative value and so it is instead normalized from 0 to 1 the final error is defined as the difference between the wrf generated q total and the lstm model generated q total since the problem is one of regression we tested both mean squared error as well as absolute squared error as error metrics during prediction we added an artificial lag of one timestep 15 min to the downflow q during summation for every five stream nodes such that it mimicked the nature of downstream flow although this is a simplification encoding such a step within the lstm would require training a larger lstm that can capture this type of delay as well as scaling flood flows accordingly between two very different streams as such we opted for a simpler solution here that does not require additional training 3 4 simulation setup to assess the prediction accuracy of the update models regression and lstm we must first standardize the method in which we discretize the landscape from the satellite s perspective the regression model is run for every modeled stream reach based on average observed parameters i e precipitation saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat infiltration parameter refkdt in the contributing watershed similarly every stream reach is treated as its own lstm neural network while this can yield detailed results the satellite needs to be scheduled to point toward a vector of spatial points at scheduled times the landscape is therefore discretized into equally spaced regular grid cells of a size comparable to the satellite s field of view we assigned the stream reach based predictions of flood magnitude from the regression and lstm models to the appropriate grid cell or cells nearest to this reach if more than one stream reach intersects a grid point the highest predicted flood value is used these grid based flood values would then be sent to the satellites to inform where to make future observations note that satellites can only observe the amount of precipitation falling over an area and thus must infer the flow rate q from models we created an initial precipitation forecast for the region and subsequent flood forecast from wrf hydro but with every observation in space and time this precipitation map is updated and fed to either the regression or lstm model to predict new river flood values the stream network consists of a total of 7 013 reaches spread over a total of 79 79 high resolution grid cells 0 9 0 9 km fig 7 the satellite is scheduled to observe a low resolution version of the area with approximately 8 8 km cells thereby the entire map is spread over 11 11 grid cells when the satellite observes one of these 11 11 gridpoints all high resolution gridpoints within the larger satellite observation area observed and may have different precipitation rates satellites may be scheduled to observe a varying number of grid cells each time they pass over an area as well as varying timing between these observation cycles since we treat every 15 min as one timestep within our forecast simulation the highest observable scenario is one in which every one of the 121 grid cells are observed every 15 min varying these observational parameters we discretize our simulation to observe a varying 30 50 75 100 or 121 grid cells per observation cycle with observation intervals occurring either 15 30 60 120 or 180 min apart observed grid cells were randomly selected but remained consistent among all models tested the lower bound of sampling frequency is limited to once every 3 h because ground stations of commercial satellite constellations are able to establish space ground contact between their assets every 4 6 h and we wanted to demonstrated the benefits of onboard autonomy if updates can be made at higher frequency the prediction accuracy of the simple regression and machine learning approaches was assessed based on precipitation observations at the various number of grid cells and observation cycles these two approaches were also compared to flood forecast updates using the wrf hydro model at these same update frequencies e g these updated precipitation forecasts were fed through the wrf hydro model to generate new flood forecasts at each time step these tests were run on the same april 5 6 2017 rainfall event used in the wrf hydro calibration the nldas precipitation data was taken to be the true precipitation values for this event we developed a synthetic initial forecast of precipitation for this event by perturbing the true values using a gaussian random filter both these precipitation data were run through wrf hydro to yield a true flood scenario and an initial flood forecast fig 8 the error between the forecast and true flooding is the initial error the simple regression and lstm update approaches should then reduce this error by incorporating different amounts of observed true precipitation areas that were not observed by the satellite are assigned their initial forecasted precipitation values we applied our update methods to a 10 h period april 5 10 00 april 5 20 00 where most of the flooding occurred error was quantified based on differences in predicted and true categorical flood magnitudes based on nws flood categories eq 5 as well as calculated flood values q m q 2 using normalized values is useful when comparing streams of different sizes and behaviors since large rivers will consistently have higher flow rate q when compared to smaller streams furthermore using flood categories allows us to generalize the importance of different degrees of flooding while ignoring the smaller errors that exist within the prediction of the raw stream flow itself finally flood categories are most representative of the severity of flood impacts and are standard forecast communication tools used in the u s while categorical data should generally not be treated as numeric flood categories are ordered and are nearly linearly related eq 5 computing average categorical errors see below is therefore an appropriate and useful metric for comparing performance between our models these errors can be calculated on stream based or grid based results stream based error is calculated for every stream reach simulated in the model grid based error is calculated based on flood values assigned from these modeled stream reaches to the 79 79 model grid both stream based and grid based error is calculated as follows 8 e x t f x t f x t where e x t is error and f and f represent the predicted e g lstm and real categorical or numeric flood values respectively this provides error for every location x either stream reach or grid cell and time step t we can also average error over time and or location mean flood error at each time step can be calculated as follows 9 e t 1 n x f x t f x t where n is the total number of stream reaches or grid cells we can average across both space and time to get a single error metric for a given model scenario this mean flood error is calculated as 10 e 1 tn t x f x t f x t where t is the total number of prediction cycles we use this average error metric to compare model errors across different satellite observation parameters i e number of cells observed and observation frequency 4 results 4 1 wrf hydro model calibration and validation the wrf hydro model was calibrated to match observed hydrographs from nine usgs stream gages in the atlanta metro area for a storm event on april 5 6 2017 mean nse was 0 33 and mean percent bias was 32 fig 9 modeled flows matched observed flows well for some gages but under or over predicted peak flow rates at others gages with multiple peaks were reasonably well captured by wrf hydro validation performance was similar june 20 21 2017 storm event with a mean nse of 0 51 and percent bias of 42 fig s1 in both the calibration and validation negative bias indicates a consistent under prediction of discharge this is primarily because the model seems to be under predicting runoff volume i e area under the hydrograph even if the peak flow rates were relatively well simulated for most sites model errors may be a result of simplifications in the model itself or incorrect parameterization wrf hydro is a relatively coarse scale model 30 30 m resolution for overland flow routing and we do not incorporate any stormwater infrastructure reservoirs or other complexity in this highly urban area that affects runoff rates and volumes additionally the under prediction of runoff volume may suggest that too much infiltration is being simulated however additional tuning of calibration parameters did not result in significantly improved model performance despite this systematic under prediction of runoff volume and errors in the absolute value of flood peaks the calibrated wrf hydro predicts the relative magnitude of flooding for most gages the model captures where high flows occur and where they do not especially visible in the validation results which is important for our interests of determining when and where floods are occurring although accuracy would ideally be higher these model results still serve as a useful realistic test case for comparison to our proposed flood forecasting methods 4 2 flood forecast update performance we compared the performance of the simple regression model update and the lstm update approach to the performance of the wrf hydro model for forecasting flooding for the april 5 6 2017 storm event the accuracy of the flood update function generally improved as more precipitation data were incorporated fig 10 the grid based categorical flood error averaged over space and time decreased as the spatial and temporal coverage of satellite observed precipitation increased overall improvement however was small for the regression model update especially if 50 or fewer grid cells were observed the wrf hydro update as expected showed considerable reduction in flood errors especially as more observed precipitation data were incorporated the lstm update showed moderate error reduction with much better performance than the regression update but not as good as the wrf hydro update fig s2 shows similar results but using mean flood value q m q 2 error instead of flood categories the error reductions are lower for both the regression update and lstm update using this metric but the general trends are the same we also examined how error changes over the course of the simulation i e averaged over space but not time fig 11 shows grid averaged flood categorical error over time for different update frequencies if all 121 grid cells are observed by the satellite all update approaches showed little error initially with a peak around time step 23 which coincides with the greatest observed modeled flooding across the study domain the full wrf hydro update displayed the lowest error especially as more observed precipitation data are incorporated 15 min update frequency the simple regression update only marginally reduced error although the improvement from the no update scenario was highest at the flooding peak where reducing error was the most important notably there was a small spike in error around time step 10 where the regression update was forecasting flooding before it actually occurred since the update function used a precipitation ratio it was sensitive to small differences in precipitation that may have resulted in a large ratio again the lstm update performed better than the simple update but cannot reduce error as much as the full wrf hydro update for all updates error increased as more precipitation falls but decreased again once precipitation and flooding abated while the results shown so far are all averaged across all grid cells because the satellite breaks the landscape into a grid for observation the update methods themselves are applied to stream reaches looking at categorical fig 10 bottom and numeric fig s2 bottom flood error averaged over time and all modeled stream reaches shows slightly better performance for the lstm update compared to the grid based results the maximum error reductions i e lowest error value from fig 10 compared to no update using this stream based averaging was 9 for the regression update and 38 for the lstm update these are slightly better than the maximum error reductions using the grid based averaging 8 for the regression update and 30 for the lstm update maximum error reduction for the wrf hydro update was slightly better for the grid based averaging 99 compared to the stream based averaging 95 since the lstm update approach performed better than the regression update we will examine this approach in more detail since our error metrics are based on categorical flood values it was useful to construct a confusion matrix of the lstm update results for both stream and grid based results 15 min update frequency all 121 grid cells observed shown in fig 12 the lstm correctly classified flood categories for 81 7 stream based update and 85 8 grid based update of cases if we assume that it was acceptable to be at most one flood category off from our predictions for satellite tasking purposes we can recalculate our metrics for only situations when a flood was actually occurring since the majority of streams over most of the time had no flooding using this approach the lstm model had an accuracy of 89 8 stream based update and 96 3 grid based update that is the lstm approach accurately predicted flooding within one category for at least 90 of cases time steps and locations however the accuracy of the lstm approach was not the same for all streams fig s3 shows sample predictions from lstm compared to wrf hydro outputs for low order streams close to headwaters the lstm models tracked those of wrf fairly closely as least for streams of lower order the results tended to diverge for larger higher order streams and rivers since they have different rainfall runoff dynamics compared to small streams to evaluate the ability of the lstm to handle varying scenarios we applied it to several artificial precipitation events first we doubled the amount of observed precipitation from the base test case april 5 6 2017 event fig s4 although the error increased compared to the original case the average categorical error was still relatively low similarly we also applied the lstm to a case where input precipitation was ½ of the original error overall is lower fig s5 likely because flooding magnitude was also lower the lstm performs particularly well if it has the most possible precipitation data 15 min update frequency yellow lines both of these cases are for the same basic storm event that the lstm was trained on albeit with different total amounts of rainfall we also applied the lstm to the june 20 21 2017 storm event that was used to validate the original wrf hydro model and which was not used at all to train the lstm for this storm event the lstm approximated the wrf hydro hydrographs in most cases fig s6 looking only at the categorical predictions the results show it performed almost identically to wrf hydro the mean absolute categorical error of the lstm method lstm prediction compared to the observed gage was 0 37 identical to the wrf hydro error at most the lstm predicts flood categories no worse than that of wrf at a fraction of the runtime 5 discussion this paper builds out a predictor or forecast module for automated scheduling of satellite constellations which can adaptively observe global urban floods caused due to transient precipitation events small satellites with precipitation radars can measure rain through space and time e g raincube but they need to infer flood severity in observed locations in the absence of direct measurements forecasting flood severity is a key input to the satellite s scheduler so that it can prioritize observations of areas with maximum flooding for more accurate measurements better understanding of the evolving phenomena and thereby improved disaster management the predictor module is important for adaptive sensing even when physical parameters are directly observable but dynamic e g soil moisture because future plans will be a function of the rapidly changing environment and their forecasts we proposed and compared three tools for predicting flood severity across a metropolitan area using dynamic precipitation measurements by satellites a simple regression based update model a lstm machine learning algorithm and a fully distributed hydrologic model wrf hydro for the purpose of forecasting and adaptive sensing these tools range from low to high complexity and low to high computational cost the simple regression model can produce flood updates quickly on the order of seconds but only marginally reduces error from an initial flood forecast the lstm produces much less error but does require more computational time on the order of minutes finally the full wrf hydro has the least error but has by far the highest run times on the order of hours which is currently infeasible for onboard satellite platforms to update flood forecasts in real time based on the latest available precipitation data it is important to balance performance error reduction with computational cost this is especially important for running these flood forecast models on board a satellite which has limited computational power given these competing constraints it appears the lstm approach represents an appropriate balance by providing reasonably accurate flood forecasts relatively rapidly the simple regression update does have the lowest cost but it cannot adequately reduce flood forecast error this perhaps is not surprising since it is a relatively naïve modeling approach that attempts to relate changes in flood magnitude to only relative differences in cumulative observed precipitation albeit with some adjustment for watershed characteristics complex rainfall runoff processes are not mechanistically accounted for in this approach the lstm approach was also shown to be relatively robust performing well when precipitation depth was increased and decreased figs s4 and s5 and when applied to a different rainfall event than was used in model training fig s6 for this validation event the lstm predicted actual flood categories with similar accuracy as wrf hydro percent error for wrf hydro compared to gage measured flood peak was lower median 7 than for the lstm median 40 comparatively lstms used by other flood models kao et al 2020 le et al 2019 display maximum percentage errors of up to 28 2 and 50 respectively for 3 and 6 timesteps away from the point of prediction we note that our lstm does not have access to upstream inflows like these other models and must predict 40 timesteps of highly dynamical flow scenarios over many different types of streams furthermore the lstm showed appreciable error reduction in predicting flood categories with increasing precipitation data fig 10 even if numeric flood value error reduction was smaller fig s2 overall these results suggest that the lstm model can predict the general flood severity as flood category but has difficulty predicting the exact flood discharge comparing the confusion matrices fig 12 of categorical error from the lstm also yields some interesting insights we note that for at least 90 of relevant flooding cases the lstm predicts flooding that is at most one category away from the actual flooding category while not perfectly accurate most of the predictions are not far off from the actual event the no flooding case does dominate our statistics but is still important to the prediction effort given limited satellite passes and observation opportunities it is critical that we do not overestimate flooding scenarios such that it diverts these resources away from areas that are flooding from a flood warning perspective on the other hand it is better to overestimate a flooding case than the underestimate it particularly for any category above minor flooding the lstm did perform significantly better than the simple regression approach however it did not perform equally well across all streams to visualize where error is highest it is useful to split the categorical error per stream into their own order groups shown in fig 13 it can be seen that as the streams turn into larger rivers the error increases the reason for this is twofold first because there are only a few large streams within the training data the lstm does a poor job of capturing the different dynamics that dominates the larger flows second any error in the flow rate q propagates downstream compounding many small errors into several large errors especially when thousands of small streams eventually flow into a few large rivers as a result the lstm tends to overestimate the flow rate q in larger rivers since local precipitation has a smaller effect on these slow moving streams than the faster flows encountered near headwaters these challenges were also observed when training the lstm on large rivers because of the different dynamics between streams of different sizes it was difficult for the models to converge the weights would oscillate if one trained on small streams then on large rivers and vice versa as a result much of the training was focused on double or singular headwater flows since these were most common this works well even for non headwater flows in the beginning but eventually the errors accumulate especially for downstream flows to remedy this problem we propose that separate lstm models need to be trained depending upon the order of the stream in question additionally summing tributary inflows although simple may be inadequate for predicting flows in larger streams quick and accurate flood prediction in smaller streams is more important to satellite adaptive sensing than in larger rivers small streams tend to respond quickly to rainfall and this fast hydrologic response can be damaging but does not have the same breadth of flood forecasting tools as larger rivers gourley et al 2017 lag times for flooding in large rivers are longer and therefore allows for more computationally intensive and accurate flood modeling to be run on ground based computers and for adaptive sensing strategies to be uplinked to satellites during overpasses on the other hand rapid onboard updating of flood forecasts for small streams using satellite derived precipitation could be extremely beneficial flood prediction accuracy increases with more observations of precipitation for all three update methods thereby quantifying sensitivity to the adaptiveness of adaptive sensing we examined this effect both spatially number of grid cells the satellite observed and temporally time between satellite observations for the wrf hydro update the satellite needs to observe over half of the available grid cells before we see significant reductions in error in comparison the lstm seems to actually have greater error reduction at these low numbers of observed grid cells for the grid based errors at least as long as observation frequency is high fig 10 in our framework observation scale and frequency are constrained by satellite availability our results are useful for scheduling satellite passes over the study area to obtain the necessary frequency and spatial distribution of precipitation to reduce error in flood forecasts below an acceptable level importantly we quantify the value of recurring observations to overall predictive capability and at what point additional satellite passes may have diminishing returns this is especially relevant because parallel studies have shown that single satellite overpasses over the atlanta urban region allow enough time to observe less than 30 of the grid cells sin et al 2021 therefore predicting their relative value and scheduling to observe the most valuable areas maximizes mission value this observation constraint is due to precipitation radars being narrow field of view sensors which can observe small fractions of atlanta in a single image the primary focus of this paper was the prediction module portion of fig 1 however it is useful to provide more details of satellite constellation topologies as this is relevant to the results discussed above low earth orbit satellites are dynamic with respect to grid cells on the earth and rain radars onboard can observe any ground point over an access duration of 10 15 min it can take several days for a single satellite to revisit that ground point depending on its orbit and latitude of the ground point flying a constellation of satellites improves revisit significantly but with marginal benefits after a certain number as discussed in a parallel study nag et al 2019 a 24 satellite can provide revisits as frequently as every 15 min and a maximum gap duration of a few hours when arranged in 3 orbital plans an example of revisit frequencies for different satellite constellations is shown in fig 14 a single plane constellation gives a minimum observation gap of 12 min following by a long 10 12 h gap before the constellation can revisit the region of interest additional constellations decrease these revisit gaps providing more relevant observation data small satellite companies have demonstrated commercial success in flying large constellations of satellites foster et al 2018 stringham et al 2019 and commercial launch providers can deploy dozens of satellites as rideshare options e g spacex reducing the satellites or orbital planes increases the time gap between revisits allowing less frequent re planning cycles based on the previously collected round of measurements therefore we demonstrate the performance of the forecast models as a function of measurement update frequency varying from 15 min to 3 h in fig 10 to capture the variability of various constellation abilities make measurements at said cadence regardless of the observation frequency the scheduling of satellites is based on conceptualizing the landscape as a grid however our update methods performed at least marginally better at the stream reach scale compared to the grid based approach taking the maximum observed flooding in each cell due to the loss in information during the transfer supplying grid based values makes the scheduling problem more tractable for satellites but exploring the best ways to make this conversion to minimize errors is an important area of further research the lstm update approach can and will be applied to other regions to determine its applicability outside of our one model domain so that the predictive models can be extended to global adaptive sensing this would require training a new set of lstms based on regional topography soils stream network and other local characteristics as discussed previously lstm approaches have been applied to forecast flooding in other regions kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 there is therefore growing evidence that the basic structure of lstms is suitable for flood prediction in a variety of situations however each of these models are trained for specific locations and it remains to be seen whether more generalizable lstm models can be developed that can be rapidly applied to a variety of locations with minimal site specific data and training there are several opportunities to improve lstm accuracy in future work for example we used a single lstm model structure for all interactions between streams one improvement would be to develop a separate lstm model based on stream type i e size or number of tributaries additionally more model parameters could be incorporated e g more complex urban land cover and stormwater infrastructure in both cases there is a risk of overtraining the models reducing the ability to predict flooding for a variety of storm events we attempted some of these approaches including separating the double headwaters single headwaters and no headwaters scenarios into their own separate models as well as including additional domain variables i e elevation and flow accretion but the results were on par with our original lstm model the results presented in this paper successfully demonstrate the development of methods to accurately predict riverine flooding using space based measurements of precipitation and an approach that could be run on board a satellite constellation this has some major advantages over more computationally intensive and centralized approaches for updating predictions of flood events which is especially important in regions without ground based precipitation and streamflow sensors as long as sufficient data are available to train a lstm model the proposed approach deserves further testing to determine when and where it can replace or complement existing flood forecasting approaches our results also add to growing evidence that machine learning approaches in general yaseen et al 2019 and lstm in particular kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 le et al 2019 are promising methods for accurately and efficiently predicting river flows and flooding without the need for data intensive and computationally demanding process based modeling 6 conclusion this paper proposes two simplified flood forecast models that are computationally efficient enough to run onboard a constellation of satellites providing an approach to prioritize where satellite observed precipitation data will be most informative during ongoing flood events we show that one method the lstm model is able to mimic the more complicated physics based wrf hydro model relatively well correctly classifying flooding within one flood category in 90 of cases the lstm approach runs orders of magnitude faster than wrf hydro making it more suitable to run quickly on board resource limited satellites additional testing showed the lstm model was robust to changes in precipitation and associated flood severity finally we demonstrated continuous reductions in flood prediction error as the spatial extent and temporal frequency of satellite precipitation observations increased these findings together suggest that lstm models are appropriate for informing responsive scheduling of satellite constellations directing these satellites to observe precipitation where it will be most useful for updating flood forecasts during an ongoing flood event future work can help refine this approach and develop more general lstm models that are applicable beyond our study region credit authorship contribution statement roderick lammers conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing
