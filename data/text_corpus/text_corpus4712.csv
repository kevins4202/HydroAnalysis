and ma et al 2018 have invested a great deal of effort on the semi passive system and fully flow induced systems in comparison with rigid foils flexible foils or wings exhibit superior hydrodynamic performance as well as energy extraction capacity recently a two dimensional numerical simulation of a flapping foil with local described deformation was performed in order to investigate the advantages of flexibility for energy extraction liu et al 2013 wang et al 2016 tian et al 2014 studied the effects of passive deformation and active control on the energy extraction capability of a

imposed the described deformations in the chord and span wise directions onto the hydrofoil surfaces throughout the parametric study of the aspect ratio variation they determined that the 3d effect of chord wise flexible foil is slightly higher than that of rigid foil an obvious limitation of the existing studies regarding oscillating hydrofoil energy generation is that the incoming flow is always deemed uniform and steady this assumption is an oversimplification because real flows are often unsteady and nonuniform using 2d numerical simulation zhu 2012 investigated the energy harvesting performance of an oscillating foil in shear flow tian et al 2015 studied the phase difference in orbital flows over flapping foils in propulsion and energy harvesting chen et al 2017 and zhan et al 2017 numerically investigated the energy harvesting performance of fully and semi activated flapping airfoils under wing gust conditions respectively however the time varying velocity of the tidal current has not yet been considered systematically in oscillating foil energy generation in this study a sinusoidal oscillation freestream is employed to assess the effects of time varying freestream velocity 2 oscillating foil kinematics parameters as mentioned previously there are three oscillating foil types based on energy harvesting systems in accordance with the actuation mechanisms applied namely fully active semi active and fully passive systems xiao and zhu 2014 with the first type the foil undergoes the prescribed heaving and pitching motions without consideration of the actuation mechanism with the second and third types the foil executes the imposed pitching and induced heaving motions and the self sustained pitching and heaving motions respectively for the sake of simplicity the prescribed motion mode whereby the foil experiences a sinusoidal motion of heaving and pitching simultaneously is used for analysis in the majority of research on oscillating foil the pitching axis is located at 1 3 of the chord length from the leading edge xiao and zhu 2014 it is therefore a reasonable selection for this study a sketch of the oscillating foil motion is presented in fig 1 and the motion components equations are as follows 1 θ t θ 0 sin 2 π f t y t y 0 sin 2 π f t φ where c is the chord length u is the mean freestream velocity t is the time of one cycle θ 0 and y 0 are the oscillating amplitudes for pitching and heaving respectively y 0 c 1 f is the oscillation frequency and φ is the phase difference between the heaving and pitching motions in the study φ is kept constant at 90 the reduced frequency f is defined as f π f c u and the heaving velocity is v y t d y t d t the tidal current cannot maintain a constant velocity owing to the seabed conditions and wind wave effects according to data collected by engineering business limited dti 2005 and kinsey and dumas 2012a the freestream velocity varies over time for the sake of simplicity and referring to other assumptions gharali and johnson 2013 johansen 1999 zhan et al 2017 the freestream velocity is assumed as a sinusoidal varying form as illustrated in fig 1 the horizontal velocity u t is governed by 2 u t u 1 λ sin 2 π f v t where λ is the reduced freestream oscillation amplitude and f v is the freestream oscillation frequency the freestream oscillation factor μ x is defined as 3 μ x f v 2 f where μ x ranges from 0 to 1 it should be noted that μ x 0 represents a constant freestream velocity the instantaneous power p t extracted from the oncoming flow comes from the sum of the heaving and pitching contribution 4 p t p h t p θ t f y t v y t m t ω t where f y t is the force component in the vertical direction and m t is the torque around the pitching center the f y t and m t values can be dealt with in a dimensionless manner as the lift coefficient c y t and moment coefficient c m t respectively furthermore the power coefficient c p and cycle averaged power coefficient c p are denoted by 5 c p p t 1 2 ρ u t 3 b c 6 c p 2 t 0 t c y t v y t c m t ω t u t dt where b indicates the foil span for a 2d foil we assume that the foil span has a unit length the effective angle of attack is smaller than the pitching angle because of the heaving motion however the effective angle of attack has a positive relation with the pitching angle the effective angle of attack is expressed as the combination of the plunging induced and pitching angles 7 α e t tan 1 v y t u t θ t for a 2d foil the swept area s of the oscillating foil equals the overall vertical extent of the foil motion therefore the energy harvesting efficiency η can be defined as 8 η c p s at fixed pitching and heaving amplitudes there exists a linear relation between the cycle averaged power coefficient and energy harvesting efficiency consequently the energy extraction efficiency is not applied when discussing the effects of the time varying freestream velocity because c p can effectively embody the energy harvesting performance of the oscillating foil 3 computational method the foil used generally has a larger span owing to the characteristics of the oscillating foil generator kinsey and dumas 2012a xiao and zhu 2014 kinsey and dumas 2012c revealed that in 3d reality the performance reduction relative to a 2d foil may be limited to nearly 10 at a larger aspect ratio considering the computational resources a 2d foil is selected to analyze the effects of the time varying flow field therefore the governing equations for the unsteady incompressible flow around the naca0015 foil are the 2d navier stokes equations and which can be expressed as follows 9 u i x i 0 10 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i v 2 u i where i 1 and 2 are the x and y coordinates respectively u i is the velocity f i is the body force p is the pressure and v is the viscosity the governing equations were discretized based on the finite volume method fvm using the software fluent karbasian et al 2016 kinsey and dumas 2012a the grid model used for computation was established with dynamic mesh and a sliding interface the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm was selected for pressure velocity coupling a bounded second order upwind was applied for discretizing the convection and diffusion terms the foil movement and freestream velocity were controlled by means of user defined function udf the fourth period was selected as the starting point for computing the power and forces coefficients because of the stable convergence computations an overview of the mesh as well as boundary conditions is presented in fig 2 the square fluid computational field was divided into two sections by the sliding interface the computational domain center was located at the pitching axis 1c 3 of the foil the internal fluid field experiences a synchronous rigid heaving pitching rigid movement with the foil which ensures that no twisting occurs in the core computational domain the external region deformation is only affected by the sliding interface heaving motion thus grid distortion because of pitching motion is avoided to verify the mesh model reliability the grid number and time step independence were validated with different levels computational details and results are plotted in fig 3 the results reveal that the effect of grid and time step quantity can be ignored the fluid solver was validated in our previous studies ma et al 2017 2018 here the mesh model and parameter settings were further verified by comparing the results to those of the existing study firstly validation was performed in the vorticity field against the work of kinsey and dumas under the same condition using the software fluent kinsey and dumas 2012a as shown in fig 4 a the energy harvesting performance was further validated against the work of liu et al 2017 which used the immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm as shown in fig 4 b the findings indicate that the results of this paper agree well with the literature which demonstrates the appropriateness of the numerical method 4 results and discussion existing studies demonstrated that the maximum angle of attack α m a x has an obvious effect on the hydrodynamics of the oscillating foil hover et al 2004 kinsey and dumas 2008 therefore six types of motion parameters as well as α m a x are selected for analyzing the effects of time varying freestream velocity on energy harvesting performance details of the motion parameters applied for computation are provided in table 1 in order to study the effects of time varying freestream velocity c p which is effectively related to energy harvesting performance is first examined an example of the typical c p varying with μ x for different λ is illustrated in fig 5 at the same λ value c p fluctuates evidently with the change in μ x this means that the oscillation frequency of the time varying freestream velocity has a significant effect on the energy harvesting performance of the oscillating foil this can be attributed to various freestream velocity profiles existing for different μ x values the c p fluctuation is particularly obvious at a smaller μ x it should be noted that the trend of the changing c p versus μ x is not consistent for different motion parameters the c p fluctuation is more conspicuous in the case of a larger reduced oscillation frequency f and pitching amplitude θ 0 at a smaller pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency c p fluctuates slightly with a changing μ x when μ x exceeds 0 4 thus for a larger oscillation frequency of the varying freestream a more intense variation in freestream velocity the effect of the freestream fluctuation on energy harvesting performance is negligible it is furthermore determined that the c p fluctuation is relatively small at approximately μ x 0 5 this is because the foil motion and freestream variation are almost synchronous for different λ values a slight distinction appears in the tendency of c p versus μ x for the same motion parameters a larger λ results in greater fluctuation the maximum difference is less than 6 in the case of θ 0 40 and f 0 08 for λ 0 05 while the difference exceeds 17 for θ 0 70 and f 0 16 when λ 0 15 for a large λ c p exhibits more obvious fluctuation this is readily comprehensible because a larger λ means greater freestream velocity oscillation amplitude fig 5 indicates that the reduced freestream velocity oscillation amplitude λ has a slight effect on the variation trend of c p therefore the selection of λ 0 1 is appropriate for the analysis in the following sections in order to study the discrepancies in the behavior of c p the evolutions of c p versus t at fixed motion parameters and fixed μ x are considered respectively fig 6 illustrates the variation in c p versus t at θ 0 60 and f 0 13 when the freestream oscillation frequency is an integral multiple of that of the foil such as μ x is 0 5 and 1 c p exhibits little discrepancy at different t values owing to the same averaged freestream velocity under these circumstances the curves of c p form an approximately straight line the discrepancy in c p is noticeable at different periods when the freestream oscillation frequency is a non integer multiple of that of the foil this can be attributed to the velocity distribution not being uniform at different periods moreover various trends are observed for c p varying with t at different μ x because the freestream velocity profile differs the fluctuation of c p versus t is low at a larger μ x because the discrepancy of the averaged freestream velocity of one period is relatively small at a large μ x for different periods fig 7 presents the variation in c p versus t for the cases μ x 0 2 and 0 65 at a fixed μ x the freestream velocity exhibits the same variation trend for different motion parameters which leads to the variation trend of c p versus t being roughly similar for different motion parameters furthermore it is observed that a larger θ 0 and f results in a more obvious fluctuation of c p the selection of α m a x has a slight effect on the evolution of c p in the case of θ 0 70 and f 0 16 a 16 77 difference in c p is observed in different periods as discussed previously the mean power coefficient over one period cannot accurately reflect the real energy harvesting performance under the time varying freestream because the freestream exhibits a different velocity distribution at a fixed μ x however the averaged freestream velocity remains constant for a lengthy period consequently to assess the energy harvesting performance accurately c pmean is introduced which is the mean power coefficient over eight periods as shown in fig 8 c pmean fluctuates within a narrow range as μ x changes in the case of θ 0 40 and f 0 08 the curve of c pmean versus μ x is almost a straight line compared to the special case of μ x 0 the maximum difference in c pmean is less than 3 97 for θ 0 70 and f 0 16 moreover discrepancies can be identified in the trend of the varying c pmean with μ x for different motion parameters it can be concluded that the time varying freestream velocity slightly affects the total energy harvesting performance for a lengthy period this characteristic strongly agrees with the results of kinsey and dumas 2012a the power coefficient comes from the total of the heaving motion contribution c ph and pitching motion contribution c pθ previous work revealed that the lift is the major contributor to the energy harvesting of the oscillating foil kinsey and dumas 2012a le and ko 2015 a similar conclusion was obtained by xie et al 2014 in their modified motion model therefore the instantaneous lift coefficient c y and instantaneous power coefficient c p are examined to interpret the causes of the differences in c p as presented in fig 9 as illustrated in fig 9 a the same evolution trend can be observed for c y before the angle of attack reaches the dynamic stall angle c y increases rapidly with the increase in pitching angle boundary layer separation and vortex shedding will appear because the angle of attack exceeds the dynamic stall angle vortex shedding takes amounts of energy and leads to sudden changes in the pressure field furthermore the increase in the pitching angle reduces the windward area in the lift direction therefore c y quickly declines after it reaches the peak value an obvious discrepancy can be observed in the peak value of cy the maximum difference reaches 45 68 for different μ x values a possible reason for this is that different freestream velocities exist in the peak value vicinity this results in different vortex structures and pressure distributions around the foil surface following the vortex shedding from the foil surface the flow field around the foil will recover and cy will rise again as can be observed from fig 9 a the time varying freestream velocity will not change the curve shape of the c p evolution the curves represent synchronization between the evolutions of c y and c p compared to c y the difference in the cp evolution is relatively small for varying μ x values however a discrepancy can also be observed in the peak value of c p in particular for the peak value reached by c y following vortex shedding the maximum difference exceeds 15 43 this can be attributed to the synchronization between the maximum value of the heaving velocity and the instantaneous lift and is the main reason leadng to the discrepancy of c p for different μ x in fig 5 at a fixed μ x both c y and c p exhibit periodic evolution for μ x 0 with a slight discrepancy at different periods obvious discrepancies can be observed in the curves for μ x 0 2 and 0 65 at different periods regardless of the evolution of c y or c p this leads to a varying c p in different periods as shown in fig 7 the discrepancies in the evolution of c y and c p are more obvious near the peak value for different μ x a close up examination of near body flow fields is very helpful for researching the discrepancies in the c y behavior fig 10 shows the vortex field and velocity distributions around the foil at t t 5 8 for different μ x when fluid flows through foil the boundary layer will be changed if the freestream velocity gradient experiences a large change the boundary layer will separate from the foil surface and form a leading edge vortex at the foil head the leading edge vortex develops with a further increasing in the angle of attack this changes the pressure field distribution which related to the hydrodynamic behavior in fig 10 the leading edge vortex is evolving and several vortices can be observed in the wake of the foil with the evolution of the leading edge vortex it sheds from the foil head and interacts with the trailing edge this leads to boundary layer thickening near the trailing edge and gradually extending to the leading edge of the foil although leading edge vortex evolution can be observed for different μ x values a discrepancy exists in the vortex structure more precisely the leading edge vortex has differing degree of interaction with the trailing edge for varying μ x for μ x 0 65 the leading edge vortex has a relatively slight interaction with the trailing edge a small area of the boundary layer near the trailing edge is thick compared to μ x 0 65 the interaction between the leading edge vortex and trailing edge of the foil is more stronger for μ x 0 2 the boundary layer near the trailing edge has already thickened it has a large interaction zone and almost covers the foil lower surface corresponding to the vortex field a discrepancy exists in the velocity distribution around the foil for different μ x values on the upper foil surface the freestream velocity variation gradient δ u exhibits a trend of δ u μ x 0 2 δ u μ x 0 δ u μ x 0 65 thus the pressure gradient is the highest for the case of μ x 0 2 as displayed in fig 12 a different orders of the freestream velocity variation gradient exist on the lower surface for different μ x values owing to the interaction between the leading edge vortex and the trailing edge the bernoulli equation reveals that an increasing velocity will result in a declining pressure gradient and negative pressure is generated on the lower surface as a result in particular a deeply low negative pressure is produced near the foil leading edge the largest freestream velocity variation gradient is observed for μ x 0 2 and the negative pressure gradient is correspondingly lowest fig 11 presents the vortex field and velocity distributions around the foil at different moments for μ x 0 2 at a small angle of attack a vortex will not be formed when fluid flows through the foil however it leads to a change in the boundary layer with a thicker boundary layer on the upper surface although little difference is observed in the vortex field at different moments discrepancies can still be observed in the velocity distribution the freestream velocity variation gradient on the upper surface exhibits the trend δ u t t 1 8 δ u t t 9 8 δ u t t 17 8 thus a relatively higher pressure gradient exists on the upper surface at t t 1 8 on the lower surface near the leading edge the largest freestream velocity variation gradient is observed at t t 9 8 consequently the negative pressure is lowest according to fig 12 the velocity difference between the upper and lower surfaces is δ u μ x 0 2 δ u μ x 0 δ u μ x 0 65 the pressure difference exhibits the same trend that is the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces for μ x 0 2 is largest at t t 5 8 the corresponding c y is largest in fig 9 a similarly the value of c y is relatively larger at t t 9 8 for the case of μ x 0 2 it can be concluded that the time varying freestream velocity results in various velocity distribution profiles at different μ x values even for the same case of μ x the velocity distribution is inconsistent in different periods with the same motion parameters both the vortex field and velocity distribution exhibit obvious discrepancies at different oscillation frequencies of the freestream variation although the vortex field discrepancy is slight because the freestream velocity fluctuates within a narrow range discrepancies still can be observed in the velocity distribution around the foil 5 conclusions a systematic investigation was carried out on an oscillating foil with time varying freestream velocity the energy harvesting performance and related hydrodynamic characteristics were discussed for various μ x as well as λ values several conclusions can be drawn from the computational results the time varying freestream velocity results in different velocity profiles for both different μ x and periods resulting in unstable energy harvesting by the oscillating foil it is observed that c p fluctuates obviously with changes in μ x the maximum fluctuation of c p is greater than 16 for a special case the trend for the varying c p with μ x is similar for different motion parameters moreover a larger λ causes a wide fluctuation of c p however the mean power coefficient c pmean fluctuates within a very small range with μ x and the maximum fluctuation of c pmean is less than 4 therefore the time varying freestream has little impact on the total energy harvesting efficiency owing to the same averaged freestream velocity for a lengthy period in summary the hydrological conditions should first be considered when the oscillating foil device is designed especially because the freestream is more complicated in real conditions otherwise the energy extraction performance of the oscillating foil can scarcely be predicated acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the national natural science foundation of china no 51475270 the scientific and technological development

stokes equations and which can be expressed as follows 9 u i x i 0 10 u i t u j u i x j f i 1 ρ p x i v 2 u i where i 1 and 2 are the x and y coordinates respectively u i is the velocity f i is the body force p is the pressure and v is the viscosity the governing equations were discretized based on the finite volume method fvm using the software fluent karbasian et al 2016 kinsey and dumas 2012a the grid model used for computation was established with dynamic mesh and a sliding interface the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm was selected for pressure velocity coupling a bounded second order upwind was applied for discretizing the convection and diffusion terms the foil movement and freestream velocity were controlled by means of user defined function udf the fourth period was selected as the starting point for computing the power and forces coefficients because of the stable convergence computations an overview of the mesh as well as boundary conditions is presented in fig 2 the square fluid computational field was divided into two sections by the sliding interface the computational domain center was located at the pitching axis 1c 3 of the foil the internal fluid field experiences a synchronous rigid heaving pitching rigid movement with the foil which ensures that no twisting occurs in the core computational domain the external region deformation is only affected by the sliding interface heaving motion thus grid distortion because of pitching motion is avoided to verify the mesh model reliability the grid number and time step independence were validated with different levels computational details and results are plotted in fig 3 the results reveal that the effect of grid and time step quantity can be ignored the fluid solver was validated in our previous studies ma et al 2017 2018 here the mesh model and parameter settings were further verified by comparing the results to those of the existing study firstly validation was performed in the vorticity field against the work of kinsey and dumas under the same condition using the software fluent kinsey and dumas 2012a as shown in fig 4 a the energy harvesting performance was further validated against the work of liu et al 2017 which used the immersed boundary lattice boltzmann method ib lbm as shown in fig 4 b the findings indicate that the results of this paper agree well with the literature which demonstrates the appropriateness of the numerical method 4 results and discussion existing studies demonstrated that the maximum angle of attack α m a x has an obvious effect on the hydrodynamics of the oscillating foil hover et al 2004 kinsey and dumas 2008 therefore six types of motion parameters as well as α m a x are selected for analyzing the effects of time varying freestream velocity on energy harvesting performance details of the motion parameters applied for computation are provided in table 1 in order to study the effects of time varying freestream velocity c p which is effectively related to energy harvesting performance is first examined an example of the typical c p varying with μ x for different λ is illustrated in fig 5 at the same λ value c p fluctuates evidently with the change in μ x this means that the oscillation frequency of the time varying freestream velocity has a significant effect on the energy harvesting performance of the oscillating foil this can be attributed to various freestream velocity profiles existing for different μ x values the c p fluctuation is particularly obvious at a smaller μ x it should be noted that the trend of the changing c p versus μ x is not consistent for different motion parameters the c p fluctuation is more conspicuous in the case of a larger reduced oscillation frequency f and pitching amplitude θ 0 at a smaller pitching amplitude and oscillation frequency c p fluctuates slightly with a changing μ x when μ x exceeds 0 4 thus for a larger oscillation frequency of the varying freestream a more intense variation in freestream velocity the effect of the freestream fluctuation on energy harvesting performance is negligible it is furthermore determined that the c p fluctuation is relatively small at approximately μ x 0 5 this is because the foil motion and freestream variation are almost synchronous for different λ values a slight distinction appears in the tendency of c p versus μ x for the same motion parameters a larger λ results in greater fluctuation the maximum difference is less than 6 in the case of θ 0 40 and f 0 08 for λ 0 05 while the difference exceeds 17 for θ 0 70 and f 0 16 when λ 0 15 for a large λ c p exhibits more obvious fluctuation this is readily comprehensible because a larger λ means greater freestream velocity oscillation amplitude fig 5 indicates that the reduced freestream velocity oscillation amplitude λ has a slight effect on the variation trend of c p therefore the selection of λ 0 1 is appropriate for the analysis in the following sections in order to study the discrepancies in the behavior of c p the evolutions of c p versus t at fixed motion parameters and fixed μ x are considered respectively fig 6 illustrates the variation in c p versus t at θ 0 60 and f 0 13 when the freestream oscillation frequency is an integral multiple of that of the foil such as μ x is 0 5 and 1 c p exhibits little discrepancy at different t values owing to the same averaged freestream velocity under these circumstances the curves of c p form an approximately straight line the discrepancy in c p is noticeable at different periods when the freestream oscillation frequency is a non integer multiple of that of the foil this can be attributed to the velocity distribution not being uniform at different periods moreover various trends are observed for c p varying with t at different μ x because the freestream velocity profile differs the fluctuation of c p versus t is low at a larger μ x because the discrepancy of the averaged freestream velocity of one period is relatively small at a large μ x for different periods fig 7 presents the variation in c p versus t for the cases μ x 0 2 and 0 65 at a fixed μ x the freestream velocity exhibits the same variation trend for different motion parameters which leads to the variation trend of c p versus t being roughly similar for different motion parameters furthermore it is observed that a larger θ 0 and f results in a more obvious fluctuation of c p the selection of α m a x has a slight effect on the evolution of c p in the case of θ 0 70 and f 0 16 a 16 77 difference in c p is observed in different periods as discussed previously the mean power coefficient over one period cannot accurately reflect the real energy harvesting performance under the time varying freestream because the freestream exhibits a different velocity distribution at a fixed μ x however the averaged freestream velocity remains constant for a lengthy period consequently to assess the energy harvesting performance accurately c pmean is introduced which is the mean power coefficient over eight periods as shown in fig 8 c pmean fluctuates within a narrow range as μ x changes in the case of θ 0 40 and f 0 08 the curve of c pmean versus μ x is almost a straight line compared to the special case of μ x 0 the maximum difference in c pmean is less than 3 97 for θ 0 70 and f 0 16 moreover discrepancies can be identified in the trend of the varying c pmean with μ x for different motion parameters it can be concluded that the time varying freestream velocity slightly affects the total energy harvesting performance for a lengthy period this characteristic strongly agrees with the results of kinsey and dumas 2012a the power coefficient comes from the total of the heaving motion contribution c ph and pitching motion contribution c pθ previous work revealed that the lift is the major contributor to the energy harvesting of the oscillating foil kinsey and dumas 2012a le and ko 2015 a similar conclusion was obtained by xie et al 2014 in their modified motion model therefore the instantaneous lift coefficient c y and instantaneous power coefficient c p are examined to interpret the causes of the differences in c p as presented in fig 9 as illustrated in fig 9 a the same evolution trend can be observed for c y before the angle of attack reaches the dynamic stall angle c y increases rapidly with the increase in pitching angle boundary layer separation and vortex shedding will appear because the angle of attack exceeds the dynamic stall angle vortex shedding takes amounts of energy and leads to sudden changes in the pressure field furthermore the increase in the pitching angle reduces the windward area in the lift direction therefore c y quickly declines after it reaches the peak value an obvious discrepancy can be observed in the peak value of cy the maximum difference reaches 45 68 for different μ x values a possible reason for this is that different freestream velocities exist in the peak value vicinity this results in different vortex structures and pressure distributions around the foil surface following the vortex shedding from the foil surface the flow field around the foil will recover and cy will rise again as can be observed from fig 9 a the time varying freestream velocity will not change the curve shape of the c p evolution the curves represent synchronization between the evolutions of c y and c p compared to c y the difference in the cp evolution is relatively small for varying μ x values however a discrepancy can also be observed in the peak value of c p in particular for the peak value reached by c y following vortex shedding the maximum difference exceeds 15 43 this can be attributed to the synchronization between the maximum value of the heaving velocity and the instantaneous lift and is the main reason leadng to the discrepancy of c p for different μ x in fig 5 at a fixed μ x both c y and c p exhibit periodic evolution for μ x 0 with a slight discrepancy at different periods obvious discrepancies can be observed in the curves for μ x 0 2 and 0 65 at different periods regardless of the evolution of c y or c p this leads to a varying c p in different periods as shown in fig 7 the discrepancies in the evolution of c y and c p are more obvious near the peak value for different μ x a close up examination of near body flow fields is very helpful for researching the discrepancies in the c y behavior fig 10 shows the vortex field and velocity distributions around the foil at t t 5 8 for different μ x when fluid flows through foil the boundary layer will be changed if the freestream velocity gradient experiences a large change the boundary layer will separate from the foil surface and form a leading edge vortex at the foil head the leading edge vortex develops with a further increasing in the angle of attack this changes the pressure field distribution which related to the hydrodynamic behavior in fig 10 the leading edge vortex is evolving and several vortices can be observed in the wake of the foil with the evolution of the leading edge vortex it sheds from the foil head and interacts with the trailing edge this leads to boundary layer thickening near the trailing edge and gradually extending to the leading edge of the foil although leading edge vortex evolution can be observed for different μ x values a discrepancy exists in the vortex structure more precisely the leading edge vortex has differing degree of interaction with the trailing edge for varying μ x for μ x 0 65 the leading edge vortex has a relatively slight interaction with the trailing edge a small area of the boundary layer near the trailing edge is thick compared to μ x 0 65 the interaction between the leading edge vortex and trailing edge of the foil is more stronger for μ x 0 2 the boundary layer near the trailing edge has already thickened it has a large interaction zone and almost covers the foil lower surface corresponding to the vortex field a discrepancy exists in the velocity distribution around the foil for different μ x values on the upper foil surface the freestream velocity variation gradient δ u exhibits a trend of δ u μ x 0 2 δ u μ x 0 δ u μ x 0 65 thus the pressure gradient is the highest for the case of μ x 0 2 as displayed in fig 12 a different orders of the freestream velocity variation gradient exist on the lower surface for different μ x values owing to the interaction between the leading edge vortex and the trailing edge the bernoulli equation reveals that an increasing velocity will result in a declining pressure gradient and negative pressure is generated on the lower surface as a result in particular a deeply low negative pressure is produced near the foil leading edge the largest freestream velocity variation gradient is observed for μ x 0 2 and the negative pressure gradient is correspondingly lowest fig 11 presents the vortex field and velocity distributions around the foil at different moments for μ x 0 2 at a small angle of attack a vortex will not be formed when fluid flows through the foil however it leads to a change in the boundary layer with a thicker boundary layer on the upper surface although little difference is observed in the vortex field at different moments discrepancies can still be observed in the velocity distribution the freestream velocity variation gradient on the upper surface exhibits the trend δ u t t 1 8 δ u t t 9 8 δ u t t 17 8 thus a relatively higher pressure gradient exists on the upper surface at t t 1 8 on the lower surface near the leading edge the largest freestream velocity variation gradient is observed at t t 9 8 consequently the negative pressure is lowest according to fig 12 the velocity difference between the upper and lower surfaces is δ u μ x 0 2 δ u μ x 0 δ u μ x 0 65 the pressure difference exhibits the same trend that is the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces for μ x 0 2 is largest at t t 5 8 the corresponding c y is largest in fig 9 a similarly the value of c y is relatively larger at t t 9 8 for the case of μ x 0 2 it can be concluded that the time varying freestream velocity results in various velocity distribution profiles at different μ x values even for the same case of μ x the velocity distribution is inconsistent in different periods with the same motion parameters both the vortex field and velocity distribution exhibit obvious discrepancies at different oscillation frequencies of the freestream variation although the vortex field discrepancy is slight because the freestream velocity fluctuates within a narrow range discrepancies still can be observed in the velocity distribution around the foil 5 conclusions a systematic investigation was carried out on an oscillating foil with time varying freestream velocity the energy harvesting performance and related hydrodynamic characteristics were discussed for various μ x as well as λ values several conclusions can be drawn from the computational results the time varying freestream velocity results in different velocity profiles for both different μ x and periods resulting in unstable energy harvesting by the oscillating foil it is observed that c p fluctuates obviously with changes in μ x the maximum fluctuation of c p is greater than 16 for a special case the trend for the varying c p with μ x is similar for different motion parameters moreover a larger λ causes a wide fluctuation of c p however the mean power coefficient c pmean fluctuates within a very small range with μ x and the maximum fluctuation of c pmean is less than 4 therefore the time varying freestream has little impact on the total energy harvesting efficiency owing to the same averaged freestream velocity for a lengthy period in summary the hydrological conditions should first be considered when the oscillating foil device is designed especially because the freestream is more complicated in real conditions otherwise the energy extraction performance of the oscillating foil can scarcely be predicated acknowledgments the authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the national natural science foundation of china no 51475270 the scientific and technological development

23561,using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver numerical investigations of hydrodynamic interactions of a conceptual flng lng offloading system in regular head sea waves are presented initially a verification study is performed on estimating the numerical uncertainties within the urans model based on the validated computational setup the gap wave responses and wave loads on the flng and lng vessels are studied for different wave frequencies and varying lateral separations urans predictions on the gap wave responses are compared with that from the experiments and demonstrate better accuracy over potential flow calculations especially at relatively high wave frequency conditions where gap wave resonance occurs from the data gathered it is seen that the gap wave resonance appears when the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the gap fluid resulting in significant variation of wave loads in the directions of sway heave pitch and yaw meanwhile reduction in the lateral separation shifts the occurrence of gap wave resonance to a higher wave frequency and brings more significant exaggerations on the gap waves and wave loads furthermore when comparing model and full scale wave loads and gap wave responses the two series of data correlate well implying insignificant influence of scale effects keywords flng lng interaction wave loads gap

an lng carrier are often of limited duration depending on the sea environment in extreme seas or even in moderate sea states strong hydrodynamic interactions between the flng and lng may occur with resonant motions of the fluid in the gap between the two ships this could consequently result in excessive ship motions which constrain the operability of on board facilities numerous methods have been developed by earlier researchers investigating the hydrodynamic interactions between side by side ships in waves and the vast majority among these studies relies on experiments and potential flow theory the very first and original experimental work on this subject was carried out by taylor 1909 it was the first time that the complexity of the hydrodynamic interaction was recognised and further evaluation was suggested many researchers continued research in this area and one of the most well known publications was by newton 1960 discussing the feasibility of side by side offloading in deep water the fundamental potential flow approach of investigating the ship ship interactions was proposed by tuck and newman 1974 and abkowitz et al 1976 since then the method has been implemented continuously by many researchers kodan 1984 fang and kim 1986 for the modelling of more sophisticated ship hulls studies have demonstrated that the potential flow method is able to predict the first and second order wave loads for side by side ships fang and chen 2002 kashiwagi 2004 kashiwagi et al 2005 by integrating wave loads and mechanical coupling into the rigid body dynamic equations motion responses of a side by side offloading system e g the flng lng offloading system are solved for the desired time domain kim et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2017a conducted experimental and numerical analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of typical single point turret moored flng lng offloading system good correspondences in mooring loads and relative motions were achieved in recent years attentions are drawn on the effect of gap wave resonance for the side by side offloading configuration molin et al 2009 perić and swan 2015 and zhao et al 2017b all carried out experimental investigations of gap wave resonance between ship shaped floating structures several different resonance modes were identified experimentally including contributions from higher harmonics however linear potential flow method often over predicts the amplitudes of gap waves around the resonance frequency due to the absence of viscous damping in the fluid huijsmans et al 2001 molin et al 2009 this could lead to inaccurate predictions of wave loads and ship motions to achieve more conservative results methods to suppress the unrealistic gap wave elevations including the rigid buchner et al 2001 flexible newman 2004 and dissipative epsilon damping lid chen 2005 were proposed it must be noted that the damping coefficients are generally empirical being tuned based on experimental data this emphasises that experimental work is still indispensable when studying the ship to ship interactions in waves despite its advantages of providing direct and reliable solutions experimental measurements can be expensive and time consuming when predicting the ship to ship interactions in waves similarly the linear potential flow method also has its own limitations as it barely solves viscous effects associated flow separation and nonlinear free surface boundaries which are regarded as the main sources of the discrepancies between the potential theory and experiments zhao et al 2017 as computational power grows rapidly in the past decade reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis has drawn much attention the method accounts for viscous effects and is expected to perform more accurate predictions on the interaction forces and moments and the amplitudes of the gap waves without calibration against experiments in recent years extensive studies have been carried out using rans based methods steady and unsteady on predicting the ship ship interaction forces and moments considering variables such as froude number drift angle and relative positions sadat hosseini et al 2011 zou and larsson 2013 jin et al 2016a although the results show good agreement with experimental data the application has only been proven for calm water interaction problems the feasibility and accuracy of rans urans modelling of ship to ship interactions in waves are yet needed to be studied in light of the above urans computations are presented for investigating the hydrodynamic interactions between a conceptual flng and a lng vessel in a side by side offloading configuration this study aims to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of cfd urans method for investigating ship to ship hydrodynamic interactions in waves the computations are carried out in regular head sea waves with both vessels fully constrained in 6 degrees of freedom dof physical model scale experiments are performed for the validation of the numerical approach based on the validated numerical model a series of systematic computations is reported for studying the wave loads and gap wave responses of the flng lng system for different wave frequencies and lateral separations furthermore the computations are also performed in full scale to quantify possible scale effects in the prediction of wave loads and gap wave responses 2 ship geometry in this study the marad systematic series full form ship models from roseman 1987 were used to represent a generic flng hull design and a lng shuttle tanker which operates alongside the flng the hull forms are shown in fig 1 the modelled full scale flng has an overall length of 422 m and a displacement of approximately 600 000 tonnes at its fully loaded condition at the same time the lng carrier was studied for an empty hull condition ready for the liquid cargo to be loaded the geometry particulars of the lng and flng are illustrated in table 1 the stretched marad f series here represents a marad f series hull that has been lengthened by 24 0 in the x direction but the beam and depth remain the same ratio as the original 3 computational method the present computations are carried out using commercial urans solver star ccm the code uses a finite volume discretisation on structured or unstructured grids consisting of arbitrary convex polyhedrals the pressure velocity coupling is solved using a pimple algorithm where its practical implementation is discussed in cd adapco 2014 3 1 urans equations and turbulence modelling the governing equations for the two phase incompressible flow combining air and water are given by the urans equations coupled with the conservation of continuity rusche 2003 1 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ u ρ τ σ t κ γ γ 2 u 0 here u u v w is the velocity field in cartesian coordinates p represents the pressure including hydrostatic ρ ρ x is the fluid

wilcox 2008 3 2 computational domain boundary conditions and grid the computational domain is designed following the international towing tank conference ittc practical guidelines for ship cfd applications ittc 2014a to avoid blockage effect and wave reflections a schematic drawing of the computed fluid domain is given in fig 2 a velocity inlet boundary condition is applied at the upstream end of the fluid domain where incident regular waves are generated at the downstream end of the fluid domain a damping pressure outlet boundary is imposed to prevent wave reflections the top bottom and side walls of the domain are all selected as velocity inlets to avoid velocity gradient occurring from the boundaries the computational grid is generated according to the cd adapco 2014 recommendations of wave simulations slow cell growth rate is selected to create smooth mesh transition between the refined hull surfaces and the outer boundaries hexahedral trimmer and surface remesher are adopted to generate global volume mesh as well as local refinements to resolve the turbulent boundary layer all y wall treatment is utilised as well as the prism layer mesh achieving y value of around 30 along the hull for all computations at the free surface anisotropic trimmer refinements in both x and z directions are applied which provides approximately 80 cells per wavelength and 20 cells per wave height for accurate wave capturing 3 3 wave generation the fifth order stokes waves are employed for the present computations as it resembles real waves more closely than ones generated by the method using the first order wave theory this higher order wave theory is based on the work by fenton 1985 and is suggested by dnv 2010 for wave generations in this study existing work by tezdogan et al 2015 and jin et al 2016b both applied this approach to generate regular waves their results showed 2 5 difference when compared against input wave height a detailed comparison between the computed waves and theoretical values can be found in jin et al 2017 illustrations of the generated waves at different positions along the computational domain are given in fig 3 4 experimental study model scale measurements of wave loads acting on the flng lng system are presented in this section the two ships were constrained in 6 dof gap wave elevations η were measured using wave probes the experimental results are employed for the validation of numerical simulations 4 1 test program the model tests were performed in the model test basin at the australian maritime college university of tasmania the basin is 35 m long 12 m wide and has a flat bottom with a maximum water depth of 1 0 m the water depth set for the tests in this study was 0 8 m which corresponds to the water depth draft ratio of d tflng 3 3 or d tlng 8 0 the two ships were parallel to each other and the investigated gap separations are 100 mm 0 22blng 200 mm 0 44blng and 350 mm 0 78blng side to side regular waves at an encountering angle of 180 head sea were generated by a multi element wavemaker with 16 paddles the model tests were carried out at the scale of 1 100 for both the flng and lng models due to the water depth limit within the model test basin the waves for some of the tested cases corresponded to transitional water waves the remainder were classified as deep water waves the test conditions are listed in table 2 4 2 model test setup the model tests were conducted according to ittc recommended procedures for seakeeping experiments ittc 2014b fig 4 gives an overview of the model test setup in the model test basin wave energy dissipation devices were located at the rear of the basin to reduce the influence of wave reflection during the tests each of the flng and lng models were mounted to a carriage by a starboard forward post a port forward post and an aft post the posts were fixed in both horizontal and vertical planes to constrain the ship models in 6 dof force transducers were placed at the base of the posts for the measurement of wave loads ball joints were used to connect the base of the load cells to the ship model the aft ball joint incorporated a slide oriented parallel to the longitudinal centreline of the model the forward starboard ball joint incorporated a slide oriented perpendicular to the aft slide the port ball joint did not incorporate a slide the forward and aft post connections were located at the ship model s vcg wave probes were placed between the two vessels for measuring the gap wave elevations η at different incoming wave conditions the positions of probes relative to the lcg of the flng are given in table 3 4 3 instrumentation initial readings of all instruments were taken prior to each run and were checked between runs to ensure that no notable drift had existed sufficient time was allowed between consecutive runs to achieve calm water conditions data acquisition commenced after the regular waves had propagated to 5 m forward of the ship model the sample rate for the wave probes and load cells was set at 200 hz throughout the model test program the wave loads for each test run were derived afterwards from the time series selecting a time window where the phase wave probe had exhibited consistent sinusoidal reading in order to obtain accurate wave elevation measurements wave probes were calibrated on a daily basis before testing for the load cells calibrations were performed at the beginning and at the end of the testing program 4 4 wave loads and gap wave elevations the wave induced forces and moments and the gap wave elevations were measured when the waves are passing through the flng lng system an example of the time history measurements of wave loads are given in fig 5 for the condition of 3 96 rad s head sea waves where no significant non linear effect is observed due to a less displacement the wave loads on the lng are lower compared to that on the flng the gap wave elevations exhibit similar sinusoidal forms as the measured wave loads time history measurements from wave probes are presented in fig 6 it is observed that the amplitude of the gap waves varies at different locations based on a fast fourier transformation fft analysis the gap wave frequency is shown to be consistent to the incident wave frequency as presented in fig 7 more detailed descriptions on the gap wave elevations at different wave frequencies are given in a later section for the comparison with urans computational results the measured wave loads are expressed as transfer functions tf fj and tf mj 7 tf fj f j a 8 tf mj m j a where f j and m j j x y and z are the amplitudes for wave induced force and moment on the ship s hull it also must be noted that the wave induced loads are evaluated referring to the ships local coordinate systems 5 verification and validation before investigating the flng lng interaction systematically it is essential to verify and validate the present computational approach the verification and validation study is carried out for one of the wave conditions ω 6 22 rad s at δs 0 22 blng according to weymouth et al 2005 large forces and motions tend to result in high numerical errors this therefore can be regarded as one of the ideal cases to investigate the greatest numerical errors that exist in our computations for the prediction of large wave loads 5 1 numerical uncertainty firstly a verification study is performed to estimate the numerical uncertainties within the simulations following the procedures by wilson et al 2001 and stern et al 2001 it is assumed that the numerical uncertainty u sn comprises of iterative convergence uncertainty u i grid spacing uncertainty u g and time step uncertainty u t giving the following expression 9 u sn 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 tezdogan et al 2015 estimated the iterative convergence uncertainty in the predictions of motion responses for a container ship using the star ccm urans solver their analysis indicated ui to be less than 0 50 in simulation results which is considered to be negligible since similar computational settings are applied grid and time step uncertainties are of primary interest in the present study the grid and time step convergence study are both conducted with triple solutions systematically the grid uncertainty analysis is performed with the smallest time step whilst the time step independence study was carried out with the finest mesh the details of the grid and time step adopted in the verification study are presented in table 4 referring to simonsen et al 2012 and jin et al 2016c the grid uncertainty of unstructured trimmer mesh can also be estimated based on richardson s extrapolation variations of simulation results s between the fine s1 medium s2 and coarse s3 grids with refinement ratio of r g 2 are identified as 10 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 11 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 the numerical convergence ratio r g can be calculated from equation 12 12 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 depending on the value of the convergence ratio four conditions can be predicted i 0 r g 1 monotonic convergence ii r g 0 r g 1 oscillatory convergence iii 1 r g monotonic divergence iv r g 0 r g 1 oscillatory divergence it is noted that for divergence conditions iii and iv the numerical uncertainty cannot be estimated for the oscillatory convergence ii the numerical uncertainty can be estimated by bounding the error based on oscillation with upper limit s u and lower limit s l using equation 13 13 u g 1 2 s u s l for convergence condition i the generalized richardson extrapolation can be employed to estimate the numerical error δ re g 1 and order of accuracy p g as 14 δ re g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 15 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g there are two ways to estimate the numerical uncertainty depending on whether the solutions are close to the asymptotic range this is determined by the correction factor c g defined as 16 c g r g p g 1 r g p gest 1 where p gest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy if c g approaches unity the solutions are close to the asymptotic range in this case the numerical error δ sn benchmark result s c and uncertainty u g can be estimated from 17 δ sn c g δ re g 1 18 s c s δ sn 19 u g 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ re g 1 1 c g δ re g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g 0 125 when c g is sufficiently greater than 1 which means the solutions are far away from the asymptotic range the numerical uncertainty u g can be calculated from equation 20 20 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ re g 1 2 1 c g 1 δ re g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g 0 125 based on similar procedures the time step uncertainty u t can be estimated a summary of the grid spacing and time step uncertainties for the tested computational case are listed in table 5 and table 6 overall the present computation gives relatively small numerical uncertainties demonstrating its feasibility for undertaking further systematic simulations to validate the computations it is necessary to check if the absolute comparison error e between numerical and experimental results is less than the validation uncertainty u v shown in equation 21 calculated as a combination of numerical uncertainty u sn and experimental uncertainty u d 21 u v u sn 2 u d 2 comparisons between e and u v for the wave load transfer functions from the present computation are given in table 7 it is worth mentioning here that the experimental uncertainties u d are obtained based on the method adopted by longo and stern 2005 and duffy 2008 it is observed that the urans predictions correlate well with the experimental results the average comparison errors are 6 10 and 5 62 for the flng and lng respectively all the investigated parameters are validated except tfmy for the lng this is considered to be acceptable due to a relatively small discrepancy when comparing against the experimental value 6 systematic computations in the previous section urans computation was verified and validated against physical model scale experiments the results demonstrate the feasibility of the present numerical model in predicting the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions in waves applying an analogous numerical approach the flng lng system is investigated for different wave frequencies and lateral separations furthermore the computations have also been performed in full scale to quantify scale effects of the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions in waves an illustration of the test matrix is given in table 8 urans computations are firstly performed for the lateral separation of δs 0 22blng for different incident wave frequencies the results gathered from the numerical simulations are compared with experimental data efd and those obtained from potential flow pf solver aqwa which utilises a three dimensional panel method solving inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid around floating structures for more theoretical explanation of the pf solver reference can be made to the manual of the software ansys 2013 illustrations of urans time history predictions of wave loads on the flng and lng for the wave frequency of 4 40 rad s are presented in fig 8 generally good correlation in the magnitude and period of the wave loads is observed between the urans and efd results by carrying out fft analysis on the time history recordings the wave load transfer functions are derived for the investigated wave frequencies as shown in fig 9 to assess the performance of urans and pf methods the discrepancies between numerical predictions and experimental measurements are quantified in table 9 and table 10 for relatively low wave frequencies 3 96 5 59 rad s the pf and urans predictions are similar as the incident wave frequency increases the urans computation starts to show better correlation with efd data it can be found that the pf method tends to over predict the peak magnitude of the transfer functions particularly for the sway force heave force pitch moment and yaw moment the absolute comparison error for urans and pf predictions against efd results varies between 0 05 and 37 0 and 0 14 47 4 respectively it is seen from fig 9 that the sway force heave force and yaw moment transfer functions vary significantly at relatively high wave frequency conditions this is considered as a consequence of gap wave resonance where the amplified gap waves induce asymmetric pressure distributions on the flng and lng hulls and therefore large disturbances on the wave loads fig 10 presents the significant variation of gap waves under different incident wave frequencies from urans predictions and efd measurements at the incident wave frequency of 3 96 rad s the gap wave elevations recorded at wp 5 and 6 are suppressed to half that of the incident waves on the other hand at the incident wave frequency of 7 23 rad s the gap waves raise to three times the height of the incident wave it is observed that the gap wave response is generally sinusoidal which enables a constant gap wave height h g to be estimated for the convenience of comparing gap wave response at different locations and wave frequencies the non dimensional gap wave height h g is introduced representing the ratio between h g and the incident wave height h o fig 11 presents comparisons of urans efd and pf predictions on the gap wave responses at different wave frequencies for the model scale lateral separation of δs 0 22blng it is found that the gap wave height is similar for urans pf and efd when the incident wave frequency is below 5 59 rad s though there are discrepancies in the magnitude of h g between the numerical and experimental results at certain regions for positions within the range of 0 5 0 0 m relative to lcg of the flng in the x direction the gap waves are suppressed to less than half of the incident wave height at the low frequency conditions 3 96 5 59 rad s the tendency of h g varies differently for high wave frequency conditions 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s close to the natural frequency of the fluid 7 72 rad s in the gap this natural frequency which is outlined in fig 12 is estimated based on an empirical formulae from saitoh et al 2006 and moradi et al 2015 as given in equation 20 the height of the gap waves within the range of 1 0 1 0 m relative to lcg of the flng in the x direction are magnified to 2 4 times of the incident wave height due to resonance effect 20 f n g δ s b d t t it is seen from fig 11 that the urans method provides more accurate predictions of h g especially for the relatively high wave frequency conditions 6 22 rad s 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s on the other hand the pf method tends to over estimate the peak values of gap wave height at these wave frequencies as discussed in the literature review this is primarily due to the absence of viscous damping in the linear potential flow solver this observation also explains the better correlation of urans predictions on the wave load transfer functions over the pf method when comparing with efd results for relatively high wave frequency conditions for better pf calculations additional damping has to be added to the gap waves and it requires to be tuned based on reliable efd data it is also found that the gap wave resonance is not the only dominant factor that influences the wave loads on the flng and lng for instance at the incident wave frequency of 6 66 rad s where the gap waves are significantly exaggerated the sway force is not comparable to that for the wave frequency ω 6 22 rad s to explain this the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the flng and lng hulls are presented in fig 13 this specific time step corresponds to the highest gap wave elevation at the location of x 0 m where the peak repulsive sway force appears when comparing the two different wave frequencies one can observe greater hydrodynamic pressure on the inside wall of the ship hulls for the case of ω 6 22 rad s this leads to a more significant portion of repulsive sway force adding on top of that caused by gap wave excitation and therefore results in a greater net sway force when compared to the wave frequency of ω 6 66 rad s 6 1 free surface around the flng lng offloading system to visualise wave diffraction around the flng lng system in a side by side offloading configuration contours of the free surface elevation are presented in fig 14 for the model scale lateral separation of δs 0 78 blng for low frequency wave conditions the flng lng system acts like an integrated floating structure where the incident waves diffract directly at the forward region of the system the wave energy hardly passes into the gap between the two ships as a result the amplitude of the gap waves becomes less significant than that of the incident waves as the wave frequency increases the incident waves start to penetrate the flng lng system meanwhile the wave frequency shifts closer to the natural frequency of the fluid trapped in the gap and results in great exaggerations of the gap waves to understand the fluid dynamics behind the gap wave resonance in head seas the velocity field around the flng lng cross section x 0 m is presented in fig 15 it can be seen that the gap wave response induces strong cross flow around the two ships with much less noticeable vortical structures when compared to the beam sea conditions shown in moradi et al 2015 when t 0 tw the gap wave is at its crest where the fluid starts to escape from the confined region between the two ships and a small vortex forms near the inner bilge of the flng as time progresses the gap wave keeps decreasing and reaches its lowest elevation at t 3 8 tw after that the fluid starts to be driven back from the far field to the gap at t 1 2 tw this leads to the uprising of gap wave elevation which reaches its maximum at t 7 8 tw one can also find that there is a high velocity region in the gap consistently throughout the presented time intervals the outcome from this is a reduction of hydrodynamic pressure on the inside walls of the flng and lng hulls which leads to strong attraction force at that can be hazardous for operation 6 2 influence of lateral separation between flng and lng in this section the influence of lateral separations on the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions has been investigated fig 16 presents the variation of non dimensional gap wave height h g for the flng lng lateral separations of δs 0 44blng and δs 0 78blng respectively when comparing against fig 11 the pattern of gap waves exhibits similarities for the three lateral separations at low incident wave frequencies of 3 96 rad s 4 40 rad s and 4 71 rad s as the wave frequency increases the gap waves for the condition with lateral separation of δs 0 78blng firstly starts to be exaggerated at the incident wave frequency of 5 09 rad s exaggeration of gap waves for conditions with smaller lateral separation starts at higher wave frequencies 6 22 rad s for δs 0 44blng and 6 66 rad s for δs 0 22blng this indicates the occurrence of gap wave resonance shifts to higher frequencies when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng this is also evident from the inverse relationship between the lateral separation and gap fluid natural frequency in equation 20 in addition the lateral separation also has an influence on the significance of gap wave resonance among the three lateral separations tested δs 0 22blng 0 44blng and 0 78blng it was found that a smaller lateral separation brings severe wave response in the gap between the flng and lng hulls in fig 16 for the lateral separation of δs 0 44blng urans computation still provides better predictions on h g than the pf method when comparing against efd measurements especially for the high wave frequency conditions 6 22 7 23 rad s when the lateral distance increases to 0 78blng this advantage becomes less profound although urans simulation still demonstrates slightly better accuracy the discrepancies between pf and efd measurements on h g has been reduced significantly for the lateral separation of δs 0 78blng this implies that the pf method is suitable to model the gap wave responses for relatively large lateral separations with an acceptable level of accuracy the variation of lateral separation also influences the wave loads on the flng and lng hulls which are associated with the gap wave responses fig 17 presents the wave induced forces and moments from urans efd and pf predictions for the investigated lateral separations of δs 0 44blng and 0 78blng combining with the wave load results for δs 0 22blng in fig 9 some interesting aspects are highlighted here for the surge force given in fig 17 a and b fluctuations on the transfer function are observed at wave frequencies close to the natural frequency of the gap fluid these fluctuations start at relatively higher incident wave frequencies for conditions with less lateral separations for the sway force heave force pitch moment and yaw moment transfer functions in fig 17 c j similar to that observed in the gap wave responses when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng occurrence of the peak transfer function shifts to higher frequencies in addition the lateral separation also influences the significance of the exaggerations on the transfer functions it is found that a smaller lateral separation produces a peak transfer function of greater magnitude in sway force and yaw moment with increasing lateral separation the accuracy of pf predictions on the gap wave response increases this trend is also found on the frequency domain wave loads given in fig 17 the discrepancy between peak transfer functions from pf calculation and efd measurement reduces as the lateral separation increases for the condition of δs 0 78blng the urans efd and pf give very close predictions for the wave forces and moments including the peak values as above in the absence of a tuned damping lid pf method is still feasible to provide predictions on the wave loads with satisfactory level of accuracy for lateral separations greater than 0 44blng 6 3 full scale predictions on flng lng interaction to investigate scale effects in the flng lng interactions in waves full scale urans computations are carried out for the incident wave frequencies of 0 666 rad s and 0 723 rad s at the lateral separation of δs 0 22blng the two cases correspond to the model scale conditions of wave frequencies of 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s by froude scaling the full scale fluid domain and computational grid are scaled isotropically therefore shares the same level of grid density when compared to model scale additional prism cells are added to the full scale ships for achieving similar y distributions along the hull and resolving the boundary layer to the same extent as model scale conditions in this section comparisons are made on the wave loads gap wave elevations and diffracted wave patterns between the model and full scale computations fig 18 presents time series of the model and full scale wave loads acting on the two ships for the incident wave frequency of 6 66 rad s ms and 0 666 rad s fs it is observed that the two series of data correlates well which reflects minor influence of scale effects in the prediction of wave loads for the case studied to further investigate scale effects in the gap wave predictions the model and full scale non dimensional gap wave elevations η are compared at different wave probe locations as given in fig 19 again it is found that scale effects barely influence the gap wave responses model and full scale wave diffractions around the flng lng system are presented in fig 20 the wave patterns exhibit great similarity which demonstrates the minor influences of scale effects in the presented flng lng head sea interaction cases as above this part of the study has shown that model scale simulations are able to represent the full scale conditions for the presented flng lng interaction in head sea waves 7 concluding remarks the hydrodynamic interactions of a conceptual flng lng offloading system has been investigated using viscous urans solver star ccm the computations are carried out with 6 dof motions of the ship being fixed predictions on the wave loads as well as gap wave responses are carried out and compared with that from the physical model scale experiments and inviscid potential flow solver aqwa a verification and validation study is performed based on a chosen wave case to demonstrate the credibility of the computational setup based on the validated urans model a systematic investigation is conducted for analysing the influences of incident wave frequency and lateral separation between the flng and lng on the hydrodynamic interactions furthermore full scale computations are presented to demonstrate scale effects involved in the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions from the computational results the following conclusions can be drawn there is a good correspondence between the experimental and urans computed gap wave responses and wave loads for the investigated conditions demonstrating the credibility of urans approach for studying ship ship interactions in waves viscous urans computations provide more accurate predictions on the gap wave responses over pf method at relatively high wave frequency conditions when the lateral separation between two ships is relatively small δs 0 22blng and 0 44blng with greater lateral separation δs 0 78blng the pf calculations are proven to have similar level of accuracy pf method is still valid and recommended for predicting the wave loads when the incident wave frequency is relatively low and away from the natural frequency of the gap fluid considering its rapid computational time the accuracy of pf method improves as the lateral separation increases gap wave resonance is observed when the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the fluid in the gap between the flng and lng vessels this also leads to significant variation of wave loads in the directions of surge sway heave pitch and yaw changing the lateral separation can strongly affect the ship ship hydrodynamic interactions reduction in the lateral separation between the flng and lng brings greater exaggeration of gap wave responses and shifts the occurrence of gap wave resonance to a higher frequency region the variation of lateral separation poses similar effects on the wave loads in the directions of sway heave pitch and yaw when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng occurrence of peak wave load transfer functions shifts to a higher frequency region the model and full scale urans computations are very close in aspects of wave loads gap wave responses and wave diffractions around the flng lng system which indicates scale effects are not significant for the tested cases in summary this paper tests the feasibility of viscous urans method for investigating ship ship interactions in regular waves comparisons are made with efd and inviscid pf calculations for the demonstration of numerical accuracy suggestions are provided for the applicability of pf method when there are no experimental data available to tune a damping lid however the topic of ship ship interactions requires further investigations since the current study has limitations subject to negligence of the ship motion related wave radiation and the mechanical coupling with stationkeeping system acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the scholarship support provided by the australian maritime

23561,using an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes solver numerical investigations of hydrodynamic interactions of a conceptual flng lng offloading system in regular head sea waves are presented initially a verification study is performed on estimating the numerical uncertainties within the urans model based on the validated computational setup the gap wave responses and wave loads on the flng and lng vessels are studied for different wave frequencies and varying lateral separations urans predictions on the gap wave responses are compared with that from the experiments and demonstrate better accuracy over potential flow calculations especially at relatively high wave frequency conditions where gap wave resonance occurs from the data gathered it is seen that the gap wave resonance appears when the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the gap fluid resulting in significant variation of wave loads in the directions of sway heave pitch and yaw meanwhile reduction in the lateral separation shifts the occurrence of gap wave resonance to a higher wave frequency and brings more significant exaggerations on the gap waves and wave loads furthermore when comparing model and full scale wave loads and gap wave responses the two series of data correlate well implying insignificant influence of scale effects keywords flng lng interaction wave loads gap

spectral density rans reynolds averaged navier stokes urans unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes 1 introduction the offloading operation between a floating liquefied natural gas flng facility and an lng carrier are often of limited duration depending on the sea environment in extreme seas or even in moderate sea states strong hydrodynamic interactions between the flng and lng may occur with resonant motions of the fluid in the gap between the two ships this could consequently result in excessive ship motions which constrain the operability of on board facilities numerous methods have been developed by earlier researchers investigating the hydrodynamic interactions between side by side ships in waves and the vast majority among these studies relies on experiments and potential flow theory the very first and original experimental work on this subject was carried out by taylor 1909 it was the first time that the complexity of the hydrodynamic interaction was recognised and further evaluation was suggested many researchers continued research in this area and one of the most well known publications was by newton 1960 discussing the feasibility of side by side offloading in deep water the fundamental potential flow approach of investigating the ship ship interactions was proposed by tuck and newman 1974 and abkowitz et al 1976 since then the method has been implemented continuously by many researchers kodan 1984 fang and kim 1986 for the modelling of more sophisticated ship hulls studies have demonstrated that the potential flow method is able to predict the first and second order wave loads for side by side ships fang and chen 2002 kashiwagi 2004 kashiwagi et al 2005 by integrating wave loads and mechanical coupling into the rigid body dynamic equations motion responses of a side by side offloading system e g the flng lng offloading system are solved for the desired time domain kim et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 zhao et al 2014 and zhao et al 2017a conducted experimental and numerical analysis on the hydrodynamic performance of typical single point turret moored flng lng offloading system good correspondences in mooring loads and relative motions were achieved in recent years attentions are drawn on the effect of gap wave resonance for the side by side offloading configuration molin et al 2009 perić and swan 2015 and zhao et al 2017b all carried out experimental investigations of gap wave resonance between ship shaped floating structures several different resonance modes were identified experimentally including contributions from higher harmonics however linear potential flow method often over predicts the amplitudes of gap waves around the resonance frequency due to the absence of viscous damping in the fluid huijsmans et al 2001 molin et al 2009 this could lead to inaccurate predictions of wave loads and ship motions to achieve more conservative results methods to suppress the unrealistic gap wave elevations including the rigid buchner et al 2001 flexible newman 2004 and dissipative epsilon damping lid chen 2005 were proposed it must be noted that the damping coefficients are generally empirical being tuned based on experimental data this emphasises that experimental work is still indispensable when studying the ship to ship interactions in waves despite its advantages of providing direct and reliable solutions experimental measurements can be expensive and time consuming when predicting the ship to ship interactions in waves similarly the linear potential flow method also has its own limitations as it barely solves viscous effects associated flow separation and nonlinear free surface boundaries which are regarded as the main sources of the discrepancies between the potential theory and experiments zhao et al 2017 as computational power grows rapidly in the past decade reynolds averaged navier stokes rans based computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis has drawn much attention the method accounts for viscous effects and is expected to perform more accurate predictions on the interaction forces and moments and the amplitudes of the gap waves without calibration against experiments in recent years extensive studies have been carried out using rans based methods steady and unsteady on predicting the ship ship interaction forces and moments considering variables such as froude number drift angle and relative positions sadat hosseini et al 2011 zou and larsson 2013 jin et al 2016a although the results show good agreement with experimental data the application has only been proven for calm water interaction problems the feasibility and accuracy of rans urans modelling of ship to ship interactions in waves are yet needed to be studied in light of the above urans computations are presented for investigating the hydrodynamic interactions between a conceptual flng and a lng vessel in a side by side offloading configuration this study aims to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of cfd urans method for investigating ship to ship hydrodynamic interactions in waves the computations are carried out in regular head sea waves with both vessels fully constrained in 6 degrees of freedom dof physical model scale experiments are performed for the validation of the numerical approach based on the validated numerical model a series of systematic computations is reported for studying the wave loads and gap wave responses of the flng lng system for different wave frequencies and lateral separations furthermore the computations are also performed in full scale to quantify possible scale effects in the prediction of wave loads and gap wave responses 2 ship geometry in this study the marad systematic series full form ship models from roseman 1987 were used to represent a generic flng hull design and a lng shuttle tanker which operates alongside the flng the hull forms are shown in fig 1 the modelled full scale flng has an overall length of 422 m and a displacement of approximately 600 000 tonnes at its fully loaded condition at the same time the lng carrier was studied for an empty hull condition ready for the liquid cargo to be loaded the geometry particulars of the lng and flng are illustrated in table 1 the stretched marad f series here represents a marad f series hull that has been lengthened by 24 0 in the x direction but the beam and depth remain the same ratio as the original 3 computational method the present computations are carried out using commercial urans solver star ccm the code uses a finite volume discretisation on structured or unstructured grids consisting of arbitrary convex polyhedrals the pressure velocity coupling is solved using a pimple algorithm where its practical implementation is discussed in cd adapco 2014 3 1 urans equations and turbulence modelling the governing equations for the two phase incompressible flow combining air and water are given by the urans equations coupled with the conservation of continuity rusche 2003 1 ρ u t ρ uu p g x ρ μ u ρ τ σ t κ γ γ 2 u 0 here u u v w is the velocity field in cartesian coordinates p represents the pressure including hydrostatic ρ ρ x is the fluid density which varies with the content of air water in the computational cells x x y z are the cartesian coordinates g is the gravitational acceleration and μ is the dynamic molecular viscosity here τ

and κ γ is the surface curvature jacobsen et al 2012 the above equations are solved for air and water simultaneously where the fluids are tracked using the volume of fraction γ γ is 0 for air and 1

wilcox 2008 3 2 computational domain boundary conditions and grid the computational domain is designed following the international towing tank conference ittc practical guidelines for ship cfd applications ittc 2014a to avoid blockage effect and wave reflections a schematic drawing of the computed fluid domain is given in fig 2 a velocity inlet boundary condition is applied at the upstream end of the fluid domain where incident regular waves are generated at the downstream end of the fluid domain a damping pressure outlet boundary is imposed to prevent wave reflections the top bottom and side walls of the domain are all selected as velocity inlets to avoid velocity gradient occurring from the boundaries the computational grid is generated according to the cd adapco 2014 recommendations of wave simulations slow cell growth rate is selected to create smooth mesh transition between the refined hull surfaces and the outer boundaries hexahedral trimmer and surface remesher are adopted to generate global volume mesh as well as local refinements to resolve the turbulent boundary layer all y wall treatment is utilised as well as the prism layer mesh achieving y value of around 30 along the hull for all computations at the free surface anisotropic trimmer refinements in both x and z directions are applied which provides approximately 80 cells per wavelength and 20 cells per wave height for accurate wave capturing 3 3 wave generation the fifth order stokes waves are employed for the present computations as it resembles real waves more closely than ones generated by the method using the first order wave theory this higher order wave theory is based on the work by fenton 1985 and is suggested by dnv 2010 for wave generations in this study existing work by tezdogan et al 2015 and jin et al 2016b both applied this approach to generate regular waves their results showed 2 5 difference when compared against input wave height a detailed comparison between the computed waves and theoretical values can be found in jin et al 2017 illustrations of the generated waves at different positions along the computational domain are given in fig 3 4 experimental study model scale measurements of wave loads acting on the flng lng system are presented in this section the two ships were constrained in 6 dof gap wave elevations η were measured using wave probes the experimental results are employed for the validation of numerical simulations 4 1 test program the model tests were performed in the model test basin at the australian maritime college university of tasmania the basin is 35 m long 12 m wide and has a flat bottom with a maximum water depth of 1 0 m the water depth set for the tests in this study was 0 8 m which corresponds to the water depth draft ratio of d tflng 3 3 or d tlng 8 0 the two ships were parallel to each other and the investigated gap separations are 100 mm 0 22blng 200 mm 0 44blng and 350 mm 0 78blng side to side regular waves at an encountering angle of 180 head sea were generated by a multi element wavemaker with 16 paddles the model tests were carried out at the scale of 1 100 for both the flng and lng models due to the water depth limit within the model test basin the waves for some of the tested cases corresponded to transitional water waves the remainder were classified as deep water waves the test conditions are listed in table 2 4 2 model test setup the model tests were conducted according to ittc recommended procedures for seakeeping experiments ittc 2014b fig 4 gives an overview of the model test setup in the model test basin wave energy dissipation devices were located at the rear of the basin to reduce the influence of wave reflection during the tests each of the flng and lng models were mounted to a carriage by a starboard forward post a port forward post and an aft post the posts were fixed in both horizontal and vertical planes to constrain the ship models in 6 dof force transducers were placed at the base of the posts for the measurement of wave loads ball joints were used to connect the base of the load cells to the ship model the aft ball joint incorporated a slide oriented parallel to the longitudinal centreline of the model the forward starboard ball joint incorporated a slide oriented perpendicular to the aft slide the port ball joint did not incorporate a slide the forward and aft post connections were located at the ship model s vcg wave probes were placed between the two vessels for measuring the gap wave elevations η at different incoming wave conditions the positions of probes relative to the lcg of the flng are given in table 3 4 3 instrumentation initial readings of all instruments were taken prior to each run and were checked between runs to ensure that no notable drift had existed sufficient time was allowed between consecutive runs to achieve calm water conditions data acquisition commenced after the regular waves had propagated to 5 m forward of the ship model the sample rate for the wave probes and load cells was set at 200 hz throughout the model test program the wave loads for each test run were derived afterwards from the time series selecting a time window where the phase wave probe had exhibited consistent sinusoidal reading in order to obtain accurate wave elevation measurements wave probes were calibrated on a daily basis before testing for the load cells calibrations were performed at the beginning and at the end of the testing program 4 4 wave loads and gap wave elevations the wave induced forces and moments and the gap wave elevations were measured when the waves are passing through the flng lng system an example of the time history measurements of wave loads are given in fig 5 for the condition of 3 96 rad s head sea waves where no significant non linear effect is observed due to a less displacement the wave loads on the lng are lower compared to that on the flng the gap wave elevations exhibit similar sinusoidal forms as the measured wave loads time history measurements from wave probes are presented in fig 6 it is observed that the amplitude of the gap waves varies at different locations based on a fast fourier transformation fft analysis the gap wave frequency is shown to be consistent to the incident wave frequency as presented in fig 7 more detailed descriptions on the gap wave elevations at different wave frequencies are given in a later section for the comparison with urans computational results the measured wave loads are expressed as transfer functions tf fj and tf mj 7 tf fj f j a 8 tf mj m j a where f j and m j j x y and z are the amplitudes for wave induced force and moment on the ship s hull it also must be noted that the wave induced loads are evaluated referring to the ships local coordinate systems 5 verification and validation before investigating the flng lng interaction systematically it is essential to verify and validate the present computational approach the verification and validation study is carried out for one of the wave conditions ω 6 22 rad s at δs 0 22 blng according to weymouth et al 2005 large forces and motions tend to result in high numerical errors this therefore can be regarded as one of the ideal cases to investigate the greatest numerical errors that exist in our computations for the prediction of large wave loads 5 1 numerical uncertainty firstly a verification study is performed to estimate the numerical uncertainties within the simulations following the procedures by wilson et al 2001 and stern et al 2001 it is assumed that the numerical uncertainty u sn comprises of iterative convergence uncertainty u i grid spacing uncertainty u g and time step uncertainty u t giving the following expression 9 u sn 2 u i 2 u g 2 u t 2 tezdogan et al 2015 estimated the iterative convergence uncertainty in the predictions of motion responses for a container ship using the star ccm urans solver their analysis indicated ui to be less than 0 50 in simulation results which is considered to be negligible since similar computational settings are applied grid and time step uncertainties are of primary interest in the present study the grid and time step convergence study are both conducted with triple solutions systematically the grid uncertainty analysis is performed with the smallest time step whilst the time step independence study was carried out with the finest mesh the details of the grid and time step adopted in the verification study are presented in table 4 referring to simonsen et al 2012 and jin et al 2016c the grid uncertainty of unstructured trimmer mesh can also be estimated based on richardson s extrapolation variations of simulation results s between the fine s1 medium s2 and coarse s3 grids with refinement ratio of r g 2 are identified as 10 ε g 21 s 2 s 1 11 ε g 32 s 3 s 2 the numerical convergence ratio r g can be calculated from equation 12 12 r g ε g 21 ε g 32 depending on the value of the convergence ratio four conditions can be predicted i 0 r g 1 monotonic convergence ii r g 0 r g 1 oscillatory convergence iii 1 r g monotonic divergence iv r g 0 r g 1 oscillatory divergence it is noted that for divergence conditions iii and iv the numerical uncertainty cannot be estimated for the oscillatory convergence ii the numerical uncertainty can be estimated by bounding the error based on oscillation with upper limit s u and lower limit s l using equation 13 13 u g 1 2 s u s l for convergence condition i the generalized richardson extrapolation can be employed to estimate the numerical error δ re g 1 and order of accuracy p g as 14 δ re g 1 ε g 21 r g p g 1 15 p g ln ε g 32 ε g 21 ln r g there are two ways to estimate the numerical uncertainty depending on whether the solutions are close to the asymptotic range this is determined by the correction factor c g defined as 16 c g r g p g 1 r g p gest 1 where p gest is an estimate for the limiting order of accuracy if c g approaches unity the solutions are close to the asymptotic range in this case the numerical error δ sn benchmark result s c and uncertainty u g can be estimated from 17 δ sn c g δ re g 1 18 s c s δ sn 19 u g 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ re g 1 1 c g δ re g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g 0 125 when c g is sufficiently greater than 1 which means the solutions are far away from the asymptotic range the numerical uncertainty u g can be calculated from equation 20 20 u g 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ re g 1 2 1 c g 1 δ re g 1 1 c g 0 125 1 c g 0 125 based on similar procedures the time step uncertainty u t can be estimated a summary of the grid spacing and time step uncertainties for the tested computational case are listed in table 5 and table 6 overall the present computation gives relatively small numerical uncertainties demonstrating its feasibility for undertaking further systematic simulations to validate the computations it is necessary to check if the absolute comparison error e between numerical and experimental results is less than the validation uncertainty u v shown in equation 21 calculated as a combination of numerical uncertainty u sn and experimental uncertainty u d 21 u v u sn 2 u d 2 comparisons between e and u v for the wave load transfer functions from the present computation are given in table 7 it is worth mentioning here that the experimental uncertainties u d are obtained based on the method adopted by longo and stern 2005 and duffy 2008 it is observed that the urans predictions correlate well with the experimental results the average comparison errors are 6 10 and 5 62 for the flng and lng respectively all the investigated parameters are validated except tfmy for the lng this is considered to be acceptable due to a relatively small discrepancy when comparing against the experimental value 6 systematic computations in the previous section urans computation was verified and validated against physical model scale experiments the results demonstrate the feasibility of the present numerical model in predicting the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions in waves applying an analogous numerical approach the flng lng system is investigated for different wave frequencies and lateral separations furthermore the computations have also been performed in full scale to quantify scale effects of the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions in waves an illustration of the test matrix is given in table 8 urans computations are firstly performed for the lateral separation of δs 0 22blng for different incident wave frequencies the results gathered from the numerical simulations are compared with experimental data efd and those obtained from potential flow pf solver aqwa which utilises a three dimensional panel method solving inviscid irrotational and incompressible fluid around floating structures for more theoretical explanation of the pf solver reference can be made to the manual of the software ansys 2013 illustrations of urans time history predictions of wave loads on the flng and lng for the wave frequency of 4 40 rad s are presented in fig 8 generally good correlation in the magnitude and period of the wave loads is observed between the urans and efd results by carrying out fft analysis on the time history recordings the wave load transfer functions are derived for the investigated wave frequencies as shown in fig 9 to assess the performance of urans and pf methods the discrepancies between numerical predictions and experimental measurements are quantified in table 9 and table 10 for relatively low wave frequencies 3 96 5 59 rad s the pf and urans predictions are similar as the incident wave frequency increases the urans computation starts to show better correlation with efd data it can be found that the pf method tends to over predict the peak magnitude of the transfer functions particularly for the sway force heave force pitch moment and yaw moment the absolute comparison error for urans and pf predictions against efd results varies between 0 05 and 37 0 and 0 14 47 4 respectively it is seen from fig 9 that the sway force heave force and yaw moment transfer functions vary significantly at relatively high wave frequency conditions this is considered as a consequence of gap wave resonance where the amplified gap waves induce asymmetric pressure distributions on the flng and lng hulls and therefore large disturbances on the wave loads fig 10 presents the significant variation of gap waves under different incident wave frequencies from urans predictions and efd measurements at the incident wave frequency of 3 96 rad s the gap wave elevations recorded at wp 5 and 6 are suppressed to half that of the incident waves on the other hand at the incident wave frequency of 7 23 rad s the gap waves raise to three times the height of the incident wave it is observed that the gap wave response is generally sinusoidal which enables a constant gap wave height h g to be estimated for the convenience of comparing gap wave response at different locations and wave frequencies the non dimensional gap wave height h g is introduced representing the ratio between h g and the incident wave height h o fig 11 presents comparisons of urans efd and pf predictions on the gap wave responses at different wave frequencies for the model scale lateral separation of δs 0 22blng it is found that the gap wave height is similar for urans pf and efd when the incident wave frequency is below 5 59 rad s though there are discrepancies in the magnitude of h g between the numerical and experimental results at certain regions for positions within the range of 0 5 0 0 m relative to lcg of the flng in the x direction the gap waves are suppressed to less than half of the incident wave height at the low frequency conditions 3 96 5 59 rad s the tendency of h g varies differently for high wave frequency conditions 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s close to the natural frequency of the fluid 7 72 rad s in the gap this natural frequency which is outlined in fig 12 is estimated based on an empirical formulae from saitoh et al 2006 and moradi et al 2015 as given in equation 20 the height of the gap waves within the range of 1 0 1 0 m relative to lcg of the flng in the x direction are magnified to 2 4 times of the incident wave height due to resonance effect 20 f n g δ s b d t t it is seen from fig 11 that the urans method provides more accurate predictions of h g especially for the relatively high wave frequency conditions 6 22 rad s 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s on the other hand the pf method tends to over estimate the peak values of gap wave height at these wave frequencies as discussed in the literature review this is primarily due to the absence of viscous damping in the linear potential flow solver this observation also explains the better correlation of urans predictions on the wave load transfer functions over the pf method when comparing with efd results for relatively high wave frequency conditions for better pf calculations additional damping has to be added to the gap waves and it requires to be tuned based on reliable efd data it is also found that the gap wave resonance is not the only dominant factor that influences the wave loads on the flng and lng for instance at the incident wave frequency of 6 66 rad s where the gap waves are significantly exaggerated the sway force is not comparable to that for the wave frequency ω 6 22 rad s to explain this the hydrodynamic pressure distribution on the flng and lng hulls are presented in fig 13 this specific time step corresponds to the highest gap wave elevation at the location of x 0 m where the peak repulsive sway force appears when comparing the two different wave frequencies one can observe greater hydrodynamic pressure on the inside wall of the ship hulls for the case of ω 6 22 rad s this leads to a more significant portion of repulsive sway force adding on top of that caused by gap wave excitation and therefore results in a greater net sway force when compared to the wave frequency of ω 6 66 rad s 6 1 free surface around the flng lng offloading system to visualise wave diffraction around the flng lng system in a side by side offloading configuration contours of the free surface elevation are presented in fig 14 for the model scale lateral separation of δs 0 78 blng for low frequency wave conditions the flng lng system acts like an integrated floating structure where the incident waves diffract directly at the forward region of the system the wave energy hardly passes into the gap between the two ships as a result the amplitude of the gap waves becomes less significant than that of the incident waves as the wave frequency increases the incident waves start to penetrate the flng lng system meanwhile the wave frequency shifts closer to the natural frequency of the fluid trapped in the gap and results in great exaggerations of the gap waves to understand the fluid dynamics behind the gap wave resonance in head seas the velocity field around the flng lng cross section x 0 m is presented in fig 15 it can be seen that the gap wave response induces strong cross flow around the two ships with much less noticeable vortical structures when compared to the beam sea conditions shown in moradi et al 2015 when t 0 tw the gap wave is at its crest where the fluid starts to escape from the confined region between the two ships and a small vortex forms near the inner bilge of the flng as time progresses the gap wave keeps decreasing and reaches its lowest elevation at t 3 8 tw after that the fluid starts to be driven back from the far field to the gap at t 1 2 tw this leads to the uprising of gap wave elevation which reaches its maximum at t 7 8 tw one can also find that there is a high velocity region in the gap consistently throughout the presented time intervals the outcome from this is a reduction of hydrodynamic pressure on the inside walls of the flng and lng hulls which leads to strong attraction force at that can be hazardous for operation 6 2 influence of lateral separation between flng and lng in this section the influence of lateral separations on the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions has been investigated fig 16 presents the variation of non dimensional gap wave height h g for the flng lng lateral separations of δs 0 44blng and δs 0 78blng respectively when comparing against fig 11 the pattern of gap waves exhibits similarities for the three lateral separations at low incident wave frequencies of 3 96 rad s 4 40 rad s and 4 71 rad s as the wave frequency increases the gap waves for the condition with lateral separation of δs 0 78blng firstly starts to be exaggerated at the incident wave frequency of 5 09 rad s exaggeration of gap waves for conditions with smaller lateral separation starts at higher wave frequencies 6 22 rad s for δs 0 44blng and 6 66 rad s for δs 0 22blng this indicates the occurrence of gap wave resonance shifts to higher frequencies when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng this is also evident from the inverse relationship between the lateral separation and gap fluid natural frequency in equation 20 in addition the lateral separation also has an influence on the significance of gap wave resonance among the three lateral separations tested δs 0 22blng 0 44blng and 0 78blng it was found that a smaller lateral separation brings severe wave response in the gap between the flng and lng hulls in fig 16 for the lateral separation of δs 0 44blng urans computation still provides better predictions on h g than the pf method when comparing against efd measurements especially for the high wave frequency conditions 6 22 7 23 rad s when the lateral distance increases to 0 78blng this advantage becomes less profound although urans simulation still demonstrates slightly better accuracy the discrepancies between pf and efd measurements on h g has been reduced significantly for the lateral separation of δs 0 78blng this implies that the pf method is suitable to model the gap wave responses for relatively large lateral separations with an acceptable level of accuracy the variation of lateral separation also influences the wave loads on the flng and lng hulls which are associated with the gap wave responses fig 17 presents the wave induced forces and moments from urans efd and pf predictions for the investigated lateral separations of δs 0 44blng and 0 78blng combining with the wave load results for δs 0 22blng in fig 9 some interesting aspects are highlighted here for the surge force given in fig 17 a and b fluctuations on the transfer function are observed at wave frequencies close to the natural frequency of the gap fluid these fluctuations start at relatively higher incident wave frequencies for conditions with less lateral separations for the sway force heave force pitch moment and yaw moment transfer functions in fig 17 c j similar to that observed in the gap wave responses when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng occurrence of the peak transfer function shifts to higher frequencies in addition the lateral separation also influences the significance of the exaggerations on the transfer functions it is found that a smaller lateral separation produces a peak transfer function of greater magnitude in sway force and yaw moment with increasing lateral separation the accuracy of pf predictions on the gap wave response increases this trend is also found on the frequency domain wave loads given in fig 17 the discrepancy between peak transfer functions from pf calculation and efd measurement reduces as the lateral separation increases for the condition of δs 0 78blng the urans efd and pf give very close predictions for the wave forces and moments including the peak values as above in the absence of a tuned damping lid pf method is still feasible to provide predictions on the wave loads with satisfactory level of accuracy for lateral separations greater than 0 44blng 6 3 full scale predictions on flng lng interaction to investigate scale effects in the flng lng interactions in waves full scale urans computations are carried out for the incident wave frequencies of 0 666 rad s and 0 723 rad s at the lateral separation of δs 0 22blng the two cases correspond to the model scale conditions of wave frequencies of 6 66 rad s and 7 23 rad s by froude scaling the full scale fluid domain and computational grid are scaled isotropically therefore shares the same level of grid density when compared to model scale additional prism cells are added to the full scale ships for achieving similar y distributions along the hull and resolving the boundary layer to the same extent as model scale conditions in this section comparisons are made on the wave loads gap wave elevations and diffracted wave patterns between the model and full scale computations fig 18 presents time series of the model and full scale wave loads acting on the two ships for the incident wave frequency of 6 66 rad s ms and 0 666 rad s fs it is observed that the two series of data correlates well which reflects minor influence of scale effects in the prediction of wave loads for the case studied to further investigate scale effects in the gap wave predictions the model and full scale non dimensional gap wave elevations η are compared at different wave probe locations as given in fig 19 again it is found that scale effects barely influence the gap wave responses model and full scale wave diffractions around the flng lng system are presented in fig 20 the wave patterns exhibit great similarity which demonstrates the minor influences of scale effects in the presented flng lng head sea interaction cases as above this part of the study has shown that model scale simulations are able to represent the full scale conditions for the presented flng lng interaction in head sea waves 7 concluding remarks the hydrodynamic interactions of a conceptual flng lng offloading system has been investigated using viscous urans solver star ccm the computations are carried out with 6 dof motions of the ship being fixed predictions on the wave loads as well as gap wave responses are carried out and compared with that from the physical model scale experiments and inviscid potential flow solver aqwa a verification and validation study is performed based on a chosen wave case to demonstrate the credibility of the computational setup based on the validated urans model a systematic investigation is conducted for analysing the influences of incident wave frequency and lateral separation between the flng and lng on the hydrodynamic interactions furthermore full scale computations are presented to demonstrate scale effects involved in the flng lng hydrodynamic interactions from the computational results the following conclusions can be drawn there is a good correspondence between the experimental and urans computed gap wave responses and wave loads for the investigated conditions demonstrating the credibility of urans approach for studying ship ship interactions in waves viscous urans computations provide more accurate predictions on the gap wave responses over pf method at relatively high wave frequency conditions when the lateral separation between two ships is relatively small δs 0 22blng and 0 44blng with greater lateral separation δs 0 78blng the pf calculations are proven to have similar level of accuracy pf method is still valid and recommended for predicting the wave loads when the incident wave frequency is relatively low and away from the natural frequency of the gap fluid considering its rapid computational time the accuracy of pf method improves as the lateral separation increases gap wave resonance is observed when the incident wave frequency approaches the natural frequency of the fluid in the gap between the flng and lng vessels this also leads to significant variation of wave loads in the directions of surge sway heave pitch and yaw changing the lateral separation can strongly affect the ship ship hydrodynamic interactions reduction in the lateral separation between the flng and lng brings greater exaggeration of gap wave responses and shifts the occurrence of gap wave resonance to a higher frequency region the variation of lateral separation poses similar effects on the wave loads in the directions of sway heave pitch and yaw when reducing the lateral separation between the flng and lng occurrence of peak wave load transfer functions shifts to a higher frequency region the model and full scale urans computations are very close in aspects of wave loads gap wave responses and wave diffractions around the flng lng system which indicates scale effects are not significant for the tested cases in summary this paper tests the feasibility of viscous urans method for investigating ship ship interactions in regular waves comparisons are made with efd and inviscid pf calculations for the demonstration of numerical accuracy suggestions are provided for the applicability of pf method when there are no experimental data available to tune a damping lid however the topic of ship ship interactions requires further investigations since the current study has limitations subject to negligence of the ship motion related wave radiation and the mechanical coupling with stationkeeping system acknowledgement the authors acknowledge the scholarship support provided by the australian maritime

23562,current commercial autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are powered by conventional batteries however such technology has reached a point at which an increase of the endurance and range of operations would require increasing the size of existing auv designs much attention has been paid to fuel cells as they have proven successfully installable in auv prototypes and have shown good results regarding the increase of range and endurance of auvs nevertheless no commercial auv powered by fuel cells has been made yet in this work the characteristics of well known commercial auvs have been studied using the principal components analysis such study allows inferring the requirements and constraints for the implementation of fuel cells in commercial auvs freedom in certain design parameters of both fuel cells and auvs has been found regarding the necessity to store oxidant along with the fuel in underwater applications a map of achieved energy densities by the combination of different means of storing hydrogen and oxygen has been obtained such map reveals the most benefiting combination of storage means for both reactants finally a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fuel cell powered auvs is proposed keywords fuel cell marine application auv design energy density power density hydrogen storage principal component analysis 1 introduction thanks to the great development achieved in these last years unmanned vehicles have evolved from the research laboratories into commercial military and scientific applications vukic 2013 although unmanned marine vehicles were developed by the military industry they are revolutionizing the access to the oceans in the civil industry as they are allowing to reach depths beyond the limits of scuba divers leonard et al 1998 the main reasons for using underwater unmanned vehicles uuvs are that they reduce human presence for safety costs or acoustic signature reasons and they increase operational ranges two different types of uuvs can be distinguished regarding whether uuvs are remotely piloted or not being both able to develop multitude of missions wang et al 2012 remotely operated vehicles rovs are usually employed for deep sea offshore tasks as substitutes of scuba divers autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are usually employed in offshore industry for obtaining information about subsea environment they operate without any physical or electronic interaction with human beings and therefore are able to navigate by themselves national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2013 alam et al 2014 whereas auvs need media to store energy on board for the propulsion and all the systems rovs normally do not need them as they are connected to a mother ship although sometimes they might have energy storing media to reduce their cable section brown current commercial auvs use batteries for storing energy eca group 2017 alam et al 2014 kongsberg 2012a 2012b 2013 2015 2016 2017a elektronik 2012 2013 bluefin robotics 2016a 2016b 2016c 2016d 2017a 2017b gavia 2016 eca group 2016 eca group 2017a eca group 2017b eca group 2017c eca group 2017d eca group 2017e their main drawback is that current technology has reached a maturity state at which very small improvement is expected regarding their energy densities this means that at the current state battery powered auvs with extended range and endurance are set to be bigger than normal range and endurance auvs however bigger auvs are less practical as they require heavier duty cranes to put them afloat and need more space to maneuver the main challenge addressed by this article is to increase the endurance and the range of auvs without increasing too much their size therefore a new power source with higher storage energy density is needed such new power source should be able to keep a small acoustic signature so that sonar readings can still be precise and accurate whilst keeping a small thermal signature in order not to interfere with other sensors affected by temperature kongsberg 2017b it is believed that a possible solution might be behind fuel cells fcs as they have the potential of achieving higher energy densities than those offered by batteries under certain configurations evans et al 2009 so far only some prototypes and conceptual designs of auvs are powered by fcs miller et al 2014 mendez et al 2014 yamamotoet al 2004 shih et al 2014 the reason for the lack of presence of fcs in commercial auvs is mainly due to the high costs of this technology at its current state however this technology can be competitive as it is for auvs that are to accomplish missions requiring longer ranges and endurances than those powered by batteries besides it is expected that the price of this technology will go down in the following years as giant car manufacturers have just released the first generation of commercial fc vehicles and are betting for this technology in the case of watertight auvs hybridization of fcs with batteries might reduce even more the cost and volume of final fc power systems lane et al 2017 for flooded auvs the cost reduction is yet unclear as subsea pressure compensated batteries can be even more expensive than fuel cell stacks at current state the purpose of this work is to present guidelines for auv designers at early stages of the designing process of fc powered auvs with the aim of saving time and effort the first part of the work as usually done in new projects of naval architecture focuses in finding existing relations between parameters of different auvs lewis et al 1988 this is to define the initial design parameters of fc powered auvs through the regressions obtained from such relations and to find the fc geometrical constraints that underlie the collected data the followed method for such aim is based on statistical analysis of well known commercial auvs the second part of the work discusses the most suitable fc type according to the inferred constraints and also discusses the different ways to store the reactants this part culminates with an assessment of the combined storing solutions of reactants in the form of matrix based maps of achieved energy densities and costs by such combinations to conclude a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fc powered auvs is described the followed approach throughout this work is numerical this has been done with the intention of adding objectivity in the decision making at early stages of the designing process especially when there is lack of data to support decisions 2 analysis of commercial auvs the aim of this section is to obtain the existing relations among parameters of commercial auvs therefore a data analysis is performed in a group of existing auvs although all of these are powered by batteries this will help to set the initial dimensions of the fc powered auv by prefixing as few parameters as possible lewis et al 1988 and will also help to unveil the geometrical constraints of the fc to be fitted in the auv there are two additional constraints for auv designs that cannot be found in the data analysis and must be always considered during the designing process such two constraints are known due to the similarities of auvs with submarines kormilitsin and khalizev 2001 being the first one that they must be able to stay in upright position and the second one that they must have neutral buoyancy when no thrust is applied in immersion the first one is fulfilled in designs with lower center of gravity than center of buoyancy and the second one is fulfilled in designs with overall density equal to the one of the seawater one exception to the second constraint is found in glider type auvs as they propel themselves by varying their own buoyancy overall density zhang et al 2014 table 1 collects data of 21 well known commercial auvs kongsberg 2017a kongsberg 2012a 2012b 2013 2015 2016 elektronik 2012 2013 bluefin robotics 2016a 2016b 2016c 2016d 2017a 2017b gavia 2016 eca group 2016 eca group 2017a eca group 2017b eca group 2017c eca group 2017d eca group 2017e that have proved cost effectiveness such table contains information about the main auv parameters length l diameter d mass displacement δ maximum depth h maximum speed v stored energy e endurance t mean power output w and length to diameter ratio l d the information shown in table 1 has been extracted directly from the datasheets of the corresponding manufacturers except for w and l d which have been calculated by dividing e by t and l by d respectively all the auvs gathered in table 1 are powered by batteries and are propelled by mechanical means typically propellers or pump jets except for the seaglider whose means of propulsion stem from the gliding caused by changes in the overall density of the auv thanks to the small power consumption of the glider type propulsion very long endurances can be achieved up to 10 months before starting with the data analysis process the original data structure shown in table 1 is checked by using a procedure capable of explaining the variability of such data the most common procedure used for this purpose is the principal component analysis pca this procedure not only allows to explain the variability of the data but also reduces the dimension of the problem as it reveals simpler data structures that underlie the original one as it implies obtaining the covariance matrix abdi and williams 2010 as the method works with matrixes it requires full information of the involved parameters therefore all the auvs collected in table 1 with missing information are eliminated during the pca in this work the pca rotates the original data structure defined as the reference vectors or parameters l d δ h v e t w l d to new reference vectors that are linear combinations of the original ones such new reference vectors also known as principal components pcs are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the original data meaning that they are linearly independent amongst themselves martens and naes 1992 for that reason l d and w are also omitted as they are dependent on other parameters allowing a reduction of the problem to 7 dimensions l d δ h v e t the covariance matrix obtained from a first pca on the data in table 1 indicates that most of the variability of the data is determined by a linear combination of the parameters related to the size of the system l d δ e as it will be discussed later a numerical correlation between them can be verified that allows using only one as a representation of a global variable that will be named s i z e p c the mass displacement has been chosen to represent this global variable as it is the most related factor with size then a new pca has been carried out using only four variables namely δ h v and t at this point the problem is down to 4 dimensions δ h v and t allowing a second pca with satisfactory results table 2 shows the 4 new rotated vectors or pcs obtained by the second pca ordered in decreasing degree of information they contain on the variability of the data each pc is represented as a composition of the original parameters δ h v and t here is a brief discussion on the pcs obtained the first pc summarizes the auv information given by δ h v and t containing a 52 9 of it such pc has great influence of all the four parameters but as it is mainly defined by δ with a factor of 0 654 the chosen alias for the first pc is s i z e p c the accumulated percentage of auv information represented by the first two pcs accounts for the 78 4 as the second pc is mainly defined by h and v with factors of 0 793 and 0 584 respectively its chosen alias could be p e r f o r m a n c e p c but as it can be seen as well in the third pc the second pc is not the only one clearly defined by two parameters therefore the alias d e p t h p c is considered better suited in this case the three first pcs together represent the information given by δ h v and t in a 96 2 as the third pc is mainly defined by t with a factor of 0 798 and v with a factor of 0 546 its chosen alias could be p e r f o r m a n c e p c but to avoid confusion its chosen alias is e n d u r a n c e p c all the pcs together define the variability of the auvs by a 100 the fourth pc also represents the size but is omitted as it adds very little information on the variability of the auvs allowing for further simplification table 3 and fig 1 show all the auvs except for the bluefin sandshark due to the lack of data as a function of the three first pcs obtained as it can be noted table 3 and fig 1 show three different groups group 1 group 2 and group 3 the first two groups are composed by the auvs that intervened in the pca while group 3 is composed by the auvs that did not have full information for being included in the pca therefore group 3 acts as control group as it will be discussed in the correlation between t and l two separated trends are identified group 1 and group 2 hence the differentiation in table 3 and fig 1 as well a graphical representation of the auvs by their pcs helps to find existing relations between pcs thus relations between the primitive parameters δ h v and t as well for that purpose data shown in table 1 must be normalized to remove the differences in orders of magnitude among the original parameters δ h v and t this is done to prevent a biased representation of the auvs towards δ and h which are up to three orders of magnitude greater than v and t the normalization of the parameters is performed by subtracting the standard deviation σ of the corresponding parameter from each value given in table 1 and then such result is divided by the corresponding parameter mean value x both standard deviations and mean values used for the normalization can be found at the bottom of table 1 note that the standard deviation and the mean value correspond to the 16 auvs that intervened in the pca exclusively fig 1 shows the distribution of auvs in a parallelepiped composed by the first three normalized pcs the s i z e p c the d e p t h p c and the e n d u r a n c e p c which as stated earlier represent the information given by δ h v and t in a 96 2 the normalized pcs are a result of using table 2 coefficients and the normalized parameters obtained for this purpose the identification number that appears in fig 1 is the same as the one shown in table 3 fig 1 shows that auvs do not seem to obey any visible pattern except in the e n d u r a n c e p c and s i z e p c projection where most of the auvs are alineated see the line in such projection this shows that there might be a good correlation between s i z e p c and e n d u r a n c e p c related parameters however the other pcs do not seem to hold any relation between them the pca has been very useful as a first step of the data analysis as it has helped to identify where the correlations might be thanks to the first pca it is known that correlations are bound to exist among s i z e related parameters l d δ and e and thanks to the second pca whose results are shown in tables 2 and 3 and fig 1 it is also known that there might be interrelations among the parameters involved with s i z e p c and e n d u r a n c e p c nevertheless it has been found out that the chance of finding relations among the parameters involved in the interrelation of d e p t h p c with e n d u r a n c e p c and between d e p t h p c with s i z e p c are very low however this is also good as that would mean fewer restrictions in the choice of parameters once the pca has been done correlations between the original parameters shown in table 1 should be attempted so that the resulting regressions can help to obtain the initial design dimensions of the auv to be designed by prefixing as few initial parameters as possible lewis et al 1988 in fig 2 it can be noted that the geometry is very regular as the diameter to length regression shows a straight line passing through the origin 1 d 0 1138 0 0077 l which corresponds to l d of 8 83 0 60 throughout this work two figures will be used in the expression of the data uncertainty to maintain the significance level α 0 05 in the confidence interval of all the results according to burcher and rydill 1995 given a specific total displacement the l d that optimizes the viscous drag is near 6 a good reason for designing an auv with l d other than 6 could be found in restrictions related to dimensions of the equipment it is more common to find l d 6 as such values are less penalizing to the drag than l d 6 this fact might give some extra degree of freedom in the dimensions and shape of the fc system to be fitted in the auv the correlation between δ and l can be seen in fig 3 and is given by 2 δ 10 3 l 2 65 0 25 it can be noted that there is a good correlation between these two parameters which could be expected as the l d does not have very big variations between auvs as seen in fig 2 fig 3 also shows the good correlation existing between stored energy and length of auvs 3 e 0 28 0 11 l 2 59 0 29 it can be noted that both regressions have a potential behavior with an exponent close to 3 fact that makes sense as both the mass displacement and the storage volume depend directly on the auv volume which depends on the auv length at the third power it is worth to mention that the regression of e and l corresponds to auvs powered by batteries and as such it should be taken as the minimum acceptable regression line in fc powered auvs otherwise the conversion from batteries to fc can only be explained by the shorter refueling time compared to the one found in the recharging cycles of batteries which normally is not enough to justify the substitution over lithium batteries with the current difference in market values the observed distinction between the two groups 1 and 2 made in fig 1 can be seen in the correlation between t and l shown in fig 4 the reason to attempt for a linear correlation is explained here at a given speed the energy consumption rate is directly proportional to the resistance which increases linearly with the wetted surface w d l on the other hand the energy storage capacity depends directly on the auv volume e d 2 l and as the endurance is obtained as the division of stored energy and energy consumption rate t depends linearly on d t d but as seen in fig 2 d and l are directly related therefore t also depends linearly on l t l lewis et al 1988 the regression of group 1 is as follows 4 t 1 4 95 0 53 l 2 1 2 2 while the regression of the group 2 corresponds to 5 t 2 6 35 0 51 l 1 9 1 7 the great uncertainty in the intercepts shows that t is directly proportional to l implying the existence of a different design factor between the two groups the recommended regression line to be chosen in fig 4 is the one corresponding to eq 5 as it is the one that offers more t at less l because as mentioned above one of the reasons to resort to fcs as power source is enhancing the ratio of t and l furthermore it is worth to note that the regression of t with l corresponds to auvs powered by batteries and as such it should be taken as the minimum acceptable regression line in fc powered auvs in fig 5 h and v do not correlate well neither between them nor with the other parameters the main conclusion of these last correlation attempts is that there is a fair degree of freedom in the choice of v and h however v appears to be almost invariant in the values shown in table 1 and usually close to 5 kn 2 6 m s such values can be explained not only because of power consumption economy but also due to the small acoustic signature required for passive sonar transducers which are hindered by the hydrodynamic hull noise when navigating therefore it seems reasonable to choose any v that does not exceed the values presented in table 1 3 fuel cell requirements for auvs brief discussion on the best suited fuel cell type taking as a basis the data of auvs collected in table 1 and the specification sheets of the manufacturers the inferred requirements of fcs for auvs are listed here the size of the fc system shall be as small and light as possible power output of fc systems shall be in the range of 0 12 kw 2 kw fc systems should be modularized in order to be removable exchangeable and replaceable as this feature is present in current auv battery modules the temperature mismatch between the fc system and temperature sensitive electronics shall be as small as possible this is to reduce the thermal break thickness between both systems typical temperature sensitive electronics have their operation temperatures limited to 40 c kongsberg 2017b depending on whether the auv is flooded or watertight this affects differently but it is always translated as an increase in size o in flooded architectures the water that floods the space between watertight compartments acts as thermal break thus separation between watertight compartments increases for higher temperature fuel cells o in watertight auvs all elements share the same space here thermal breaks are added between temperature sensitive electronics and the fuel cell the thickness of the thermal break increases with the thermal gap between spaces table 4 energy 2016 oorja 2015 independent

2016 horizon fuel cell technologies 2016 hydrogenics 2016 nedstack 2016 plugpower 2014 summarizes the ranges of properties of different types of fcs from well known fc manufacturers such fcs include direct methanol fuel cells dmfcs alkaline fuel cells afcs solid oxide fuel cells sofcs molten carbonate fuel cells mcfcs phosphoric acid fuel cells pafcs and proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs it is worth to mention that the information shown regards the whole fc system including the balance of plant bop components except in the upper power density limits power mass and power volume of the pemfc where the weight and volume of coolant pumps are not included the fuel and oxidant storage are regarded separately in the next section looking at table 4 the best suited fc regarding the above criteria for powering auvs is the proton exchange membrane type pemfc as it can reach very good power densities at low temperatures even higher power densities have been identified by the authors of the reference van biert et al 2016 pemfc has also demonstrated its successfulness in powering fc auv prototypes mendez et al 2014 yamamotoet al 2004 shih et al 2014 other reasons that support the choice of pemfc are that they present shorter response times shorter start up times and also greater resistance to shocks and vibrations than the other fc types for all these reasons pemfcs should be the first option for designers at the current state of the technology 4 storage of reactants in fuel cell systems for auvs discussion fcs require not only fuel to produce electricity but also an oxidant normally fcs working in the atmosphere use air as oxidant however one of the peculiarities of subsea fc applications is that there is a very limited source of air within the underwater craft therefore it is necessary to store oxidant along with fuel hydrogen can be stored in several different ways some of the figures related to some of current hydrogen storage media can be found in table 5 ahluwalia et al 2016 materials based hydrogen 2017 brunner et al 2016 hylium industries 2016 note that the values of hydrogen shown in table 5 that involve the stored energy in kwh have been obtained from the same equivalent ratios in mass by using the lhv note as well that the cost addressed in table 5 is referred to the storage medium and not to the hydrogen itself regarding the oxygen the ways of physically storing it are very similar to the ones of hydrogen therefore figures shown in table 6 stem from the same data of hydrogen presented in table 5 adapting the gas properties to oxygen national institute of standards and technology 2016 except data related to liquid oxygen which has been obtained from a commercial manufacturer of dewars cryofab 2016 with a net capacity of 50 l it is worth to mention that the ratios of oxygen involving the stored energy presented in table 6 stem from the oxygen equivalent amount of hydrogen to which the lhv of hydrogen is applied according to 6 h 2 1 2 o 2 h 2 o with the aim of putting into context the data appearing in tables 5 9 a brief discussion on hydrogen and oxygen storage is done hydrogen and oxygen can be stored compressed in high pressure vessels up to 700 bar at ambient temperature the vessels are usually heavy and made of austenitic stainless steel or more often lighter and made of composite materials baumert and epp 1993 caution must be taken of materials that suffer from hydrogen embrittlement this is the simplest method of storing both gases the information on compressed systems that appear in tables 5 and 6 is referred to type iv composite material pressure vessels concretely of 250 4 l the 350 bar unit and 145 2 l the 700 bar unit of net capacity which are lighter but more expensive than type i metallic pressure vessels hydrogen and oxygen can be stored in liquid state at cryogenic temperatures kang and kim 2014 in vacuum flasks special attention must be paid to the boil off of the liquid hydrogen especially when the consumption rate is lower than the boil off rate and there is no reliquefication system this solution is more common in oxygen than in hydrogen as the storing temperature for oxygen is higher 90 k in contrast with 22 k of hydrogen data shown in tables 5 and 6 correspond to 50 l commercial dewars hydrogen and oxygen can be stored in cryo compressed state ahluwalia et al 2012 pressure vessels can be insulated and store super critic hydrogen at 300 bar of pressure and temperatures around 57 k with a density close to the one of liquid hydrogen the same applies to cryo compressed oxygen at 300 bar and around 155 k the main problem is that if the reactants consumption rate is low as the temperature in the tank rises gases must be either blown off or refrigerated in order to keep the pressure from rising data shown in tables 5 and 6 corresponds to type iii composite pressure vessels with metallic lining of 100 l of net capacity hydrogen can be stored in the form of hydrocarbons such as kerosene or diesel which are very cheap and easy to store and later be steam reformed at high temperatures the regenerated gas is hydrogen rich at about 70 75 and comes along with steam co2 co and sox co and sox must be completely removed to avoid catalyst poisoning the three main drawbacks of this storage method are the volume and complexity of the reforming system the high temperatures needed for steam reforming and the co2 management under water baumert and epp 1993 hydrogen can also be stored at low pressure in certain metal hydrides that react reversibly with hydrogen hyakudome 2011 the hydrogen is freed from the alloy by heating this metal alloys have an acceptable volumetric storage density although usually have poor gravimetric storage density typically less than 3 6 of hydrogen in mass materials based hydrogen 2017 this storage system shows some issues such as their high cost their loss of efficiency after some hydrogen refueling cycles and their sensitivity to water baumert and epp 1993 metal hydrides as these mentioned with poor gravimetric densities and acceptable volumetric densities might be advisable for large auvs as the urashima yamamotoet al 2004 for small amounts of stored hydrogen the gravimetric and volumetric densities of physical storage means are penalized on the contrary the gravimetric and volumetric densities are kept constant in metal hydrides along with other hydrogen chemical compounds regardless the amount of stored hydrogen for that reason hydrogen compounds with very good gravimetric and volumetric densities such as nabh4 have gained a lot of interest for applications that require small amounts of stored hydrogen swider lyons and deitz 2016 in addition as the hydrogen is produced on demand this is one of the safest methods for storing hydrogen napán and peltzer y blancá 2012 oxygen can be released from exothermic reactions of different chemical compounds as peroxides sodium chlorate lithium perchlorate or other oxyhalides mendez et al 2014 special attention must be paid to the choice of the chemical compound so that the reaction byproducts other than oxygen can be easily stored during operation as it happens to hydrogen chemical compounds it makes special sense to store oxygen in the form of chemical compounds for applications that require small quantities of oxygen swider lyons and deitz 2016 the gravimetric and volumetric densities shown in tables 5 and 6 are used to obtain the overall gravimetric and volumetric density of both reactants which can be obtained as 7 1 ρ o a 1 ρ h 2 1 ρ o 2 where ρ is either the gravimetric or the volumetric density and the o a subscript stands for overall the overall gravimetric and volumetric densities are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively in the form of matrix based maps as an example the first value appearing in table 7 is calculated which corresponds to the gravimetric density of both hydrogen and oxygen compressed at 700 bar for that reason ρ h 2 is taken from table 5 as 1 48 kwh kg h 2 system and ρ o 2 is taken from table 6 as 1 84 kwh kg o 2 system therefore the overall gravimetric density appearing in table 7 is ρ o a 1 ρ h 2 1 ρ o 2 1 1 1 48 kwh kg h 2 syst 1 1 84 kwh kg o 2 syst 1 0 82 kwh kg h 2 o 2 system the overall cost of the storage system c o a can be obtained from the direct sum of costs of hydrogen and oxygen storage systems c h 2 and c o 2 respectively as shown in eq 8 here c represents the cost in kwh 8 c o a c h 2 c o 2 note in table 7 that the best storage solution for both gravimetric and volumetric densities is liquid cryogenic for both reactants with a value of 1 06 kwh kg h2 o2 system and 0 75 kwh l h2 o2 system respectively however as obtaining liquid hydrogen has an approximate cost of a 35 of its lhv godula jopek et al 2012 a better solution in this regard could be in storing compressed hydrogen at 350 bar and at ambient temperature this is because the compression process of hydrogen is more than three times cheaper than the liquefaction process from an energetic point of view durbin and malardier jugroot 2013 on the other hand oxygen can be kept liquid at 90 k and 1 bar since the energetic impact of liquefaction for this gas is much smaller this is known because the ideal liquefaction cost of nitrogen is around 15 times lower than the one of hydrogen given that the boiling point of nitrogen at 1 bar is 77 2 k godula jopek et al 2012 regarding the energetic efficiency of the storing process of hydrogen the gravimetric density enhancing solution would be to store it compressed at 350 bar the new value of gravimetric density is 1 05 kwh kg h2 o2 system which is very close to the previous value of 1 06 kwh kg h2 o2 system about the volumetric density in table 8 the energy efficient storing alternative could be to store hydrogen in cryo compressed state and oxygen in liquid state as there is almost no difference in value with the first mentioned solution the overall cost of the storage system shown in table 9 has been calculated by taking data from tables 5 and 6 as a basis the most expensive combinations involve storing hydrogen in metal hydrides while the others are in the range of 18 kwh to 26 kwh since there is a potential loss of reactants in cryogenic solutions due to boil off or blow off depending on the case perhaps the most economical solution in the long term would be to store oxygen and hydrogen at a compressed state of 350 bar it is expected that the final decision will depend on the specific design and mission of the craft in any case it must be checked that the fc system to be designed including reactants surpasses li ion batteries gravimetric density 0 24 kwh kg panasonic 2016 and volumetric density 0 68 kwh l panasonic 2016 equations 9 and 10 allow checking whether the densities of the whole fc system including storage system are greater or not than the corresponding of lithium batteries 9 e e ρ g r e a c t w ρ g f c 0 24 kwh kg 10 e e ρ v r e a c t w ρ v f c 0 68 kwh l where ρ g r e a c t kwh kg and ρ v r e a c t kwh l are the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the combined storage systems respectively found in tables 7 and 8 the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the fc systems ρ g f c w kg and ρ v f c w l respectively are available in table 4 note that e must be in kwh and w in w to be unit consistent with their respective densities it is worth to mention that all data appearing in tables 7 9 are true for stoichiometric storage of both reactants 5 methodology for obtaining initial design parameters of fc powered auvs the aim of this section is to present a procedure for obtaining the initial dimensions of fc powered auvs which are expected to have more endurance than those of the same size powered by batteries the proposed procedure is an iterative process based on assumptions and regressions obtained during the data analysis on auvs as shown in the flow diagram presented in fig 6 such process is divided in three stages being the first one the estimation of the parameters e w l and d the main constraints of the fc system followed by the mass displacement δ check and culminated by the volume displacement check first the designer must choose t h and v of the auv it is recommended that v does not exceed the corresponding range presented in table 1 this first part focuses in obtaining w and the corresponding e for the t given and the w obtained once the mission of the auv and the equipment to carry are known the power requirements of the fc can be estimated for peak situations running all the equipment and navigating at full speed in order to obtain the needed capacity of the buffer batteries and for mean situations running the typical equipment for the mission at cruise speed for dimensioning the fc and the subsequent amount of reactants as this is an iterative process it is necessary to fix l and d of the auv for the first time the closer they are to the actual convergence value the fewer iterations it will take for its convergence therefore it is recommended to refer to table 1 and pick those values based on other similar auvs at this point it is recommended that designers make a short list of possible fc candidates regarding the foreseeable power ranges and dimensions required by the auv in mind the aim of this is using that information for choosing the initial d as it is the main geometrical constraint for the fc l can be obtained by using l d 6 note that if that l d is not suited for the fc system a higher value of l d can be chosen as seen in eq 1 and in the comment below it the estimation of the power consumption due to propulsion is solely based on the viscous drag jagadeesh et al 2009 which can be obtained using the viscous drag coefficient c v this can be obtained from the skin friction drag c f and the form coefficient 1 k gillmer and bruce 1982 the c f can be obtained by using the international towing tank conference 57 correlation line ittc 1957 11 c f 0 075 log 10 r e 2 2 where r e is the reynolds number 12 r e v l ν being ν the kinematic viscosity of seawater the form coefficient can be obtained from the droblenkov s curve for auvs with circular cross section kormilitsin and khalizev 2001 13 1 k 1 0 2 d l 8 d l 2 10 d l 3 then c v is calculated 14 c v c f 1 k next the viscous drag is calculated 15 r v 1 2 ρ w s v 2 c v where ρ is the seawater density typically 1025 kg m3 and w s is the wetted surface of the auv which can be assumed as a cylinder of dimensions l and d finally the power requirement for propulsion can be estimated as 16 w p r o p v r v η d where η d is the propulsive efficiency renilson 2015 as a reminder it is necessary to add the power requirements of the rest of the equipment to that value to get the overall power requirements before continuing to the next step once the power output requirement of the fc is obtained the stored energy required is obtained as 17 e t w η f c where η f c is the fc efficiency now that e and w are known it is time to decide the configuration of the fc system and the reactants system as stated before the main purpose of designing an fc powered auv is to benefit from their potential of achieving greater energy densities than current commercial batteries the word potential is used intendedly as it is known from eqs 9 and 10 that given a specific e and w for the mission there might be combinations where the whole fc system including reactants might have smaller energy densities than batteries this depends on the power density of the fc and the energy density of the reactants the volumetric density of the whole fc system is the most compromised at this respect this is because the best volumetric energy density achieved by the reactants is not much higher than the one of li ion batteries li ion volumetric density is only surpassed either by liquid or cryo compressed hydrogen combined with liquid oxygen therefore it is strongly advised to check in eq 10 that the volumetric density achieved by the whole fc system chosen including reactants presents higher values the length range of the auv can be obtained from the stored energy e by using eq 3 the smaller value of the range shall substitute the l value used until now because eq 3 represents the behavior of battery powered auvs which are bigger in size than fc auvs for the same stored energy although l can be adjusted to even smaller values after the displacement checks if l is considered big and there is an important excess of displacement once the new l is fixed the new d shall be calculated from eq 1 note that l d shall be as close as possible to 6 to the extent that the equipment and the fc system allow it it is advisable to repeat the calculations done until now with the new l and d values until they converge once this is done the mass displacement check shall start in eq 2 the δ range can be calculated by introducing l the δ check involves estimating the mass of the hull and structure the one of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the fc reactants once all the masses have been estimated the sum of them is compared with the δ range obtained the mass of the reactants can be estimated by dividing the stored energy by the resulting gravimetric density shown in table 7 of the selected combination of reactants storage systems similarly the mass of the fc system if unknown can be estimated by dividing the total power requirement by the gravimetric density of the fc system selected shown in table 4 it is recommended to use more accurate information given by manufacturers when at hand as this method presents some uncertainties that may require more work in later stages moreover some of the values in table 4 do not include the coolant pump after choosing the auv materials the mass of the hull and structure can be calculated by summing the masses of all the plates and stiffeners of the structure however this type of calculation is only possible at stages where the fc auv is more defined despite that an estimation is possible at this stage by supposing that the hull and structure are solely composed by equivalent plates of greater thickness thereby the mass of the structure can be estimated by calculating the volume of this equivalent plates by obtaining the plate thickness by using the kirchhoff membrane theory of cylindrical shaped pressure vessels vullo 2014 18 t d ρ g h k s 2 σ y where ρ is the density of seawater g is the gravity acceleration k s is the thickener coefficient of the plates and σ y is the yield strength of the chosen material once the thickness of the equivalent plates of hull and structure is obtained the mass of the structure can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the hull plates by the density of the material ρ m a t which can be estimated by means of m t l d π ρ m a t after checking that the sum of the mass of the hull the one of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the fc reactants is equal or smaller than the mass displacement range it is possible to do the volume displacement check similarly it must be checked that the sum of the volume of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the stored reactants is smaller or equal to the range of which is obtained by dividing the mass displacement by the seawater density δ ρ the whole process shall be repeated by changing parameters materials equipment or fc systems as shown in fig 6 until both displacement checks have passed successfully it is advisable to leave some margin in both displacement checks to prevent unnecessary repetitions of the whole design in later stages as it is likely to find deficit of displacements as the design progresses and more certainty on the weights and volumes taking place are gained this is also useful to prevent problems related to the packaging of the fuel cell system which are more likely to appear than in batteries should there be a wide margin regarding both displacement checks at the latest stages of the designing process the amount of stored reactants could be increased to extend even more the range and the endurance of the craft if there is no room for more reactants but there is still a wide margin for weight it can easily be solved by adding ballast such ballast will add extra stability to the auv as long as it is positioned below the center of buoyancy another possibility could be to reduce the size of the auv until the margin in the displacement checks is acceptable as an example of the method table 10 summarizes the inputs and outputs of each stage of the process for the calculation of the initial design parameters of a watertight auv the process starts by fixing a target endurance of 50 h at a cruise speed of 1 7 m s the chosen initial parameters for the iteration process are l 4 5 m and d 0 7 m other chosen parameters for the dimensioning of the auvs are those related to the auv equipment and the coolant pump of the fc system 300 w 50 kg and 350 l the pressure hull carbon fiber reinforced epoxy with k s 3 efficiencies of the fuel cell system based on table 4 and propulsion η f c 0 40 η d 0 35 449 w kg and 471 w l after 5 iterations the process converges to l 8 6 m and d 1 0 m both the δ check and check pass without problem however both present excessive mass and volume reserves that is σ mass δ and σ volume for that reason a size reduction process is performed consisting in reducing l and d and then repeating all 3 stages of the process until a solution with reasonable buoyancy and volume reserves are found the solution able to descend to 6000 m depth and able endure 50 h of operation at 1 7 m s of cruise speed has 4 2 m length and 0 6 m diameter the buoyancy reserve after the size reduction is 227 kg and the volume reserve within the pressure hull is 118 l the resulting size of the dimensioned fc powered auv is similar to the one of the bluefin 21 from table 1 the dimensioned fc auv presents the same δ of the hugin attending to size and δ comparison criteria it can be seen that the endurance of the fc powered auv dimensioned in this example presents twice the endurance of the two battery powered auvs aforementioned 6 conclusions guidelines have been presented in this the article aimed to obtain new designs of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with extended range and endurance without increasing size such guidelines include a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fuel cell fc powered auvs the presented method is an iterative process based on assumptions and regressions obtained from current commercial auvs for that reason a thorough analysis has been performed on a set of 21 well known auvs involving a principal component analysis pca and the subsequent search for correlations among the parameters of the auvs collected a certain degree of freedom in the dimensions of fc systems has been found as the length to diameter ratio of auvs allow for a range of values thus allowing a variety of fuel cell sizes and shapes the goodness of the method proposed has been tested with the dimensioning of a representative example of a hypothetical fc powered auv as a result the dimensioned fc auv presents a greater endurance than others equivalent in size and displacement powered by batteries in order to gain some insight a brief discussion on the best suited fc for powering auv has been performed the fittest fc type for powering auv at the current state of technology is the proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc type being the main reasons their high power densities and their low operating temperatures nevertheless direct methanol fuel cells dmfc may also be identified as possible candidates provided that further investigation is conducted in regard to carbon dioxide management underwater dmfc technology is considered promising as their fuel offers much greater volumetric energy density than the one offered by hydrogen an analysis has also been performed in the storage means of fc reactants the main peculiarity of fc in underwater applications is that there is no oxygen readily available in the environment for that reason oxygen must be stored along with hydrogen as a result matrix based maps have been elaborated representing energy densities and costs of the combined storing solutions none of the regarded solutions involve the use of fuel reformers the best solution regarding energy densities of the reactants is to store both of them in liquefied state but since liquefaction of hydrogen is a very expensive process two more efficient solutions that also hold good energy densities have been addressed these alternative solutions for the storage of hydrogen regarding good gravimetric and volumetric energy densities are compressed at 350 bar and cryo compressed at 300 bar and 57 k

23562,current commercial autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are powered by conventional batteries however such technology has reached a point at which an increase of the endurance and range of operations would require increasing the size of existing auv designs much attention has been paid to fuel cells as they have proven successfully installable in auv prototypes and have shown good results regarding the increase of range and endurance of auvs nevertheless no commercial auv powered by fuel cells has been made yet in this work the characteristics of well known commercial auvs have been studied using the principal components analysis such study allows inferring the requirements and constraints for the implementation of fuel cells in commercial auvs freedom in certain design parameters of both fuel cells and auvs has been found regarding the necessity to store oxidant along with the fuel in underwater applications a map of achieved energy densities by the combination of different means of storing hydrogen and oxygen has been obtained such map reveals the most benefiting combination of storage means for both reactants finally a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fuel cell powered auvs is proposed keywords fuel cell marine application auv design energy density power density hydrogen storage principal component analysis 1 introduction thanks to the great development achieved in these last years unmanned vehicles have evolved from the research laboratories into commercial military and scientific applications vukic 2013 although unmanned marine vehicles were developed by the military industry they are revolutionizing the access to the oceans in the civil industry as they are allowing to reach depths beyond the limits of scuba divers leonard et al 1998 the main reasons for using underwater unmanned vehicles uuvs are that they reduce human presence for safety costs or acoustic signature reasons and they increase operational ranges two different types of uuvs can be distinguished regarding whether uuvs are remotely piloted or not being both able to develop multitude of missions wang et al 2012 remotely operated vehicles rovs are usually employed for deep sea offshore tasks as substitutes of scuba divers autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are usually employed in offshore industry for obtaining information about subsea environment they operate without any physical or electronic interaction with human beings and therefore are able to navigate by themselves national oceanic and atmospheric administration 2013 alam et al 2014 whereas auvs need media to store energy on board for the propulsion and all the systems rovs normally do not need them as they are connected to a mother ship although sometimes they might have energy storing media to reduce their cable section brown current commercial auvs use batteries for storing energy eca group 2017 alam et al 2014 kongsberg 2012a 2012b 2013 2015 2016 2017a elektronik 2012 2013 bluefin robotics 2016a 2016b 2016c 2016d 2017a 2017b gavia 2016 eca group 2016 eca group 2017a eca group 2017b eca group 2017c eca group 2017d eca group 2017e their main drawback is that current technology has reached a maturity state at which very small improvement is expected regarding their energy densities this means that at the current state battery powered auvs with extended range and endurance are set to be bigger than normal range and endurance auvs however bigger auvs are less practical as they require heavier duty cranes to put them afloat and need more space to maneuver the main challenge addressed by this article is to increase the endurance and the range of auvs without increasing too much their size therefore a new power source with higher storage energy density is needed such new power source should be able to keep a small acoustic signature so that sonar readings can still be precise and accurate whilst keeping a small thermal signature in order not to interfere with other sensors affected by temperature kongsberg 2017b it is believed that a possible solution might be behind fuel cells fcs as they have the potential of achieving higher energy densities than those offered by batteries under certain configurations evans et al 2009 so far only some prototypes and conceptual designs of auvs are powered by fcs miller et al 2014 mendez et al 2014 yamamotoet al 2004 shih et al 2014 the reason for the lack of presence of fcs in commercial auvs is mainly due to the high costs of this technology at its current state however this technology can be competitive as it is for auvs that are to accomplish missions requiring longer ranges and endurances than those powered by batteries besides it is expected that the price of this technology will go down in the following years as giant car manufacturers have just released the first generation of commercial fc vehicles and are betting for this technology in the case of watertight auvs hybridization of fcs with batteries might reduce even more the cost and volume of final fc power systems lane et al 2017 for flooded auvs the cost reduction is yet unclear as subsea pressure compensated batteries can be even more expensive than fuel cell stacks at current state the purpose of this work is to present guidelines for auv designers at early stages of the designing process of fc powered auvs with the aim of saving time and effort the first part of the work as usually done in new projects of naval architecture focuses in finding existing relations between parameters of different auvs lewis et al 1988 this is to define the initial design parameters of fc powered auvs through the regressions obtained from such relations and to find the fc geometrical constraints that underlie the collected data the followed method for such aim is based on statistical analysis of well known commercial auvs the second part of the work discusses the most suitable fc type according to the inferred constraints and also discusses the different ways to store the reactants this part culminates with an assessment of the combined storing solutions of reactants in the form of matrix based maps of achieved energy densities and costs by such combinations to conclude a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fc powered auvs is described the followed approach throughout this work is numerical this has been done with the intention of adding objectivity in the decision making at early stages of the designing process especially when there is lack of data to support decisions 2 analysis of commercial auvs the aim of this section is to obtain the existing relations among parameters of commercial auvs therefore a data analysis is performed in a group of existing auvs although all of these are powered by batteries this will help to set the initial dimensions of the fc powered auv by prefixing as few parameters as possible lewis et al 1988 and will also help to unveil the geometrical constraints of the fc to be fitted in the auv there are two additional constraints for auv designs that cannot be found in the data analysis and must be always considered during the designing process such two constraints are known due to the similarities of auvs with submarines kormilitsin and khalizev 2001 being the first one that they must be able to stay in upright position and the second one that they must have neutral buoyancy when no thrust is applied in immersion the first one is fulfilled in designs with lower center of gravity than center of buoyancy and the second one is fulfilled in designs with overall density equal to the one of the seawater one exception to the second constraint is found in glider type auvs as they propel themselves by varying their own buoyancy overall density zhang et al 2014 table 1 collects data of 21 well known commercial auvs kongsberg 2017a kongsberg 2012a 2012b 2013 2015 2016 elektronik 2012 2013 bluefin robotics 2016a 2016b 2016c 2016d 2017a 2017b gavia 2016 eca group 2016 eca group 2017a eca group 2017b eca group 2017c eca group 2017d eca group 2017e that have proved cost effectiveness such table contains information about the main auv parameters length l diameter d mass displacement δ maximum depth h maximum speed v stored energy e endurance t mean power output w and length to diameter ratio l d the information shown in table 1 has been extracted directly from the datasheets of the corresponding manufacturers except for w and l d which have been calculated by dividing e by t and l by d respectively all the auvs gathered in table 1 are powered by batteries and are propelled by mechanical means typically propellers or pump jets except for the seaglider whose means of propulsion stem from the gliding caused by changes in the overall density of the auv thanks to the small power consumption of the glider type propulsion very long endurances can be achieved up to 10 months before starting with the data analysis process the original data structure shown in table 1 is checked by using a procedure capable of explaining the variability of such data the most common procedure used for this purpose is the principal component analysis pca this procedure not only allows to explain the variability of the data but also reduces the dimension of the problem as it reveals simpler data structures that underlie the original one as it implies obtaining the covariance matrix abdi and williams 2010 as the method works with matrixes it requires full information of the involved parameters therefore all the auvs collected in table 1 with missing information are eliminated during the pca in this work the pca rotates the original data structure defined as the reference vectors or parameters l d δ h v e t w l d to new reference vectors that are linear combinations of the original ones such new reference vectors also known as principal components pcs are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the original data meaning that they are linearly independent amongst themselves martens and naes 1992 for that reason l d and w are also omitted as they are dependent on other parameters allowing a reduction of the problem to 7 dimensions l d δ h v e t the covariance matrix obtained from a first pca on the data in table 1 indicates that most of the variability of the data is determined by a linear combination of the parameters related to the size of the system l d δ e as it will be discussed later a numerical correlation between them can be verified that allows using only one as a representation of a global variable that will be named s i z e p c the mass displacement has been chosen to represent this global variable as it is the most related factor with size then a new pca has been carried out using only four variables namely δ h v and t at this point the problem is down to 4 dimensions δ h v and t allowing a second pca with satisfactory results table 2 shows the 4 new rotated vectors or pcs obtained by the second pca ordered in decreasing degree of information they contain on the variability of the data each pc is represented as a composition of the original parameters δ h v and t here is a brief discussion on the pcs obtained the first pc summarizes the auv information given by δ h v and t containing a 52 9 of it such pc has great influence of all the four parameters but as it is mainly defined by δ with a factor of 0 654 the chosen alias for the first pc is s i z e p c the accumulated percentage of auv information represented by the first two pcs accounts for the 78 4 as the second pc is mainly defined by h and v with factors of 0 793 and 0 584 respectively its chosen alias could be p e r f o r m a n c e p c but as it can be seen as well in the third pc the second pc is not the only one clearly defined by two parameters therefore the alias d e p t h p c is considered better suited in this case the three first pcs together represent the information given by δ h v and t in a 96 2 as the third pc is mainly defined by t with a factor of 0 798 and v with a factor of 0 546 its chosen alias could be p e r f o r m a n c e p c but to avoid confusion its chosen alias is e n d u r a n c e p c all the pcs together define the variability of the auvs by a 100 the fourth pc also represents the size but is omitted as it adds very little information on the variability of the auvs allowing for further simplification table 3 and fig 1 show all the auvs except for the bluefin sandshark due to the lack of data as a function of the three first pcs obtained as it can be noted table 3 and fig 1 show three different groups group 1 group 2 and group 3 the first two groups are composed by the auvs that intervened in the pca while group 3 is composed by the auvs that did not have full information for being included in the pca therefore group 3 acts as control group as it will be discussed in the correlation between t and l two separated trends are identified group 1 and group 2 hence the differentiation in table 3 and fig 1 as well a graphical representation of the auvs by their pcs helps to find existing relations between pcs thus relations between the primitive parameters δ h v and t as well for that purpose data shown in table 1 must be normalized to remove the differences in orders of magnitude among the original parameters δ h v and t this is done to prevent a biased representation of the auvs towards δ and h which are up to three orders of magnitude greater than v and t the normalization of the parameters is performed by subtracting the standard deviation σ of the corresponding parameter from each value given in table 1 and then such result is divided by the corresponding parameter mean value x both standard deviations and mean values used for the normalization can be found at the bottom of table 1 note that the standard deviation and the mean value correspond to the 16 auvs that intervened in the pca exclusively fig 1 shows the distribution of auvs in a parallelepiped composed by the first three normalized pcs the s i z e p c the d e p t h p c and the e n d u r a n c e p c which as stated earlier represent the information given by δ h v and t in a 96 2 the normalized pcs are a result of using table 2 coefficients and the normalized parameters obtained for this purpose the identification number that appears in fig 1 is the same as the one shown in table 3 fig 1 shows that auvs do not seem to obey any visible pattern except in the e n d u r a n c e p c and s i z e p c projection where most of the auvs are alineated see the line in such projection this shows that there might be a good correlation between s i z e p c and e n d u r a n c e p c related parameters however the other pcs do not seem to hold any relation between them the pca has been very useful as a first step of the data analysis as it has helped to identify where the correlations might be thanks to the first pca it is known that correlations are bound to exist among s i z e related parameters l d δ and e and thanks to the second pca whose results are shown in tables 2 and 3 and fig 1 it is also known that there might be interrelations among the parameters involved with s i z e p c and e n d u r a n c e p c nevertheless it has been found out that the chance of finding relations among the parameters involved in the interrelation of d e p t h p c with e n d u r a n c e p c and between d e p t h p c with s i z e p c are very low however this is also good as that would mean fewer restrictions in the choice of parameters once the pca has been done correlations between the original parameters shown in table 1 should be attempted so that the resulting regressions can help to obtain the initial design dimensions of the auv to be designed by prefixing as few initial parameters as possible lewis et al 1988 in fig 2 it can be noted that the geometry is very regular as the diameter to length regression shows a straight line passing through the origin 1 d 0 1138 0 0077 l which corresponds to l d of 8 83 0 60 throughout this work two figures will be used in the expression of the data uncertainty to maintain the significance level α 0 05 in the confidence interval of all the results according to burcher and rydill 1995 given a specific total displacement the l d that optimizes the viscous drag is near 6 a good reason for designing an auv with l d other than 6 could be found in restrictions related to dimensions of the equipment it is more common to find l d 6 as such values are less penalizing to the drag than l d 6 this fact might give some extra degree of freedom in the dimensions and shape of the fc system to be fitted in the auv the correlation between δ and l can be seen in fig 3 and is given by 2 δ 10 3 l 2 65 0 25 it can be noted that there is a good correlation between these two parameters which could be expected as the l d does not have very big variations between auvs as seen in fig 2 fig 3 also shows the good correlation existing between stored energy and length of auvs 3 e 0 28 0 11 l 2 59 0 29 it can be noted that both regressions have a potential behavior with an exponent close to 3 fact that makes sense as both the mass displacement and the storage volume depend directly on the auv volume which depends on the auv length at the third power it is worth to mention that the regression of e and l corresponds to auvs powered by batteries and as such it should be taken as the minimum acceptable regression line in fc powered auvs otherwise the conversion from batteries to fc can only be explained by the shorter refueling time compared to the one found in the recharging cycles of batteries which normally is not enough to justify the substitution over lithium batteries with the current difference in market values the observed distinction between the two groups 1 and 2 made in fig 1 can be seen in the correlation between t and l shown in fig 4 the reason to attempt for a linear correlation is explained here at a given speed the energy consumption rate is directly proportional to the resistance which increases linearly with the wetted surface w d l on the other hand the energy storage capacity depends directly on the auv volume e d 2 l and as the endurance is obtained as the division of stored energy and energy consumption rate t depends linearly on d t d but as seen in fig 2 d and l are directly related therefore t also depends linearly on l t l lewis et al 1988 the regression of group 1 is as follows 4 t 1 4 95 0 53 l 2 1 2 2 while the regression of the group 2 corresponds to 5 t 2 6 35 0 51 l 1 9 1 7 the great uncertainty in the intercepts shows that t is directly proportional to l implying the existence of a different design factor between the two groups the recommended regression line to be chosen in fig 4 is the one corresponding to eq 5 as it is the one that offers more t at less l because as mentioned above one of the reasons to resort to fcs as power source is enhancing the ratio of t and l furthermore it is worth to note that the regression of t with l corresponds to auvs powered by batteries and as such it should be taken as the minimum acceptable regression line in fc powered auvs in fig 5 h and v do not correlate well neither between them nor with the other parameters the main conclusion of these last correlation attempts is that there is a fair degree of freedom in the choice of v and h however v appears to be almost invariant in the values shown in table 1 and usually close to 5 kn 2 6 m s such values can be explained not only because of power consumption economy but also due to the small acoustic signature required for passive sonar transducers which are hindered by the hydrodynamic hull noise when navigating therefore it seems reasonable to choose any v that does not exceed the values presented in table 1 3 fuel cell requirements for auvs brief discussion on the best suited fuel cell type taking as a basis the data of auvs collected in table 1 and the specification sheets of the manufacturers the inferred requirements of fcs for auvs are listed here the size of the fc system shall be as small and light as possible power output of fc systems shall be in the range of 0 12 kw 2 kw fc systems should be modularized in order to be removable exchangeable and replaceable as this feature is present in current auv battery modules the temperature mismatch between the fc system and temperature sensitive electronics shall be as small as possible this is to reduce the thermal break thickness between both systems typical temperature sensitive electronics have their operation temperatures limited to 40 c kongsberg 2017b depending on whether the auv is flooded or watertight this affects differently but it is always translated as an increase in size o in flooded architectures the water that floods the space between watertight compartments acts as thermal break thus separation between watertight compartments increases for higher temperature fuel cells o in watertight auvs all elements share the same space here thermal breaks are added between temperature sensitive electronics and the fuel cell the thickness of the thermal break increases with the thermal gap between spaces table 4 energy 2016 oorja 2015 independent

2016 horizon fuel cell technologies 2016 hydrogenics 2016 nedstack 2016 plugpower 2014 summarizes the ranges of properties of different types of fcs from well known fc manufacturers such fcs include direct methanol fuel cells dmfcs alkaline fuel cells afcs solid oxide fuel cells sofcs molten carbonate fuel cells mcfcs phosphoric acid fuel cells pafcs and proton exchange membrane fuel cells pemfcs it is worth to mention that the information shown regards the whole fc system including the balance of plant bop components except in the upper power density limits power mass and power volume of the pemfc where the weight and volume of coolant pumps are not included the fuel and oxidant storage are regarded separately in the next section looking at table 4 the best suited fc regarding the above criteria for powering auvs is the proton exchange membrane type pemfc as it can reach very good power densities at low temperatures even higher power densities have been identified by the authors of the reference van biert et al 2016 pemfc has also demonstrated its successfulness in powering fc auv prototypes mendez et al 2014 yamamotoet al 2004 shih et al 2014 other reasons that support the choice of pemfc are that they present shorter response times shorter start up times and also greater resistance to shocks and vibrations than the other fc types for all these reasons pemfcs should be the first option for designers at the current state of the technology 4 storage of reactants in fuel cell systems for auvs discussion fcs require not only fuel to produce electricity but also an oxidant normally fcs working in the atmosphere use air as oxidant however one of the peculiarities of subsea fc applications is that there is a very limited source of air within the underwater craft therefore it is necessary to store oxidant along with fuel hydrogen can be stored in several different ways some of the figures related to some of current hydrogen storage media can be found in table 5 ahluwalia et al 2016 materials based hydrogen 2017 brunner et al 2016 hylium industries 2016 note that the values of hydrogen shown in table 5 that involve the stored energy in kwh have been obtained from the same equivalent ratios in mass by using the lhv note as well that the cost addressed in table 5 is referred to the storage medium and not to the hydrogen itself regarding the oxygen the ways of physically storing it are very similar to the ones of hydrogen therefore figures shown in table 6 stem from the same data of hydrogen presented in table 5 adapting the gas properties to oxygen national institute of standards and technology 2016 except data related to liquid oxygen which has been obtained from a commercial manufacturer of dewars cryofab 2016 with a net capacity of 50 l it is worth to mention that the ratios of oxygen involving the stored energy presented in table 6 stem from the oxygen equivalent amount of hydrogen to which the lhv of hydrogen is applied according to 6 h 2 1 2 o 2 h 2 o with the aim of putting into context the data appearing in tables 5 9 a brief discussion on hydrogen and oxygen storage is done hydrogen and oxygen can be stored compressed in high pressure vessels up to 700 bar at ambient temperature the vessels are usually heavy and made of austenitic stainless steel or more often lighter and made of composite materials baumert and epp 1993 caution must be taken of materials that suffer from hydrogen embrittlement this is the simplest method of storing both gases the information on compressed systems that appear in tables 5 and 6 is referred to type iv composite material pressure vessels concretely of 250 4 l the 350 bar unit and 145 2 l the 700 bar unit of net capacity which are lighter but more expensive than type i metallic pressure vessels hydrogen and oxygen can be stored in liquid state at cryogenic temperatures kang and kim 2014 in vacuum flasks special attention must be paid to the boil off of the liquid hydrogen especially when the consumption rate is lower than the boil off rate and there is no reliquefication system this solution is more common in oxygen than in hydrogen as the storing temperature for oxygen is higher 90 k in contrast with 22 k of hydrogen data shown in tables 5 and 6 correspond to 50 l commercial dewars hydrogen and oxygen can be stored in cryo compressed state ahluwalia et al 2012 pressure vessels can be insulated and store super critic hydrogen at 300 bar of pressure and temperatures around 57 k with a density close to the one of liquid hydrogen the same applies to cryo compressed oxygen at 300 bar and around 155 k the main problem is that if the reactants consumption rate is low as the temperature in the tank rises gases must be either blown off or refrigerated in order to keep the pressure from rising data shown in tables 5 and 6 corresponds to type iii composite pressure vessels with metallic lining of 100 l of net capacity hydrogen can be stored in the form of hydrocarbons such as kerosene or diesel which are very cheap and easy to store and later be steam reformed at high temperatures the regenerated gas is hydrogen rich at about 70 75 and comes along with steam co2 co and sox co and sox must be completely removed to avoid catalyst poisoning the three main drawbacks of this storage method are the volume and complexity of the reforming system the high temperatures needed for steam reforming and the co2 management under water baumert and epp 1993 hydrogen can also be stored at low pressure in certain metal hydrides that react reversibly with hydrogen hyakudome 2011 the hydrogen is freed from the alloy by heating this metal alloys have an acceptable volumetric storage density although usually have poor gravimetric storage density typically less than 3 6 of hydrogen in mass materials based hydrogen 2017 this storage system shows some issues such as their high cost their loss of efficiency after some hydrogen refueling cycles and their sensitivity to water baumert and epp 1993 metal hydrides as these mentioned with poor gravimetric densities and acceptable volumetric densities might be advisable for large auvs as the urashima yamamotoet al 2004 for small amounts of stored hydrogen the gravimetric and volumetric densities of physical storage means are penalized on the contrary the gravimetric and volumetric densities are kept constant in metal hydrides along with other hydrogen chemical compounds regardless the amount of stored hydrogen for that reason hydrogen compounds with very good gravimetric and volumetric densities such as nabh4 have gained a lot of interest for applications that require small amounts of stored hydrogen swider lyons and deitz 2016 in addition as the hydrogen is produced on demand this is one of the safest methods for storing hydrogen napán and peltzer y blancá 2012 oxygen can be released from exothermic reactions of different chemical compounds as peroxides sodium chlorate lithium perchlorate or other oxyhalides mendez et al 2014 special attention must be paid to the choice of the chemical compound so that the reaction byproducts other than oxygen can be easily stored during operation as it happens to hydrogen chemical compounds it makes special sense to store oxygen in the form of chemical compounds for applications that require small quantities of oxygen swider lyons and deitz 2016 the gravimetric and volumetric densities shown in tables 5 and 6 are used to obtain the overall gravimetric and volumetric density of both reactants which can be obtained as 7 1 ρ o a 1 ρ h 2 1 ρ o 2 where ρ is either the gravimetric or the volumetric density and the o a subscript stands for overall the overall gravimetric and volumetric densities are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively in the form of matrix based maps as an example the first value appearing in table 7 is calculated which corresponds to the gravimetric density of both hydrogen and oxygen compressed at 700 bar for that reason ρ h 2 is taken from table 5 as 1 48 kwh kg h 2 system and ρ o 2 is taken from table 6 as 1 84 kwh kg o 2 system therefore the overall gravimetric density appearing in table 7 is ρ o a 1 ρ h 2 1 ρ o 2 1 1 1 48 kwh kg h 2 syst 1 1 84 kwh kg o 2 syst 1 0 82 kwh kg h 2 o 2 system the overall cost of the storage system c o a can be obtained from the direct sum of costs of hydrogen and oxygen storage systems c h 2 and c o 2 respectively as shown in eq 8 here c represents the cost in kwh 8 c o a c h 2 c o 2 note in table 7 that the best storage solution for both gravimetric and volumetric densities is liquid cryogenic for both reactants with a value of 1 06 kwh kg h2 o2 system and 0 75 kwh l h2 o2 system respectively however as obtaining liquid hydrogen has an approximate cost of a 35 of its lhv godula jopek et al 2012 a better solution in this regard could be in storing compressed hydrogen at 350 bar and at ambient temperature this is because the compression process of hydrogen is more than three times cheaper than the liquefaction process from an energetic point of view durbin and malardier jugroot 2013 on the other hand oxygen can be kept liquid at 90 k and 1 bar since the energetic impact of liquefaction for this gas is much smaller this is known because the ideal liquefaction cost of nitrogen is around 15 times lower than the one of hydrogen given that the boiling point of nitrogen at 1 bar is 77 2 k godula jopek et al 2012 regarding the energetic efficiency of the storing process of hydrogen the gravimetric density enhancing solution would be to store it compressed at 350 bar the new value of gravimetric density is 1 05 kwh kg h2 o2 system which is very close to the previous value of 1 06 kwh kg h2 o2 system about the volumetric density in table 8 the energy efficient storing alternative could be to store hydrogen in cryo compressed state and oxygen in liquid state as there is almost no difference in value with the first mentioned solution the overall cost of the storage system shown in table 9 has been calculated by taking data from tables 5 and 6 as a basis the most expensive combinations involve storing hydrogen in metal hydrides while the others are in the range of 18 kwh to 26 kwh since there is a potential loss of reactants in cryogenic solutions due to boil off or blow off depending on the case perhaps the most economical solution in the long term would be to store oxygen and hydrogen at a compressed state of 350 bar it is expected that the final decision will depend on the specific design and mission of the craft in any case it must be checked that the fc system to be designed including reactants surpasses li ion batteries gravimetric density 0 24 kwh kg panasonic 2016 and volumetric density 0 68 kwh l panasonic 2016 equations 9 and 10 allow checking whether the densities of the whole fc system including storage system are greater or not than the corresponding of lithium batteries 9 e e ρ g r e a c t w ρ g f c 0 24 kwh kg 10 e e ρ v r e a c t w ρ v f c 0 68 kwh l where ρ g r e a c t kwh kg and ρ v r e a c t kwh l are the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the combined storage systems respectively found in tables 7 and 8 the gravimetric and volumetric densities of the fc systems ρ g f c w kg and ρ v f c w l respectively are available in table 4 note that e must be in kwh and w in w to be unit consistent with their respective densities it is worth to mention that all data appearing in tables 7 9 are true for stoichiometric storage of both reactants 5 methodology for obtaining initial design parameters of fc powered auvs the aim of this section is to present a procedure for obtaining the initial dimensions of fc powered auvs which are expected to have more endurance than those of the same size powered by batteries the proposed procedure is an iterative process based on assumptions and regressions obtained during the data analysis on auvs as shown in the flow diagram presented in fig 6 such process is divided in three stages being the first one the estimation of the parameters e w l and d the main constraints of the fc system followed by the mass displacement δ check and culminated by the volume displacement check first the designer must choose t h and v of the auv it is recommended that v does not exceed the corresponding range presented in table 1 this first part focuses in obtaining w and the corresponding e for the t given and the w obtained once the mission of the auv and the equipment to carry are known the power requirements of the fc can be estimated for peak situations running all the equipment and navigating at full speed in order to obtain the needed capacity of the buffer batteries and for mean situations running the typical equipment for the mission at cruise speed for dimensioning the fc and the subsequent amount of reactants as this is an iterative process it is necessary to fix l and d of the auv for the first time the closer they are to the actual convergence value the fewer iterations it will take for its convergence therefore it is recommended to refer to table 1 and pick those values based on other similar auvs at this point it is recommended that designers make a short list of possible fc candidates regarding the foreseeable power ranges and dimensions required by the auv in mind the aim of this is using that information for choosing the initial d as it is the main geometrical constraint for the fc l can be obtained by using l d 6 note that if that l d is not suited for the fc system a higher value of l d can be chosen as seen in eq 1 and in the comment below it the estimation of the power consumption due to propulsion is solely based on the viscous drag jagadeesh et al 2009 which can be obtained using the viscous drag coefficient c v this can be obtained from the skin friction drag c f and the form coefficient 1 k gillmer and bruce 1982 the c f can be obtained by using the international towing tank conference 57 correlation line ittc 1957 11 c f 0 075 log 10 r e 2 2 where r e is the reynolds number 12 r e v l ν being ν the kinematic viscosity of seawater the form coefficient can be obtained from the droblenkov s curve for auvs with circular cross section kormilitsin and khalizev 2001 13 1 k 1 0 2 d l 8 d l 2 10 d l 3 then c v is calculated 14 c v c f 1 k next the viscous drag is calculated 15 r v 1 2 ρ w s v 2 c v where ρ is the seawater density typically 1025 kg m3 and w s is the wetted surface of the auv which can be assumed as a cylinder of dimensions l and d finally the power requirement for propulsion can be estimated as 16 w p r o p v r v η d where η d is the propulsive efficiency renilson 2015 as a reminder it is necessary to add the power requirements of the rest of the equipment to that value to get the overall power requirements before continuing to the next step once the power output requirement of the fc is obtained the stored energy required is obtained as 17 e t w η f c where η f c is the fc efficiency now that e and w are known it is time to decide the configuration of the fc system and the reactants system as stated before the main purpose of designing an fc powered auv is to benefit from their potential of achieving greater energy densities than current commercial batteries the word potential is used intendedly as it is known from eqs 9 and 10 that given a specific e and w for the mission there might be combinations where the whole fc system including reactants might have smaller energy densities than batteries this depends on the power density of the fc and the energy density of the reactants the volumetric density of the whole fc system is the most compromised at this respect this is because the best volumetric energy density achieved by the reactants is not much higher than the one of li ion batteries li ion volumetric density is only surpassed either by liquid or cryo compressed hydrogen combined with liquid oxygen therefore it is strongly advised to check in eq 10 that the volumetric density achieved by the whole fc system chosen including reactants presents higher values the length range of the auv can be obtained from the stored energy e by using eq 3 the smaller value of the range shall substitute the l value used until now because eq 3 represents the behavior of battery powered auvs which are bigger in size than fc auvs for the same stored energy although l can be adjusted to even smaller values after the displacement checks if l is considered big and there is an important excess of displacement once the new l is fixed the new d shall be calculated from eq 1 note that l d shall be as close as possible to 6 to the extent that the equipment and the fc system allow it it is advisable to repeat the calculations done until now with the new l and d values until they converge once this is done the mass displacement check shall start in eq 2 the δ range can be calculated by introducing l the δ check involves estimating the mass of the hull and structure the one of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the fc reactants once all the masses have been estimated the sum of them is compared with the δ range obtained the mass of the reactants can be estimated by dividing the stored energy by the resulting gravimetric density shown in table 7 of the selected combination of reactants storage systems similarly the mass of the fc system if unknown can be estimated by dividing the total power requirement by the gravimetric density of the fc system selected shown in table 4 it is recommended to use more accurate information given by manufacturers when at hand as this method presents some uncertainties that may require more work in later stages moreover some of the values in table 4 do not include the coolant pump after choosing the auv materials the mass of the hull and structure can be calculated by summing the masses of all the plates and stiffeners of the structure however this type of calculation is only possible at stages where the fc auv is more defined despite that an estimation is possible at this stage by supposing that the hull and structure are solely composed by equivalent plates of greater thickness thereby the mass of the structure can be estimated by calculating the volume of this equivalent plates by obtaining the plate thickness by using the kirchhoff membrane theory of cylindrical shaped pressure vessels vullo 2014 18 t d ρ g h k s 2 σ y where ρ is the density of seawater g is the gravity acceleration k s is the thickener coefficient of the plates and σ y is the yield strength of the chosen material once the thickness of the equivalent plates of hull and structure is obtained the mass of the structure can be calculated by multiplying the volume of the hull plates by the density of the material ρ m a t which can be estimated by means of m t l d π ρ m a t after checking that the sum of the mass of the hull the one of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the fc reactants is equal or smaller than the mass displacement range it is possible to do the volume displacement check similarly it must be checked that the sum of the volume of the equipment the one of the fc system and the one of the stored reactants is smaller or equal to the range of which is obtained by dividing the mass displacement by the seawater density δ ρ the whole process shall be repeated by changing parameters materials equipment or fc systems as shown in fig 6 until both displacement checks have passed successfully it is advisable to leave some margin in both displacement checks to prevent unnecessary repetitions of the whole design in later stages as it is likely to find deficit of displacements as the design progresses and more certainty on the weights and volumes taking place are gained this is also useful to prevent problems related to the packaging of the fuel cell system which are more likely to appear than in batteries should there be a wide margin regarding both displacement checks at the latest stages of the designing process the amount of stored reactants could be increased to extend even more the range and the endurance of the craft if there is no room for more reactants but there is still a wide margin for weight it can easily be solved by adding ballast such ballast will add extra stability to the auv as long as it is positioned below the center of buoyancy another possibility could be to reduce the size of the auv until the margin in the displacement checks is acceptable as an example of the method table 10 summarizes the inputs and outputs of each stage of the process for the calculation of the initial design parameters of a watertight auv the process starts by fixing a target endurance of 50 h at a cruise speed of 1 7 m s the chosen initial parameters for the iteration process are l 4 5 m and d 0 7 m other chosen parameters for the dimensioning of the auvs are those related to the auv equipment and the coolant pump of the fc system 300 w 50 kg and 350 l the pressure hull carbon fiber reinforced epoxy with k s 3 efficiencies of the fuel cell system based on table 4 and propulsion η f c 0 40 η d 0 35 449 w kg and 471 w l after 5 iterations the process converges to l 8 6 m and d 1 0 m both the δ check and check pass without problem however both present excessive mass and volume reserves that is σ mass δ and σ volume for that reason a size reduction process is performed consisting in reducing l and d and then repeating all 3 stages of the process until a solution with reasonable buoyancy and volume reserves are found the solution able to descend to 6000 m depth and able endure 50 h of operation at 1 7 m s of cruise speed has 4 2 m length and 0 6 m diameter the buoyancy reserve after the size reduction is 227 kg and the volume reserve within the pressure hull is 118 l the resulting size of the dimensioned fc powered auv is similar to the one of the bluefin 21 from table 1 the dimensioned fc auv presents the same δ of the hugin attending to size and δ comparison criteria it can be seen that the endurance of the fc powered auv dimensioned in this example presents twice the endurance of the two battery powered auvs aforementioned 6 conclusions guidelines have been presented in this the article aimed to obtain new designs of autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with extended range and endurance without increasing size such guidelines include a method for obtaining the initial design parameters of fuel cell fc powered auvs the presented method is an iterative process based on assumptions and regressions obtained from current commercial auvs for that reason a thorough analysis has been performed on a set of 21 well known auvs involving a principal component analysis pca and the subsequent search for correlations among the parameters of the auvs collected a certain degree of freedom in the dimensions of fc systems has been found as the length to diameter ratio of auvs allow for a range of values thus allowing a variety of fuel cell sizes and shapes the goodness of the method proposed has been tested with the dimensioning of a representative example of a hypothetical fc powered auv as a result the dimensioned fc auv presents a greater endurance than others equivalent in size and displacement powered by batteries in order to gain some insight a brief discussion on the best suited fc for powering auv has been performed the fittest fc type for powering auv at the current state of technology is the proton exchange membrane fuel cell pemfc type being the main reasons their high power densities and their low operating temperatures nevertheless direct methanol fuel cells dmfc may also be identified as possible candidates provided that further investigation is conducted in regard to carbon dioxide management underwater dmfc technology is considered promising as their fuel offers much greater volumetric energy density than the one offered by hydrogen an analysis has also been performed in the storage means of fc reactants the main peculiarity of fc in underwater applications is that there is no oxygen readily available in the environment for that reason oxygen must be stored along with hydrogen as a result matrix based maps have been elaborated representing energy densities and costs of the combined storing solutions none of the regarded solutions involve the use of fuel reformers the best solution regarding energy densities of the reactants is to store both of them in liquefied state but since liquefaction of hydrogen is a very expensive process two more efficient solutions that also hold good energy densities have been addressed these alternative solutions for the storage of hydrogen regarding good gravimetric and volumetric energy densities are compressed at 350 bar and cryo compressed at 300 bar and 57 k

23563,this paper presents a framework for the availability assessment of subsea distribution systems during the functional design selection phase this framework which also includes all interface elements can be started at an early stage when the definition of the system architecture is coarse and generic failure data is available and can be refined as more information becomes available then maintained as the system ages during the operational phase the main objective is to present a decision tool for selecting the subsea distribution system with the highest advantage in terms of availability at a very early stage of the design the design structure matrix dsm mapping method is used to represent the system s components and their dependencies which is then enriched with additional reliability data to calculate availability a case study of an actual subsea distribution system is used to demonstrate the approach keywords availability reliability subsea distribution

remotely operated vehicle scm subsea control module sdu subsea distribution unit x tree christmas tree 1 introduction downtime of high value subsea installations due to equipment failures and time needed for their subsequent retrieval repair and replacement can have a significant effect on revenue the problem is compounded for deep water subsea installations where all tasks must be handled remotely from a surface vessel reliability and availability assessments particularly during the concept selection phase can identify key systems configuration equipment and components that are likely to have a major impact on system availability iso 2394 and 20815 such study can also include accidental damage e g dropped object anchor dropping and dragging etc that can destroy part of the system a good architecture helps to avoid these hazards for subsea installations the difficulty of access makes the system architecture a primary factor that influences availability components are bundled together for ease of lifting and installation considering the limit on size and weight of bundles which can be installed using available crane barges balancing the number of offshore lifts and accessibility of components for ease of retrieval is the hallmark of a good architecture reliability is the probability that a system will operate properly for a specific period of time under specified operating conditions system maintainability is a measure of the ability of a system to be maintained to prevent a failure occurring in the future and the ability to restore the system when a failure occurs a system is not available if it is taken down for routine or preventative maintenance the consequence is similar to a system that has broken down maintainability is a derivative of the system reliability it is design dependent and is achieved by the highest level of availability mil hdbk 217f system reliability availability and maintainability ram studies at the early development stage can provide a baseline to compare alternative architectures at the concept selection phase yasseri 2014 when the functional architecture is being decided it is helpful to model the functional elements in terms of coarse grain building blocks the functional architecture is a high level abstraction which defines functional elements without reference to its physical implementation many methods have been proposed for the reliability analysis of systems the most commonly used methods are failure mode and effect assessment fmea riac 2010 fault tree diagram ftd riac 2010 reliability block diagram rbd bs en 61078 2006 markov chain liu et al 2014 koutras 1996 and monte carlo simulation zio et al 2006 2010 each method has its own advantages and disadvantages dekker and groenendijk 1995 robert and laing 2002 studied the causes and frequency of failure by collecting data from field experience and accelerated testing brandt and eriksen 2001 showed how ram analysis can be used to quantify costs associated with subsea well interventions and subsea repairs brandt 2003 applied risk and reliability techniques in combination with verification and qualification procedures sunde 2003 proposed a guideline based on a computerized tool for the assessment of the reliability and cost of subsea process systems alhanati and trevisan 2012 investigated reliability gaps in an electrical submersible pump technology for deep water applications the first step in evaluating a system s reliability is to construct a graphical presentation of the system s components and their connectivity reliability wise this paper uses the design structure matrix dsm eppinger and browning 2012 for this purpose the interface dsm yasseri 2015 is enriched with reliability data concerning non graphic characteristics like k the number of components required for the system to be deemed available i e the k in k out of m systems nasa 2011 or nswc 11 2010 and the calculated reliability this model is carried forward to later stages of the development when the physical architecture has taken shape and component specific failure rate can be obtained or calculated the overall system availability is determined compositionally as a function of the reliability of its constituent components and their interactions the primary emphasis of the reliability of the subsea system is component based it is true that a reliable system must be composed of reliable components but it is possible to arrange reliable component into a subsea system for which retrieving of a failed component is time consuming thus leading to extensive downtime and hence to a poor availability subsea equipment is housed in a suitable size and weight structures for the transportation and the installation purposes equipment may be bundled with little attention in how they can be brought back to the surface for repair consequently there is a need for an approach that can consider the effect of system architecture on availability the motivation for the use of an architecture level quantitative assessment of availability includes the following developing techniques to analyse the reliability and performance of the system which is built from commercially available off the shelf cots components rather than bespoke design understanding how the system reliability performance depends on how its components are arranged configured and their interactions studying the sensitivity to reliabilities of components and interfaces in search of better interface designs and packing guiding the process of identifying critical components and interfaces developing techniques for quantitative analysis that are applicable throughout the system life cycle 2 system architecture the system architecture is an abstract model that defines the structure and behaviour of a system sillitto 2014 it defines the organization of the system s components their relationships to each other and to the environment it also provides a plan from which components can be procured and manufactured such that the developed system will work together to deliver the required overall function two levels of system architecture are defined namely the functional also known as logical architecture and the physical architecture functional architecture sometimes referred to as the conceptual design is an abstract view of the production system functional architecture defines a solution independent representation of the system composed of pure functions the depiction of components of a functional architecture represents abstractions of physical solutions at this stage what the component must do is quite clear but its physical properties weight size material etc are unknown until a decision made regarding which vendor would supply them this happens later in the project lifecycle physical components procured from two different vendors provide the same function but their details may be different hence their failure rate for example two subsea control modules scm developed by two suppliers will have many different physical characteristics but they will also share many common functional properties a component of a functional system thus defines functions properties and interfaces that are common to a range of physical design alternatives most importantly functional architecture remains largely independent of technology or suppliers and provides a reasonably stable baseline from which the physical architecture can be derived and manufactured a functional logical architecture is a design which includes all major components by naming their functions plus their relationships the upper part of fig 1 shows that a system to deliver a function consists of many sub functions at this level only the function of each equipment flow communications connections and dependencies are identified each component is shown as a black box whose function is described but not its physical properties the intention is to ensure that all components and functionality of a subsea system are accounted and well understood functional architecture does not include vendors names or equipment properties weight size geometry transportation install ability etc as the design progresses and one of the many possible functional architecture options is chosen to be taken forward for detailing then the physical architecture gradually emerges the lower part of fig 1 the lower part of fig 1 is a mirror image of the upper part and there is a one to one relationship between the functional components and their physical counterpart when vendors are selected then gradually the physical system takes shape as the design of components starts their dimensions become available and the system configuration can be refined this process starts at the select phase yasseri 2014 perfected in the detail design and maintained as the project lifecycle management requires at the detail design phase few iterations are required until a satisfactory physical architecture is obtained the physical architecture has all major components and entities identified within a specific physical dimension vendor locations etc or possible solutions it also includes all known details such as how they operate vendor s operating instructions configuration materials and means of communication control all physical constraints or limitations are also identified e g fluid flow requirements size and availability of installation barges and physical solution for interfaces are decided in fact a physical architecture is one possible realisation of the functional architecture if the available installation barge is smaller than desired then the physical system is broken down further or reduced in size to fit the available crane capacity limitation of what can be transported and installed is a primary factor in determining the geometry and the system configuration after the select phase the functional design will remain relatively static but the physical resources will change throughout the lifecycle the physical implementation is ultimately based on the available technology and as such changes dynamically physical architecture evolves over time and can change by the introduction of new capabilities or by new technologies hardware software upgrade cycles or the need to replace obsolete equipment or acquiring from a different supplier thus functional architecture is a scheme through which each function of a system is allocated to a physical component fig 1 the physical architecture also takes into consideration constraints such as size geometric compatibility and configuration as well as the arrangement and spatial layout of a particular distribution concept e g should a subsea distribution unit sdu be located inside or outside of the manifold fig 2 shows an example of the functional architecture of a subsea field tied back to an onshore terminal architectural decisions directly affect aspects of system dependability identifying and eliminating or mitigating architectural problems during the selection phase helps to enhance dependability to achieve this goal reliability and other quality attributes must be built into the subsea system during the development stage starting with the functional architecture this paper investigates the availability of a subsea distribution system at its functional architectural level when only generic data is available later when the design has progressed physical components can be characterised by actual supplier reliability data or by structural mechanical reliability methods 3 domain mapping dsm is a visual tool browning 2013 that represents the relationships and dependencies between components of a system browning 2016 the component based dsm eppinger and browning 2012 which is used in this paper comprises a list of components in some desirable order whereby upstream components are listed in the upper row fig 3 shows a directed graph network and its representation using dsm is shown in fig 4 the network fig 3 is the functional block diagram which gives a view of the system s functions and how they must interface to achieve the overall function the components are shown as rows and columns in the matrix where the components are listed in the same order along both axes an off diagonal mark located within the matrix denotes a coupling between two components fig 4 shows that components a and f do not require input from the other components but b c d e i g h and i receive input the component interactions are represented by x marks in the off diagonal cells the marked cells indicate dependencies between components reading down a column indicates that a component provides input to others in its associated row on the other hand a component in the row receives input from the component in the corresponding column when reading across a row in the matrix a number can be used instead of x to represent some interface quantity for example risk or and the volatility of the interface see yasseri 2014 since network shown in fig 3 is a directed graph its dsm shown in fig 4 shows is an asymmetrical matrix this paper for simplicity assumes at the highest level of system hierarchy all dependencies are two way thus leading to the symmetrical matrix presenting every component of a subsea system in a single matrix obscures its visual usefulness a subsea system can be organised into a hierarchical structure e g subsystem subsystems and assemblies components such hierarchical representation avoids problems related to presenting extremely large matrices by shifting the focus to various levels in the hierarchy at a time which enables the analysis of a system at different levels of details in general the dsm analysis only looks at relationships across components at the same level and not within components the next level below 4 availability assessment the cost of accessing subsea equipment for repair and maintenance is a primary decision factor there are many components and interfaces on a subsea distribution system that can fail due to a variety of reasons for example intrinsic factors e g corrosion joint failure water ingress hydraulic coupling leak weld failure electrical connection failure sensor failure solenoid valve failure power supply failure solenoid failure driver microprocessor failure etc extrinsic factors e g wax or hydrate blocking a sensor port dropped object umbilical dragged by anchor chain or trawl board etc degradation such as caused by fatigue creep or stress corrosion can have a strong influence on failure probability cumulative damage in a highly stressed component can also cause failure so will a single overload a number of reliability methods for structural and mechanical components known as structural reliability methods have been developed among them first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm madsen et al 1986 known as capacity demand models are the easiest to apply and are in fact considered as the work horse of reliability based code development essentially these methods relate failure probability to the effect of the interaction between loading demand by loads and strength capacity or resistance distributions when these distributions are well separated with little interference as they are with new and well engineered equipment the safety margin will be sufficiently large and the failure distribution will tend towards the constant hazard rate model in this case the system failure probability can be computed as a function of the hazard rates for all the components in the system for highly stressed equipment operating in a corrosive environment or subjected to fast transients the load and strength distributions may have a significant overlap and interference would grow as the strength of components degrade over time the probability of failure in this case may depend on the resistance of just a few components to the excursions of applied loads relating component reliabilities to stressors remains the aim but except for structures the structural reliability methods have not been applied to other subsea components in a meaningful way the lack of comprehensive strength degradation data loading and complex geometries can be the primary constraints for applying structural reliability methods the assumption of constant hazard and repair rates are frequently used for availability and reliability assessment of subsea production systems sps which is the best that can be done e g see choi and chang 2016 this paper follows the same tradition as nothing better than failure databases are available during the concept selection phase subsea production systems sps tend to have a relatively simple configuration from the reliability viewpoint they often consist of systems in series possibly with standby units that can therefore be modelled as a series parallel configuration availability assessments usually occur at a subsystem level i e x tree manifold etc and not at a component level e g valves since at the functional design stage detailed information is not available data in databases are averaged and only one bad set of data could bring the average down thus making more of current installations above the average secondly the averaging also masks the effect of extreme conditions operational environmental and maintenance conditions can affect the validity of generic reliability data an evaluation of uncertainties in the basic data is prudent for ensuring that predictions based on the assumption of constant hazard rates are acceptable component reliability calculations require the use of established databases to obtain the failure rate λ these databases are comprehensive for electronic components but far less so for mechanical and hydraulic components possibly making the calculated reliability as an upper bound estimate a more useful measure is mean time to failure mttf which is the inherent availability this is the steady state availability when considering only the corrective maintenance downtime this classification excludes preventive maintenance downtime logistic delays supply delays diagnostics and administrative delays since such causes of delay can be minimized or eliminated an availability value that considers only the corrective downtime is the inherent property of the system the corrective downtime reflects the design excellence the efficiency and speed of the maintenance personnel as well as availability of an intervention vessel it also reflects characteristics that are important to the designers such as the complexity of intervention ease of disconnection recovery and repair maintainability for a single component the inherent availability can be computed by riac 2010 1 a i m t t f m t t f m t t r where mttf mean time to failure and mttr mean time to repair one should keep in mind that until steady state is reached the mttf calculation may be a function of time e g a system degrading over time due to of erosion corrosion thus the above formulation and databases should be used cautiously a subsea distribution system consists of a number of subsystems and can only facilitate subsea control if all subsystems are operational the failure of any one system results in loss of control this is the property of series dependent systems the overall availability of the scheme can be calculated by multiplying the availability of all subsystems in practice mttr is the most significant criterion for the maintainability maintainability is defined as the total time required for making the initial diagnosis recovery to the surface replacement and commissioning returning to service after testing for better maintainability the mttr must be as short as possible to minimize the downtime for handling of reliability and availability functions which are dependent and in series then the total availability a s y s t e m is calculated as 2 a s y s t e m a 1 a 2 a 3 e t c subsystems containing redundancy must be treated separately before they are combined in the above fashion with other subsystems with which they are in parallel redundant subsystems can be described as k out of m systems where m is the total number of redundant elements and k is the number of elements required to ensure that the subsystem functions i e is considered available in fact a series subsystem can be treated as a k out of n system in which k equals m for independent and identical units with an availability of a k m the k out of m availability is riac 2010 3 a k m i k m m i a i 1 a m i where m i m i m i alternatively a spreadsheet can be used for groups of identically behaving elements an equipment of the same design supplied by the same supplier failing at random the binomial distribution can be used as follows 4 a k m 1 binomdis k 1 m a true 5 case study fig 5 shows an artist impression of the functional architecture of the subsea distribution system for the case study this is one possible realisation of the functional architecture this configuration is one among seven forerunners options which were carried forward to the end of the select phase fig 6 shows details of the option used for this paper components of the option used in this case study are listed in table 1 and table 2 together with suitable labels for ease of reference the battery limits for the case study are from the bulk meg line and umbilical up to and including the christmas trees the availability model includes the effect of the trees and associated valves but excludes any down hole equipment or valves the modelling assumptions are instrumentation and any spurious trips they may initiate are ignored adequate spares are held such that there are no long lead order times system unavailability due to scheduled maintenance activities is not included in the assessment of system availability scheduled maintenance may be included in future analysis no account is taken of system unavailability due to adverse weather conditions affecting intervention activities vessel mobilisation times assume that vessels are readily available all choices are equally affected by vessels unavailability only two out of three wells connected to each manifold need to be producing for the system to be considered in an available state no critical failures for umbilicals are recorded in oreda so degraded failure mode used instead of critical this assumption should be revisited when the physical system is established item failures are detected immediately at which point the necessary intervention task is mobilised i e no lost time for the purposes of this illustration only those spares that can be brought online without the system becoming unavailable are counted in k out of m spares equal ageing is assumed for all components across the options through rigorous quality control age related failures will be designed out such that only random failures remain the reason for making these assumptions is that at the early phase of the design the system is not fully defined in order to progress with the design there is a need for clearly defined assumptions which can be refined at the later phases another reason for making these assumptions is to simplify the analysis all assumptions introduced in the analysis must be judged as acceptable and revisited at the detailed design phase obviously assumptions must be traceable and should cause only a small uncertainty in results an uncertainty analysis can be performed to gain insight into the importance of the uncertainties associated with any key assumptions flage and aven 2009 see the section on the monte carlo analysis data on failure rates repair times and intervention vessel mobilisation times for different components and systems have been collated from various sources including oreda 2009 mean recovery time data for peripheral items such as gaskets is based on author s engineering judgement the total recovery time is the sum of the following elements mobilisation transport removal and installation the values used are shown in table a1 in the appendix a the recovery time data shown in table a2 in appendix a oreda authors have collected the total time that similar components worked before failure and averaged using the number of components then by using such data from a large sample of components the lifetime of a component is predicted this life estimation is not based on any measured property of the individual component this approach is reasonable for mass produced electronic components subsea components are not mass produced but individually designed manufactured and tested hence their average failure rate is not very informative however as a first estimate using oreda is justifiable at the functional design phase when the actual components are known then structural mechanical reliability analysis can be performed using material properties and the working condition madsen et al 1986 however such analyses are expensive instead companies augment the publically available data by adding their own data to reflect their own experience bayesian statistics are used to combine data from various sources to model the reliability two pieces of information are needed to assure the correct description of the system these are a description of components and the relationship between them dsm is used yasseri 2013 for the visualisation of the system s components and the relationship between them dsm provides an alternative for the block diagram the system is broken down into its functional subsystems and letters a to l are used to label them table 1 and table 2 the distribution system is mapped using dsm see the left hand side of table 3 the off diagonal markers show the connectivity and dependencies between interfacing subsystems in this paper subsystems a b c f i and l are taken as black boxes their reliability data are taken from table 1 and recovery times are given in table 2 however d e g h j and k are broken down into their sub subsystems assemblies data required to construct dsm for the subsystems d e g h j and k and their sub subsystems multilayer dsm can be found in tabel 2 and tables b1 to b6 in appendix b additional reliability data has been added to the right hand side of the interface dsm and the reliabilities are calculated the content of the left hand side is about interface issues which are discussed in yasseri 2014 entries for columns of 1 4 the right hand side of table 3 for subsystems a b c f i and l are taken directly from table a1 and table a2 in appendix a the fifth column gives the reliability of a single subsystem equation 2 as follows

shows how many of them are needed for the system to be available finally the eights column contains the calculated availability of a k out of m system using equation 3 for example for the christmas tree label l 6 a v a l a i b i l i t y o f x t r e e l i k m m i a i 1 a m i i 4 6 6 i 0 99942 i 1 0 99942 6 i 6 4 2 0 99942 4 1 0 99942 6 4 6 5 1 0 99942 5 1 0 99942 6 5 6 4 2 0 99942 6 1 0 99942 6 6 1 00000 see table 3 for figure 0 99942 the availability of a single unit in column 5 across l when k m the system reduces to a series system for example there is two g subsystem which both of them will be in use then 7 99963 0 99963 0 99925 where 0 99925 is noted in column 8 and 99963 in column 6 of table 3 the availability of subsystems is built up from the key elements within them in accordance with their configurations to determine the availability of a single d e g h j and k content of column 5 of table 3 their constituent components sub subsystems are modelled explicitly the same process as above is used and data needed for this study are presented in tables b1 to b6 in appendix b and table 2 take subsystem g see fig 6 as an example description of the makeup of subsystem g is given in table 2 as well as how many of each sub subsystem are inserted and how many of them are used k and m italic note the redundancy of components within g subsystem table 2 also shows that two of g subsystem are inserted and both are needed fig 7 shows an exploded view of g note that each tubing in g has two connectors this information is also given in table 2 as well as in tables b1 to b6 in appendix b which can be used to decompose other subsystems components of g are listed in table b3 and their raw reliability data entries columns 2 to 4 are taken from tables a1 and entries in column 5 are taken from table a2 the contents of the fourth column are calculated using equation 2 the contents of the sixth column are calculated using equation 1 the seventh column shows the makeup of g the eight column shows the availability of the sub subsystems assemblies columns 9 and 10 give the number of each sus subsystem that are inserted and how many are needed at a given time the last column shows the availability of k out of m system using equation 3 the availability of a single g is noted at the foot of the table b3 and entered for g in column 5 in table 3 note that there are redundancies within each subsystem and the number of each subsystem inserted may be more than needed for example there are 6 of j k and l but 4 of them are adequate table 3 manifolds and christmas tree are not really part of the distribution system but they need power chemical and hydraulic fluid to function thus their inclusion is inevitable manifolds and x trees consist of many elements which make the size of dsm too large for a journal page in the context of this paper dsm of the manifold and x tree can be build layer by layer to a desirable level of detail six more configurations for the distribution system were examined for their availability it was found that the availability ranges from 0 982 to 0 992 for the chosen options assumptions made for these analyses affect all six configurations equally however changing the assumptions for any single configuration will cause a variation of the result for that configuration the main contributors to the system unavailability of the analysed case fig 9 are the manifolds which is 64 for all seven configurations the manifolds contributions to unavailability were 48 64 of the total figure in some configurations the umbilical termination was also a major contributor which shows the importance of the architecture limited sensitivity analysis has been performed the most critical assumption with respect to availability might be thought to be the number of christmas trees that need to be functional for the system to be available the upper part of table 2 presents the overall system availability for the three cases with the configuration of fig 8 and two cases that lack redundancy 2 out of 2 and 3 out of 3 the most critical assumption in terms of absolute results is likely to be the availability of intervention vessels the middle section of table 2 presents the system availability results for the three cases with the current vessel mobilisation and loadout times as well as all these times increased by a factor of two and then five engineering judgement was used to decide the failure rates for the umbilical hydraulic chemical steel core tubing stab plates and metal gaskets the effects of changing the judgment on the results i e increasing or decreasing these values by an order of magnitude are shown in the lower part of table 4 the sensitivity analyses show that there is not much more to gain by improving mttf the conclusion could be either the data has not enough resolution or more effort should be directed towards the design for a quick disconnect mechanism for faster recovery mttf of modern hardware is too large to measure for example mttf of the bulk meg line is 365 years table a1 verifying this requires many years of operation in contrast mttr varies from hours to days thus mttr is the better measure of overall availability of the system and a far better target of attention during the system design mttr can be improved by arranging for a modular design repair ability adequate tooling to facilitate quick retrieval and replacement this statement does not imply that mttf is unimportant and still requires the designer s attention 6 monte carlo simulation variability is identified in iso 20815 2008 as an element contributing to uncertainty the point estimators i e the mttf and mttr were used in section 5 are average values an alternative to point estimation of the availability is the monte carlo mc simulation technique zio et al 2006 2010 where uncertainty in equipment failures and repairs are modelled by probability distributions the interaction of large complex and multi layered systems can be graphically represented by dsm and the simulation can be performed by the monte carlo methods i e stochastic discrete event simulation hence quantifying the output of the entire system in a probabilistic format a unique probability distribution can be assumed and verified for each item of equipment thereby producing the probability distribution of failure and repair times etc the model uses a random number generator to sample from these distributions results from a reasonable number of runs generally in order of 20 000 provide a converged probability distribution of the system s response over its lifetime using dsm of table 3 and the probability distribution assumptions for equipment lifetime and restoration time monte carlo simulation estimates of system unavailability and uncertainty distributions were calculated the exponential distribution was used for all equipment failures over time a monte carlo simulation of 20 000 iterations gives results as shown in fig 9 this figure shows the calculated uncertainty distribution of the availability and the cumulative probability distribution of the availability it can be seen that the system availability is likely to be in the interval 92 5 98 5 the probability that the availability is below 92 5 is 2 5 the probability that the availability is exceeding 97 5 is also 2 5 thus the 95 interval is given by 92 5 97 5 this shape and boundary of this distribution depend on the type of failure probability distribution and their standard distribution comparing this result with the result obtained using the point estimate oreda data indicate that oreda data is rather optimistic for this reason some researchers proposed to use data based on 95 confidence limit sometimes a weibull distribution is used for all variable or some them the weibull distribution gives a slightly more optimistic estimate of the availability 7 discussion with the growing complexity of subsea production systems and increasing demand on the continuity of supply architectural level reliability analysis has become the focus of high reliability systems by considering how components are assembled housed for installation and how they can be retrieved for repair as well as explicitly accounting for the interactions between the components at their interfaces higher availability can be assured this paper presents a framework for the availability analysis at the early stages of a project when the system architecture is taking shape and describes how it can be used to examine the system behaviour right from the concept selection phase to the implementation deployment and finally to the operational phase the conventional fault tree analysis fta can be used to calculate the probability of failure e g wang et al 2016 an alternative to the ft approach would be to use failure modes and effect analysis fmea failure scenarios are systematically identified and are utilized to derive a fault tree set fts in which failures are prioritized based on severity from the perspective of the designer rausand and høyland 2004 severity analysis is provided for the top level and the most relevant fault categories are identified for the individual components fmeca can be used for improving the reliability of the system architecture however the database of failures must be screened for relevancy as all potential faults may not be quite relevant to a given case both fta and fmeca compliment the availability analysis the availability analysis fmeca and fta can be effective in the selection of high performance architecture if precautions are taken to ensure that all probable degradation mechanisms are identified and measures introduced such as condition monitoring to minimize their contribution to downtime the operating conditions environmental effect and maintenance strategy are the main factors that affect the availability of the subsea system where degradation influence cannot be monitored and controlled then the constant hazard rate model is not an adequate representation of likely reliability performance however it may still be used as the best estimate that can be achieved without introducing additional redundancy or other design changes a failure tolerant design may be an acceptable price to pay in order to have a higher availability for a high value field the availability target and its relationship to the revenue generation of the field must be defined in order to balance availability and the cost of achieving it the availability target flow from the project s business case i e the availability needed to fulfil contractual commitment the capital and operating cost of achieving the availability an alternative way of specifying availability is the allowable degraded state i e making the failed state capable of operation albeit at a reduced rate this approach requires the availability of individual components as well as the entire system the choice between the cost of high reliability components and redundancy needs to be made at the functional design stage i e high reliability components with low redundancy or high redundancy with low reliability components in situations where maintenance is not easy to perform or can only be done after a significant length of time redundancy may not greatly improve the overall reliability of equipment the result may only be more failed equipment the subsea industry pre installs spares whenever possible a failed equipment item is swapped over if the need arises 8 conclusions the proposed framework has been demonstrated by presenting and discussing a subsea distribution system seven options for the distribution system have been analysed and the predicted availability figures have been presented reliability analysis requires key assumptions relating to the model uncertainty the effect of internal flow on the system state of equipment environmental stressors the configuration of the system and so on as the system is developed more data and information become available thus the form and content of the assumptions may change one major source of error in ram analysis is the assumption of a constant failure rate consequently results obtained using this method are more useful when comparing two systems a methodology is presented to deal with availability assurance of subsea distribution systems at the functional design stage before the physical architecture has taken shape this approach belongs to the field of architectural level availability prediction which treats systems as a composition of functional components with the intention to develop fault tolerant architecture the concept of the ram model used here stems from rbd methods which this are arranged in dsm format that also shows their dependencies it is proposed to integrate the interface dsm yasseri 2014 and the conventional ram analysis for assessment of the availability of a subsea distribution system at the early stages of the design process when only the functional architecture has been decided by performing architectural level analysis at the functional design stage sensitive points of the architecture are identified with respect to availability the enriched dsm with reliability data summarizes the analysis results and provides hints for improvements it is also pointed out mttr is a better focus for attention for subsea production systems because mttf of the modern component is so high that directly measuring them is not easy and any claim for further enhancement cannot be validated on the other hand mttr can be directly measured making mttr claims independently verifiable lowering mttr can directly affect the revenue increasing mttf may reduce the frequency of failures but does not capture

23563,this paper presents a framework for the availability assessment of subsea distribution systems during the functional design selection phase this framework which also includes all interface elements can be started at an early stage when the definition of the system architecture is coarse and generic failure data is available and can be refined as more information becomes available then maintained as the system ages during the operational phase the main objective is to present a decision tool for selecting the subsea distribution system with the highest advantage in terms of availability at a very early stage of the design the design structure matrix dsm mapping method is used to represent the system s components and their dependencies which is then enriched with additional reliability data to calculate availability a case study of an actual subsea distribution system is used to demonstrate the approach keywords availability reliability subsea distribution

remotely operated vehicle scm subsea control module sdu subsea distribution unit x tree christmas tree 1 introduction downtime of high value subsea installations due to equipment failures and time needed for their subsequent retrieval repair and replacement can have a significant effect on revenue the problem is compounded for deep water subsea installations where all tasks must be handled remotely from a surface vessel reliability and availability assessments particularly during the concept selection phase can identify key systems configuration equipment and components that are likely to have a major impact on system availability iso 2394 and 20815 such study can also include accidental damage e g dropped object anchor dropping and dragging etc that can destroy part of the system a good architecture helps to avoid these hazards for subsea installations the difficulty of access makes the system architecture a primary factor that influences availability components are bundled together for ease of lifting and installation considering the limit on size and weight of bundles which can be installed using available crane barges balancing the number of offshore lifts and accessibility of components for ease of retrieval is the hallmark of a good architecture reliability is the probability that a system will operate properly for a specific period of time under specified operating conditions system maintainability is a measure of the ability of a system to be maintained to prevent a failure occurring in the future and the ability to restore the system when a failure occurs a system is not available if it is taken down for routine or preventative maintenance the consequence is similar to a system that has broken down maintainability is a derivative of the system reliability it is design dependent and is achieved by the highest level of availability mil hdbk 217f system reliability availability and maintainability ram studies at the early development stage can provide a baseline to compare alternative architectures at the concept selection phase yasseri 2014 when the functional architecture is being decided it is helpful to model the functional elements in terms of coarse grain building blocks the functional architecture is a high level abstraction which defines functional elements without reference to its physical implementation many methods have been proposed for the reliability analysis of systems the most commonly used methods are failure mode and effect assessment fmea riac 2010 fault tree diagram ftd riac 2010 reliability

1995 robert and laing 2002 studied the causes and frequency of failure by collecting data from field experience and accelerated testing brandt and eriksen 2001 showed how ram analysis can be used to quantify costs associated with subsea well interventions and subsea repairs brandt 2003 applied risk and reliability techniques in combination with verification and qualification procedures sunde 2003 proposed a guideline based on a computerized tool for the assessment of the reliability and cost of subsea process systems alhanati and trevisan 2012 investigated reliability gaps in an electrical submersible pump technology for deep water applications the first step in evaluating a system s reliability is to construct a graphical presentation of the system s components and their connectivity reliability wise this paper uses the design structure matrix dsm eppinger and browning 2012 for this purpose the interface dsm yasseri 2015 is enriched with reliability data concerning non graphic characteristics like k the number of components required for the system to be deemed available i e the k in k out of m systems nasa 2011 or nswc 11 2010 and the calculated reliability this model is carried forward to later stages of the development when the physical architecture has taken shape and component specific failure rate can be obtained or calculated the overall system availability is determined compositionally as a function of the reliability of its constituent components and their interactions the primary emphasis of the reliability of the subsea system is component based it is true that a reliable system must be composed of reliable components but it is possible to arrange reliable component into a subsea system for which retrieving of a failed component is time consuming thus leading to extensive downtime and hence to a poor availability subsea equipment is housed in a suitable size and weight structures for the transportation and the installation purposes equipment may be bundled with little attention in how they can be brought back to the surface for repair consequently there is a need for an approach that can consider the effect of system architecture on availability the motivation for the use of an architecture level quantitative assessment of availability includes the following developing techniques to analyse the reliability and performance of the system which is built from commercially available off the shelf cots components rather than bespoke design understanding how the system reliability performance depends on how its components are arranged configured and their interactions studying the sensitivity to reliabilities of components and interfaces in search of better interface designs and packing guiding the process of identifying critical components and interfaces developing techniques for quantitative analysis that are applicable throughout the system life cycle 2 system architecture the system architecture is an abstract model that defines the structure and behaviour of a system sillitto 2014 it defines the organization of the system s components their relationships to each other and to the environment it also provides a plan from which components can be procured and manufactured such that the developed system will work together to deliver the required overall function two levels of system architecture are defined namely the functional also known as logical architecture and the physical architecture functional architecture sometimes referred to as the conceptual design is an abstract view of the production system functional architecture defines a solution independent representation of the system composed of pure functions the depiction of components of a functional architecture represents abstractions of physical solutions at this stage what the component must do is quite clear but its physical properties weight size material etc are unknown until a decision made regarding which vendor would supply them this happens later in the project lifecycle physical components procured from two different vendors provide the same function but their details may be different hence their failure rate for example two subsea control modules scm developed by two suppliers will have many different physical characteristics but they will also share many common functional properties a component of a functional system thus defines functions properties and interfaces that are common to a range of physical design alternatives most importantly functional architecture remains largely independent of technology or suppliers and provides a reasonably stable baseline from which the physical architecture can be derived and manufactured a functional logical architecture is a design which includes all major components by naming their functions plus their relationships the upper part of fig 1 shows that a system to deliver a function consists of many sub functions at this level only the function of each equipment flow communications connections and dependencies are identified each component is shown as a black box whose function is described but not its physical properties the intention is to ensure that all components and functionality of a subsea system are accounted and well understood functional architecture does not include vendors names or equipment properties weight size geometry transportation install ability etc as the design progresses and one of the many possible functional architecture options is chosen to be taken forward for detailing then the physical architecture gradually emerges the lower part of fig 1 the lower part of fig 1 is a mirror image of the upper part and there is a one to one relationship between the functional components and their physical counterpart when vendors are selected then gradually the physical system takes shape as the design of components starts their dimensions become available and the system configuration can be refined this process starts at the select phase yasseri 2014 perfected in the detail design and maintained as the project lifecycle management requires at the detail design phase few iterations are required until a satisfactory physical architecture is obtained the physical architecture has all major components and entities identified within a specific physical dimension vendor locations etc or possible solutions it also includes all known details such as how they operate vendor s operating instructions configuration materials and means of communication control all physical constraints or limitations are also identified e g fluid flow requirements size and availability of installation barges and physical solution for interfaces are decided in fact a physical architecture is one possible realisation of the functional architecture if the available installation barge is smaller than desired then the physical system is broken down further or reduced in size to fit the available crane capacity limitation of what can be transported and installed is a primary factor in determining the geometry and the system configuration after the select phase the functional design will remain relatively static but the physical resources will change throughout the lifecycle the physical implementation is ultimately based on the available technology and as such changes dynamically physical architecture evolves over time and can change by the introduction of new capabilities or by new technologies hardware software upgrade cycles or the need to replace obsolete equipment or acquiring from a different supplier thus functional architecture is a scheme through which each function of a system is allocated to a physical component fig 1 the physical architecture also takes into consideration constraints such as size geometric compatibility and configuration as well as the arrangement and spatial layout of a particular distribution concept e g should a subsea distribution unit sdu be located inside or outside of the manifold fig 2 shows an example of the functional architecture of a subsea field tied back to an onshore terminal architectural decisions directly affect aspects of system dependability identifying and eliminating or mitigating architectural problems during the selection phase helps to enhance dependability to achieve this goal reliability and other quality attributes must be built into the subsea system during the development stage starting with the functional architecture this paper investigates the availability of a subsea distribution system at its functional architectural level when only generic data is available later when the design has progressed physical components can be characterised by actual supplier reliability data or by structural mechanical reliability methods 3 domain mapping dsm is a visual tool browning 2013 that represents the relationships and dependencies between components of a system browning 2016 the component based dsm eppinger and browning 2012 which is used in this paper comprises a list of components in some desirable order whereby upstream components are listed in the upper row fig 3 shows a directed graph network and its representation using dsm is shown in fig 4 the network fig 3 is the functional block diagram which gives a view of the system s functions and how they must interface to achieve the overall function the components are shown as rows and columns in the matrix where the components are listed in the same order along both axes an off diagonal mark located within the matrix denotes a coupling between two components fig 4 shows that components a and f do not require input from the other components but b c d e i g h and i receive input the component interactions are represented by x marks in the off diagonal cells the marked cells indicate dependencies between components reading down a column indicates that a component provides input to others in its associated row on the other hand a component in the row receives input from the component in the corresponding column when reading across a row in the matrix a number can be used instead of x to represent some interface quantity for example risk or and the volatility of the interface see yasseri 2014 since network shown in fig 3 is a directed graph its dsm shown in fig 4 shows is an asymmetrical matrix this paper for simplicity assumes at the highest level of system hierarchy all dependencies are two way thus leading to the symmetrical matrix presenting every component of a subsea system in a single matrix obscures its visual usefulness a subsea system can be organised into a hierarchical structure e g subsystem subsystems and assemblies components such hierarchical representation avoids problems related to presenting extremely large matrices by shifting the focus to various levels in the hierarchy at a time which enables the analysis of a system at different levels of details in general the dsm analysis only looks at relationships across components at the same level and not within components the next level below 4 availability assessment the cost of accessing subsea equipment for repair and maintenance is a primary decision factor there are many components and interfaces on a subsea distribution system that can fail due to a variety of reasons for example intrinsic factors e g corrosion joint failure water ingress hydraulic coupling leak weld failure electrical connection failure sensor failure solenoid valve failure power supply failure solenoid failure driver microprocessor failure etc extrinsic factors e g wax or hydrate blocking a sensor port dropped object umbilical dragged by anchor chain or trawl board etc degradation such as caused by fatigue creep or stress corrosion can have a strong influence on failure probability cumulative damage in a highly stressed component can also cause failure so will a single overload a number of reliability methods for structural and mechanical components known as structural reliability methods have been developed among them first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm madsen et al 1986 known as capacity demand models are the easiest to apply and are in fact considered as the work horse of reliability based code development essentially these methods relate failure probability to the effect of the interaction between loading demand by loads and strength capacity or resistance distributions when these distributions are well separated with little interference as they are with new and well engineered equipment the safety margin will be sufficiently large and the failure distribution will tend towards the constant hazard rate model in this case the system failure probability can be computed as a function of the hazard rates for all the components in the system for highly stressed equipment operating in a corrosive environment or subjected to fast transients the load and strength distributions may have a significant overlap and interference would grow as the strength of components degrade over time the probability of failure in this case may depend on the resistance of just a few components to the excursions of applied loads relating component reliabilities to stressors remains the aim but except for structures the structural reliability methods have not been applied to other subsea components in a meaningful way the lack of comprehensive strength degradation data loading and complex geometries can be the primary constraints for applying structural reliability methods the assumption of constant hazard and repair rates are frequently used for availability and reliability assessment of subsea production systems sps which is the best that can be done e g see choi and chang 2016 this paper follows the same tradition as nothing better than failure databases are available during the concept selection phase subsea production systems sps tend to have a relatively simple configuration from the reliability viewpoint they often consist of systems in series possibly with standby units that can therefore be modelled as a series parallel configuration availability assessments usually occur at a subsystem level i e x tree manifold etc and not at a component level e g valves since at the functional design stage detailed information is not available data in databases are averaged and only one bad set of data could bring the average down thus making more of current installations above the average secondly the averaging also masks the effect of extreme conditions operational environmental and maintenance conditions can affect the validity of generic reliability data an evaluation of uncertainties in the basic data is prudent for ensuring that predictions based on the assumption of constant hazard rates are acceptable component reliability calculations require the use of established databases to obtain the failure rate λ these databases are comprehensive for electronic components but far less so for mechanical and hydraulic components possibly making the calculated reliability as an upper bound estimate a more useful measure is mean time to failure mttf which is the inherent availability this is the steady state availability when considering only the corrective maintenance downtime this classification excludes preventive maintenance downtime logistic delays supply delays diagnostics and administrative delays since such causes of delay can be minimized or eliminated an availability value that considers only the corrective downtime is the inherent property of the system the corrective downtime reflects the design excellence the efficiency and speed of the maintenance personnel as well as availability of an intervention vessel it also reflects characteristics that are important to the designers such as the complexity of intervention ease of disconnection recovery and repair maintainability for a single component the inherent availability can be computed by riac 2010 1 a i m t t f m t t f m t t r where mttf mean time to failure and mttr mean time to repair one should keep in mind that until steady state is reached the mttf calculation may be a function of time e g a system degrading over time due to of erosion corrosion thus the above formulation and databases should be used cautiously a subsea distribution system consists of a number of subsystems and can only facilitate subsea control if all subsystems are operational the failure of any one system results in loss of control this is the property of series dependent systems the overall availability of the scheme can be calculated by multiplying the availability of all subsystems in practice mttr is the most significant criterion for the maintainability maintainability is defined as the total time required for making the initial diagnosis recovery to the surface replacement and commissioning returning to service after testing for better maintainability the mttr must be as short as possible to minimize the downtime for handling of reliability and availability functions which are dependent and in series then the total

subsystems with which they are in parallel redundant subsystems can be described as k out of m systems where m is the total number of redundant elements and k is the number of elements required to

impression of the functional architecture of the subsea distribution system for the case study this is one possible realisation of the functional architecture this configuration is one among seven forerunners options which were carried forward to the end of the select phase fig 6 shows details of the option used for this paper components of the option used in this case study are listed in table 1 and table 2 together with suitable labels for ease of reference the battery limits for the case study are from the bulk meg line and umbilical up to and including the christmas trees the availability model includes the effect of the trees and associated valves but excludes any down hole equipment or valves the modelling assumptions are instrumentation and any spurious trips they may initiate are ignored adequate spares are held such that there are no long lead order times system unavailability due to scheduled maintenance activities is not included in the assessment of system availability scheduled maintenance may be included in future analysis no account is taken of system unavailability due to adverse weather conditions affecting intervention activities vessel mobilisation times assume that vessels are readily available all choices are equally affected by vessels unavailability only two out of three wells connected to each manifold need to be producing for the system to be considered in an available state no critical failures for umbilicals are recorded in oreda so degraded failure mode used instead of critical this assumption should be revisited when the physical system is established item failures are detected immediately at which point the necessary intervention task is mobilised i e no lost time for the purposes of this illustration only those spares that can be brought online without the system becoming unavailable are counted in k out of m spares equal ageing is assumed for all components across the options through rigorous quality control age related failures will be designed out such that only random failures remain the reason for making these assumptions is that at the early phase of the design the system is not fully defined in order to progress with the design there is a need for clearly defined assumptions which can be refined at the later phases another reason for making these assumptions is to simplify the analysis all assumptions introduced in the analysis must be judged as acceptable and revisited at the detailed design phase obviously assumptions must be traceable and should cause only a small uncertainty in results an uncertainty analysis can be performed to gain insight into the importance of the uncertainties associated with any key assumptions flage and aven 2009 see the section on the monte carlo analysis data on failure rates repair times and intervention vessel mobilisation times for different components and systems have been collated from various sources including oreda 2009 mean recovery time data for peripheral items such as gaskets is based on author s engineering judgement the total recovery time is the sum of the following elements mobilisation transport removal and installation the values used are shown in table a1 in the appendix a the recovery time data shown in table a2 in appendix a oreda authors have collected the total time that similar components worked before failure and averaged using the number of components then by using such data from a large sample of components the lifetime of a component is predicted this life estimation is not based on any measured property of the individual component this approach is reasonable for mass produced electronic components subsea components are not mass produced but individually designed manufactured and tested hence their average failure rate is not very informative however as a first estimate using oreda is justifiable at the functional design phase when the actual components are known then structural mechanical reliability analysis can be performed using material properties and the working condition madsen et al 1986 however such analyses are expensive instead companies augment the publically available data by adding their own data to reflect their own experience bayesian statistics are used to combine data from various sources to model the reliability two pieces of information are needed to assure the correct description of the system these are a description of components and the relationship between them dsm is used yasseri 2013 for the visualisation of the system s components and the relationship between them dsm provides an alternative for the block diagram the system is broken down into its functional subsystems and letters a to l are used to label them table 1 and table 2 the distribution system is mapped using dsm see the left hand side of table 3 the off diagonal markers show the connectivity and dependencies between interfacing subsystems in this paper subsystems a b c f i and l are taken as black boxes their reliability data are taken from table 1 and recovery times are given in table 2 however d e g h j and k are broken down into their sub subsystems assemblies data required to construct dsm for the subsystems d e g h j and k and their sub subsystems multilayer dsm can be found in tabel 2 and tables b1 to b6 in appendix b additional reliability data has been added to the right hand side of the interface dsm and the reliabilities are calculated the content of the left hand side is about interface issues which are discussed in yasseri 2014 entries for columns of 1 4 the right hand side of table 3 for subsystems a b c f i and l are taken directly from table a1 and table a2 in appendix a the fifth column gives the reliability of a single subsystem equation 2 as follows

shows how many of them are needed for the system to be available finally the eights column contains the calculated availability of a k out of m system using equation 3 for example for the christmas tree label l 6 a v a l a i b i l i t y o f x t r e e l i k m m i a i 1 a m i i 4 6 6 i 0 99942 i 1 0 99942 6 i 6 4 2 0 99942 4 1 0 99942 6 4 6 5 1 0 99942 5 1 0 99942 6 5 6 4 2 0 99942 6 1 0 99942 6 6 1 00000 see table 3 for figure 0 99942 the availability of a single unit in column 5 across l when k m the system reduces to a series system for example there is two g subsystem which both of them will be in use then 7 99963 0 99963 0 99925 where 0 99925 is noted in column 8 and 99963 in column 6 of table 3 the availability of subsystems is built up from the key elements within them in accordance with their configurations to determine the availability of a single d e g h j and k content of column 5 of table 3 their constituent components sub subsystems are modelled explicitly the same process as above is used and data needed for this study are presented in tables b1 to b6 in appendix b and table 2 take subsystem g see fig 6 as an example description of the makeup of subsystem g is given in table 2 as well as how many of each sub subsystem are inserted and how many of them are used k and m italic note the redundancy of components within g subsystem table 2 also shows that two of g subsystem are inserted and both are needed fig 7 shows an exploded view of g note that each tubing in g has two connectors this information is also given in table 2 as well as in tables b1 to b6 in appendix b which can be used to decompose other subsystems components of g are listed in table b3 and their raw reliability data entries columns 2 to 4 are taken from tables a1 and entries in column 5 are taken from table a2 the contents of the fourth column are calculated using equation 2 the contents of the sixth column are calculated using equation 1 the seventh column shows the makeup of g the eight column shows the availability of the sub subsystems assemblies columns 9 and 10 give the number of each sus subsystem that are inserted and how many are needed at a given time the last column shows the availability of k out of m system using equation 3 the availability of a single g is noted at the foot of the table b3 and entered for g in column 5 in table 3 note that there are redundancies within each subsystem and the number of each subsystem inserted may be more than needed for example there are 6 of j k and l but 4 of them are adequate table 3 manifolds and christmas tree are not really part of the distribution system but they need power chemical and hydraulic fluid to function thus their inclusion is inevitable manifolds and x trees consist of many elements which make the size of dsm too large for a journal page in the context of this paper dsm of the manifold and x tree can be build layer by layer to a desirable level of detail six more configurations for the distribution system were examined for their availability it was found that the availability ranges from 0 982 to 0 992 for the chosen options assumptions made for these analyses affect all six configurations equally however changing the assumptions for any single configuration will cause a variation of the result for that configuration the main contributors to the system unavailability of the analysed case fig 9 are the manifolds which is 64 for all seven configurations the manifolds contributions to unavailability were 48 64 of the total figure in some configurations the umbilical termination was also a major contributor which shows the importance of the architecture limited sensitivity analysis has been performed the most critical assumption with respect to availability might be thought to be the number of christmas trees that need to be functional for the system to be available the upper part of table 2 presents the overall system availability for the three cases with the configuration of fig 8 and two cases that lack redundancy 2 out of 2 and 3 out of 3 the most critical assumption in terms of absolute results is likely to be the availability of intervention vessels the middle section of table 2 presents the system availability results for the three cases with the current vessel mobilisation and loadout times as well as all these times increased by a factor of two and then five engineering judgement was used to decide the failure rates for the umbilical hydraulic chemical steel core tubing stab plates and metal gaskets the effects of changing the judgment on the results i e increasing or decreasing these values by an order of magnitude are shown in the lower part of table 4 the sensitivity analyses show that there is not much more to gain by improving mttf the conclusion could be either the data has not enough resolution or more effort should be directed towards the design for a quick disconnect mechanism for faster recovery mttf of modern hardware is too large to measure for example mttf of the bulk meg line is 365 years table a1 verifying this requires many years of operation in contrast mttr varies from hours to days thus mttr is the better measure of overall availability of the system and a far better target of attention during the system design mttr can be improved by arranging for a modular design repair ability adequate tooling to facilitate quick retrieval and replacement this statement does not imply that mttf is unimportant and still requires the designer s attention 6 monte carlo simulation variability is identified in iso 20815 2008 as an element contributing to uncertainty the point estimators i e the mttf and mttr were used in section 5 are average values an alternative to point estimation of the availability is the monte carlo mc simulation technique zio et al 2006 2010 where uncertainty in equipment failures and repairs are modelled by probability distributions the interaction of large complex and multi layered systems can be graphically represented by dsm and the simulation can be performed by the monte carlo methods i e stochastic discrete event simulation hence quantifying the output of the entire system in a probabilistic format a unique probability distribution can be assumed and verified for each item of equipment thereby producing the probability distribution of failure and repair times etc the model uses a random number generator to sample from these distributions results from a reasonable number of runs generally in order of 20 000 provide a converged probability distribution of the system s response over its lifetime using dsm of table 3 and the probability distribution assumptions for equipment lifetime and restoration time monte carlo simulation estimates of system unavailability and uncertainty distributions were calculated the exponential distribution was used for all equipment failures over time a monte carlo simulation of 20 000 iterations gives results as shown in fig 9 this figure shows the calculated uncertainty distribution of the availability and the cumulative probability distribution of the availability it can be seen that the system availability is likely to be in the interval 92 5 98 5 the probability that the availability is below 92 5 is 2 5 the probability that the availability is exceeding 97 5 is also 2 5 thus the 95 interval is given by 92 5 97 5 this shape and boundary of this distribution depend on the type of failure probability distribution and their standard distribution comparing this result with the result obtained using the point estimate oreda data indicate that oreda data is rather optimistic for this reason some researchers proposed to use data based on 95 confidence limit sometimes a weibull distribution is used for all variable or some them the weibull distribution gives a slightly more optimistic estimate of the availability 7 discussion with the growing complexity of subsea production systems and increasing demand on the continuity of supply architectural level reliability analysis has become the focus of high reliability systems by considering how components are assembled housed for installation and how they can be retrieved for repair as well as explicitly accounting for the interactions between the components at their interfaces higher availability can be assured this paper presents a framework for the availability analysis at the early stages of a project when the system architecture is taking shape and describes how it can be used to examine the system behaviour right from the concept selection phase to the implementation deployment and finally to the operational phase the conventional fault tree analysis fta can be used to calculate the probability of failure e g wang et al 2016 an alternative to the ft approach would be to use failure modes and effect analysis fmea failure scenarios are systematically identified and are utilized to derive a fault tree set fts in which failures are prioritized based on severity from the perspective of the designer rausand and høyland 2004 severity analysis is provided for the top level and the most relevant fault categories are identified for the individual components fmeca can be used for improving the reliability of the system architecture however the database of failures must be screened for relevancy as all potential faults may not be quite relevant to a given case both fta and fmeca compliment the availability analysis the availability analysis fmeca and fta can be effective in the selection of high performance architecture if precautions are taken to ensure that all probable degradation mechanisms are identified and measures introduced such as condition monitoring to minimize their contribution to downtime the operating conditions environmental effect and maintenance strategy are the main factors that affect the availability of the subsea system where degradation influence cannot be monitored and controlled then the constant hazard rate model is not an adequate representation of likely reliability performance however it may still be used as the best estimate that can be achieved without introducing additional redundancy or other design changes a failure tolerant design may be an acceptable price to pay in order to have a higher availability for a high value field the availability target and its relationship to the revenue generation of the field must be defined in order to balance availability and the cost of achieving it the availability target flow from the project s business case i e the availability needed to fulfil contractual commitment the capital and operating cost of achieving the availability an alternative way of specifying availability is the allowable degraded state i e making the failed state capable of operation albeit at a reduced rate this approach requires the availability of individual components as well as the entire system the choice between the cost of high reliability components and redundancy needs to be made at the functional design stage i e high reliability components with low redundancy or high redundancy with low reliability components in situations where maintenance is not easy to perform or can only be done after a significant length of time redundancy may not greatly improve the overall reliability of equipment the result may only be more failed equipment the subsea industry pre installs spares whenever possible a failed equipment item is swapped over if the need arises 8 conclusions the proposed framework has been demonstrated by presenting and discussing a subsea distribution system seven options for the distribution system have been analysed and the predicted availability figures have been presented reliability analysis requires key assumptions relating to the model uncertainty the effect of internal flow on the system state of equipment environmental stressors the configuration of the system and so on as the system is developed more data and information become available thus the form and content of the assumptions may change one major source of error in ram analysis is the assumption of a constant failure rate consequently results obtained using this method are more useful when comparing two systems a methodology is presented to deal with availability assurance of subsea distribution systems at the functional design stage before the physical architecture has taken shape this approach belongs to the field of architectural level availability prediction which treats systems as a composition of functional components with the intention to develop fault tolerant architecture the concept of the ram model used here stems from rbd methods which this are arranged in dsm format that also shows their dependencies it is proposed to integrate the interface dsm yasseri 2014 and the conventional ram analysis for assessment of the availability of a subsea distribution system at the early stages of the design process when only the functional architecture has been decided by performing architectural level analysis at the functional design stage sensitive points of the architecture are identified with respect to availability the enriched dsm with reliability data summarizes the analysis results and provides hints for improvements it is also pointed out mttr is a better focus for attention for subsea production systems because mttf of the modern component is so high that directly measuring them is not easy and any claim for further enhancement cannot be validated on the other hand mttr can be directly measured making mttr claims independently verifiable lowering mttr can directly affect the revenue increasing mttf may reduce the frequency of failures but does not capture the impact of a particular downtime on the cost acknowledgments the author would like to thank mr andy ridpath for his input for the case study the many helpful comments of mr chris millyard are also

23564,this paper reviews the dynamics and vibration control techniques for marine riser systems the riser pipes are modeled as euler bernoulli beams that vibrate under the effects of ocean loads and the movements of the surface vessel resulting in hybrid ode pde equations chronological development of such hybrid models is first discussed and their approximated ode models for simulation are examined theoretical and experimental techniques for instability and fatigue analyses on the riser systems are also summarized to increase the fatigue life against ocean currents passive vibration suppression devices e g strakes and spoilers were mounted on the surface of the riser whereas to tackle the instability problem caused by sea waves active control techniques utilizing the movements of the vessel were employed in conclusions as future riser technologies seven research issues are identified keywords marine riser modeling vibration control vortex induced vibrations fatigue subsea production systems oil and gas 1 introduction a marine riser an essential component of subsea oil gas production systems acts as a conductor pipe between an offshore platform floating in an ocean i e a storage platform or a vessel and a well on the seabed chakrabarti and frampton 1982 as shown in fig 1 the riser is connected to the well through the blowout preventer bop valve that prevents leakages of the fluid transported through the riser the riser system is exposed to harsh environmental loads like ocean currents and waves the currents act along the length of the riser whereas the waves inflict the movements of the vessel a severe current and a large movement of the vessel can result in a large deflection of the riser which causes a disconnection of the riser from the bop valve or a failure due to fatigue in the riser system in the past fifty years to ensure the safety and to enhance the productivity of riser systems several investigations on the dynamics analyses and vibration controls of various riser systems have been reported in the literature the main objective of this paper is to review the works on the dynamics and control of the riser itself comprehensively under the influence of ocean currents and waves the issues of laying and reentry of the riser and its contact with the seabed are important elosta et al 2016 jensen et al 2009a 2010 wang et al 2016 however those will not be touched due to page limitation at the end of the review future research directions to improve riser technologies will be identified this paper intends to portray a comprehensive picture on the evolution of mathematical modeling analyses and the vibration control strategies applicable to riser systems to the present state of the art riser systems can be classified into production and drilling risers from the operational view point a production riser transports oil gas from the seabed to the vessel a drilling riser provides a pathway for drilling and transports drilling mud chakrabarti 2005 he et al 2014 risers can be further classified into flexible or rigid according to the material used in their construction a rigid or straight top tensioned riser is usually utilized for shallow water operations whereas a flexible or steel catenary riser is typically used for deep ocean operations i e 2000 m mekha 2001 meng and zhu 2015 when a riser moves in the presence of currents vortices are shed along its surface resulting in the formation of an unstable wake region around it vortex shedding takes place at different frequencies and amplitudes thus effecting different vortex patterns according to xu et al 2009 the formation of different patterns of vortices depends upon the reynolds number re of the incident flow fig 2 shows three different patterns of the vortices i e 2s 2p and p s shed by the structure of the riser upon its interaction with the incident flow the 2s pattern is a combination of two single vortices shed in opposite directions relative to each other during one cycle i e von karman vortex shedding the 2p pattern represents two pairs of vortices shed in one cycle in which each pair consists of vortices in opposite direction relative to each other and the p s pattern denotes the asymmetric combination of a pair of vortices with a separate single vortex during each cycle williamson and govardhan 2004 vortices inflict a periodically varying transverse force on the riser i e perpendicular to the direction of the flow resulting in periodic transverse vibrations known as the vortex induced vibrations vivs wu et al 2012b according to modarres sadeghi et al 2011 the vortex induced response of a riser is a complex phenomenon and continuously shifts between a stationary state and a chaotic state also when the frequency of the vortices i e the vortex shedding frequency is close to one of the natural frequencies of the riser the so called lock in phenomenon occurs whereby the riser manifests large vibrations xue et al 2008 noted that the riser can experience either single or multi mode i e excitation of multiple modes lock in responses for more details interested readers can refer to the papers on the topic of viv sarpkaya 1979 vandiver et al 2009 risers ought to confront continuous loads jeans et al 2003 which are the main cause of fatigue damage collette 2011 collette and incecik 2006 elosta et al 2014 hodapp et al 2015 jensen 1990 2015 marsh et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 zhu and collette 2017 fatigue the main concern reflecting the structural integrity of a riser is caused by both the inline i e in the direction of a flow and the transverse i e perpendicular to the direction of the flow forces xue et al 2014 early works ignored the contribution of the inline forces to fatigue damage however later investigations revealed that the fatigue causing effects of the inline forces and the transverse forces are equally important lie and kaasen 2006 trim et al 2005 according to baarholm et al 2006 the contribution of the inline forces to fatigue damage is particularly evident for the lower modes of vibration i e the first and second modes whereas that of the transverse forces is clear at the higher modes several subsequent investigations iranpour et al 2008 song et al 2011 were concurrent with those results more recent findings of gao et al 2011 and zhang and tang 2015 have reported that the maximum fatigue damage usually incurs at the boundary ends of the riser along with the damage induced by the currents the one resulting from the movements of the vessel is also a concern with regard to the integration and safety of the riser and the production system according to kuiper et al 2008 the heave i e vertical motion of the vessel can result in i instability caused by the periodic variation of the tension at the top portion of the riser and ii a local dynamic buckling of the riser the latter can be potentially resulted from the occurrence of high bending stresses that can exceed the yield stress of the riser vessel movements will also change the contact angles at the top and bottom ends of the riser with the vessel and the bop of the well respectively according to nguyen et al 2010 if the end angles increase beyond a specific threshold usually 2 the connection between the riser and the bop can be broken the control problem of a riser system is mainly concerned with the suppression of its vibrations caused by the currents and the movements of the vessel caused by the waves the two main control objectives accordingly are the prevention of both the fatigue and instability of the riser in a deep sea the damage caused by the movements of the vessel is significantly less than that caused by the currents as they act over the entire submerged length of the riser trim et al 2005 at a shallow depth however the instability of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel is the main concern perunovic and jensen 2003 the heave motion of a vessel is normally suppressed by mooring the ship to the seabed see the mooring lines in fig 1 which is a passive method rotations such as pitch and yaw meanwhile are more effectively suppressed by active control strategies utilizing thrusters to maintain the desired vessel orientation how et al 2009 regarding fatigue prevention one strategy is to design the riser with a large safety factor leira et al 2005 performed reliability analyses to investigate the effects of different safety factors for controlling fatigue damage of the risers for large depths in relation to the suppression of the vivs passive devices such as spoilers abbassian and moros 1996 and strakes gao et al 2015a can be mounted on the surface of the riser to extend its fatigue life active methods for suppressing the vivs include the proportional integral control rustad et al 2008 proportional integral derivative control jensen et al 2009b optimal control mazzilli and sanches 2011 boundary control choi et al 2004 he et al 2017 kim

of the riser at position x and time t as indicated the bottom and top ends of the riser are pin jointed to the bop on the seabed and to the surface vessel respectively where ϕ t and θ t are the bottom and top angles of the riser respectively the vessel is considered to undergo three motions heave surge and pitch i e movements in the vertical i ˆ j ˆ plane which are mainly caused by the waves and the wind to restrict such movements the vessel can be moored to the seabed as depicted in fig 1 ocean currents meanwhile which are shown to act along the length of the riser are the main cause of the vivs in the riser in the following subsections various mathematical formulations describing the responses of the riser to different hydrodynamic forces are reviewed for consistency and ease of comparison the symbols appearing in the literature have been unified also the derivatives with respect to t and x are denoted by and respectively 2 1 lateral vibrations huang and dareing 1968 is recognized as the first work in the derivation of the equations of motion of the riser system for analyzing the lateral dynamics i e the motions only in the i ˆ j ˆ plane in which the sea current flows of a flexible drilling riser the following partial differential equation pde was developed 1 e i u x t m r m i g x f v u x t m r m i g u x t m u x t 0 where m r and m i denote the masses per

drilling fluid and the external fluid moving with the pipe and f v is the vertical thrust force acting at the bottom of the riser due to drilling in eq 1 the effects of the ocean currents and waves on the dynamics of the riser were not considered however it certainly leads to a more detailed formulation on the interaction between the riser and the surrounding fluid the inline hydrodynamic force f i x t acting along the j ˆ axis is modeled by the following nonlinear morison equation morison et al 1950 2 f i x t f m x t f d x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x v y x t u x t v y x t u x t where f m x t and f d x t represent the inertial and the drag forces respectively ρ w denotes the density of the water v y x t signifies the horizontal water particle velocity c m is the inertial coefficient and c d stands for the drag coefficient in young et al 1978 the following equation was developed to analyze the lateral vibrations of the riser under the effects of the inline hydrodynamic force f i 3 e i u x t t x γ i a i γ o a o u x t t x p o a o p i a i u x t m u x t f i x t where t denotes the actual riser tension a represents the area of the riser γ stands for the specific weight and p is the fluid pressure and the subscripts i and o signify the properties of the quantities considered inside and outside of the riser respectively in eq 3 a simplified form of the drag force in eq 2 was alternatively proposed assuming that the drag force is caused by a constant velocity of the current v then the drag force is obtained in the following form 4 f d 1 2 ρ w d c d v v later sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 replaced the quadratic term i e v y u v y u of the drag force in eq 2 with a linear expression involving the root mean square value of the relative velocity between the riser and the incident current σ v resulting in the following linear formulation 5 f d x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v v y x t u x t chakrabarti and frampton 1982 derived the following equation of motion of the riser considering the fact that the hydrodynamic forces act along both the horizontal and the vertical axes 6 e i u x t t e x u x t t e x u x t m u x t f i x t

component of the hydrodynamic force caused by the currents and the internal fluid recently fan et al 2017 has developed a new formulation to calculate the effective tension te of a free hanging riser i e when the bottom end of the riser is not connected to the seabed which is given as follows 9 t e x w b o p w s ρ w a o ρ i a i g l x where w bop denotes the weight of the bop valve w s represents the submerged weight per unit length of the riser ρ i signifies the density of the fluid flowing inside the riser and g is the gravitational acceleration later niedzwecki and liagre 2003 in consideration of both linear i e viscous and nonlinear i e due to drag fluid damping have derived the following equation of motion of the riser for the lateral deflection i e along the j ˆ axis 10 e i u x t t e x u x t m u x t c x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v u x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v v y x t where c denotes the linear viscous damping coefficient 2 2 vortex induced vibrations for analyzing the transverse vibrations or vivs of the riser the transverse force f t acting along the k ˆ axis has to be included in the forcing function chakrabarti and frampton 1982 initially modeled the transverse force as 11 f t x t 1 2 ρ w d c l x t v y x t u x t 2 where c l denotes the lift coefficient the transverse force is a consequence of the vortex shedding phenomenon therefore to incorporate the oscillating effect due to vortex shedding of the transverse force faltinsen 1990 proposed the following equation 12 f t x t 1 2 ρ w d c l x t v y x t 2 cos 2 π f v t φ z where φ z is the phase angle along the k ˆ axis and f v is the vortex shedding frequency represented by the following equation 13 f v st v y x t d where st is the strouhal number furnes 2000 investigated the vivs of the riser subject to the transverse force by using the following pde 14 e i w x t t e x w x t t e x w x t c w x t m w x t f t x t in sagatun et al 2002 the pde used to investigate the vivs of the riser also included the term c r v w x t to consider the damping effects due to the relative velocity between the riser and the current 15 e i w x t t e x w x t t e x w x t c w x t c r v w x t m w x t f t x t where c r denotes the linear damping parameter associated with the dissipation of energy due to the relative velocity between the riser and the water 2 2 1 wake oscillator model another way to investigate the vivs of the riser is to consider two coupled differential equations that model the dynamics of the riser and the wake separately to model the vivs of a riser facchinetti et al 2004 utilized the following single degree of freedom spring mass damper equation considering an elastically mounted rigid cylinder under the influence of wakes 16 m w t c w t k w t f t t where k is the stiffness of the riser the equation describing the wake dynamics was given as follows 17 q t η ω v q t 2 1 q t ω v 2 q t β w t where η is the van der pol parameter ω v 2πstv d is the strouhal circular frequency q t is the local fluctuating lift coefficient and β is the linear coupling coefficient in eq 17 q t 2c l t c l0 where c l0 0 3 is a constant lift coefficient η ω v q t 2 1 q t is the viscous damping term and β w t is the acceleration coupling term for modeling the effect of the riser structure on the fluid in the wake region in earlier models le cunff et al 2002 sarpkaya 1979 a velocity coupling term β w t was considered instead of β w t the coupling between the structure and the wake has been established by modeling the transverse force as f t t 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c l 0 2 q t xu et al 2008 eqs 16 and 17 are collectively known as the wake oscillator model keber and wiercigroch 2008 li et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishi and doan 2015 xue et al 2011 violette et al 2007 proposed a distributed wake oscillator model in which the dynamics of the wake and the riser respectively were accounted for by the following pdes 18 w x t χ ω f r m w x t λ 2 w x t κ 2 w x t ω f 2 m q x t 19 q x t η ω f q x t 2 1 q x t ω f 2 q x t β w x t where χ c d 4πst is the stall coefficient ω f ω v ω ref is the non dimensional shedding frequency where ω ref 2πstv ref d is the strouhal

stiffness and m c l0 2 8π2st2 r m is a coefficient of the forcing term acting on the structure due to the wake dynamics distributed wake dynamics model eq 19 was later utilized by meng and chen 2012 and srinil et al 2009 to model the unsteady hydrodynamic forces for the analysis of the vibrational behavior of a catenary riser in the 3d space also to incorporate the cellular vortex shedding feature caused by a sheared flow in the wake dynamics equation srinil 2011 added the diffusion term τ q to the left hand side of eq 19 where τ is the diffusion parameter in all the wake oscillator models discussed to this point the parameters η β c l0 and c d were considered to be constants contrastingly in mukundan et al 2009 to model the randomness shown in the experimental data provided by the norwegian deepwater program see trim et al 2005 those parameters were considered to be randomly varying along the length of the riser 2 3 effect of internal fluid investigations by chatjigeorgiou 2017 and wu and lou 1991 revealed that the internal fluid has a significant effect on the tension of the riser whose effect was early described in the equations of the lateral motion of the riser developed by young et al 1978 eq 3 and chakrabarti and frampton 1982 eq 6 however those formulations assumed the internal fluid to be at rest therefore to incorporate the effect of the speed of the internal fluid seyed and patel 1992 modified the equation for the effective tension t e eq 7 as follows 20 t e x t x a o x p o x a i x p i x ρ i v i 2 a i where ρ i and v i denote the density and the average velocity of the internal fluid respectively considering eq 20 kuiper and metrikine 2005 modified eq 3 to incorporate the effect of the velocity of the internal fluid in the following pde 21 e i u x t x t x u x t ρ r a i v i 2 u x t 2 v i u x t u x t x a o p o x a i p i x u x t ρ r a 0 a i u x f i x t later kuiper et al 2007 revealed that the fluid transported by the riser also contributes to the drag part in the inline force the following nonlinear equation was formulated to depict their finding 22 f d x t α 1 μ i l u x t 1 2 α 2 ρ w l d u x t u x t where α 1 and α 2 are the two unknown dimensionless constants and μ i denotes the dynamic viscosity of the fluid conveyed by the riser in investigating the impact of the internal fluid on the vivs guo et al 2004 found that the effect of the internal fluid velocity on the vivs is strong when the natural frequency of the riser is close to the vortex shedding frequency whose effects however can be decreased by increasing the tension at the top of the riser dai et al 2014b developed the following pde to investigate the effect of the internal flow on the vivs of the riser 23 m w x t m i v i l x t v i x t 2 e a 2 l 0 l w x t 2 d x w x t 2 m i v i x t w x t e i w x t f t x t where m i denotes the mass per unit length of the fluid transported by the riser later eq 23 was updated by dai et al 2014a to include the effect of base excitations on the vivs of the riser a new term m w l t was added to the forcing function to model the base excitations the new model reveals that the base excitations can be utilized to control the amplitude of the vivs 2 4 multi dimensional riser models all of the formulations discussed thus far were developed to investigate the lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser separately however in reality the lateral and transverse vibrations are coupled due to the vortex shedding i e the vortex shedding generates oscillating forces along both the k ˆ and j ˆ axes yuan et al 2017 the transverse force along the k ˆ axis f t z is given by eq 12 whereas that along the j ˆ axis is given as follows faltinsen 1990 24 f t y x t a c cos 4 π f v t ϕ y where a c is the amplitude of the oscillating current and φ y is the phase angle along the j ˆ axis srinil and zanganeh 2012 developed a two dimensional 2d riser model for representation and analysis of the coupled lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser where the riser was treated as a flexibly mounted circular cylinder i e a spring mass damper system subject to a uniform flow equation 16 was modified so as to obtain the following two coupled odes for modeling the lateral and transverse vibrations of the cylinder 25 m y u t c y u t k y u t α 1 y u t 3 α 2 y u t w t 2 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c d c l w t v 26 m z w t c z w t k z w t α 1 z w t 3 α 2 z w t u t 2 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c l c d w t v where α 1 y α 2 y α 1 z and α 2 z are the geometrical coefficients the subscripts y and z appearing in the parameters m c and k define their properties along the lateral j ˆ axis and the transverse k ˆ axis directions respectively equations 25 and 26 which are duffing oscillators have cubic nonlinear terms u 3 and w 3 that model the axial stretching feature of the riser along with the terms uw 2 and wu 2 that model the coupling between the lateral and transverse deflections nguyen et al 2013 later developed a more realistic 2d model based on the pdes that considered the riser as a flexible euler bernoulli beam in this model the coupling between the transverse and lateral vibrations due to environmental forces was also considered 27 m u x t e a 2 3 u x t 2 u x t w x t 2 u x t 2 u x t w x t w x t t u x t e i u x t f i y x t f t y x t 28 m w x t e a 2 3 w x t 2 w x t u x t 2 w x t 2 w x t u x t u x t t w x t e i w x t f i z x t f t z x t where f i y and f i z denote the inline forces and f t y and f t z signify the transverse forces along the j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 27 and 28 are given as follows 29 f i y x t π 4 c m ρ w d 2 v y x t c y 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ y u x t 30 f i z x t π 4 c m ρ w d 2 v z x t c z 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ z w x t 31 f t y z t 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ y x t v y x t 32 f t z x t 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ z x t v z x t where c y and c z denote the linear viscous damping coefficients v y and v z represent the water particle velocities and σ y and σ z signify the root mean square values of the corresponding water particle velocities along the j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively in do and pan 2009 meng and chen 2012 and srinil et al 2009 pdes for investigating the transverse lateral and axial vibrations of the riser in the 3d space were formulated the equations were of the form already discussed above however the coupling parts between the three different types of deflections of the riser see eqs 27 and 28 were not considered 2 5 numerical models for lumped mass systems chai et al 2002 shah and hong 2014 the equations of motion were given in the form of ordinary differential equations odes which can easily be solved analytically however for distributed parameter systems it is not always feasible to obtain an exact or an analytical solution of the system particularly nonlinear pdes therefore in such cases numerical methods for example the finite element method fem the rigid finite element method rfem the finite difference method fdm etc are employed to obtain approximate solutions such methods are used to first discretize the domain of the system in terms of spatial entities i e lengths areas or volumes and then based on the discretization scheme an approximate model of the system is formulated which can easily be solved numerically fem is the most widely used numerical approach cuamatzi melendez et al 2017 wherein the riser is discretized into a finite number of elements first then odes are developed for each element considering the mass and the external internal forces concentrated on the node i e the center of individual elements or the connection point between the elements and finally the equations of individual elements are stacked together to obtain the global equation of motion of the riser in a matrix form for example patel and jesudasen 1987 developed the following global equation for the lateral motion of the riser under the effect of waves and the movements of a vessel 33 m u c u ku f y f v where m c and k denote the global matrices of the mass the damping and the stiffness of the riser u u and u represent the vectors of the accelerations velocities and deflections of the nodes of the riser respectively f y signifies the vector of the forces due to buoyancy and the weight of the riser and f v is the vector for the excitations of the vessel which were modeled in the following form 34 f v m y ρ c m 1 v y where y and v denote the vectors of the accelerations of the vessel derived from the transfer function between the waves and the movements of the vessel and the volumes of the elements of the riser respectively later chen and lin 1989 modified the global equation of motion eq 33 to include the effect of the movements of the vessel in a different way the following formulation was introduced 35 m u c u ku f y c 0 u 0 k 0 u 0 where c0 and k0 represent the matrices of the influence coefficients and u0 and u 0 are the vectors of the deflection and the velocity at the top end of the riser respectively to simulate the vivs in consideration of the effects of the internal fluid yamamoto et al 2004 utilized the fem to convert the previously developed pde eq 14 into the following global equation for the transverse motion of the riser 36 m w c w kw f z where w represents the vector of transverse deflections of the riser and f z denotes the vector for the hydrodynamic force acting along the k ˆ axis in eq 36 the global mass matrix m also includes the effects of the internal fluid later in simulating the vivs huera huarte et al 2006 modified eq 36 by considering the damping matrix c as a linear combination of the global mass matrix m and stiffness matrix k i e rayleigh damping which are given in the following form 37 c α m β k where α 0 0555 and β 0 0002 whose values were obtained by comparing their simulation results with the data acquired from the experiments conducted by delta flume in holland during may 2003 further developments in simulating the vivs were reported in chen et al 2012 2016 where the force vector f z in eq 36 includes the components of both the transverse and the drag forces along the k ˆ axis so far we have discussed the fem based formulations developed for investigating only the lateral or only the transverse responses of the riser for simulating the responses of the riser in the 3d space one way is to discretize the riser into a finite number of linear spring elements each element consisting of two nodes with each node having three degrees of freedom i e lateral u i transverse w i and axial δ i nodal deflections where the subscript i stands for the i th node this results in the following nodal equations of motion taylor 1977 38 m i i s i t i f i q i where i denotes the 3 3 identity matrix s i u i w i δ i represents the nodal position vector t i is the vector of the nodal tension f i stands for the force vector consisting of the drag force the inertia force and the riser s weight concentrated at the node and q i signifies the nodal vector representing the constant shear force later yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a more detailed 3d formulation for the riser considering nodal rotations ϑ i x ϑ i y and ϑ i z about the i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively in addition to the lateral transverse and axial deflections of the nodes thereby resulting in six degrees of freedom at each node i e s i u i w i δ i ϑ i x ϑ i y ϑ i z later a new 3d formulation was proposed by athisakul et al 2011 to investigate the bending twisting and axial deformations of a flexible riser caused by the internal fluid considering s i u i w i ε i where ε i denotes the nodal strain other than fem the rfem has also been utilized in modeling the riser systems in which the riser is discretized into a finite number of rigid finite elements that are connected with each other by means of massless spring damper elements based on the rfem adamiec wojcik et al 2015 investigated the bending and elongation of the riser in the i ˆ j ˆ plane upon the movements of the vessel first the riser was discretized into small rigid elements having four degrees of freedom i e the position coordinates x e and y e of the element along the i ˆ and j ˆ axes respectively the axial deflection δ e of the element i e along the k ˆ axis and the rotation of the element ϑ e about the k ˆ axis s e x e y e δ e ϑ e the following form of the global equation of motion of the riser was achieved 39 m s dr f where m is the global mass matrix s s 1 t s 2 t s n t t is the vector of the generalized coordinates of the system r is the vector of the reaction forces due to the constraints of the connections between the elements d is the matrix of the coefficients associated with the constraints and f is the force vector consisting of buoyancy drag and inertial forces later drag 2017 modified the formulation in eq 39 to make each element to have five degrees of freedom i e the position coordinates x e y e and z e along i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes and the rotations ϑ e x and ϑ e z about the i ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively s e x e y e z e ϑ e x ϑ e z another approach similar to the rfem for modeling the offshore structures is the finite segment method fsm xu and wang 2012 in fsm a slender body e g the marine riser is first discretized into a series of flexible segments and then the deflections of the segment and the external forces acting on the segment are independently analyzed consequently the deformation of the whole structure is decomposed into micro deformations of the flexible segments and the governing equations are listed according to the equilibria of the moments on the individual segments xu et al 2013 besides the fem rfem the fdm is the secondly most widely used numerical method for solving the equations of motion of the riser systems in the fdm the length of the riser is first discretized into a finite number of small spatial segments δx resulting in n number of nodal points i e x 1 x 2 x n along the length of the riser then to obtain the response of the riser in time domain the pde is discretized both in space and time by converting its derivative terms both in space and time into algebraic approximations which are functions of δx and the discrete time interval δt by using the taylor series expansion the resulting equations are then solved for obtaining the responses at all spatial points for example jain 1994 developed the following fdm based formulation to perform the static analysis of the riser system i e only the spatial discretization was performed 40 1 δ x 4 e i w i 2 2 w i 1 w i i 1 2 e i i w i 1 2 w i w i 1 e i i 1 w i 2 w i 1 w i 2 t i δ x 2 w i 1 2 w i w i 1 f t i where the index i denotes the discretization in space later in analyzing the dynamic

later doan and nishi 2015 utilized the same formulation given by eq 43 to investigate the response of the riser in the 3d space considering the wake oscillator model for generating the vortex induced force the fluid structure modeling techniques discussed thus far neglect the interaction of the fluid with the entire external surface of the riser which can be accounted for by modeling the complete 3d flow around the riser using the navier stokes equation because the aspect ratio of the riser is very large and the flow around it is very complex a complete 3d analysis is infeasible rather a simpler approach known as the strip theory meneghini et al 2004 willden and graham 2001 2004 vidic perunovic and jensen 2005 is utilized which applies the hydrodynamic forces modeled in a 2d plane or strips on the surface of the riser then the solution for the combined system i e the flow and the riser model is obtained by implementing a computational fluid dynamics cfd program some important works in the field of mathematical riser modeling is summarized in table 1 3 riser analysis extensive analyses have been performed both experimentally and theoretically i e through computer simulations to understand the behavior of the riser system operating in harsh environmental conditions a thorough review of those analyses is presented below 3 1 theoretical analysis to analyze a riser system theoretically the equations of motion must be solved either analytically to obtain the exact solution or numerically to obtain an approximate solution in analytical methods aranha et al 2001a atadan et al 1997 chucheepsakul et al 2003 gu et al 2013b ramos and pesce 2003 sparks 2002 yang and xiao 2014 a mathematical form of the solution i e the deflection of the riser of the riser s equation of motion was usually assumed for example in kirk et al 1979 the deflection was assumed to be a sinusoidal series another approach for obtaining an analytical solution is by applying the normal mode method i e modal superposition e g furnes 2000 in numerical techniques in contrast approximation methods e g fem fdm and the finite volume method are used to obtain an approximate solution of the equations of motion of the system since the works involving analytical solutions are limited patel and seyed 1995 this review will focus mainly on the numerical techniques for analyzing the riser systems 3 1 1 static and dynamic analyses theoretical solutions to the equations of motion of a riser system can be obtained by either static or dynamic analyses in this subsection a detailed review on the static and dynamic analysis methods is presented some earlier reviews on the said topic may be found in chen et al 2006 larsen 1992 and patel and seyed 1995 static riser analysis is performed to obtain the deflected shape of the riser under a constant load distribution jain 1994 santillan and virgin 2011 in such cases the inertia term m w in the equations of motion of the riser for example eq 14 is not considered and the hydrodynamic force given by eq 4 i e a steady current profile is considered as the forcing function in dynamic analyses meanwhile the deflected shape of the riser is obtained in consideration of the inertia term the time varying load distribution and the movements of the vessel chakrabarti and frampton 1982 dynamic analyses can be categorized into three types kirk et al 1979 i time domain or time history analysis ii frequency domain analysis and iii stochastic or non deterministic analysis both the time and frequency domain techniques are based on deterministic solutions of the riser equations time domain analyses in comparison with those in the frequency domain provide more general solutions for example the nonlinear drag term and the variation in buoyancy near the surface can be included in the analysis however frequency domain analyses usually are performed to obtain a steady state solution to the fatigue problem where the wave forces and the motions of the vessel are assumed to be harmonic young et al 1978 whereas fatigue analyses have been performed mostly in the frequency domain several time domain fatigue analyses have been reported recently thorsen et al 2015 wang et al 2015c xue et al 2015 on the other hand stochastic analyses based on non deterministic solutions are based on the modal superposition method random vibration which requires the linearization of time dependent loads including nonlinear drag forces jensen 2011 3 1 1 1 frequency and time domain analyses young et al 1978 performed a frequency domain analysis for analyzing the stresses and fatigues on the riser subject to excitations from the waves and the movements of the vessel the response of the riser caused by random waves was utilized to predict the stresses while the response caused by the regular waves was utilized to predict the fatigue later in kirk et al 1979 a frequency domain analysis was performed to predict the dynamic and static stresses of the riser subject to the movements of the vessel it was concluded that the movements of the vessel in comparison to the drag forces induced by the currents play a more vital role in generating the bending stresses benassai and campanile 2002 performed a frequency domain analysis using the modal priority technique in order to predict the multi mode vivs of a flexible riser under the actions of waves and currents the employed technique was based on the amplitudes of the active vibration modes rather than their frequencies to predict the multi modal oscillations of the riser under a sheared flow condition modarres sadeghi et al 2010 performed a frequency domain analysis to investigate the effect of higher modes on the fatigue life of a flexible riser they found that consideration of higher modes in the analysis resulted in a significant decrease in the fatigue life of the riser mukundan et al 2010 performed a combined time and frequency domain analysis using the wavelet transform technique for reconstructing the vortex induced response of a flexible riser they then utilized the reconstructed response to analyze the fatigue damage on the riser response reconstruction was achieved for two separate cases i when a large number of sensors were placed along the length of the riser and ii when only a small number of sensors was used shi et al 2012 employed the weighted wave form analysis wwa technique to reconstruct the response of a flexible marine riser and concluded that for that purpose sensor positioning is more important than the number of sensors used shi et al 2014 also demonstrated the effectiveness of the wwa technique as combined with field measurements to predict the long term fatigue damage to the riser system considered recently a new approach based on a variance reduction technique for analyzing the long term fatigue damage in conjunction with the time domain simulations has been proposed in gao and low 2016 patel and jesudasen 1987 performed a time domain dynamic analysis to simulate the lateral response of a flexible riser subject to the movements of the vessel and disturbance loads due to the currents and waves using the fem they obtained a numerical solution to the equations of motion however using their proposed method they could not simulate the vivs of the riser a simulation of the vivs was later reported in chen and lin 1989 who developed a numerical scheme based on the newmark method to simulate the responses in consideration of the effects of the static and dynamic offsets of the surface vessel and disturbance loads due to waves and currents sagatun et al 2002 presented a time domain analysis for determining the vivs of two adjacent risers moving relative to each other in a steady flow the main purpose of their study was to predict whether the two risers would collide while moving in the presence of wakes later a numerical investigation by chen and kim 2010 revealed that the velocity of the external current and the distance between two adjacent risers are the most significant factors in influencing the vivs of the considered two adjacent risers a nonlinear fem based scheme was developed in kaewunruen et al 2005 to evaluate the nonlinear free vibrations of a flexible marine riser conveying internal fluid according to their results flexural rigidity has the most significant impact on the response the higher the flexural rigidity is the stiffer the vibrational responses are in huera huarte et al 2006 eq 14 was solved using the fem to investigate the vivs of a flexible cylinder and to determine the hydrodynamic forcing function from the experimental data of chaplin et al 2005a a more detailed fem based algorithm subsequently was developed by monprapussorn et al 2007 to investigate the effects of the internally flowing fluid on the response of an extensible marine riser that study revealed that the impulsive acceleration of the internal fluid affected the stability of the riser significantly specifically by shifting the equilibrium positions later guo et al 2008 utilized the galerkin approximation method to analyze the effects of the internally flowing fluid on the vivs of a top tensioned riser an advanced fem based simulation scheme for investigating the vivs of a flexible riser was reported in chen et al 2012 who additionally considered variations in the structural parameters along the length of the riser in their formulation their results revealed that for lower modes a high amplitude riser response occurred at the position where the tension was small whereas for higher modes the same high amplitude response occurred at the riser position where the bending stiffness was low chen et al 2014 applied the fem to their study of the impact of the heave motion of the vessel on the vivs of the riser they found that the heave motion has a significant impact on the displacements of the riser particularly in the lower modes soon thereafter chen et al 2015 performed an fem based time domain dynamic analysis of a flexible riser isolating the occurrence of a nonlinear response amplification phenomenon signifying the response amplification at the top end with the propagation along the length of the riser in another recent study adamiec wojcik et al 2015 developed an fem based algorithm to simulate the bending and longitudinal displacements of a freely hanging riser subject to vessel movements and ocean loads they were able to demonstrate the capability of the developed algorithm to avoid a contact of the riser tip with an obstacle on the seabed by controlling the movements of the vessel recently a fem based dynamic analysis of the marine riser conducted by mao et al 2016b revealed that increasing the top tension of the riser can significantly reduce the large lateral deflection and the bending movement of the riser under extreme environmental loads also chen et al 2016 reported an fem based time domain analysis for investigating the multi mode vivs of a flexible marine riser subject to stepped and shear flows the fem based investigation of meng et al 2017 has revealed that the multi mode vivs can be caused by the changes in the velocity of the internal fluid in teixeira and morooka 2017 an fem based analysis of the vivs of the risers was performed in their analysis the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients was achieved in real time recently in khan and ahmad 2018 a 3d nonlinear dynamic analysis of a riser was performed in the time domain using the finite element solver abaqus the response history was then utilized in performing a fatigue reliability assessment by using monte carlo simulations one of the earliest studies on simulating the responses of risers in the 3d space is ghadimi 1988 who utilized a numerical scheme combining the tangent stiffness incremental approach with the wilson theta numerical integration algorithm to obtain the lateral transverse and axial deflections of the riser under the effect of the hydrodynamic forces modeled by morison equation later herfjord et al 1999 employed the cfd computations to simulate the vivs of a flexible riser in the 3d space by utilizing the strip theory as discussed in subsection 2 5 to impose the hydrodynamic forces on the surface of the riser then yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a nonlinear scheme based on the fem to simulate the responses namely bending axial and shear deformations of a flexible riser in the 3d space meneghini et al 2004 performed a cfd based analysis to simulate the vivs of a flexible cylinder subject to both uniform and sheared flow conditions they simulated the hydrodynamic forces by means of the distributed vortex method dvm which is a lagrangian numerical technique for modeling of 2d incompressible and viscous fluid flows yamamoto et al 2004 adopted the same simulation scheme to analyze the vivs of a vertical riser the cfd analysis of a vertical riser subject to a uniform current also was reported in willden and graham 2004 where it was demonstrated that the simulation of multi modal vivs can be achieved if the vortex shedding frequency varies along the length of the riser athisakul et al 2011 used the fem to analyze both the static and dynamic responses of a fluid transporting riser in the 3d space sun et al 2012 developed a new strip wise discrete vortex method to simulate the vivs of flexible risers also in the 3d space and calculated the vivs at each strip using the finite volume method combined with the incremental method to simulate the fluid structure interaction zhang et al 2013 analyzed the experimental data of the vivs by utilizing the fem specifically for estimating the tangential transverse and longitudinal hydrodynamic forces acting on them recently madani et al 2016 utilized the strip theory in simulating the multi mode vivs of flexible risers although the riser analyses have mostly used the fem several works have utilized the fdm wanderley and levi 2005 presented a finite difference numerical scheme based on beam and warming approximation formula for simulating the vivs of a flexible marine riser chatjigeorgiou 2008 used the fdm in developing an algorithm for analyzing the stability of the riser subject to vessel movements in the 2d space later the samefinite difference scheme was updated by chatjigeorgiou 2010a b to investigate the response of the riser in the 3d space the proposed scheme could also analyze the effect of internally flowing fluid on the response of the riser another algorithm based on the fdm was developed in huang et al 2011a for investigating the 3d response of a top tensioned riser considered as a tensioned beam considering the riser as a tensioned beam a 3d fdm based algorithm was utilized in jung et al 2012 to investigate the vivs of the riser under the influence of both the inline and transverse hydrodynamic forces wang et al 2014b developed a numerical scheme based on the fdm for analyzing the stresses and deformations of a flexible marine riser under the combined effect of the axial and lateral hydrodynamic forces they found that the stresses in the structure of the riser increase with the drag speed while bending deformation increases with the depth of water and decreases with the size of the riser recently doan and nishi 2015 employed an fdm based scheme combined with the wake oscillator model to simulate the vivs of a flexible riser they discovered however that their proposed method needed to be improved for predicting more accurate amplitudes and frequencies of the responses torres et al 2015 developed an fdm based algorithm for application to a nonlinear analysis in estimating the structural parameters of the riser kamble and chen 2016 utilized the finite analytical navier stokes technique based on the finite volume method in predicting the vivs and fatigue damages to the riser upon inline and cross flows recently a fdm based numerical analysis was performed in lei et al 2017 to investigate the transverse deflections and bending stresses in the riser exposed to the coupled axial and transverse loads considering a time varying tension caused by the heave movements of the vessel 3 1 1 2 stochastic analysis sagrilo et al 2000 performed a stochastic analysis to predict the tension at the top end of the riser under the influence of the heave excited motions of the surface vessel in aranha and pinto 2001 an analytical approximation of the probability density function of the dynamic tension in riser systems was developed which requires an estimation of the statistical parameters of the dynamic tension using numerical simulation in another work aranha et al 2001b estimated random excitations in the structure of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel mukundan et al 2009 developed a stochastic algorithm based on a wake oscillator model with randomly varying parameters to predict the minimum fatigue life of marine risers and used experimental data provided by the norwegian deepwater program trim et al 2005 for the validation of their proposed prediction algorithm srivilairit and manuel 2009 statistically investigated the acceleration of the riser and the coincident velocity profiles of the current in formulating the relationship between those profiles and the response of the riser they applied the proper orthogonal decomposition method i e a numerical scheme for statistical analysis to analyze full scale field data obtained from a deepwater drilling site sun et al 2014 performed a stochastic analysis of the inline and transverse vibrations of a flexible riser considering the vortex induced response as a stationary random process and calculating it by the pseudo excitation method low and srinil 2016 proposed a stochastic approach based on the point estimate method to conduct fatigue analyses which revealed that the randomness of wake coefficients in the wake oscillator model leads to large variability in fatigue 3 2 experimental analysis thus far we have discussed a number of mathematical models and analysis techniques employed in investigating riser systems to ensure the validity of these models and techniques by comparison of the theoretical results with experimental data a proper experimental paradigm setup needs to be established a special attention to the design of such experimental setup is required which often requires in turn the design of a test rig having eigen frequencies lower than that of the first eigen frequency of the riser trim et al 2005 so that the effect of the rig to the responses of the riser can be minimized furthermore the experimental model must be able to predict the behavior of the actual system which can be achieved by implementing the similarity theory fontaine et al 2006 guo et al 2006 queau et al 2013 shah et al 2017 also the experimental data obtained from the sensors i e accelerometers and angular rate devices attached to the riser must be processed into the form suitable for validating the theoretical models kaasen and lie 2003 applied the methods of modal decomposition and the least squares combined with frequency domain calculations to extract useful experimental data related to the lateral vibrations of the riser under the influence of steady currents experimental investigations on the inline and transverse vibrations of a flexible riser subject to uniform currents have been reported in the literature several times chaplin et al 2005b gu et al 2013a guo and lou 2008a mao et al 2016a trim et al 2005 where the uniform current typically having been generated by towing a cylinder in a tank containing still water chaplin et al 2005a designed a special experimental facility to investigate the transverse and lateral vibrations of a vertical tensioned model riser subject to a stepped current they were able to measure the responses to vortex excitations up to the eighth mode in the transverse direction and to the fourteenth in the lateral direction the obtained experimental data thereby were later used by huera huarte et al 2006 to numerically calculate the inline and transverse forces on a flexible cylinder chaplin et al 2005b also performed experiments to measure the transverse and lateral vibrations of a vertical model riser subject to a stepped current they compared their experimental measurements with the simulated data for the transverse and lateral vibrations of eleven different empirical and cfd based studies the comparison of experimental and numerical predictions revealed that the empirical models were more successful in predicting the vivs of the riser than the cfd based ones the experimental data thus obtained was subsequently utilized by ma et al 2014 to validate their algorithm for simulating the vivs trim et al 2005 performed experiments to analyze the inline and transverse responses of a long flexible riser model considering different arrangements of the helical strakes which are mounted on the surface of the riser for suppressing the vivs i e passive suppression it was revealed that the length of the riser covered with helical strakes as well as the nature of flow are the two main factors to be considered in the design of a riser from the stand point of fatigue prevention wang et al 2014a performed experiments in an ocean basin to investigate both the inline and transverse vibrations of a steel catenary model riser subject to the movements of the vessel they were able to confirm that the movements of the vessel cause vivs and that the fatigue damage is more sensitive to the amplitude rather than the period of the movements later the experimental investigation of wang et al 2015a on the vivs of a flexible riser subject to an oscillatory flow caused by the heave motion of the surface vessel revealed a strong dependence of fatigue damage on the keulegan carpenter kc number of the flow in fact an inverse relation between fatigue damages and kc numbers was observed fatigue damage was found to be greater at a smaller value of kc number rather than at larger ones in wang et al 2015b meanwhile an empirical relationship among the dominant frequency of the riser the maximum equivalent velocity of the flow and the kc number was obtained the ratio of the dominant frequency of the riser and the frequency of the oscillating flow was found to be equal to the product of the st and the kc numbers corresponding to the maximum flow velocity during operation a long flexible riser can undergo either the single or multi mode lock in phenomenon multi mode vivs fan et al 2015 huang et al 2011b of risers have been analyzed in a number of studies in investigating the multi mode lock in phenomenon marcollo and hinwood 2006 performed experiments entailing simultaneous excitation of the vivs of a flexible riser model at two different resonant modes which resulted in an unexpected phenomenon of single mode lock in only at a higher frequency experimental investigations of song et al 2011 revealed that their flexible riser model underwent a multi mode lock in behavior while subject to both inline and transverse vibrations under a uniform current profile however the vibration amplitude in the inline direction was found to be considerably smaller than that of the transverse direction also the frequency of the inline vibrations was found to be approximately twice that of the transverse vibrations in all these studies mentioned above the vivs of the riser were analyzed under the effect of a uniform current profile mao et al 2014 in contrast performed experiments to investigate the multi mode lock in behavior of a flexible model riser under the effect of shear flow wherein the experiments were conducted in a deepwater offshore basin rather than a water tank the tests were performed at two different reynolds numbers i e re 1105 and 2761 at re 1 105 the frequencies of the inline and transverse vibrations during lock in were found to be the same which was not the case for the uniform current however for re 2 761 the frequency of inline vibrations was found to be twice that of the transverse vibrations i e the same result reported earlier by song et al 2011 for a uniform current mao et al 2015 later demonstrated experimentally that under shear flow the vortex shedding frequency differs at different points of the riser i e along its length but that the frequency of the vivs remains the same the experimental works addressed above were undertaken to address the most commonly occurring problems related to the complex vibrations in the risers there are also several other studies that have addressed some of the uncommon yet very important issues fontaine et al 2006 experimentally investigated the vibrations due to interference between two risers in tandem configurations they found that the root mean square value of the motion deflection of the downstream rear riser was more than twice the value of the upstream front riser this was due to the fact that the motion of the rear riser was influenced not only by its own wake but also by the vortices generated by the front riser i e wake induced oscillations guo and lou 2008b performed the first experiment analyzing the effect of the internal flow on the response of the riser determining that increasing the internal flow resulted in an increased strain in both the inline and transverse directions and a decreased natural frequency liu et al 2014 performed experiments to investigate the effects of the tension of the drill pipe on the vivs revealing that the vivs can be suppressed by increasing the tension of the drill pipe recently xu et al 2018 performed experiments to investigate the multi mode vibration behavior of two side by side flexible cylinders risers by towing them in a water tank their investigations revealed that the risers exhibited large oscillations in the inline direction as compared to those in the transverse direction 4 riser control as discussed in the preceding section a number of studies have analyzed the riser responses under various load conditions in this section the schemes specifically related to the prevention or suppression by both passive and active control strategies of harmful vibrations of the risers and especially fatigue damage will be reviewed 4 1 passive control passive control strategies include modifications of the riser s structural rigidity internal fluid s velocity the top tension structural damping and other means meng and zhu 2015 the most applicable passive control procedure for the suppression of the vibrations however entails covering the riser along its length with vortex suppression devices for example spoilers abbassian and moros 1996 control rods wu et al 2012a splitter plates lou et al 2016 and helical strakes baarholm et al 2005 holland et al 2017 helical strakes are the most commonly used vibration suppression devices indeed it is experimentally proven that the use of helical strakes can significantly reduce fatigue damage gao et al 2016 2015b abbassian and moros 1996 conducted a feasibility study of the use of air bubble spoilers as a vortex suppression device for a drilling riser subject to uniform flows their work was based on the observation that injection of air bubbles into the flow reduces the vortex induced force but has little effect on the frequency of the riser they found however that air bubble spoilers are not economically feasible for actual risers undergoing large deflections wu et al 2012a carried out an experimental investigation analyzing the capability of control rods for suppressing the vivs of a long tensioned riser they performed the experiments with four slender control rods in parallel with the riser and arranged them at a uniform angle interval of 90 they concluded that by decreasing the spacing between the control rods an effective suppression of the vibration could be achieved provided that the complete length of the riser is covered by the control rods borges et al 2014 explored the use of visco elastic layers which can be assembled along the length of a steel catenary riser resulted in an increased structural damping and thereby reduced vibrations without employing any vibration suppression devices nishi and doan 2015 proposed a method that utilizes only a small number of damping devices for suppression of the transverse vibrations of a flexible marine riser they used the modal control technique to first identify the mode that contributes most to the vivs of the riser and then suppressed it using the damping devices tan et al 2015 compared the responses of composite and steel catenary risers in simulations finding the composite risers to be more vulnerable to vivs and fatigue damage due specifically to their lower structural frequencies it was also shown that assembling small diameter long buoyancy modules at the bottom of the riser resulted in superior vibration suppression as compared to the top of the riser baarholm et al 2005 in an fem based simulation study demonstrated that the use of helical strakes increased the fatigue life of risers in their analysis they used different existing empirical values for the lift and damping coefficients further they performed experiments on a model of the riser to validate the empirical values for the coefficients used in their analysis in trim et al 2005 various configurations of helical strakes were used to evaluate their performances in suppressing the vivs it was revealed that the vivs of the riser were reduced by increasing the coverage area of the strakes on the riser the greater strake coverage also reduced the vivs due to inline forces as compared with those due to the transverse forces lubbad et al 2011 carried out an experimental investigation of the efficiency of round edged helical strakes in suppressing the vibrations of a rigid riser circular cylinder three different parameters the number of starts i e the individual strakes used the pitch the distance along the length of the riser required for one complete turn of the strake and the diameter were varied to obtain twenty eight different configurations of the strakes it was concluded that regardless of the pitch and the diameter of the strake the configuration of three starts was the most efficient among the tested configurations in reducing the amplitudes of vibrations in both the inline and transverse directions in quen et al 2014 an experimental analysis of the effects of the pitch and the height of helical strakes in suppressing the vivs of long risers was carried out it was concluded that although the pitch does not play a vital role in suppressing the amplitude of vibrations a higher pitch nonetheless delays lock in an increased height moreover was found to improve vibration suppression relative to the contribution of pitch experimental investigations reported by gao et al 2015b 2016 likewise concluded that as compared to pitch the height of the strakes has a greater influence on the amplitude of vivs and consequently on the fatigue life of risers under both uniform and sheared flow conditions 4 2 active control besides the passive controls above the vibrations also can be controlled through active means for example rustad et al 2008 implemented a proportional integral control to prevent the collisions of two risers in tandem arrangement and subject to uniform currents their control law was developed to adjust the top tensions of the two risers individually by implementing a feedback control their motivation was to propose a solution to the problem to prevent a collision of two risers in tandem configuration that would be more cost effective than maintaining the top tension at a high constant value or increasing the space between two risers the numerical investigation of mazzilli and sanches 2011 undertaken to address the instability problem of a riser developed a system of optimal control incorporating a linear quadratic regulator lqr for stabilizing the large amplitude vibrations of a steel catenary riser undergoing vivs in their results only a single mode i e the twenty sixth one which has been determined to be the most excited during the vortex induced response of the riser was evaluated and the case of multi mode lock in was not considered fortaleza 2013 designed a p type control law for controlling the displacement at the top boundary of a riser model to suppress the vivs for control design the study also evaluated only one the most excited vibration mode as determined via a modal analysis applying the control law experimentally to a reduced scale riser model a 30 reduction in vivs was achieved boundary control do 2017a do and pan 2008 has been the most widely employed active control method for suppressing the vibrations of flexible marine risers how et al 2009 developed a boundary control law for limiting the upper joint angle of a tensioned riser i e the joint connecting the riser and the surface vessel where the recommended maximum value of the angle was considered to be 2 a boundary control was applied to operate the torque actuator located at the top end of the riser which not only restricted the upper joint angle of the riser but also suppressed the vivs due to the unknown time varying disturbance caused by ocean currents equations 4 and 11 were used to define the oscillating drag and transverse forces respectively in their mathematical model of the riser do and pan 2008 developed a boundary control law for suppressing the transverse vibrations of a flexible marine riser considered as a 2d system as driven by a hydraulic system and subject to waves winds and ocean currents lyapunov direct method and the back stepping technique were utilized in developing the control law to drive the hydraulic system at the top end of the riser the dynamics of the hydraulic actuator also were included in the designed control law do and pan 2009 later extended their control technique to stabilize a coupled 3d riser system i e axial lateral and transverse deflections of the riser were considered subject to inline and transverse drag force components and in consideration of the effective weight of the riser itself ge et al 2010 developed a boundary control law for suppressing the vibrations of a flexible riser in the axial and lateral directions utilizing two actuators at the top end of the riser i e for generating control force in the axial and lateral directions nguyen et al 2013 designed a boundary control law for controlling the displacement and velocity of the top end of the riser to suppress its lateral and transverse vibrations considered to be coupled due to bending their control law was implemented by obtaining a negative feedback of the top angle of the riser and the corresponding angular velocity later in nguyen et al 2014 a boundary control scheme utilizing force and torque inputs at the top end of a flexible riser was developed to suppress the rotational movements of the riser under the effect of transverse and drag inline forces recently he et al 2016 designed a boundary control law to control the lateral vibrations of a flexible marine riser subject to ocean currents and in consideration of the saturation phenomenon of the actuator the boundary control law was implemented at the top boundary of the riser where two cases of feedback i e full state feedback and output feedback were considered in most works discussed above the riser was considered inextensible however do and lucey 2017 developed a boundary control scheme to stabilize the lateral and axial deflections of the riser under the influence of ocean currents considering the riser to be extensible their proposed boundary control laws were implemented at the top boundary of the riser and required a feedback of the deflections and velocities of the top end of the riser recently a new boundary control scheme has been developed by do 2017b to stabilize the extensible marine riser in the 3d space i e considering the deflections of the riser along i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes 4 2 1 active suppression of vessel induced vibrations most works discussed so far dealt with the suppression of the vibrations caused by the ocean s currents however the movements of the vessel caused by the sea waves also have a significant impact on the response of the riser cabrera miranda and paik 2017 kuiper et al 2008 therefore to suppress the vibrations of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel several active control schemes have been proposed zhang and li 2015 proposed a linear quadratic gaussian controller for suppressing the axial stresses of a tensioned riser subject to wave induced motions of the vessel they utilized a strain feedback in implementing their control law for controlling the tension of the riser by using a winch in nguyen et al 2010 the position of the surface vessel was controlled to maintain the bottom end angle of a rigid drilling riser within 2 the proposed control scheme consisted of two parts i keeping the vessel in close proximity to a reference position which was achieved by implementing an integral control of the lengths of mooring lines and ii implementing the proportional integral derivative control law for thruster based heading control of the vessel an experimental floating production storage and offloading vessel model was utilized in validating the proposed control scheme which was found to be feasible only for moderate sea states he et al 2015b developed a boundary control law based on an integral barrier lyapunov function for controlling the top tension of the riser installed in a vessel riser system the control law was designed to control the movements of the surface vessel and to minimize the top end angle of the riser in the case of very large vessel movements to restrict the top tension within a prescribed limit later he et al 2011 developed an adaptive boundary control law for suppressing the transverse vibrations of a flexible riser so as to handle the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and the time variation of ocean currents vessel dynamics also were included in the control model the control input being applied to control the position of the vessel for suppressing the vibrations of the riser he et al 2015a also designed a boundary control law for suppressing the vibrations of both the mooring lines and the riser with the help of a force actuator installed in a vessel mooring riser system table 2 summarizes some of the important works published in the field of riser vibration control 5 discussion and future prospects in this paper an extensive review of the literature related to the mathematical modeling analysis and vibration control of marine risers was presented in section 2 the discussions on different formulations of a riser system included the modeling of different hydrodynamic load functions the lateral and transverse responses of the riser the effects of internal fluid on the responses of the riser damping functions and the coupling between the lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser section 3 introduced numerous reports of experimental and theoretical analyses on riser systems most of those investigations were mainly concerned with fatigue damage in risers the effects of sea currents uniform and sheared internal flow and the movements of the vessel on the response of the riser especially vortex induced vibrations were discussed finally in section 4 the control strategies both active and passive applied for suppressing the vibrations of the riser were discussed based upon this review the following seven aspects of key technologies for improvement have been identified in the areas of modeling analysis and control of a riser system i timoshenko beam theory first in the modeling part most formulations so far have modeled the riser system as an euler bernoulli beam but such simplification cannot describe the response of the riser upon shear forces also most works assumed the cross section of the riser to be constant however in a harsh environment in the ocean the riser can exhibit a complex deformation including twisting and elongation resulting in a change in the shape cross section of the riser therefore in the future a more complete beam formulation for example based on the timoshenko beam theory can be developed ii varying parameters also most existing works regarded that the parameters associated with the hydrodynamic forces for example the damping and added mass coefficients are constant along the lateral transverse and axial directions however such parameters should be modeled as time varying entities iii six dof motion of the vessel another important aspect in the formulation of a riser system which needs to be improved is the modeling of the movements of the surface vessel most formulations in the literature considered only the pitch yaw and heave motions of the vessel however considering the real environment a complete motion of the vessel should be considered i e the six degrees of freedom as was done for a mobile harbor system in hong and ngo 2012 a recent investigation by wang et al 2017 has revealed that the movements of the vessel also result in the vivs of the risers which phenomenon should also be addressed in the future formulations of the riser vessel system iv numerical scheme for real time estimation for the analysis of a riser system in the future more emphasis should be given to the development of a numerical scheme that can estimate the parameters associated with the hydrodynamic forces in real time this will eventually lead to the development of a more efficient control scheme v experimental facility also there is a need to develop more advanced experimental facilities for investigating the responses of the riser under complex flow situations it is evident that the existing experimental setups possess a limited capability in simulating realistic hydrodynamic load conditions for the riser vi hybrid control regarding the control of vortex induced vibrations this review found that both passive and active control methods are being applied to riser systems however there are shortcomings in both methods for example the passive techniques which require mounting of vibration suppression devices on the riser are expensive whereas the active control methods which tend to control the vibrations of the riser by applying control inputs at the top end of the riser are not much effective in suppressing the vibrations at larger depths i e the compensating movements of the riser cannot occur at larger depths due to the limited controlled movements of the vessel to overcome these problems more emphasis should be given to the development of hybrid active passive control techniques in which case the number of passive devices mounted on the riser can be reduced for cost effectiveness and rather than applying control inputs only at the top boundary the sensor actuator pairs can be mounted at several points along the length of the riser which may require application of the wireless technology for data signal transmission for implementation of a control scheme vii failure prevention at the connections of the riser lastly considering the effects of the movements of the vessel on the riser this review admits that the movements of the vessel should be restricted to avoid an accidental disconnection between the riser and the bop valve nguyen et al 2010 however not much work has been reported to constrain the movements of the vessel to prevent possible damages at the riser vessel interface recently in adamiec wojcik et al 2016 an optimization technique was proposed to restrict the bending moments at the riser vessel interface by utilizing the vertical displacements of the top end of the riser by using a winch in their study only the heave motion of the vessel was considered in generating the bending moments at the top end of the riser therefore in the future more emphases should be given in developing control techniques for example artificial neural networks for avoiding a failure at the riser vessel interface due to six dof movements of the vessel acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation nrf of korea under the auspices of the ministry of science and ict korea grant no nrf 2017r1a2a1a17069430 
23564,this paper reviews the dynamics and vibration control techniques for marine riser systems the riser pipes are modeled as euler bernoulli beams that vibrate under the effects of ocean loads and the movements of the surface vessel resulting in hybrid ode pde equations chronological development of such hybrid models is first discussed and their approximated ode models for simulation are examined theoretical and experimental techniques for instability and fatigue analyses on the riser systems are also summarized to increase the fatigue life against ocean currents passive vibration suppression devices e g strakes and spoilers were mounted on the surface of the riser whereas to tackle the instability problem caused by sea waves active control techniques utilizing the movements of the vessel were employed in conclusions as future riser technologies seven research issues are identified keywords marine riser modeling vibration control vortex induced vibrations fatigue subsea production systems oil and gas 1 introduction a marine riser an essential component of subsea oil gas production systems acts as a conductor pipe between an offshore platform floating in an ocean i e a storage platform or a vessel and a well on the seabed chakrabarti and frampton 1982 as shown in fig 1 the riser is connected to the well through the blowout preventer bop valve that prevents leakages of the fluid transported through the riser the riser system is exposed to harsh environmental loads like ocean currents and waves the currents act along the length of the riser whereas the waves inflict the movements of the vessel a severe current and a large movement of the vessel can result in a large deflection of the riser which causes a disconnection of the riser from the bop valve or a failure due to fatigue in the riser system in the past fifty years to ensure the safety and to enhance the productivity of riser systems several investigations on the dynamics analyses and vibration controls of various riser systems have been reported in the literature the main objective of this paper is to review the works on the dynamics and control of the riser itself comprehensively under the influence of ocean currents and waves the issues of laying and reentry of the riser and its contact with the seabed are important elosta et al 2016 jensen et al 2009a 2010 wang et al 2016 however those will not be touched due to page limitation at the end of the review future research directions to improve riser technologies will be identified this paper intends to portray a comprehensive picture on the evolution of mathematical modeling analyses and the vibration control strategies applicable to riser systems to the present state of the art riser systems can be classified into production and drilling risers from the operational view point a production riser transports oil gas from the seabed to the vessel a drilling riser provides a pathway for drilling and transports drilling mud chakrabarti 2005 he et al 2014 risers can be further classified into flexible or rigid according to the material used in their construction a rigid or straight top tensioned riser is usually utilized for shallow water operations whereas a flexible or steel catenary riser is typically used for deep ocean operations i e 2000 m mekha 2001 meng and zhu 2015 when a riser moves in the presence of currents vortices are shed along its surface resulting in the formation of an unstable wake region around it vortex shedding takes place at different frequencies and amplitudes thus effecting different vortex patterns according to xu et al 2009 the formation of different patterns of vortices depends upon the reynolds number re of the incident flow fig 2 shows three different patterns of the vortices i e 2s 2p and p s shed by the structure of the riser upon its interaction with the incident flow the 2s pattern is a combination of two single vortices shed in opposite directions relative to each other during one cycle i e von karman vortex shedding the 2p pattern represents two pairs of vortices shed in one cycle in which each pair consists of vortices in opposite direction relative to each other and the p s pattern denotes the asymmetric combination of a pair of vortices with a separate single vortex during each cycle williamson and govardhan 2004 vortices inflict a periodically varying transverse force on the riser i e perpendicular to the direction of the flow resulting in periodic transverse vibrations known as the vortex induced vibrations vivs wu et al 2012b according to modarres sadeghi et al 2011 the vortex induced response of a riser is a complex phenomenon and continuously shifts between a stationary state and a chaotic state also when the frequency of the vortices i e the vortex shedding frequency is close to one of the natural frequencies of the riser the so called lock in phenomenon occurs whereby the riser manifests large vibrations xue et al 2008 noted that the riser can experience either single or multi mode i e excitation of multiple modes lock in responses for more details interested readers can refer to the papers on the topic of viv sarpkaya 1979 vandiver et al 2009 risers ought to confront continuous loads jeans et al 2003 which are the main cause of fatigue damage collette 2011 collette and incecik 2006 elosta et al 2014 hodapp et al 2015 jensen 1990 2015 marsh et al 2016 yuan et al 2014 zhu and collette 2017 fatigue the main concern reflecting the structural integrity of a riser is caused by both the inline i e in the direction of a flow and the transverse i e perpendicular to the direction of the flow forces xue et al 2014 early works ignored the contribution of the inline forces to fatigue damage however later investigations revealed that the fatigue causing effects of the inline forces and the transverse forces are equally important lie and kaasen 2006 trim et al 2005 according to baarholm et al 2006 the contribution of the inline forces to fatigue damage is particularly evident for the lower modes of vibration i e the first and second modes whereas that of the transverse forces is clear at the higher modes several subsequent investigations iranpour et al 2008 song et al 2011 were concurrent with those results more recent findings of gao et al 2011 and zhang and tang 2015 have reported that the maximum fatigue damage usually incurs at the boundary ends of the riser along with the damage induced by the currents the one resulting from the movements of the vessel is also a concern with regard to the integration and safety of the riser and the production system according to kuiper et al 2008 the heave i e vertical motion of the vessel can result in i instability caused by the periodic variation of the tension at the top portion of the riser and ii a local dynamic buckling of the riser the latter can be potentially resulted from the occurrence of high bending stresses that can exceed the yield stress of the riser vessel movements will also change the contact angles at the top and bottom ends of the riser with the vessel and the bop of the well respectively according to nguyen et al 2010 if the end angles increase beyond a specific threshold usually 2 the connection between the riser and the bop can be broken the control problem of a riser system is mainly concerned with the suppression of its vibrations caused by the currents and the movements of the vessel caused by the waves the two main control objectives accordingly are the prevention of both the fatigue and instability of the riser in a deep sea the damage caused by the movements of the vessel is significantly less than that caused by the currents as they act over the entire submerged length of the riser trim et al 2005 at a shallow depth however the instability of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel is the main concern perunovic and jensen 2003 the heave motion of a vessel is normally suppressed by mooring the ship to the seabed see the mooring lines in fig 1 which is a passive method rotations such as pitch and yaw meanwhile are more effectively suppressed by active control strategies utilizing thrusters to maintain the desired vessel orientation how et al 2009 regarding fatigue prevention one strategy is to design the riser with a large safety factor leira et al 2005 performed reliability analyses to investigate the effects of different safety factors for controlling fatigue damage of the risers for large depths in relation to the suppression of the vivs passive devices such as spoilers abbassian and moros 1996 and strakes gao et al 2015a can be mounted on the surface of the riser to extend its fatigue life active methods for suppressing the vivs include the proportional integral control rustad et al 2008 proportional integral derivative control jensen et al 2009b optimal control mazzilli and sanches 2011 boundary control choi et al 2004 he et al 2017 kim et al 2005a b kim and hong 2009 nguyen and hong 2010 yang et al 2004 2005a b zhang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 sliding mode control ngo and hong 2012a b and adaptive control hong 1997 hong et al 2002 hong and bentsman 1994a b this review discusses experimental and theoretical investigations of the complex responses of the riser systems under harsh environmental conditions see section 3 most experimental studies have evaluated the responses of the riser models albeit only under simplified e g uniform flow loading conditions moreover the utility of an experimental setup for simulating highly turbulent flows is limited nonetheless several works reported immensely valuable insights into the responses of the riser system see subsection 3 2 theoretical analyses that predict time responses of the riser by solving the relevant equations of motion alternatively can yield more rich data several studies presenting a mathematical formulation of the dynamics hydrodynamic forces and the resultant fluid structure interaction have been reported see section 2 this review includes deterministic i e in both time and frequency domains and non deterministic i e stochastic methods for determining the response of the riser see subsection 3 1 after discussing the dynamics of riser systems vibration control methods based on both passive and active strategies are presented see section 4 in section 5 the following seven research issues are identified i a timoshenko beam model to consider the shear forces ii time varying parameters to incorporate the varying hydrodynamic forces iii 6 dof vessel model to cope with extreme ocean conditions iv a new numerical scheme for real time parameter estimation v enhanced experimental facilities to consider real hydrodynamic loads vi hybrid control techniques combining passive damping devices and active controls and vii control strategies for preventing failure at the end points of the riser due to the movements of the vessel this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the equations of motion of the riser systems and the mathematical formulations of the hydrodynamic forces acting on them section 3 reviews the experimental and theoretical techniques to analyze the response of the riser systems section 4 provides a detailed account of the numerous passive and active control strategies developed for suppressing the vibrations of the risers operating in harsh ocean environments finally section 5 discusses future research issues in relation to the dynamics and control of offshore marine risers 2 riser dynamics a riser system usually is modeled as an euler bernoulli beam that vibrates under the influence of the waves and currents in the ocean and the movements of the vessel fig 1 shows a schematic of a flexible marine riser system wherein d is the diameter ei is the flexural rigidity l is the length u x t is the lateral deflection w x t is the transverse deflection and δ x t is the axial deflection of the riser at position x and time t as indicated the bottom and top ends of the riser are pin jointed to the bop on the seabed and to the surface vessel respectively where ϕ t and θ t are the bottom and top angles of the riser respectively the vessel is considered to undergo three motions heave surge and pitch i e movements in the vertical i ˆ j ˆ plane which are mainly caused by the waves and the wind to restrict such movements the vessel can be moored to the seabed as depicted in fig 1 ocean currents meanwhile which are shown to act along the length of the riser are the main cause of the vivs in the riser in the following subsections various mathematical formulations describing the responses of the riser to different hydrodynamic forces are reviewed for consistency and ease of comparison the symbols appearing in the literature have been unified also the derivatives with respect to t and x are denoted by and respectively 2 1 lateral vibrations huang and dareing 1968 is recognized as the first work in the derivation of the equations of motion of the riser system for analyzing the lateral dynamics i e the motions only in the i ˆ j ˆ plane in which the sea current flows of a flexible drilling riser the following partial differential equation pde was developed 1 e i u x t m r m i g x f v u x t m r m i g u x t m u x t 0 where m r and m i denote the masses per

drilling fluid and the external fluid moving with the pipe and f v is the vertical thrust force acting at the bottom of the riser due to drilling in eq 1 the effects of the ocean currents and waves on the dynamics of the riser were not considered however it certainly leads to a more detailed formulation on the interaction between the riser and the surrounding fluid the inline hydrodynamic force f i x t acting along the j ˆ axis is modeled by the following nonlinear morison equation morison et al 1950 2 f i x t f m x t f d x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x v y x t u x t v y x t u x t where f m x t and f d x t represent the inertial and the drag forces respectively ρ w denotes the density of the water v y x t signifies the horizontal water particle velocity c m is the inertial coefficient and c d stands for the drag coefficient in young et al 1978 the following equation was developed to analyze the lateral vibrations of the riser under the effects of the inline hydrodynamic force f i 3 e i u x t t x γ i a i γ o a o u x t t x p o a o p i a i u x t m u x t f i x t where t denotes the actual riser tension a represents the area of the riser γ stands for the specific weight and p is the fluid pressure and the subscripts i and o signify the properties of the quantities considered inside and outside of the riser respectively in eq 3 a simplified form of the drag force in eq 2 was alternatively proposed assuming that the drag force is caused by a constant velocity of the current v then the drag force is obtained in the following form 4 f d 1 2 ρ w d c d v v later sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 replaced the quadratic term i e v y u v y u of the drag force in eq 2 with a linear expression involving the root mean square value of the relative velocity between the riser and the incident current σ v resulting in the following linear formulation 5 f d x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v v y x t u x t chakrabarti and frampton 1982 derived the following equation of motion of the riser considering the fact that the hydrodynamic forces act along both the horizontal and the vertical axes 6 e i u x t t e x u x t t e x u x t m u x t f i x t where 7 t e x t x a o x p o x a i x p i x and 8 t x t c 0 l ρ r a o x a i x d x 0 l f x x t d x in eqs 6 8 te denotes the effective tension t is the axial tension acting at the center of the riser cross section which varies continuously along the length tc is a constant tension due to the inertial loading of the drilling mud ρr is the weight density of the riser material and fx is the vertical component of the hydrodynamic force caused by the currents and the internal fluid recently fan et al 2017 has developed a new formulation to calculate the effective tension te of a free hanging riser i e when the bottom end of the riser is not connected to the seabed which is given as follows 9 t e x w b o p w s ρ w a o ρ i a i g l x where w bop denotes the weight of the bop valve w s represents the submerged weight per unit length of the riser ρ i signifies the density of the fluid flowing inside the riser and g is the gravitational acceleration later niedzwecki and liagre 2003 in consideration of both linear i e viscous and nonlinear i e due to drag fluid damping have derived the following equation of motion of the riser for the lateral deflection i e along the j ˆ axis 10 e i u x t t e x u x t m u x t c x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v u x t π 4 ρ w d 2 c m x v y x t 1 2 ρ w d c d x 8 π σ v v y x t where c denotes the linear viscous damping coefficient 2 2 vortex induced vibrations for analyzing the transverse vibrations or vivs of the riser the transverse force f t acting along the k ˆ axis has to be included in the forcing function chakrabarti and frampton 1982 initially modeled the transverse force as 11 f t x t 1 2 ρ w d c l x t v y x t u x t 2 where c l denotes the lift coefficient the transverse force is a consequence of the vortex shedding phenomenon therefore to incorporate the oscillating effect due to vortex shedding of the transverse force faltinsen 1990 proposed the following equation 12 f t x t 1 2 ρ w d c l x t v y x t 2 cos 2 π f v t φ z where φ z is the phase angle along the k ˆ axis and f v is the vortex shedding frequency represented by the following equation 13 f v st v y x t d where st is the strouhal number furnes 2000 investigated the vivs of the riser subject to the transverse force by using the following pde 14 e i w x t t e x w x t t e x w x t c w x t m w x t f t x t in sagatun et al 2002 the pde used to investigate the vivs of the riser also included the term c r v w x t to consider the damping effects due to the relative velocity between the riser and the current 15 e i w x t t e x w x t t e x w x t c w x t c r v w x t m w x t f t x t where c r denotes the linear damping parameter associated with the dissipation of energy due to the relative velocity between the riser and the water 2 2 1 wake oscillator model another way to investigate the vivs of the riser is to consider two coupled differential equations that model the dynamics of the riser and the wake separately to model the vivs of a riser facchinetti et al 2004 utilized the following single degree of freedom spring mass damper equation considering an elastically mounted rigid cylinder under the influence of wakes 16 m w t c w t k w t f t t where k is the stiffness of the riser the equation describing the wake dynamics was given as follows 17 q t η ω v q t 2 1 q t ω v 2 q t β w t where η is the van der pol parameter ω v 2πstv d is the strouhal circular frequency q t is the local fluctuating lift coefficient and β is the linear coupling coefficient in eq 17 q t 2c l t c l0 where c l0 0 3 is a constant lift coefficient η ω v q t 2 1 q t is the viscous damping term and β w t is the acceleration coupling term for modeling the effect of the riser structure on the fluid in the wake region in earlier models le cunff et al 2002 sarpkaya 1979 a velocity coupling term β w t was considered instead of β w t the coupling between the structure and the wake has been established by modeling the transverse force as f t t 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c l 0 2 q t xu et al 2008 eqs 16 and 17 are collectively known as the wake oscillator model keber and wiercigroch 2008 li et al 2010 lin et al 2009 nishi and doan 2015 xue et al 2011 violette et al 2007 proposed a distributed wake oscillator model in which the dynamics of the wake and the riser respectively were accounted for by the following pdes 18 w x t χ ω f r m w x t λ 2 w x t κ 2 w x t ω f 2 m q x t 19 q x t η ω f q x t 2 1 q x t ω f 2 q x t β w x t where χ c d 4πst is the stall coefficient ω f ω v ω ref is the non dimensional shedding frequency where ω ref 2πstv ref d is the strouhal circular frequency at an arbitrary reference flow velocity v ref r m m ρ w d 2 is the mass ratio λ 2 t m dω ref 2 is the non dimensional tension κ 2 ei m d 2 ω ref 2 is the non dimensional bending stiffness and m c l0 2 8π2st2 r m is a coefficient of the forcing term acting on the structure due to the wake dynamics distributed wake dynamics model eq 19 was later utilized by meng and chen 2012 and srinil et al 2009 to model the unsteady hydrodynamic forces for the analysis of the vibrational behavior of a catenary riser in the 3d space also to incorporate the cellular vortex shedding feature caused by a sheared flow in the wake dynamics equation srinil 2011 added the diffusion term τ q to the left hand side of eq 19 where τ is the diffusion parameter in all the wake oscillator models discussed to this point the parameters η β c l0 and c d were considered to be constants contrastingly in mukundan et al 2009 to model the randomness shown in the experimental data provided by the norwegian deepwater program see trim et al 2005 those parameters were considered to be randomly varying along the length of the riser 2 3 effect of internal fluid investigations by chatjigeorgiou 2017 and wu and lou 1991 revealed that the internal fluid has a significant effect on the tension of the riser whose effect was early described in the equations of the lateral motion of the riser developed by young et al 1978 eq 3 and chakrabarti and frampton 1982 eq 6 however those formulations assumed the internal fluid to be at rest therefore to incorporate the effect of the speed of the internal fluid seyed and patel 1992 modified the equation for the effective tension t e eq 7 as follows 20 t e x t x a o x p o x a i x p i x ρ i v i 2 a i where ρ i and v i denote the density and the average velocity of the internal fluid respectively considering eq 20 kuiper and metrikine 2005 modified eq 3 to incorporate the effect of the velocity of the internal fluid in the following pde 21 e i u x t x t x u x t ρ r a i v i 2 u x t 2 v i u x t u x t x a o p o x a i p i x u x t ρ r a 0 a i u x f i x t later kuiper et al 2007 revealed that the fluid transported by the riser also contributes to the drag part in the inline force the following nonlinear equation was formulated to depict their finding 22 f d x t α 1 μ i l u x t 1 2 α 2 ρ w l d u x t u x t where α 1 and α 2 are the two unknown dimensionless constants and μ i denotes the dynamic viscosity of the fluid conveyed by the riser in investigating the impact of the internal fluid on the vivs guo et al 2004 found that the effect of the internal fluid velocity on the vivs is strong when the natural frequency of the riser is close to the vortex shedding frequency whose effects however can be decreased by increasing the tension at the top of the riser dai et al 2014b developed the following pde to investigate the effect of the internal flow on the vivs of the riser 23 m w x t m i v i l x t v i x t 2 e a 2 l 0 l w x t 2 d x w x t 2 m i v i x t w x t e i w x t f t x t where m i denotes the mass per unit length of the fluid transported by the riser later eq 23 was updated by dai et al 2014a to include the effect of base excitations on the vivs of the riser a new term m w l t was added to the forcing function to model the base excitations the new model reveals that the base excitations can be utilized to control the amplitude of the vivs 2 4 multi dimensional riser models all of the formulations discussed thus far were developed to investigate the lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser separately however in reality the lateral and transverse vibrations are coupled due to the vortex shedding i e the vortex shedding generates oscillating forces along both the k ˆ and j ˆ axes yuan et al 2017 the transverse force along the k ˆ axis f t z is given by eq 12 whereas that along the j ˆ axis is given as follows faltinsen 1990 24 f t y x t a c cos 4 π f v t ϕ y where a c is the amplitude of the oscillating current and φ y is the phase angle along the j ˆ axis srinil and zanganeh 2012 developed a two dimensional 2d riser model for representation and analysis of the coupled lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser where the riser was treated as a flexibly mounted circular cylinder i e a spring mass damper system subject to a uniform flow equation 16 was modified so as to obtain the following two coupled odes for modeling the lateral and transverse vibrations of the cylinder 25 m y u t c y u t k y u t α 1 y u t 3 α 2 y u t w t 2 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c d c l w t v 26 m z w t c z w t k z w t α 1 z w t 3 α 2 z w t u t 2 1 2 ρ w d v 2 c l c d w t v where α 1 y α 2 y α 1 z and α 2 z are the geometrical coefficients the subscripts y and z appearing in the parameters m c and k define their properties along the lateral j ˆ axis and the transverse k ˆ axis directions respectively equations 25 and 26 which are duffing oscillators have cubic nonlinear terms u 3 and w 3 that model the axial stretching feature of the riser along with the terms uw 2 and wu 2 that model the coupling between the lateral and transverse deflections nguyen et al 2013 later developed a more realistic 2d model based on the pdes that considered the riser as a flexible euler bernoulli beam in this model the coupling between the transverse and lateral vibrations due to environmental forces was also considered 27 m u x t e a 2 3 u x t 2 u x t w x t 2 u x t 2 u x t w x t w x t t u x t e i u x t f i y x t f t y x t 28 m w x t e a 2 3 w x t 2 w x t u x t 2 w x t 2 w x t u x t u x t t w x t e i w x t f i z x t f t z x t where f i y and f i z denote the inline forces and f t y and f t z signify the transverse forces along the j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 27 and 28 are given as follows 29 f i y x t π 4 c m ρ w d 2 v y x t c y 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ y u x t 30 f i z x t π 4 c m ρ w d 2 v z x t c z 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ z w x t 31 f t y z t 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ y x t v y x t 32 f t z x t 1 2 c d ρ w d 8 π σ z x t v z x t where c y and c z denote the linear viscous damping coefficients v y and v z represent the water particle velocities and σ y and σ z signify the root mean square values of the corresponding water particle velocities along the j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively in do and pan 2009 meng and chen 2012 and srinil et al 2009 pdes for investigating the transverse lateral and axial vibrations of the riser in the 3d space were formulated the equations were of the form already discussed above however the coupling parts between the three different types of deflections of the riser see eqs 27 and 28 were not considered 2 5 numerical models for lumped mass systems chai et al 2002 shah and hong 2014 the equations of motion were given in the form of ordinary differential equations odes which can easily be solved analytically however for distributed parameter systems it is not always feasible to obtain an exact or an analytical solution of the system particularly nonlinear pdes therefore in such cases numerical methods for example the finite element method fem the rigid finite element method rfem the finite difference method fdm etc are employed to obtain approximate solutions such methods are used to first discretize the domain of the system in terms of spatial entities i e lengths areas or volumes and then based on the discretization scheme an approximate model of the system is formulated which can easily be solved numerically fem is the most widely used numerical approach cuamatzi melendez et al 2017 wherein the riser is discretized into a finite number of elements first then odes are developed for each element considering the mass and the external internal forces concentrated on the node i e the center of individual elements or the connection point between the elements and finally the equations of individual elements are stacked together to obtain the global equation of motion of the riser in a matrix form for example patel and jesudasen 1987 developed the following global equation for the lateral motion of the riser under the effect of waves and the movements of a vessel 33 m u c u ku f y f v where m c and k denote the global matrices of the mass the damping and the stiffness of the riser u u and u represent the vectors of the accelerations velocities and deflections of the nodes of the riser respectively f y signifies the vector of the forces due to buoyancy and the weight of the riser and f v is the vector for the excitations of the vessel which were modeled in the following form 34 f v m y ρ c m 1 v y where y and v denote the vectors of the accelerations of the vessel derived from the transfer function between the waves and the movements of the vessel and the volumes of the elements of the riser respectively later chen and lin 1989 modified the global equation of motion eq 33 to include the effect of the movements of the vessel in a different way the following formulation was introduced 35 m u c u ku f y c 0 u 0 k 0 u 0 where c0 and k0 represent the matrices of the influence coefficients and u0 and u 0 are the vectors of the deflection and the velocity at the top end of the riser respectively to simulate the vivs in consideration of the effects of the internal fluid yamamoto et al 2004 utilized the fem to convert the previously developed pde eq 14 into the following global equation for the transverse motion of the riser 36 m w c w kw f z where w represents the vector of transverse deflections of the riser and f z denotes the vector for the hydrodynamic force acting along the k ˆ axis in eq 36 the global mass matrix m also includes the effects of the internal fluid later in simulating the vivs huera huarte et al 2006 modified eq 36 by considering the damping matrix c as a linear combination of the global mass matrix m and stiffness matrix k i e rayleigh damping which are given in the following form 37 c α m β k where α 0 0555 and β 0 0002 whose values were obtained by comparing their simulation results with the data acquired from the experiments conducted by delta flume in holland during may 2003 further developments in simulating the vivs were reported in chen et al 2012 2016 where the force vector f z in eq 36 includes the components of both the transverse and the drag forces along the k ˆ axis so far we have discussed the fem based formulations developed for investigating only the lateral or only the transverse responses of the riser for simulating the responses of the riser in the 3d space one way is to discretize the riser into a finite number of linear spring elements each element consisting of two nodes with each node having three degrees of freedom i e lateral u i transverse w i and axial δ i nodal deflections where the subscript i stands for the i th node this results in the following nodal equations of motion taylor 1977 38 m i i s i t i f i q i where i denotes the 3 3 identity matrix s i u i w i δ i represents the nodal position vector t i is the vector of the nodal tension f i stands for the force vector consisting of the drag force the inertia force and the riser s weight concentrated at the node and q i signifies the nodal vector representing the constant shear force later yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a more detailed 3d formulation for the riser considering nodal rotations ϑ i x ϑ i y and ϑ i z about the i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively in addition to the lateral transverse and axial deflections of the nodes thereby resulting in six degrees of freedom at each node i e s i u i w i δ i ϑ i x ϑ i y ϑ i z later a new 3d formulation was proposed by athisakul et al 2011 to investigate the bending twisting and axial deformations of a flexible riser caused by the internal fluid considering s i u i w i ε i where ε i denotes the nodal strain other than fem the rfem has also been utilized in modeling the riser systems in which the riser is discretized into a finite number of rigid finite elements that are connected with each other by means of massless spring damper elements based on the rfem adamiec wojcik et al 2015 investigated the bending and elongation of the riser in the i ˆ j ˆ plane upon the movements of the vessel first the riser was discretized into small rigid elements having four degrees of freedom i e the position coordinates x e and y e of the element along the i ˆ and j ˆ axes respectively the axial deflection δ e of the element i e along the k ˆ axis and the rotation of the element ϑ e about the k ˆ axis s e x e y e δ e ϑ e the following form of the global equation of motion of the riser was achieved 39 m s dr f where m is the global mass matrix s s 1 t s 2 t s n t t is the vector of the generalized coordinates of the system r is the vector of the reaction forces due to the constraints of the connections between the elements d is the matrix of the coefficients associated with the constraints and f is the force vector consisting of buoyancy drag and inertial forces later drag 2017 modified the formulation in eq 39 to make each element to have five degrees of freedom i e the position coordinates x e y e and z e along i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes and the rotations ϑ e x and ϑ e z about the i ˆ and k ˆ axes respectively s e x e y e z e ϑ e x ϑ e z another approach similar to the rfem for modeling the offshore structures is the finite segment method fsm xu and wang 2012 in fsm a slender body e g the marine riser is first discretized into a series of flexible segments and then the deflections of the segment and the external forces acting on the segment are independently analyzed consequently the deformation of the whole structure is decomposed into micro deformations of the flexible segments and the governing equations are listed according to the equilibria of the moments on the individual segments xu et al 2013 besides the fem rfem the fdm is the secondly most widely used numerical method for solving the equations of motion of the riser systems in the fdm the length of the riser is first discretized into a finite number of small spatial segments δx resulting in n number of nodal points i e x 1 x 2 x n along the length of the riser then to obtain the response of the riser in time domain the pde is discretized both in space and time by converting its derivative terms both in space and time into algebraic approximations which are functions of δx and the discrete time interval δt by using the taylor series expansion the resulting equations are then solved for obtaining the responses at all spatial points for example jain 1994 developed the following fdm based formulation to perform the static analysis of the riser system i e only the spatial discretization was performed 40 1 δ x 4 e i w i 2 2 w i 1 w i i 1 2 e i i w i 1 2 w i w i 1 e i i 1 w i 2 w i 1 w i 2 t i δ x 2 w i 1 2 w i w i 1 f t i where the index i denotes the discretization in space later in analyzing the dynamic response of a catenary riser the following formulation based on fdm was developed by chatjigeorgiou 2008 41 s i j 1 s i j s i 1 j 1 s i 1 j 2 δ x s i j 1 s i 1 j 1 s i j s i 1 j 2 δ t f i j 1 f i 1 j

u t components of the lateral velocity of the riser the curvature φ of the riser and the angle ψ between the riser s tangent and the j ˆ axis equation 41 investigates the response of the riser in 2d to simulate the vortex induced vibrations of the riser huang et al 2011a discretized eq 14 by implementing the centered space and forward time finite difference scheme to obtain the following equations of motion of the riser along the k ˆ axis 42 e i δ x 4 w i 2 j t i δ x 2 t i 2 δ x 4 e i δ x 4 w i 1 j e i δ x 4 w i 2 j 2 t i δ x 2 6 e i δ x 4 m δ t 2 c δ t w i j t i δ x 2 t i 2 δ x 4 e i δ x 4 w i 1 j f t i j 2 m δ t 2 c δ t w i j 1 m δ t 2 w i j 2 to investigate the response of the riser in the 3d space chatjigeorgiou 2008 developed an fdm based formulation considering s t q n q t u w δ φ n φ t ϑ ψ where q n and q t denote the components of the shear force whereas φ n and φ t represent the components of the curvature of the riser along the normal and tangential directions respectively the discretized governing equations of motion were obtained in a matrix form as follows 43 m i j 1 m i j s i j 1 s i j δ t m i 1 j 1 m i 1 j s i 1 j 1 s i 1 j δ t k i 1 j 1 k i j 1 s i j

later doan and nishi 2015 utilized the same formulation given by eq 43 to investigate the response of the riser in the 3d space considering the wake oscillator model for generating the vortex induced force the fluid structure modeling techniques discussed thus far neglect the interaction of the fluid with the entire external surface of the riser which can be accounted for by modeling the complete 3d flow around the riser using the navier stokes equation because the aspect ratio of the riser is very large and the flow around it is very complex a complete 3d analysis is infeasible rather a simpler approach known as the strip theory meneghini et al 2004 willden and graham 2001 2004 vidic perunovic and jensen 2005 is utilized which applies the hydrodynamic forces modeled in a 2d plane or strips on the surface of the riser then the solution for the combined system i e the flow and the riser model is obtained by implementing a computational fluid dynamics cfd program some important works in the field of mathematical riser modeling is summarized in table 1 3 riser analysis extensive analyses have been performed both experimentally and theoretically i e through computer simulations to understand the behavior of the riser system operating in harsh environmental conditions a thorough review of those analyses is presented below 3 1 theoretical analysis to analyze a riser system theoretically the equations of motion must be solved either analytically to obtain the exact solution or numerically to obtain an approximate solution in analytical methods aranha et al 2001a atadan et al 1997 chucheepsakul et al 2003 gu et al 2013b ramos and pesce 2003 sparks 2002 yang and xiao 2014 a mathematical form of the solution i e the deflection of the riser of the riser s equation of motion was usually assumed for example in kirk et al 1979 the deflection was assumed to be a sinusoidal series another approach for obtaining an analytical solution is by applying the normal mode method i e modal superposition e g furnes 2000 in numerical techniques in contrast approximation methods e g fem fdm and the finite volume method are used to obtain an approximate solution of the equations of motion of the system since the works involving analytical solutions are limited patel and seyed 1995 this review will focus mainly on the numerical techniques for analyzing the riser systems 3 1 1 static and dynamic analyses theoretical solutions to the equations of motion of a riser system can be obtained by either static or dynamic analyses in this subsection a detailed review on the static and dynamic analysis methods is presented some earlier reviews on the said topic may be found in chen et al 2006 larsen 1992 and patel and seyed 1995 static riser analysis is performed to obtain the deflected shape of the riser under a constant load distribution jain 1994 santillan and virgin 2011 in such cases the inertia term m w in the equations of motion of the riser for example eq 14 is not considered and the hydrodynamic force given by eq 4 i e a steady current profile is considered as the forcing function in dynamic analyses meanwhile the deflected shape of the riser is obtained in consideration of the inertia term the time varying load distribution and the movements of the vessel chakrabarti and frampton 1982 dynamic analyses can be categorized into three types kirk et al 1979 i time domain or time history analysis ii frequency domain analysis and iii stochastic or non deterministic analysis both the time and frequency domain techniques are based on deterministic solutions of the riser equations time domain analyses in comparison with those in the frequency domain provide more general solutions for example the nonlinear drag term and the variation in buoyancy near the surface can be included in the analysis however frequency domain analyses usually are performed to obtain a steady state solution to the fatigue problem where the wave forces and the motions of the vessel are assumed to be harmonic young et al 1978 whereas fatigue analyses have been performed mostly in the frequency domain several time domain fatigue analyses have been reported recently thorsen et al 2015 wang et al 2015c xue et al 2015 on the other hand stochastic analyses based on non deterministic solutions are based on the modal superposition method random vibration which requires the linearization of time dependent loads including nonlinear drag forces jensen 2011 3 1 1 1 frequency and time domain analyses young et al 1978 performed a frequency domain analysis for analyzing the stresses and fatigues on the riser subject to excitations from the waves and the movements of the vessel the response of the riser caused by random waves was utilized to predict the stresses while the response caused by the regular waves was utilized to predict the fatigue later in kirk et al 1979 a frequency domain analysis was performed to predict the dynamic and static stresses of the riser subject to the movements of the vessel it was concluded that the movements of the vessel in comparison to the drag forces induced by the currents play a more vital role in generating the bending stresses benassai and campanile 2002 performed a frequency domain analysis using the modal priority technique in order to predict the multi mode vivs of a flexible riser under the actions of waves and currents the employed technique was based on the amplitudes of the active vibration modes rather than their frequencies to predict the multi modal oscillations of the riser under a sheared flow condition modarres sadeghi et al 2010 performed a frequency domain analysis to investigate the effect of higher modes on the fatigue life of a flexible riser they found that consideration of higher modes in the analysis resulted in a significant decrease in the fatigue life of the riser mukundan et al 2010 performed a combined time and frequency domain analysis using the wavelet transform technique for reconstructing the vortex induced response of a flexible riser they then utilized the reconstructed response to analyze the fatigue damage on the riser response reconstruction was achieved for two separate cases i when a large number of sensors were placed along the length of the riser and ii when only a small number of sensors was used shi et al 2012 employed the weighted wave form analysis wwa technique to reconstruct the response of a flexible marine riser and concluded that for that purpose sensor positioning is more important than the number of sensors used shi et al 2014 also demonstrated the effectiveness of the wwa technique as combined with field measurements to predict the long term fatigue damage to the riser system considered recently a new approach based on a variance reduction technique for analyzing the long term fatigue damage in conjunction with the time domain simulations has been proposed in gao and low 2016 patel and jesudasen 1987 performed a time domain dynamic analysis to simulate the lateral response of a flexible riser subject to the movements of the vessel and disturbance loads due to the currents and waves using the fem they obtained a numerical solution to the equations of motion however using their proposed method they could not simulate the vivs of the riser a simulation of the vivs was later reported in chen and lin 1989 who developed a numerical scheme based on the newmark method to simulate the responses in consideration of the effects of the static and dynamic offsets of the surface vessel and disturbance loads due to waves and currents sagatun et al 2002 presented a time domain analysis for determining the vivs of two adjacent risers moving relative to each other in a steady flow the main purpose of their study was to predict whether the two risers would collide while moving in the presence of wakes later a numerical investigation by chen and kim 2010 revealed that the velocity of the external current and the distance between two adjacent risers are the most significant factors in influencing the vivs of the considered two adjacent risers a nonlinear fem based scheme was developed in kaewunruen et al 2005 to evaluate the nonlinear free vibrations of a flexible marine riser conveying internal fluid according to their results flexural rigidity has the most significant impact on the response the higher the flexural rigidity is the stiffer the vibrational responses are in huera huarte et al 2006 eq 14 was solved using the fem to investigate the vivs of a flexible cylinder and to determine the hydrodynamic forcing function from the experimental data of chaplin et al 2005a a more detailed fem based algorithm subsequently was developed by monprapussorn et al 2007 to investigate the effects of the internally flowing fluid on the response of an extensible marine riser that study revealed that the impulsive acceleration of the internal fluid affected the stability of the riser significantly specifically by shifting the equilibrium positions later guo et al 2008 utilized the galerkin approximation method to analyze the effects of the internally flowing fluid on the vivs of a top tensioned riser an advanced fem based simulation scheme for investigating the vivs of a flexible riser was reported in chen et al 2012 who additionally considered variations in the structural parameters along the length of the riser in their formulation their results revealed that for lower modes a high amplitude riser response occurred at the position where the tension was small whereas for higher modes the same high amplitude response occurred at the riser position where the bending stiffness was low chen et al 2014 applied the fem to their study of the impact of the heave motion of the vessel on the vivs of the riser they found that the heave motion has a significant impact on the displacements of the riser particularly in the lower modes soon thereafter chen et al 2015 performed an fem based time domain dynamic analysis of a flexible riser isolating the occurrence of a nonlinear response amplification phenomenon signifying the response amplification at the top end with the propagation along the length of the riser in another recent study adamiec wojcik et al 2015 developed an fem based algorithm to simulate the bending and longitudinal displacements of a freely hanging riser subject to vessel movements and ocean loads they were able to demonstrate the capability of the developed algorithm to avoid a contact of the riser tip with an obstacle on the seabed by controlling the movements of the vessel recently a fem based dynamic analysis of the marine riser conducted by mao et al 2016b revealed that increasing the top tension of the riser can significantly reduce the large lateral deflection and the bending movement of the riser under extreme environmental loads also chen et al 2016 reported an fem based time domain analysis for investigating the multi mode vivs of a flexible marine riser subject to stepped and shear flows the fem based investigation of meng et al 2017 has revealed that the multi mode vivs can be caused by the changes in the velocity of the internal fluid in teixeira and morooka 2017 an fem based analysis of the vivs of the risers was performed in their analysis the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients was achieved in real time recently in khan and ahmad 2018 a 3d nonlinear dynamic analysis of a riser was performed in the time domain using the finite element solver abaqus the response history was then utilized in performing a fatigue reliability assessment by using monte carlo simulations one of the earliest studies on simulating the responses of risers in the 3d space is ghadimi 1988 who utilized a numerical scheme combining the tangent stiffness incremental approach with the wilson theta numerical integration algorithm to obtain the lateral transverse and axial deflections of the riser under the effect of the hydrodynamic forces modeled by morison equation later herfjord et al 1999 employed the cfd computations to simulate the vivs of a flexible riser in the 3d space by utilizing the strip theory as discussed in subsection 2 5 to impose the hydrodynamic forces on the surface of the riser then yazdchi and crisfield 2002 developed a nonlinear scheme based on the fem to simulate the responses namely bending axial and shear deformations of a flexible riser in the 3d space meneghini et al 2004 performed a cfd based analysis to simulate the vivs of a flexible cylinder subject to both uniform and sheared flow conditions they simulated the hydrodynamic forces by means of the distributed vortex method dvm which is a lagrangian numerical technique for modeling of 2d incompressible and viscous fluid flows yamamoto et al 2004 adopted the same simulation scheme to analyze the vivs of a vertical riser the cfd analysis of a vertical riser subject to a uniform current also was reported in willden and graham 2004 where it was demonstrated that the simulation of multi modal vivs can be achieved if the vortex shedding frequency varies along the length of the riser athisakul et al 2011 used the fem to analyze both the static and dynamic responses of a fluid transporting riser in the 3d space sun et al 2012 developed a new strip wise discrete vortex method to simulate the vivs of flexible risers also in the 3d space and calculated the vivs at each strip using the finite volume method combined with the incremental method to simulate the fluid structure interaction zhang et al 2013 analyzed the experimental data of the vivs by utilizing the fem specifically for estimating the tangential transverse and longitudinal hydrodynamic forces acting on them recently madani et al 2016 utilized the strip theory in simulating the multi mode vivs of flexible risers although the riser analyses have mostly used the fem several works have utilized the fdm wanderley and levi 2005 presented a finite difference numerical scheme based on beam and warming approximation formula for simulating the vivs of a flexible marine riser chatjigeorgiou 2008 used the fdm in developing an algorithm for analyzing the stability of the riser subject to vessel movements in the 2d space later the samefinite difference scheme was updated by chatjigeorgiou 2010a b to investigate the response of the riser in the 3d space the proposed scheme could also analyze the effect of internally flowing fluid on the response of the riser another algorithm based on the fdm was developed in huang et al 2011a for investigating the 3d response of a top tensioned riser considered as a tensioned beam considering the riser as a tensioned beam a 3d fdm based algorithm was utilized in jung et al 2012 to investigate the vivs of the riser under the influence of both the inline and transverse hydrodynamic forces wang et al 2014b developed a numerical scheme based on the fdm for analyzing the stresses and deformations of a flexible marine riser under the combined effect of the axial and lateral hydrodynamic forces they found that the stresses in the structure of the riser increase with the drag speed while bending deformation increases with the depth of water and decreases with the size of the riser recently doan and nishi 2015 employed an fdm based scheme combined with the wake oscillator model to simulate the vivs of a flexible riser they discovered however that their proposed method needed to be improved for predicting more accurate amplitudes and frequencies of the responses torres et al 2015 developed an fdm based algorithm for application to a nonlinear analysis in estimating the structural parameters of the riser kamble and chen 2016 utilized the finite analytical navier stokes technique based on the finite volume method in predicting the vivs and fatigue damages to the riser upon inline and cross flows recently a fdm based numerical analysis was performed in lei et al 2017 to investigate the transverse deflections and bending stresses in the riser exposed to the coupled axial and transverse loads considering a time varying tension caused by the heave movements of the vessel 3 1 1 2 stochastic analysis sagrilo et al 2000 performed a stochastic analysis to predict the tension at the top end of the riser under the influence of the heave excited motions of the surface vessel in aranha and pinto 2001 an analytical approximation of the probability density function of the dynamic tension in riser systems was developed which requires an estimation of the statistical parameters of the dynamic tension using numerical simulation in another work aranha et al 2001b estimated random excitations in the structure of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel mukundan et al 2009 developed a stochastic algorithm based on a wake oscillator model with randomly varying parameters to predict the minimum fatigue life of marine risers and used experimental data provided by the norwegian deepwater program trim et al 2005 for the validation of their proposed prediction algorithm srivilairit and manuel 2009 statistically investigated the acceleration of the riser and the coincident velocity profiles of the current in formulating the relationship between those profiles and the response of the riser they applied the proper orthogonal decomposition method i e a numerical scheme for statistical analysis to analyze full scale field data obtained from a deepwater drilling site sun et al 2014 performed a stochastic analysis of the inline and transverse vibrations of a flexible riser considering the vortex induced response as a stationary random process and calculating it by the pseudo excitation method low and srinil 2016 proposed a stochastic approach based on the point estimate method to conduct fatigue analyses which revealed that the randomness of wake coefficients in the wake oscillator model leads to large variability in fatigue 3 2 experimental analysis thus far we have discussed a number of mathematical models and analysis techniques employed in investigating riser systems to ensure the validity of these models and techniques by comparison of the theoretical results with experimental data a proper experimental paradigm setup needs to be established a special attention to the design of such experimental setup is required which often requires in turn the design of a test rig having eigen frequencies lower than that of the first eigen frequency of the riser trim et al 2005 so that the effect of the rig to the responses of the riser can be minimized furthermore the experimental model must be able to predict the behavior of the actual system which can be achieved by implementing the similarity theory fontaine et al 2006 guo et al 2006 queau et al 2013 shah et al 2017 also the experimental data obtained from the sensors i e accelerometers and angular rate devices attached to the riser must be processed into the form suitable for validating the theoretical models kaasen and lie 2003 applied the methods of modal decomposition and the least squares combined with frequency domain calculations to extract useful experimental data related to the lateral vibrations of the riser under the influence of steady currents experimental investigations on the inline and transverse vibrations of a flexible riser subject to uniform currents have been reported in the literature several times chaplin et al 2005b gu et al 2013a guo and lou 2008a mao et al 2016a trim et al 2005 where the uniform current typically having been generated by towing a cylinder in a tank containing still water chaplin et al 2005a designed a special experimental facility to investigate the transverse and lateral vibrations of a vertical tensioned model riser subject to a stepped current they were able to measure the responses to vortex excitations up to the eighth mode in the transverse direction and to the fourteenth in the lateral direction the obtained experimental data thereby were later used by huera huarte et al 2006 to numerically calculate the inline and transverse forces on a flexible cylinder chaplin et al 2005b also performed experiments to measure the transverse and lateral vibrations of a vertical model riser subject to a stepped current they compared their experimental measurements with the simulated data for the transverse and lateral vibrations of eleven different empirical and cfd based studies the comparison of experimental and numerical predictions revealed that the empirical models were more successful in predicting the vivs of the riser than the cfd based ones the experimental data thus obtained was subsequently utilized by ma et al 2014 to validate their algorithm for simulating the vivs trim et al 2005 performed experiments to analyze the inline and transverse responses of a long flexible riser model considering different arrangements of the helical strakes which are mounted on the surface of the riser for suppressing the vivs i e passive suppression it was revealed that the length of the riser covered with helical strakes as well as the nature of flow are the two main factors to be considered in the design of a riser from the stand point of fatigue prevention wang et al 2014a performed experiments in an ocean basin to investigate both the inline and transverse vibrations of a steel catenary model riser subject to the movements of the vessel they were able to confirm that the movements of the vessel cause vivs and that the fatigue damage is more sensitive to the amplitude rather than the period of the movements later the experimental investigation of wang et al 2015a on the vivs of a flexible riser subject to an oscillatory flow caused by the heave motion of the surface vessel revealed a strong dependence of fatigue damage on the keulegan carpenter kc number of the flow in fact an inverse relation between fatigue damages and kc numbers was observed fatigue damage was found to be greater at a smaller value of kc number rather than at larger ones in wang et al 2015b meanwhile an empirical relationship among the dominant frequency of the riser the maximum equivalent velocity of the flow and the kc number was obtained the ratio of the dominant frequency of the riser and the frequency of the oscillating flow was found to be equal to the product of the st and the kc numbers corresponding to the maximum flow velocity during operation a long flexible riser can undergo either the single or multi mode lock in phenomenon multi mode vivs fan et al 2015 huang et al 2011b of risers have been analyzed in a number of studies in investigating the multi mode lock in phenomenon marcollo and hinwood 2006 performed experiments entailing simultaneous excitation of the vivs of a flexible riser model at two different resonant modes which resulted in an unexpected phenomenon of single mode lock in only at a higher frequency experimental investigations of song et al 2011 revealed that their flexible riser model underwent a multi mode lock in behavior while subject to both inline and transverse vibrations under a uniform current profile however the vibration amplitude in the inline direction was found to be considerably smaller than that of the transverse direction also the frequency of the inline vibrations was found to be approximately twice that of the transverse vibrations in all these studies mentioned above the vivs of the riser were analyzed under the effect of a uniform current profile mao et al 2014 in contrast performed experiments to investigate the multi mode lock in behavior of a flexible model riser under the effect of shear flow wherein the experiments were conducted in a deepwater offshore basin rather than a water tank the tests were performed at two different reynolds numbers i e re 1105 and 2761 at re 1 105 the frequencies of the inline and transverse vibrations during lock in were found to be the same which was not the case for the uniform current however for re 2 761 the frequency of inline vibrations was found to be twice that of the transverse vibrations i e the same result reported earlier by song et al 2011 for a uniform current mao et al 2015 later demonstrated experimentally that under shear flow the vortex shedding frequency differs at different points of the riser i e along its length but that the frequency of the vivs remains the same the experimental works addressed above were undertaken to address the most commonly occurring problems related to the complex vibrations in the risers there are also several other studies that have addressed some of the uncommon yet very important issues fontaine et al 2006 experimentally investigated the vibrations due to interference between two risers in tandem configurations they found that the root mean square value of the motion deflection of the downstream rear riser was more than twice the value of the upstream front riser this was due to the fact that the motion of the rear riser was influenced not only by its own wake but also by the vortices generated by the front riser i e wake induced oscillations guo and lou 2008b performed the first experiment analyzing the effect of the internal flow on the response of the riser determining that increasing the internal flow resulted in an increased strain in both the inline and transverse directions and a decreased natural frequency liu et al 2014 performed experiments to investigate the effects of the tension of the drill pipe on the vivs revealing that the vivs can be suppressed by increasing the tension of the drill pipe recently xu et al 2018 performed experiments to investigate the multi mode vibration behavior of two side by side flexible cylinders risers by towing them in a water tank their investigations revealed that the risers exhibited large oscillations in the inline direction as compared to those in the transverse direction 4 riser control as discussed in the preceding section a number of studies have analyzed the riser responses under various load conditions in this section the schemes specifically related to the prevention or suppression by both passive and active control strategies of harmful vibrations of the risers and especially fatigue damage will be reviewed 4 1 passive control passive control strategies include modifications of the riser s structural rigidity internal fluid s velocity the top tension structural damping and other means meng and zhu 2015 the most applicable passive control procedure for the suppression of the vibrations however entails covering the riser along its length with vortex suppression devices for example spoilers abbassian and moros 1996 control rods wu et al 2012a splitter plates lou et al 2016 and helical strakes baarholm et al 2005 holland et al 2017 helical strakes are the most commonly used vibration suppression devices indeed it is experimentally proven that the use of helical strakes can significantly reduce fatigue damage gao et al 2016 2015b abbassian and moros 1996 conducted a feasibility study of the use of air bubble spoilers as a vortex suppression device for a drilling riser subject to uniform flows their work was based on the observation that injection of air bubbles into the flow reduces the vortex induced force but has little effect on the frequency of the riser they found however that air bubble spoilers are not economically feasible for actual risers undergoing large deflections wu et al 2012a carried out an experimental investigation analyzing the capability of control rods for suppressing the vivs of a long tensioned riser they performed the experiments with four slender control rods in parallel with the riser and arranged them at a uniform angle interval of 90 they concluded that by decreasing the spacing between the control rods an effective suppression of the vibration could be achieved provided that the complete length of the riser is covered by the control rods borges et al 2014 explored the use of visco elastic layers which can be assembled along the length of a steel catenary riser resulted in an increased structural damping and thereby reduced vibrations without employing any vibration suppression devices nishi and doan 2015 proposed a method that utilizes only a small number of damping devices for suppression of the transverse vibrations of a flexible marine riser they used the modal control technique to first identify the mode that contributes most to the vivs of the riser and then suppressed it using the damping devices tan et al 2015 compared the responses of composite and steel catenary risers in simulations finding the composite risers to be more vulnerable to vivs and fatigue damage due specifically to their lower structural frequencies it was also shown that assembling small diameter long buoyancy modules at the bottom of the riser resulted in superior vibration suppression as compared to the top of the riser baarholm et al 2005 in an fem based simulation study demonstrated that the use of helical strakes increased the fatigue life of risers in their analysis they used different existing empirical values for the lift and damping coefficients further they performed experiments on a model of the riser to validate the empirical values for the coefficients used in their analysis in trim et al 2005 various configurations of helical strakes were used to evaluate their performances in suppressing the vivs it was revealed that the vivs of the riser were reduced by increasing the coverage area of the strakes on the riser the greater strake coverage also reduced the vivs due to inline forces as compared with those due to the transverse forces lubbad et al 2011 carried out an experimental investigation of the efficiency of round edged helical strakes in suppressing the vibrations of a rigid riser circular cylinder three different parameters the number of starts i e the individual strakes used the pitch the distance along the length of the riser required for one complete turn of the strake and the diameter were varied to obtain twenty eight different configurations of the strakes it was concluded that regardless of the pitch and the diameter of the strake the configuration of three starts was the most efficient among the tested configurations in reducing the amplitudes of vibrations in both the inline and transverse directions in quen et al 2014 an experimental analysis of the effects of the pitch and the height of helical strakes in suppressing the vivs of long risers was carried out it was concluded that although the pitch does not play a vital role in suppressing the amplitude of vibrations a higher pitch nonetheless delays lock in an increased height moreover was found to improve vibration suppression relative to the contribution of pitch experimental investigations reported by gao et al 2015b 2016 likewise concluded that as compared to pitch the height of the strakes has a greater influence on the amplitude of vivs and consequently on the fatigue life of risers under both uniform and sheared flow conditions 4 2 active control besides the passive controls above the vibrations also can be controlled through active means for example rustad et al 2008 implemented a proportional integral control to prevent the collisions of two risers in tandem arrangement and subject to uniform currents their control law was developed to adjust the top tensions of the two risers individually by implementing a feedback control their motivation was to propose a solution to the problem to prevent a collision of two risers in tandem configuration that would be more cost effective than maintaining the top tension at a high constant value or increasing the space between two risers the numerical investigation of mazzilli and sanches 2011 undertaken to address the instability problem of a riser developed a system of optimal control incorporating a linear quadratic regulator lqr for stabilizing the large amplitude vibrations of a steel catenary riser undergoing vivs in their results only a single mode i e the twenty sixth one which has been determined to be the most excited during the vortex induced response of the riser was evaluated and the case of multi mode lock in was not considered fortaleza 2013 designed a p type control law for controlling the displacement at the top boundary of a riser model to suppress the vivs for control design the study also evaluated only one the most excited vibration mode as determined via a modal analysis applying the control law experimentally to a reduced scale riser model a 30 reduction in vivs was achieved boundary control do 2017a do and pan 2008 has been the most widely employed active control method for suppressing the vibrations of flexible marine risers how et al 2009 developed a boundary control law for limiting the upper joint angle of a tensioned riser i e the joint connecting the riser and the surface vessel where the recommended maximum value of the angle was considered to be 2 a boundary control was applied to operate the torque actuator located at the top end of the riser which not only restricted the upper joint angle of the riser but also suppressed the vivs due to the unknown time varying disturbance caused by ocean currents equations 4 and 11 were used to define the oscillating drag and transverse forces respectively in their mathematical model of the riser do and pan 2008 developed a boundary control law for suppressing the transverse vibrations of a flexible marine riser considered as a 2d system as driven by a hydraulic system and subject to waves winds and ocean currents lyapunov direct method and the back stepping technique were utilized in developing the control law to drive the hydraulic system at the top end of the riser the dynamics of the hydraulic actuator also were included in the designed control law do and pan 2009 later extended their control technique to stabilize a coupled 3d riser system i e axial lateral and transverse deflections of the riser were considered subject to inline and transverse drag force components and in consideration of the effective weight of the riser itself ge et al 2010 developed a boundary control law for suppressing the vibrations of a flexible riser in the axial and lateral directions utilizing two actuators at the top end of the riser i e for generating control force in the axial and lateral directions nguyen et al 2013 designed a boundary control law for controlling the displacement and velocity of the top end of the riser to suppress its lateral and transverse vibrations considered to be coupled due to bending their control law was implemented by obtaining a negative feedback of the top angle of the riser and the corresponding angular velocity later in nguyen et al 2014 a boundary control scheme utilizing force and torque inputs at the top end of a flexible riser was developed to suppress the rotational movements of the riser under the effect of transverse and drag inline forces recently he et al 2016 designed a boundary control law to control the lateral vibrations of a flexible marine riser subject to ocean currents and in consideration of the saturation phenomenon of the actuator the boundary control law was implemented at the top boundary of the riser where two cases of feedback i e full state feedback and output feedback were considered in most works discussed above the riser was considered inextensible however do and lucey 2017 developed a boundary control scheme to stabilize the lateral and axial deflections of the riser under the influence of ocean currents considering the riser to be extensible their proposed boundary control laws were implemented at the top boundary of the riser and required a feedback of the deflections and velocities of the top end of the riser recently a new boundary control scheme has been developed by do 2017b to stabilize the extensible marine riser in the 3d space i e considering the deflections of the riser along i ˆ j ˆ and k ˆ axes 4 2 1 active suppression of vessel induced vibrations most works discussed so far dealt with the suppression of the vibrations caused by the ocean s currents however the movements of the vessel caused by the sea waves also have a significant impact on the response of the riser cabrera miranda and paik 2017 kuiper et al 2008 therefore to suppress the vibrations of the riser caused by the movements of the vessel several active control schemes have been proposed zhang and li 2015 proposed a linear quadratic gaussian controller for suppressing the axial stresses of a tensioned riser subject to wave induced motions of the vessel they utilized a strain feedback in implementing their control law for controlling the tension of the riser by using a winch in nguyen et al 2010 the position of the surface vessel was controlled to maintain the bottom end angle of a rigid drilling riser within 2 the proposed control scheme consisted of two parts i keeping the vessel in close proximity to a reference position which was achieved by implementing an integral control of the lengths of mooring lines and ii implementing the proportional integral derivative control law for thruster based heading control of the vessel an experimental floating production storage and offloading vessel model was utilized in validating the proposed control scheme which was found to be feasible only for moderate sea states he et al 2015b developed a boundary control law based on an integral barrier lyapunov function for controlling the top tension of the riser installed in a vessel riser system the control law was designed to control the movements of the surface vessel and to minimize the top end angle of the riser in the case of very large vessel movements to restrict the top tension within a prescribed limit later he et al 2011 developed an adaptive boundary control law for suppressing the transverse vibrations of a flexible riser so as to handle the uncertainties in the parameters of the model and the time variation of ocean currents vessel dynamics also were included in the control model the control input being applied to control the position of the vessel for suppressing the vibrations of the riser he et al 2015a also designed a boundary control law for suppressing the vibrations of both the mooring lines and the riser with the help of a force actuator installed in a vessel mooring riser system table 2 summarizes some of the important works published in the field of riser vibration control 5 discussion and future prospects in this paper an extensive review of the literature related to the mathematical modeling analysis and vibration control of marine risers was presented in section 2 the discussions on different formulations of a riser system included the modeling of different hydrodynamic load functions the lateral and transverse responses of the riser the effects of internal fluid on the responses of the riser damping functions and the coupling between the lateral and transverse vibrations of the riser section 3 introduced numerous reports of experimental and theoretical analyses on riser systems most of those investigations were mainly concerned with fatigue damage in risers the effects of sea currents uniform and sheared internal flow and the movements of the vessel on the response of the riser especially vortex induced vibrations were discussed finally in section 4 the control strategies both active and passive applied for suppressing the vibrations of the riser were discussed based upon this review the following seven aspects of key technologies for improvement have been identified in the areas of modeling analysis and control of a riser system i timoshenko beam theory first in the modeling part most formulations so far have modeled the riser system as an euler bernoulli beam but such simplification cannot describe the response of the riser upon shear forces also most works assumed the cross section of the riser to be constant however in a harsh environment in the ocean the riser can exhibit a complex deformation including twisting and elongation resulting in a change in the shape cross section of the riser therefore in the future a more complete beam formulation for example based on the timoshenko beam theory can be developed ii varying parameters also most existing works regarded that the parameters associated with the hydrodynamic forces for example the damping and added mass coefficients are constant along the lateral transverse and axial directions however such parameters should be modeled as time varying entities iii six dof motion of the vessel another important aspect in the formulation of a riser system which needs to be improved is the modeling of the movements of the surface vessel most formulations in the literature considered only the pitch yaw and heave motions of the vessel however considering the real environment a complete motion of the vessel should be considered i e the six degrees of freedom as was done for a mobile harbor system in hong and ngo 2012 a recent investigation by wang et al 2017 has revealed that the movements of the vessel also result in the vivs of the risers which phenomenon should also be addressed in the future formulations of the riser vessel system iv numerical scheme for real time estimation for the analysis of a riser system in the future more emphasis should be given to the development of a numerical scheme that can estimate the parameters associated with the hydrodynamic forces in real time this will eventually lead to the development of a more efficient control scheme v experimental facility also there is a need to develop more advanced experimental facilities for investigating the responses of the riser under complex flow situations it is evident that the existing experimental setups possess a limited capability in simulating realistic hydrodynamic load conditions for the riser vi hybrid control regarding the control of vortex induced vibrations this review found that both passive and active control methods are being applied to riser systems however there are shortcomings in both methods for example the passive techniques which require mounting of vibration suppression devices on the riser are expensive whereas the active control methods which tend to control the vibrations of the riser by applying control inputs at the top end of the riser are not much effective in suppressing the vibrations at larger depths i e the compensating movements of the riser cannot occur at larger depths due to the limited controlled movements of the vessel to overcome these problems more emphasis should be given to the development of hybrid active passive control techniques in which case the number of passive devices mounted on the riser can be reduced for cost effectiveness and rather than applying control inputs only at the top boundary the sensor actuator pairs can be mounted at several points along the length of the riser which may require application of the wireless technology for data signal transmission for implementation of a control scheme vii failure prevention at the connections of the riser lastly considering the effects of the movements of the vessel on the riser this review admits that the movements of the vessel should be restricted to avoid an accidental disconnection between the riser and the bop valve nguyen et al 2010 however not much work has been reported to constrain the movements of the vessel to prevent possible damages at the riser vessel interface recently in adamiec wojcik et al 2016 an optimization technique was proposed to restrict the bending moments at the riser vessel interface by utilizing the vertical displacements of the top end of the riser by using a winch in their study only the heave motion of the vessel was considered in generating the bending moments at the top end of the riser therefore in the future more emphases should be given in developing control techniques for example artificial neural networks for avoiding a failure at the riser vessel interface due to six dof movements of the vessel acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation nrf of korea under the auspices of the ministry of science and ict korea grant no nrf 2017r1a2a1a17069430
