20690,added mass and damping play a significant role in accurate prediction of floating wind turbine fwt motions especially near the resonance frequencies this paper investigates the still water hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt around the natural periods of surge heave and pitch motion a higher fidelity tool computational fluid dynamics cfd based on openfoam is employed in the numerical computations the tool is validated against experimental measurements decay tests and forced surge motions and then applied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the whole floater and each column at different amplitudes of forced motions the heave and pitch decay match well with the experimental measurements whereas the cfd simulations underestimate the damping in the surge decay however better agreement is obtained between measured and numerically estimated surge force in the forced oscillations in surge furthermore the added mass derived from the cfd simulation is around 12 larger than that estimated by the potential flow theory except the estimated heave added mass under the largest heave motion up to 35 larger this additional added mass in the cfd simulations is due to the viscous effects the damping shows a small dependence on the oscillation period and a larger dependence on the oscillation amplitude within the tested period range at these frequencies radiation damping is completely negligible compared to the viscous damping due to vortex shedding and the accuracy of morison s drag forces in capturing the viscous damping is sensitive to the drag coefficient keywords semi submersible floating wind turbine cfd openfoam potential flow theory added mass hydrodynamic damping 1 introduction as a promising way of harnessing the energy from winds over deep water and farther offshore floating wind turbines fwts have gained more and more attentions in recent years especially semi submersible fwts peiffer et al 2011 one type of semi submersible fwts consists of four cylindrical columns linked with a set of braces robertson et al 2014 2016 in order to reduce the amplitude of the heave resonance and move the heave resonance periods outside the wave frequency range heave plates are attached to the base of some columns these plates provide additional added mass and enhance the flow separation and vortex shedding processes that provide viscous damping wei et al 2010 all these factors reduce the floater motions but also generate more stringent requirements for the fidelity of simulation tools most approaches use potential flow theory and morison s equation to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces on the floater cordle and jonkman 2011 however in phase ⅱ of the oc5 project robertson et al 2017 these approaches significantly underestimated the wave induced floater motions at the natural frequencies outside the linear wave excitation region these results suggest that better models are needed for the hydrodynamic coefficients for nonlinear wave excitation in the present work the focus is on the added mass or damping coefficient for different motion amplitudes and periods the hydrodynamic coefficients in still water are characterized by two parameters the motion amplitude and period the nondimensional parameters are then the keulegan carpenter kc number and the stokes number β alternatively one of the control parameters can be replaced by the reynolds number re kc β cozijn et al 2005 performed experiments with a buoy with a skirt to investigate the heave roll and pitch damping and found that the heave and pitch damping contain linear and quadratic components where kc is in the range of 2 5 and β is from 76 923 to 200 000 moreno et al 2015 philip et al 2019 and nallayarasu et al 2014 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of heave plates on a spar platform at small kc 0 2 1 and high β up to 31 250 values the added mass and damping increased with kc number independent of frequency except for the increasing damping coefficients towards larger frequency at higher frequencies for the hydrodynamic coefficients of heave plates of a semi submersible fwt lopez pavon et al 2015 also confirmed there is a relatively weak dependence on oscillation frequencies and a large dependence on kc number considering kc from 0 3 to 0 86 and re from 79 695 to 446 294 model tests are the main means to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of fwts but due to limitations of the test conditions and accuracy of the test equipment the conclusions of chua et al 2005 are not completely consistent with the results of tao and dray 2008 when investigating the effect of oscillation frequency on the damping of heave plate under similar kc 0 2 1 2 and β 16 000 160 000 values therefore a series of numerical studies of hydrodynamic coefficients of fwt have been conducted based on offshore oil and gas industry experience borg et al 2013 and lefebvre et al 2012 suggested that the additional damping ratio generated by the vortex shedding is from 10 to 15 lopez pavon et al 2015 computed with a cfd commercial code ansys cfx and frequency domain panel method wadam the hydrodynamic characteristics on heave plates of a semi submersible fwt and found added mass and damping were largely dependent on the motion amplitude furthermore wadam did not predict the increased added mass due to the edge of heave plates especially for larger kc values bozonnet et al 2015 used cfd tool openfoam to calibrate and validate added mass and drag coefficients for a platform encompassing heave plates where kc is in the range of 0 36 1 07 and β is from 8 80e 07 to 2 77e 08 the added mass was found to be slightly larger than the one predicted by potential flow theory and viscous effects were predominant in the damping term the influence of different shapes of heave plates on hydrodynamic coefficients at small kc value 0 06 0 25 with β 1 1e 08 were investigated by wang et al 2020 the results showed the added mass coefficient increases with kc number whereas the damping coefficient decreases with kc number for all types of heave plates zhang et al 2018 examined the hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates by large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method and found that an accurate simulation of the unsteady flow separation around the sharp edges of the heave plates was essential for accurately predicting the drag coefficient the above numerical simulations studied the hydrodynamic coefficients using forced oscillation tests free decay is another approach to estimate the hydrodynamic damping around the natural periods burmester et al 2017 2020b investigated the surge decay of a moored semi submersible fwt using cfd methods the results showed the linear damping was largely influenced by the free surface and coupled motions increased the linear and quadratic damping slightly dunbar et al 2015 compared the discrepancy of heave and pitch decay of a semi submersible fwt between cfd methods and engineering tools and found the discrepancy is associated with reynolds number dependent viscous effects most existing studies focus on the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with one cylindrical column attached with a very thin heave plate that is not completely consistent with the configuration of a semi submersible fwt whose heave plate has a certain thickness robertson et al 2016 the possible mutual effects of different columns have not been considered in the studies of one cylindrical column in addition little attention has been paid to the hydrodynamic characteristics at large kc value and longer period such as natural periods of rigid body motions of fwts therefore it is interesting to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt at different kc numbers around the natural periods of rigid body motions and to understand the variations of hydrodynamic characteristics among different columns in this study a cfd model of a semi submersible fwt is validated against experimental measurements including free decay and forced oscillation in surge then several forced oscillations with different motion amplitudes around the surge heave and pitch natural periods are performed using the validated numerical model to identify the added mass and damping coefficients on the whole floater in addition hydrodynamic characteristics on each column are extracted to better understand the effects of the multimember arrangement of the semisubmersible meanwhile a potential flow model is used to estimate the added mass and damping coefficients and compare with the cfd model the objective of this paper is to provide improved knowledge about the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt that can be potentially applied in engineering tools the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the experimental setup the cfd tool is described in sec 3 together with an introduction of the frequency domain panel method in wadam based on potential flow theory numerical results of surge heave and pitch decay are compared to the experimental data in sec 4 while the added mass and damping estimated by the forced oscillations are analyzed in sec 5 conclusions are drawn in sec 6 2 experiment set up in the present work experimental data are from phase ⅰ of the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation and uncertainty oc6 project robertson et al 2020b the experiments were conducted in the concept basin of the maritime research institute netherland marin for the oc5 deepcwind semi submersible floater robertson et al 2016 at 1 50 scale the right handed coordinate system used here originates at the center of the floater at the still water line with positive y towards the starboard column and z upward all data and results are given at full scale in this paper except when explicitly mentioned for the configuration of free decay shown in fig 1 the wind turbine was removed but the inertial properties of the floater with tower correspond to the total inertial properties of oc5 system the mooring system was replaced with 3 taut spring lines to reproduce the equivalent linear response behavior of the original catenary system robertson et al 2020a 2020b provide the dimensions and structural properties of the platform and the configuration of the mooring lines the global motions including surge x displacement heave z displacement and pitch y rotation were measured the initial offsets for the surge heave and pitch decay are given in table 1 for forced oscillation the wind turbine and tower were removed and the floater was attached to the carriage through a frame fig 2 the floater was forced to oscillate in the surge x direction total forces on the floater were measured using a six component gauge installed between the frame and floater the details of the forced oscillation tests are provided in table 2 assuming the frequency of the radiated wave is the oscillation frequency the length of the radiated wave can be obtained by the dispersion relation the ratios between oscillation amplitudes a and radiated wave lengths l are given in table 2 3 numerical model 3 1 cfd model high fidelity numerical simulations are performed with the open source cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 the multiphase interdymfoam solver is a fluid structure interaction solver where the navier stokes and 6 degree of freedom dof equations are solved in a coupled manner the standard interdymfoam with wave absorption toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is referred to as the wavedymfoam solver which is applied in the current research 3 1 1 governing equations the wavedymfoam solver utilizes the two phase incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans to compute the fluid structure interaction the governing equations consist of a mass and a momentum conservation equation expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i f b i x j μ e f f u i x j where u i i x y z are the fluid velocity in cartesian coordinates ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure f b is the external body force including the gravity and mooring forces and μ e f f is the effective dynamic viscosity the interface between air and water is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the local fluid density ρ within a computational cell is calculated by the volume fraction α for water α 1 for air α 0 and 0 α 1 for all the intermediate values the effective dynamic viscosity μ e f f is obtained by the sum of a calculated value based on the volume fraction and an additional turbulent dynamic viscosity ρ ν t 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 μ e f f α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r ρ ν t after the velocity field is known the volume fraction is advanced in time by an advection equation 5 α t u i α x i u r i α 1 α x i 0 the last term on the left hand side of eq 5 u r is introduced as an artificial compression term to decrease the smearing of the interface it is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 see berberović et al 2009 for details a multi dimensional flux limited scheme is applied to ensure stability the k ω sst turbulence model menter et al 2003b is applied consisting of a blending of the k ω wilcox 1998 and the k ε launder and spalding 1983 models this model has shown good performance in simulating two phase flow and wave elevation brown et al 2014 rahman et al 2007 as discussed by menter et al 2003a for the two phase fluid in openfoam there is significant wave damping in the interface between air and water induced by increasing turbulent viscosity devolder et al 2017 fan and anglart 2020 when using this turbulence model hence a modified wavedymfoam solver is built to explicitly consider the variable density in the k ω sst model fan and anglart 2020 3 1 2 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations boundary conditions are imposed on all the surfaces in the numerical domain the general denomination of boundary surfaces is given in fig 3 at the inlet and outlet the velocity α field and the pressure are specified as zero normal gradient the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are set as zero normal gradient on the floater surface a no slip boundary condition zero velocity is specified and the pressure is set as zero normal gradient k is fixed at 1e 5 m2 s2 and ω is set as 1 0 1 s for the atmosphere the total pressure is set as zero and an atmospheric boundary condition is set for the velocity and α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in k is fixed at zero and ω is specified as zero normal gradient at the front back and bottom of the domain all the conditions are set as zero normal condition different k and ω values at floater and other boundaries are applied to accurately simulate the flow around the floater and reduce the influences of increasing turbulence viscosity around air water interface for the free decay the displacement of the floater is calculated based on the total forces while a prescribed sinusoidal displacement is applied for the forced oscillation in addition to the forced surge oscillations in the experiment table 2 forced oscillations with different motion amplitudes a and periods t are carried out in the cfd model following table 3 the displacements of other boundaries are set to zero a continuous wall function based on spadling s law dudley brian 1961 switching between low and high reynolds numbers is implemented for the turbulent viscosity as in table 2 the ratios between oscillation amplitudes a and radiated wave lengths l are also given in table 3 3 1 3 relaxation zones the waves2foam toolbox provides the relaxation zones region ⅰ and ⅱ in fig 3 to minimize the reflected wave from the inlet and outlet boundaries rectangular relaxation zones are defined in this work see bruinsma s work bruinsma et al 2018 for details 3 1 4 coupling of navier stokes 6 dof solver a partitioned fluid structure model is applied to simulate the flow dependent motion of a floating structure in openfoam total forces on the body are calculated by solving the rans equations for fluid and 6 dof motion equations are used to obtain the rigid body motion the stability of solutions can be ensured with a tighter coupling between fluid and motion solver openfoam provides two different methods an under relaxation and a predictor corrector method ferziger et al 2002 based on bruinsma s work bruinsma et al 2018 the predictor corrector method is more effective at eliminating the oscillations in the force profile in order to reduce the computational time the fixed number of subiteration loops to correct pressure in the predictor corrector method is replaced with a quite small tolerance 10 8 pa when solving the pressure in this paper no significant oscillation is seen in the resulting forces shown in later sections of the paper i e fig 11 in section 5 1 1 a deforming mesh technique is employed to conform to the moving boundary of the floater for the free decay the solver allows for specification of an innerdistance and an outerdistance the mesh nodes within innerdistance move with the floater while the mesh nodes between innerdistance and outerdistance morph no morphing occurs for the mesh nodes outside the outerdistance the solver of the forced oscillation uses a diffusivity function to control how the mesh morphing is distributed farther away from the floater there is less mesh morphing the diffusivity function is the square of the inverse distance between the floater and mesh position the restraints for the floater are implemented by a linear spring without considering interaction with the fluid the spring is given a simple constant stiffness and a rest length without any damping the force in the spring follows hooke s law when the length of spring is equal to the rest length the force in the spring is zero 3 1 5 computational domain the floater at scale 1 50 was built in the numerical wave tank mimicking the experimental set up the same coordinate system is also used in the cfd model as shown in fig 4 the width 3 72 m model scale and water depth 3 6 m model scale of the numerical wave flume are equal to those of the experimental facility the length of numerical wave tank should be long enough to dissipate the reflected waves from the boundaries for the heave and pitch decays the length is 4 m model scale considering the longer period of surge decay and relatively larger amplitudes of the forced oscillations in surge the length increases to 8 m model scale half of the computational domain consists of the relaxation zones in addition the height of the air regime is set to 1 m model scale fig 4 shows a plan view of the numerical wave tank with floater which is placed at the origin of the numerical domain 3 1 6 temporal and spatial discretization the courant friedrichs lewy condition is implemented for the temporal discretization a maximum courant number of 0 3 is set to determine each time step based on the finite volume method the computational domain is discretized into finite regions in space known as cells where the conservation principles are applied the size of a background cell in all the directions is 0 1 m model scale after discretization thereafter the mesh needs to be refined towards the floater and free surfaces 10 viscous layer cells adjacent to the floater surface are generated an example of the mesh topology is shown in fig 5 three different meshes used for the mesh convergence studies in the heave decay lc1 2 are summarized in table 4 the time series of heave motions with different mesh sizes are compared in fig 6 a small difference is noticeable table 5 compares the reduction in the amplitude amplitude drop and the duration of the first cycle the numerical solution is converging with decreasing mesh size the medium mesh m2 is selected for the following simulations based on the small difference in results compared to the finest mesh and the computational demands 3 2 wadam model the frequency domain analysis for the hydrodynamic characteristics is conducted with wadam veritas 2010 a panel model potential flow is used for the columns and a morison model is implemented for the braces the radiation calculation results include the frequency dependent linear added mass and damping coefficients the braces contribute to the added mass through the inertial term of morison s equation added mass coefficient is 1 0 which is frequency independent the viscous contributions of the columns and braces to the damping are taken into account by including the drag term from morison s equation based on morison s equation the total viscous surge heave force f x z v i s c t and pitch moment m y v i s c t on the floater are evaluated by adding the viscous contributions of each column and brace 6 f x z v i s c t i 1 2 ρ c d a s i v i t v i t 7 m y v i s c t i 1 2 ρ c d a s i r i θ i t r i θ i t r i where ρ is water density c d is the quadratic drag coefficient in morison s equation 0 744 in transverse direction from towing tests robertson et al 2020b and 2 48 in axial direction by matching experimental data in heave direction robertson et al 2014 a s i is the projected area of each column or brace along x or z direction v i t is the horizontal surge force or vertical heave force velocity and θ i t is the angular pitch moment velocity at the center of wetted part of each column or brace and r i is the distance between the center of the wetted part of column or brace and the origin of coordinate system frequency dependent linearized equivalent damping coefficients are then obtained for surge c d x heave c d z and pitch c φ damping coefficients by fitting the time series of total viscous surge heave force and pitch moment minimizing the error i e f x z v i s c t 1 2 ρ c d x d z a s v t and m y v i s c t 1 2 ρ c φ a s r θ t with a s being the project area of the whole floater along x or z direction v t being the horizontal or vertical velocity and θ t being the angular velocity at the center of wetted part of the whole floater and r being the distance between the center of wetted part of the whole floater and the origin of coordinate system an example is shown in fig 7 these coefficients depend on two fundamental non dimensional parameters kc number and the stokes number β that are defined as 8 k c 2 π a d 9 β d 2 ν t where d is the diameter of each column and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water in the present work only the diagonal terms in the damping matrix are investigated i e the total viscous surge forces are estimated due to surge motions but not the coupling between surge and pitch motions furthermore different contributions in the wadam model are investigated as summarized in table 6 4 free decay tests free decay tests are used to determine the natural periods and damping of the rigid body motions in the current work free decay tests in surge heave and pitch table 1 were carried out in the experiments and numerical simulations assuming that there is no coupling among motions in different dofs a typical motion equation of a free decay test in calm water considering linear stiffness and nonlinear damping can be written as follows chakrabarti 1994 10 m a x b 1 x b 2 x x k x 0 where x x and x are the motion velocity and acceleration for the surge heave or pitch motion m is the mass or mass moment of inertia in pitch of rigid body and a is the added mass or mass moment of inertia in pitch b 1 and b 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively k is the restoring coefficient natural periods are estimated as the mean duration between two consecutive peaks or troughs the damping ratio ξ relative to the critical damping is based on the logarithmic decrement δ for each cycle 11 δ ln x n x n 1 where x n and x n 1 are two consecutive peaks or troughs the damping ratio is then calculated as 12 ξ 1 1 2 π δ 2 in some cases especially for small motion amplitudes there are large variations in the damping ratio from the method of equivalent linearization the damping ratio can be expressed as a function of the decay motion amplitude x 13 ξ b 1 b 2 8 ω n 3 π x b c r where ω n is the oscillation frequency b c r 2 m a k is the critical damping based on eq 12 and eq 13 the linear and quadratic damping in the decaying motion can be obtained by the values of two consecutive peaks or troughs as this estimate is sensitive to the magnitude of the peaks or troughs the best signal mean value is subtracted from the original decaying motion by minimizing the linear regression error sum of squares 4 1 surge decay test the surge decay results are presented in fig 8 the difference of motion amplitude between cfd simulation and experimental data is small at the beginning of the simulation but increases with time the comparison of damping ratio shows the surge decay is less damped in the cfd model furthermore for large surge amplitude 0 6 m the linear component given by the intercept dominates the linear damping estimated by the cfd model is approximately 30 smaller than the one predicted in the experiment this large difference might be caused by the following reasons in the experiment taut spring lines are connected with the floater by the pulleys robertson et al 2020b some sources of mechanical friction such as the damping between spring lines and pulley are not quantified and are not considered in the cfd model this mechanical friction may be the reason for the upturning tail in the damping ratio at small surge amplitudes 0 6 m in the experiment there are also uncertainties related to performing a single experimental test furthermore the post processing method is important the difference might be up to 10 when comparing the damping estimated by a least squares approach and the classical peak to peak analysis burmester et al 2020b the surge natural periods are compared in table 7 compared to the large difference of the linear damping the difference in the natural periods is small there is significant uncertainty in the mooring line axial stiffness robertson et al 2020a considering the upper limit of the mooring system stiffness would result in a surge natural period of 105 14 s in the cfd simulations the uncertainty in measured motion is estimated as 5 mm full scale in the experiments additional uncertainties exist in the mass and geometry of the model robertson 2017 4 2 heave decay test the comparisons of heave decay are presented in fig 9 the motion amplitudes between experiment and cfd model are in close proximity of each other the comparison of damping ratio confirms that the heave damping at the small heave amplitude 0 5 m shows more linear behavior while the damping becomes nonlinear as the heave amplitude increases compared to the experiment the cfd model captures more linear damping given by the intercept and less quadratic damping given by the slope despite the small difference in damping the cfd model shows good correspondence with the experiment in predicting the heave natural period within 0 4 as presented in table 7 4 3 pitch decay test for the pitch decay interaction between pitch and surge motions was observed in the experimental results whereas no such interaction was found in the cfd simulation hence motions at the surge natural frequency are removed from the experimental signal by a high pass filter with a 0 015 hz cut off frequency the filtered experimental pitch motion is presented in fig 10 together with the original cfd results the cfd simulation captures both the period and damping well linear damping dominates the pitch damping although the overall damping level shows large variations in conclusion the cfd model is generally able to reproduce the natural periods and damping levels of the semi submersible fwt floater better correspondence is observed in the heave and pitch decay tests with shorter natural periods for the surge decay with longer period there are some differences between cfd simulations and experimental measurements similar differences are also found in other work burmester et al 2020a 2020b 2020b nevertheless these differences are considered acceptable given the differences between the experimental and numerical models and the uncertainties 5 forced oscillation tests in the forced oscillations harmonic motion is imposed on the floater the position of the floater is 14 x t a sin ω t where x t represents surge motion along the x axis x t heave motion along the z axis z t or pitch motion around y axis θ t for pitch the center of rotation is located at the origin of the coordinate system a is the oscillation amplitude and ω is the oscillation frequency the hydrodynamic force on the floater f h t is obtained by subtracting the inertial force f i t and the linear hydrostatic restoring force f k t from the measured or simulated total force f t t that is 15 f h t f t t f i t f k t the detailed expressions of inertial force and linear hydrostatic restoring force in the experimental and numerical results are given in table 8 in the cfd simulation the estimated total force is the integral of the hydrodynamic pressure along the surface of the floater which does not include inertial forces the linear hydrostatic restoring coefficient can be obtained from the variation of buoyancy loads due to small displacements in still water hence the linear restoring coefficient in surge is zero and the linear restoring coefficient in heave k 33 and in pitch k 55 can be written as 16 k 33 ρ g a w p 17 k 55 ρ g v z b ρ g a w p x 2 d s where ρ is water density g is the acceleration due to gravity a w p is the waterplane area v is the volume of the floater z b is the vertical coordinate of the center of buoyancy and the integral of eq 17 represents the waterplane area moment of inertia about y axis in eq 17 the effect of weight is not included because the estimated total force in the cfd simulation does not include the weight for the main column there is a ledge due to the large diameter for the upper part see fig 2 when the heave oscillation amplitude exceeds the distance between the ledge and the still water line varying waterplane area is used in the k 33 the first harmonic component of hydrodynamic force f h 1 t or moment m h 1 t with the same frequency as the motion ω is extracted and decomposed into in phase and out of phase components 18 f h 1 t f h cos 1 cos ω t f h sin 1 sin ω t 19 m h 1 t m h cos 1 cos ω t m h sin 1 sin ω t the first order hydrodynamic force or moment on the floater can be expressed based on the added mass and linearized damping coefficients as 20 f h 1 t ρ c a v x t 1 2 ρ c d x d z a s 8 3 π ω a x t 21 m h 1 t c a i x t 1 2 ρ c φ a s r 8 3 π ω a x t where i is the mass of moment inertia about the y axis then the added mass and linearized damping coefficients are found 22 c a f h sin 1 ρ v ω 2 a o r c a m h sin 1 i ω 2 a 23 c d x d z f h cos 1 4 3 π ρ a s ω 2 a 2 o r c φ m h cos 1 4 3 π ρ a s r ω 2 a 2 where a is equal to 1 for the linear radiation damping considering the columns wadam1 the projected area for the pitch damping coefficient is the same as the surge damping coefficient the estimated linearized damping coefficient from the cfd simulations includes both radiation damping and viscous damping 5 1 forced oscillations in surge 5 1 1 validations against the experimental measurements the numerical estimated total and first harmonic hydrodynamic forces under the forced oscillations in surge are compared against the experimental measurements in fig 11 the numerical solution remains stable and has a small oscillation at the larger surge force amplitude meanwhile the total surge force reveals weak cycle to cycle variations these fluctuations are also found in the experiments considering the differences of total surge forces at the start cycle1 middle cycle2 and end cycle3 of the steady state experimental data some possible reasons for these variations are the mechanical vibrations of the measuring equipment for the experiment and the nonlinear characteristics of hydrodynamic force and interaction between body motion with the radiated wave which was produced by the previous motion furthermore the numerically estimated first harmonic surge force is in good agreement with the experimental measurements within 0 2 fig 12 compares the surge added mass and damping coefficients of the whole floater obtained from experiments and cfd simulations the difference in the estimated added mass coefficient varies from 1 1 t 105 s to 4 6 t 31 2 s however the estimated damping coefficient shows better agreement and the largest difference occurs at t 21 s 1 9 considering the ratios of oscillation amplitudes over radiated wave lengths table 2 the smaller the ratio is the lower the radiated wave steepness is the more dominant the linear effects are and the better the estimated added mass and damping coefficients from cfd simulation approximate those from experiments in the experiments the motion and forces were measured by different measurement devices whether the force and motion signals are measured synchronously or not is crucial for the estimations of added mass and damping coefficients there is no accurate evaluation of time lag between different signals in the experiments so time lags of either 0 01 s sampling interval in the experiments and 0 02 s are used to investigate this effect this estimated time lag is similar to the time lag observed in hybrid testing of a floating wind turbine sauder et al 2016 the added mass and damping coefficients under motion lead or force lead are estimated and shown in the uncertainty bars of fig 12 the time lag between motion and force has minor influence on the calculated added mass coefficients but its impact on the calculated damping coefficients is more significant for shorter oscillation periods the same trend is observed for the different time lags generally good agreement is obtained between measured and numerically estimated hydrodynamic surge force and added mass and damping coefficients which suggests that it is possible to reproduce the correct hydrodynamic characteristics at low oscillation frequency in the cfd model 5 1 2 forced oscillation in surge in the cfd model based on eq 8 the kc numbers of each column of floater under forced oscillations in surge in the cfd model are presented in fig 13 the kc numbers vary from 0 5 to 7 4 and β is from 2 11e 05 to 8 64e 06 fig 14 compares the total surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients calculated from the cfd simulations and the values due to linear radiation considering the columns wadam1 and the contributions of morison s added mass and drag terms on the braces wadam2 the cfd simulations lead to similar added mass coefficients for smaller amplitudes 1 91 m and 3 82 m however for the largest amplitude 7 64 m the added mass coefficient is 2 7 smaller this decrease is closely related with the variation of kc numbers on each column more details can be found in the discussions about the added mass coefficients for different columns compared to the cfd model potential flow theory wadam1 underestimates the added mass up to 10 furthermore the contribution of braces only accounts for 2 5 percent in the potential flow added mass wadam1 vs wadam2 in addition the results also highlight the weak dependency of added mass on oscillation period in the cfd simulations the linearized damping coefficient decreases with oscillation amplitude and increases with oscillation period considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient in eq 23 the damping has opposite trend with the linearized damping coefficient that means the faster the surge motion is the larger the damping is in the potential flow results the radiation damping wadam1 is completely negligible with respect to the viscous damping wadam2 the linearized damping coefficient in the wadam2 model is close to the quadratic damping coefficient 0 744 in morison s equation compared to the cfd results morison type drag coefficient based on the towing tests in wadam2 underestimates the viscous damping the obtained surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients on individual columns are compared numerically in fig 15 based on other research dütsch et al 1998 gao et al 2020 the added mass coefficient of a circular cylinder is weakly dependent on the kc number when kc 3 for larger kc number the added mass coefficient decreases as kc increases and achieves the minimum value around kc 15 then the added mass coefficient increases with kc hence for the main column kc 2 the added mass coefficient decreases with increasing oscillation amplitude for the upper part of column the added mass coefficient has similar results within 1 under two smaller oscillation amplitudes kc 2 and significantly reduces for the largest amplitude kc 4 for the heave plates kc 2 the weak dependency of added mass coefficient on oscillation amplitudes seems to be valid for longer oscillation period slow surge motion but the added mass coefficient increases with kc for shorter oscillation period all the changes are due to the variations of vortex pattern around the floater the computed hydrodynamic pressures on the aft point b and starboard sides point a of upper part of starboard column are shown in fig 16 the double frequency and negative mean value of hydrodynamic pressures on the starboard side show the occurrence of vortex shedding in the cfd simulations compared to the cfd results potential flow predicts smaller added mass coefficient with a maximum difference of 15 6 200 s sc b except a larger added mass coefficient under largest oscillation amplitude for the upper part of columns uc u sc u additionally the added mass coefficient on the starboard column is larger than the one on the upstream column and this increase is more significant in the cfd simulations dütsch et al 1998 show that the drag coefficient decreases with increasing kc numbers for kc 3 when 3 kc 15 the drag coefficient is weakly dependent on the kc number the same trends can be seen in the cfd simulations fig 15 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as kc increases however for larger kc values such as larger amplitude for the main column mc and upper part of upstream and starboard column uc u sc u the variations of linearized damping coefficients over oscillation amplitude are quite small furthermore the linearized damping coefficient of each column increases with oscillation period the damping coefficient for each column in wadam model has similar results as the total damping coefficient however the underestimation of viscous damping by morison type drag wadam2 does not seems to be valid for all comparisons this also highlights the different drag coefficients instead of a uniform one should be applied in accurate estimations of viscous damping for each column furthermore in the cfd simulations the starboard column has a slightly larger damping compared to the upstream column the shorter distance from the main column along the x direction and the effect of the portside column can explain this additional damping in order to validate whether there are consistent conclusions between free decay and forced oscillation or not the durations of different cycles in the surge free decay are given in table 9 the small variations in durations suggest that the motion amplitude has minor effect on the added mass considering the maximum kc number is 1 8 furthermore from fig 8 the damping is also weakly dependent on the kc in the free decay which is not consistent with conclusions in the forced oscillation the possible reason is that linear damping dominates for very small motion however when the mean motion amplitude in the free decay is close to the motion amplitude in the forced oscillation the estimated added mass and damping are in good agreement as shown in table 10 5 2 forced oscillations in heave for the forced oscillations in heave the kc number is defined based on the heave plate diameter for the upstream and starboard columns the corresponding kc numbers are presented in fig 17 ranging from 0 25 to 7 4 the β varies from 2 23e 06 to 3 62e 07 the total heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients are presented in fig 18 the added mass coefficient increases with oscillation amplitude for all cases the calculated added mass coefficient from the cfd simulations is higher than the one derived from the potential flow theory wadam1 with a maximum increase of 32 7 64 m similar results can be found in previously published research cozijn et al 2005 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 a possible explanation for this increase is that the flow separation and the formation of eddies at the edge of heave plates for the large motion change the phase difference between the pressure and the motion of floater the braces give minor contributions to the total added mass coefficient within 2 finally the added mass coefficient is independent of the oscillation period the linearized damping coefficient is independent of the oscillation period and decreases as the oscillation amplitude increases in the cfd simulations by comparing wadam1 and wadam2 viscous damping dominates and the radiation damping is completely negligible the difference of the computed linearized damping coefficient between wadam1 and wadam2 is close to the quadratic drag coefficient 2 48 by matching the experimental data in morison s equation which underestimates the viscous damping the heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients among different columns are compared in fig 19 the added mass and linearized damping coefficients of the main column are much smaller than the upstream and starboard columns even when dividing by the small diameter which is related to the lack of a heave plate for smaller oscillation amplitudes 0 955 m and 3 82 m cfd and potential flow theory predict similar added mass coefficients for the main column which seems to be independent of the oscillation period and amplitude however for the largest oscillation amplitude 7 64 m the added mass increases sharply and shows significant dependency on the oscillation period this is because the oscillation amplitude is larger than the distance between the ledge see fig 2 and still water line 4 25 m and the occurrence of flow separation and eddies at the ledge gives additional added mass the overestimation for the linearized damping coefficient on the main column by morison type drag suggests that a smaller axial drag coefficient should be applied for the column without the heave plate the contribution of the heave plate is dominant for the heave forces and the added mass and linearized damping coefficients for the upstream and starboard columns show similar trends as the total added mass and linearized damping coefficients furthermore there are no significant differences between the upstream and starboard columns the consistency of conclusions based on free decay and forced oscillation in heave is also investigated from fig 18 the radiation added mass gives a good estimate of the added mass with small heave motion the heave free decay considers motion amplitudes which are smaller than the forced oscillations and there is no significant change in the duration of different cycles during the decay table 11 from fig 9 the linear damping increases with the motion amplitude considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient in eq 23 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as the motion amplitude increases which is the same conclusion as the free decay tests table 12 compares the estimated heave added mass and damping with similar motion amplitude in free decay and forced oscillation the added mass agrees well whereas the damping is quite sensitive to the motion amplitude 5 3 forced oscillations in pitch the total pitch added mass and linearized damping coefficients are compared in fig 20 for small pitch motion the total added mass coefficient is independent of the oscillation period and increases slightly with oscillation amplitude however the total added mass coefficient decreases with oscillation period for the largest pitch motion 0 273 rad a possible explanation is that complex vortex vortex and vortex column interaction can change the vortex pattern around the column for large pitch motions there is a significant underestimation of the pitch added mass coefficient using potential flow theory the contribution of braces to the total pitch added mass coefficient is less than 1 the pitch linearized damping coefficient decreases with the oscillation amplitude and shows a weaker dependency on the oscillation period furthermore the viscous damping dominates and the radiation damping can be neglected wadam1 vs wadam2 the applied morison s drag coefficients by matching experimental data underpredict the viscous damping since the mass distributions of each column are unknown the mass of moment inertia about y axis eq 22 is calculated assuming the mass is uniformly distributed the pitch added mass and linearized damping coefficients among different columns can be seen in fig 21 in the cfd model the main column has some openings at the intersection with the braces where no pressure results are obtained the loss of pressure at these openings leads to the negative added mass coefficient of the main column in the cfd simulations in the potential flow calculation the main column is considered as a closed cylinder this effect on the added mass and linearized damping coefficients is shown in table 13 with a difference in percentage from the results with braces when the main column is built as a closed cylinder without brace in the cfd simulation the added mass coefficient changes to positive table 13 but is also smaller than the potential flow solution presented in fig 21 furthermore the added mass coefficient of the main column seems to be independent of the oscillation amplitude but its magnitude increases with the oscillation period the negative added mass coefficient of main column is useful to consider for further modification of potential flow results in order to better simulate local responses on the semi submersible fwt the interaction between heave plate and braces has minor influence on the added mass coefficient for the upstream and starboard columns table 13 the added mass coefficient of the upstream column has similar behavior as the total added mass coefficient because most of total pitch moment arises from the contribution of the upstream column the added mass coefficient of the starboard column also shows similar trends as the total added mass coefficient except a slight decrease with the oscillation period for the smaller oscillation amplitude linear potential flow theory underestimates the added mass coefficient of upstream column but overestimates the results for the main and starboard columns the pitch linearized damping coefficients of different columns fig 21 appear to weakly depend on the oscillation period and decrease with the oscillation amplitude given both the magnitude of the linearized damping coefficient and the projected area eq 23 the upstream column contributes the most to the damping the morison type drag coefficients by matching experimental data underestimate the viscous pitch damping the interaction between columns and braces reduces the damping on each column table 13 with a minimum decrease of 0 59 for the upstream column and a maximum decrease of 31 44 for the main column similar conclusions can be found between free decay and forced oscillations in pitch the small variations of duration for different cycles table 14 in the pitch free decay are consistent with the constant added mass for small pitch motion in the forced oscillations in pitch furthermore from fig 10 the linear damping increases with the motion amplitude considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient eq 23 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as the motion amplitude increases which is the same conclusion as the forced oscillations table 15 compares the added mass and damping coefficient for the maximum mean pitch motion in the free decay and the minimum pitch motion in the forced oscillation the estimated added mass is in good agreement whereas the calculated damping has a linear relationship with the amplitude 6 conclusions in order to investigate the still water hydrodynamic characteristics of the floater for a semi submersible fwt a series of free decay and forced oscillation tests have been conducted in experiments and in a cfd model the focus is on long periods which are close to the natural periods for rigid body fwt motions in the current work the kc number varies from 0 25 to 7 4 and β is in the range of 2 11e 05 to 3 62e 07 for the free decay better correspondence can be found in the heave and pitch decay with shorter natural periods however for the surge decay with longer period cfd underestimates the damping by 30 compared to the experiment it is hypothesized that the additional damping between spring lines and pulleys as well as coupling of rigid body motions increases the damping in the experiment the uncertainty of experimental data and post processing also contributes to this difference furthermore the linear damping dominates the surge and pitch damping while quadratic damping is found in the heave damping due to the vortex shedding around the edge of heave plates the estimated natural periods of the floater motion are in good agreement with ones calculated from the experiments within 4 5 forced oscillations in surge around the natural periods of surge heave and pitch motion are firstly performed in the cfd model for validation compared to the experimental results the maximum difference of 4 6 for the added mass coefficient and 1 9 for the damping coefficient suggest the cfd model can reproduce the correct hydrodynamic characteristics at low oscillation frequency next the hydrodynamic characteristics of the whole floater and each column are analyzed using the cfd model the results are compared with the results from the potential flow theory with morison type drag the drag coefficients are determined by matching the experimental data for these long periods the surge added mass coefficient seems to be independent of the oscillation amplitude for small surge motion kc 2 and then decreases with the oscillation amplitude a slight period dependency can be found in the surge added mass coefficient furthermore the surge linearized damping coefficient increases towards longer period and smaller motion amplitude the surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients on the starboard column are slightly larger than on the upstream column the heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients show on one hand a small dependence on the oscillation period and on the other hand a larger dependence with the oscillation amplitude most of contributions of added mass and linearized damping coefficients come from the heave plates no difference can be found between the upstream and starboard columns a weak dependency of the pitch added mass coefficient on the oscillation amplitude and period is found for small pitch motion however the pitch added mass coefficient decreases with oscillation period for large pitch motion the pitch linearized damping coefficient has similar behavior as the heave linearized damping coefficient the added mass coefficient derived from the cfd simulation is slightly superior to the one estimated by the potential flow theory in most cases viscous effects give an additional added mass regarding the damping the radiation damping is completely negligible and the viscous damping from vortex shedding dominates the accuracy of capturing the vortex shedding using morison s drag force is sensitive to the drag coefficient finally free decay and forced oscillation tests give consistent conclusions about the trend of added mass and damping coefficients over the amplitude credit authorship contribution

20690,added mass and damping play a significant role in accurate prediction of floating wind turbine fwt motions especially near the resonance frequencies this paper investigates the still water hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt around the natural periods of surge heave and pitch motion a higher fidelity tool computational fluid dynamics cfd based on openfoam is employed in the numerical computations the tool is validated against experimental measurements decay tests and forced surge motions and then applied to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the whole floater and each column at different amplitudes of forced motions the heave and pitch decay match well with the experimental measurements whereas the cfd simulations underestimate the damping in the surge decay however better agreement is obtained between measured and numerically estimated surge force in the forced oscillations in surge furthermore the added mass derived from the cfd simulation is around 12 larger than that estimated by the potential flow theory except the estimated heave added mass under the largest heave motion up to 35 larger this additional added mass in the cfd simulations is due to the viscous effects the damping shows a small dependence on the oscillation period and a larger dependence on the oscillation amplitude within the tested period range at these frequencies radiation damping is completely negligible compared to the viscous damping due to vortex shedding and the accuracy of morison s drag forces in capturing the viscous damping is sensitive to the drag coefficient keywords semi submersible floating wind turbine cfd openfoam potential flow theory added mass hydrodynamic damping 1 introduction as a promising way of harnessing the energy from winds over deep water and farther offshore floating wind turbines fwts have gained more and more attentions in recent years especially semi submersible fwts peiffer et al 2011 one type of semi submersible fwts consists of four cylindrical columns linked with a set of braces robertson et al 2014 2016 in order to reduce the amplitude of the heave resonance and move the heave resonance periods outside the wave frequency range heave plates are attached to the base of some columns these plates provide additional added mass and enhance the flow separation and vortex shedding processes that provide viscous damping wei et al 2010 all these factors reduce the floater motions but also generate more stringent requirements for the fidelity of simulation tools most approaches use potential flow theory and morison s equation to evaluate the hydrodynamic forces on the floater cordle and jonkman 2011 however in phase ⅱ of the oc5 project robertson et al 2017 these approaches significantly underestimated the wave induced floater motions at the natural frequencies outside the linear wave excitation region these results suggest that better models are needed for the hydrodynamic coefficients for nonlinear wave excitation in the present work the focus is on the added mass or damping coefficient for different motion amplitudes and periods the hydrodynamic coefficients in still water are characterized by two parameters the motion amplitude and period the nondimensional parameters are then the keulegan carpenter kc number and the stokes number β alternatively one of the control parameters can be replaced by the reynolds number re kc β cozijn et al 2005 performed experiments with a buoy with a skirt to investigate the heave roll and pitch damping and found that the heave and pitch damping contain linear and quadratic components where kc is in the range of 2 5 and β is from 76 923 to 200 000 moreno et al 2015 philip et al 2019 and nallayarasu et al 2014 experimentally investigated the hydrodynamic coefficients of heave plates on a spar platform at small kc 0 2 1 and high β up to 31 250 values the added mass and damping increased with kc number independent of frequency except for the increasing damping coefficients towards larger frequency at higher frequencies for the hydrodynamic coefficients of heave plates of a semi submersible fwt lopez pavon et al 2015 also confirmed there is a relatively weak dependence on oscillation frequencies and a large dependence on kc number considering kc from 0 3 to 0 86 and re from 79 695 to 446 294 model tests are the main means to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of fwts but due to limitations of the test conditions and accuracy of the test equipment the conclusions of chua et al 2005 are not completely consistent with the results of tao and dray 2008 when investigating the effect of oscillation frequency on the damping of heave plate under similar kc 0 2 1 2 and β 16 000 160 000 values therefore a series of numerical studies of hydrodynamic coefficients of fwt have been conducted based on offshore oil and gas industry experience borg et al 2013 and lefebvre et al 2012 suggested that the additional damping ratio generated by the vortex shedding is from 10 to 15 lopez pavon et al 2015 computed with a cfd commercial code ansys cfx and frequency domain panel method wadam the hydrodynamic characteristics on heave plates of a semi submersible fwt and found added mass and damping were largely dependent on the motion amplitude furthermore wadam did not predict the increased added mass due to the edge of heave plates especially for larger kc values bozonnet et al 2015 used cfd tool openfoam to calibrate and validate added mass and drag coefficients for a platform encompassing heave plates where kc is in the range of 0 36 1 07 and β is from 8 80e 07 to 2 77e 08 the added mass was found to be slightly larger than the one predicted by potential flow theory and viscous effects were predominant in the damping term the influence of different shapes of heave plates on hydrodynamic coefficients at small kc value 0 06 0 25 with β 1 1e 08 were investigated by wang et al 2020 the results showed the added mass coefficient increases with kc number whereas the damping coefficient decreases with kc number for all types of heave plates zhang et al 2018 examined the hydrodynamic coefficients of multiple heave plates by large eddy simulations with volume of fluid method and found that an accurate simulation of the unsteady flow separation around the sharp edges of the heave plates was essential for accurately predicting the drag coefficient the above numerical simulations studied the hydrodynamic coefficients using forced oscillation tests free decay is another approach to estimate the hydrodynamic damping around the natural periods burmester et al 2017 2020b investigated the surge decay of a moored semi submersible fwt using cfd methods the results showed the linear damping was largely influenced by the free surface and coupled motions increased the linear and quadratic damping slightly dunbar et al 2015 compared the discrepancy of heave and pitch decay of a semi submersible fwt between cfd methods and engineering tools and found the discrepancy is associated with reynolds number dependent viscous effects most existing studies focus on the hydrodynamic characteristics associated with one cylindrical column attached with a very thin heave plate that is not completely consistent with the configuration of a semi submersible fwt whose heave plate has a certain thickness robertson et al 2016 the possible mutual effects of different columns have not been considered in the studies of one cylindrical column in addition little attention has been paid to the hydrodynamic characteristics at large kc value and longer period such as natural periods of rigid body motions of fwts therefore it is interesting to examine the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt at different kc numbers around the natural periods of rigid body motions and to understand the variations of hydrodynamic characteristics among different columns in this study a cfd model of a semi submersible fwt is validated against experimental measurements including free decay and forced oscillation in surge then several forced oscillations with different motion amplitudes around the surge heave and pitch natural periods are performed using the validated numerical model to identify the added mass and damping coefficients on the whole floater in addition hydrodynamic characteristics on each column are extracted to better understand the effects of the multimember arrangement of the semisubmersible meanwhile a potential flow model is used to estimate the added mass and damping coefficients and compare with the cfd model the objective of this paper is to provide improved knowledge about the hydrodynamic characteristics of a semi submersible fwt that can be potentially applied in engineering tools the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the experimental setup the cfd tool is described in sec 3 together with an introduction of the frequency domain panel method in wadam based on potential flow theory numerical results of surge heave and pitch decay are compared to the experimental data in sec 4 while the added mass and damping estimated by the forced oscillations are analyzed in sec 5 conclusions are drawn in sec 6 2 experiment set up in the present work experimental data are from phase ⅰ of the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation and uncertainty oc6 project robertson et al 2020b the experiments were conducted in the concept basin of the maritime research institute netherland marin for the oc5 deepcwind semi submersible floater robertson et al 2016 at 1 50 scale the right handed coordinate system used here originates at the center of the floater at the still water line with positive y towards the starboard column and z upward all data and results are given at full scale in this paper except when explicitly mentioned for the configuration of free decay shown in fig 1 the wind turbine was removed but the inertial properties of the floater with tower correspond to the total inertial properties of oc5 system the mooring system was replaced with 3 taut spring lines to reproduce the equivalent linear response behavior of the original catenary system robertson et al 2020a 2020b provide the dimensions and structural properties of the platform and the configuration of the mooring lines the global motions including surge x displacement heave z displacement and pitch y rotation were measured the initial offsets for the surge heave and pitch decay are given in table 1 for forced oscillation the wind turbine and tower were removed and the floater was attached to the carriage through a frame fig 2 the floater was forced to oscillate in the surge x direction total forces on the floater were measured using a six component gauge installed between the frame and floater the details of the forced oscillation tests are provided in table 2 assuming the frequency of the radiated wave is the oscillation frequency the length of the radiated wave can be obtained by the dispersion relation the ratios between oscillation amplitudes a and radiated wave lengths l are given in table 2 3 numerical model 3 1 cfd model high fidelity numerical simulations are performed with the open source cfd toolbox openfoam weller et al 1998 the multiphase interdymfoam solver is a fluid structure interaction solver where the navier stokes and 6 degree of freedom dof equations are solved in a coupled manner the standard interdymfoam with wave absorption toolbox waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 is referred to as the wavedymfoam solver which is applied in the current research 3 1 1 governing equations the wavedymfoam solver utilizes the two phase incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans to compute the fluid structure interaction the governing equations consist of a mass and a momentum conservation equation expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u

is the external body force including the gravity and mooring forces and μ e f f is the effective dynamic viscosity the interface between air and water is tracked by the volume of fluid vof method hirt and nichols 1981 the local fluid density ρ within a computational cell is calculated by the volume fraction α for water α 1 for air α 0 and 0 α 1 for all the intermediate values the effective dynamic viscosity μ e f f is obtained by the sum of a calculated value based on the volume fraction and an additional turbulent dynamic viscosity ρ ν t 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 μ e f f α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r ρ ν t after the velocity field is known the volume fraction is advanced in time by an advection equation 5 α t u i α x i u r i α 1 α x i 0 the last term on the left hand side of eq 5 u r is introduced as an artificial compression term to decrease the smearing of the interface it is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 see berberović et al 2009 for details a multi dimensional flux limited scheme is applied to ensure stability the k ω sst turbulence model menter et al 2003b is applied consisting of a blending of the k ω wilcox 1998 and the k ε launder and spalding 1983 models this model has shown good performance in simulating two phase flow and wave elevation brown et al 2014 rahman et al 2007 as discussed by menter et al 2003a for the two phase fluid in openfoam there is significant wave damping in the interface between air and water induced by increasing turbulent viscosity devolder et al 2017 fan and anglart 2020 when using this turbulence model hence a modified wavedymfoam solver is built to explicitly consider the variable density in the k ω sst model fan and anglart 2020 3 1 2 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations boundary conditions are imposed on all the surfaces in the numerical domain the general denomination of boundary surfaces is given in fig 3 at the inlet and outlet the velocity α field and the pressure are specified as zero normal gradient the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are set as zero normal gradient on the floater surface a no slip boundary condition zero velocity is specified and the pressure is set as zero normal gradient k is fixed at 1e 5 m2 s2 and ω is set as 1 0 1 s for the atmosphere the total pressure is set as zero and an atmospheric boundary condition is set for the velocity and α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in k is fixed at zero and ω is specified as zero normal gradient at the front back and bottom of the domain all the conditions are set as zero normal condition different k and ω values at floater and other boundaries are applied to accurately simulate the flow around the floater and reduce the influences of increasing turbulence viscosity around air water interface for the free decay the displacement of the floater is calculated based on the total forces while a prescribed sinusoidal displacement is applied for the forced oscillation in addition to the forced surge oscillations in the experiment table 2 forced oscillations with different motion amplitudes a and periods t are carried out in the cfd model following table 3 the displacements of other boundaries are set to zero a continuous wall function based on spadling s law dudley brian 1961 switching between low and high reynolds numbers is implemented for the turbulent viscosity as in table 2 the ratios between oscillation amplitudes a and radiated wave lengths l are also given in table 3 3 1 3 relaxation zones the waves2foam toolbox provides the relaxation zones region ⅰ and ⅱ in fig 3 to minimize the reflected wave from the inlet and outlet boundaries rectangular relaxation zones are defined in this work see bruinsma s work bruinsma et al 2018 for details 3 1 4 coupling of navier stokes 6 dof solver a partitioned fluid structure model is applied to simulate the flow dependent motion of a floating structure in openfoam total forces on the body are calculated by solving the rans equations for fluid and 6 dof motion equations are used to obtain the rigid body motion the stability of solutions can be ensured with a tighter coupling between fluid and motion solver openfoam provides two different methods an under relaxation and a predictor corrector method ferziger et al 2002 based on bruinsma s work bruinsma et al 2018 the predictor corrector method is more effective at eliminating the oscillations in the force profile in order to reduce the computational time the fixed number of subiteration loops to correct pressure in the predictor corrector method is replaced with a quite small tolerance 10 8 pa when solving the pressure in this paper no significant oscillation is seen in the resulting forces shown in later sections of the paper i e fig 11 in section 5 1 1 a deforming mesh technique is employed to conform to the moving boundary of the floater for the free decay the solver allows for specification of an innerdistance and an outerdistance the mesh nodes within innerdistance move with the floater while the mesh nodes between innerdistance and outerdistance morph no morphing occurs for the mesh nodes outside the outerdistance the solver of the forced oscillation uses a diffusivity function to control how the mesh morphing is distributed farther away from the floater there is less mesh morphing the diffusivity function is the square of the inverse distance between the floater and mesh position the restraints for the floater are implemented by a linear spring without considering interaction with the fluid the spring is given a simple constant stiffness and a rest length without any damping the force in the spring follows hooke s law when the length of spring is equal to the rest length the force in the spring is zero 3 1 5 computational domain the floater at scale 1 50 was built in the numerical wave tank mimicking the experimental set up the same coordinate system is also used in the cfd model as shown in fig 4 the width 3 72 m model scale and water depth 3 6 m model scale of the numerical wave flume are equal to those of the experimental facility the length of numerical wave tank should be long enough to dissipate the reflected waves from the boundaries for the heave and pitch decays the length is 4 m model scale considering the longer period of surge decay and relatively larger amplitudes of the forced oscillations in surge the length increases to 8 m model scale half of the computational domain consists of the relaxation zones in addition the height of the air regime is set to 1 m model scale fig 4 shows a plan view of the numerical wave tank with floater which is placed at the origin of the numerical domain 3 1 6 temporal and spatial discretization the courant friedrichs lewy condition is implemented for the temporal discretization a maximum courant number of 0 3 is set to determine each time step based on the finite volume method the computational domain is discretized into finite regions in space known as cells where the conservation principles are applied the size of a background cell in all the directions is 0 1 m model scale after discretization thereafter the mesh needs to be refined towards the floater and free surfaces 10 viscous layer cells adjacent to the floater surface are generated an example of the mesh topology is shown in fig 5 three different meshes used for the mesh convergence studies in the heave decay lc1 2 are summarized in table 4 the time series of heave motions with different mesh sizes are compared in fig 6 a small difference is noticeable table 5 compares the reduction in the amplitude amplitude drop and the duration of the first cycle the numerical solution is converging with decreasing mesh size the medium mesh m2 is selected for the following simulations based on the small difference in results compared to the finest mesh and the computational demands 3 2 wadam model the frequency domain analysis for the hydrodynamic characteristics is conducted with wadam veritas 2010 a panel model potential flow is used for the columns and a morison model is implemented for the braces the radiation calculation results include the frequency dependent linear added mass and damping coefficients the braces contribute to the added mass through the inertial term of morison s equation added mass coefficient is 1 0 which is frequency independent the viscous contributions of the columns and braces to the damping are taken into account by including the drag term from morison s equation based on morison s equation the total viscous surge heave force f x z v i s c t and pitch moment m y v i s c t on the floater are evaluated by adding the viscous contributions of each column and brace 6 f x z v i s c t i 1 2 ρ c d a s i v i t v i t 7 m y v i s c t i 1 2 ρ c d a s i r i θ i t r i θ i t r i where ρ is water

defined as 8 k c 2 π a d 9 β d 2 ν t where d is the diameter of each column and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water in the present work only the diagonal terms in the damping matrix are investigated i e the total viscous surge forces are estimated due to surge motions but not the coupling between surge and pitch motions furthermore different contributions in the wadam model are investigated as summarized in table 6 4 free decay tests free decay tests are used to determine the natural periods and damping of the rigid body motions in the current work free decay tests in surge heave and pitch table 1 were carried out in the experiments and numerical simulations assuming that there is no coupling among motions in different dofs a typical motion equation of a free decay test in calm water

or pitch motion m is the mass or mass moment of inertia in pitch of rigid body and a is the added mass or mass moment of inertia in pitch b 1 and b 2 are the linear and quadratic damping coefficients respectively k is the restoring coefficient natural periods are estimated as the mean duration between two consecutive peaks or troughs the damping ratio ξ relative to the critical damping is based on the logarithmic decrement δ for each cycle 11 δ ln x n x n 1 where x n and x n 1 are two consecutive peaks or troughs the damping ratio is then calculated as 12 ξ 1 1 2 π δ 2 in some cases especially for small motion amplitudes there are large variations in the damping ratio from the method of equivalent linearization the damping ratio can be expressed as a function of the decay motion amplitude x 13 ξ b 1 b 2 8 ω n 3 π x b c r where ω n is the oscillation frequency b c r 2 m a k is the critical damping based on eq 12 and eq 13 the linear and quadratic damping in the decaying motion can be obtained by the values of two consecutive peaks or troughs as this estimate is sensitive to the magnitude of the peaks or troughs the best signal mean value is subtracted from the original decaying motion by minimizing the linear regression error sum of squares 4 1 surge decay test the surge decay results are presented in fig 8 the difference of motion amplitude between cfd simulation and experimental data is small at the beginning of the simulation but increases with time the comparison of damping ratio shows the surge decay is less damped in the cfd model furthermore for large surge amplitude 0 6 m the linear component given by the intercept dominates the linear damping estimated by the cfd model is approximately 30 smaller than the one predicted in the experiment this large difference might be caused by the following reasons in the experiment taut spring lines are connected with the floater by the pulleys robertson et al 2020b some sources of mechanical friction such as the damping between spring lines and pulley are not quantified and are not considered in the cfd model this mechanical friction may be the reason for the upturning tail in the damping ratio at small surge amplitudes 0 6 m in the experiment there are also uncertainties related to performing a single experimental test furthermore the post processing method is important the difference might be up to 10 when comparing the damping estimated by a least squares approach and the classical peak to peak analysis burmester et al 2020b the surge natural periods are compared in table 7 compared to the large difference of the linear damping the difference in the natural periods is small there is significant uncertainty in the mooring line axial stiffness robertson et al 2020a considering the upper limit of the mooring system stiffness would result in a surge natural period of 105 14 s in the cfd simulations the uncertainty in measured motion is estimated as 5 mm full scale in the experiments additional uncertainties exist in the mass and geometry of the model robertson 2017 4 2 heave decay test the comparisons of heave decay are presented in fig 9 the motion amplitudes between experiment and cfd model are in close proximity of each other the comparison of damping ratio confirms that the heave damping at the small heave amplitude 0 5 m shows more linear behavior while the damping becomes nonlinear as the heave amplitude increases compared to the experiment the cfd model captures more linear damping given by the intercept and less quadratic damping given by the slope despite the small difference in damping the cfd model shows good correspondence with the experiment in predicting the heave natural period within 0 4 as presented in table 7 4 3 pitch decay test for the pitch decay interaction between pitch and surge motions was observed in the experimental results whereas no such interaction was found in the cfd simulation hence motions at the surge natural frequency are removed from the experimental signal by a high pass filter with a 0 015 hz cut off frequency the filtered experimental pitch motion is presented in fig 10 together with the original cfd results the cfd simulation captures both the period and damping well linear damping dominates the pitch damping although the overall damping level shows large variations in conclusion the cfd model is generally able to reproduce the natural periods and damping levels of the semi submersible fwt floater better correspondence is observed in the heave and pitch decay tests with shorter natural periods for the surge decay with longer period there are some differences between cfd simulations and experimental measurements similar differences are also found in other work burmester et al 2020a 2020b 2020b nevertheless these differences are considered acceptable given the differences between the experimental and numerical models and the uncertainties 5 forced oscillation tests in the forced oscillations harmonic motion is imposed on the floater the position of the floater is 14 x t a sin ω t where x t represents surge motion along the x axis x t heave motion along the z axis z t or pitch motion around y axis θ t for pitch the center of rotation is located at the origin of the coordinate system a is the oscillation amplitude and ω is the oscillation frequency the hydrodynamic force on the floater f h t is obtained by subtracting the inertial force f i t and the linear hydrostatic restoring force f k t from the measured or simulated total force f t t that is 15 f h t f t t f i t f k t the detailed expressions of inertial force and linear hydrostatic restoring force in the experimental and numerical results are given in table 8 in the cfd simulation the estimated total force is the integral of the hydrodynamic pressure along the surface of the floater which does not include inertial forces the linear hydrostatic restoring coefficient can be obtained from the variation of buoyancy loads due to small displacements in still water hence the linear restoring coefficient in surge is zero and the linear restoring coefficient in heave k 33 and in pitch k 55 can be written as 16 k 33 ρ g a w p 17 k 55 ρ g v z b ρ g a w p x 2 d s where ρ is water density g is the acceleration due to gravity a w p is the waterplane area v is the volume of the floater z b is the vertical coordinate of the center of buoyancy and the integral of eq 17 represents the waterplane area moment of inertia about y axis in eq 17 the effect of weight is not included because the estimated total force in the cfd simulation does not include the weight for the main column there is a ledge due to the large diameter for the upper part see fig 2 when the heave oscillation amplitude exceeds the distance between the ledge and the still water line varying waterplane area is used in the k 33 the first harmonic component of hydrodynamic force f h 1 t or moment m h 1 t with the same frequency as the motion ω is extracted and decomposed into in phase and out of phase components 18 f h 1 t f h cos 1 cos ω t f h sin 1 sin ω t 19 m h 1 t m h cos 1 cos ω t m h sin 1 sin ω t the first order hydrodynamic force or moment on the floater can be expressed based on the added mass and linearized damping coefficients as 20 f h 1 t ρ c a v x t 1 2 ρ c d x d z a s 8 3 π ω a x t 21 m h 1 t c a i x t 1 2 ρ c φ a s r 8 3 π ω a x t where i is the mass of moment inertia about the y axis then the added mass and linearized damping coefficients are found 22 c a f h sin 1 ρ v ω 2 a o r c a m h sin 1 i ω 2 a 23 c d x d z f h cos 1 4 3 π ρ a s ω 2 a 2 o r c φ m h cos 1 4 3 π ρ a s r ω 2 a 2 where a is equal to 1 for the linear radiation damping considering the columns wadam1 the projected area for the pitch damping coefficient is the same as the surge damping coefficient the estimated linearized damping coefficient from the cfd simulations includes both radiation damping and viscous damping 5 1 forced oscillations in surge 5 1 1 validations against the experimental measurements the numerical estimated total and first harmonic hydrodynamic forces under the forced oscillations in surge are compared against the experimental measurements in fig 11 the numerical solution remains stable and has a small oscillation at the larger surge force amplitude meanwhile the total surge force reveals weak cycle to cycle variations these fluctuations are also found in the experiments considering the differences of total surge forces at the start cycle1 middle cycle2 and end cycle3 of the steady state experimental data some possible reasons for these variations are the mechanical vibrations of the measuring equipment for the experiment and the nonlinear characteristics of hydrodynamic force and interaction between body motion with the radiated wave which was produced by the previous motion furthermore the numerically estimated first harmonic surge force is in good agreement with the experimental measurements within 0 2 fig 12 compares the surge added mass and damping coefficients of the whole floater obtained from experiments and cfd simulations the difference in the estimated added mass coefficient varies from 1 1 t 105 s to 4 6 t 31 2 s however the estimated damping coefficient shows better agreement and the largest difference occurs at t 21 s 1 9 considering the ratios of oscillation amplitudes over radiated wave lengths table 2 the smaller the ratio is the lower the radiated wave steepness is the more dominant the linear effects are and the better the estimated added mass and damping coefficients from cfd simulation approximate those from experiments in the experiments the motion and forces were measured by different measurement devices whether the force and motion signals are measured synchronously or not is crucial for the estimations of added mass and damping coefficients there is no accurate evaluation of time lag between different signals in the experiments so time lags of either 0 01 s sampling interval in the experiments and 0 02 s are used to investigate this effect this estimated time lag is similar to the time lag observed in hybrid testing of a floating wind turbine sauder et al 2016 the added mass and damping coefficients under motion lead or force lead are estimated and shown in the uncertainty bars of fig 12 the time lag between motion and force has minor influence on the calculated added mass coefficients but its impact on the calculated damping coefficients is more significant for shorter oscillation periods the same trend is observed for the different time lags generally good agreement is obtained between measured and numerically estimated hydrodynamic surge force and added mass and damping coefficients which suggests that it is possible to reproduce the correct hydrodynamic characteristics at low oscillation frequency in the cfd model 5 1 2 forced oscillation in surge in the cfd model based on eq 8 the kc numbers of each column of floater under forced oscillations in surge in the cfd model are presented in fig 13 the kc numbers vary from 0 5 to 7 4 and β is from 2 11e 05 to 8 64e 06 fig 14 compares the total surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients calculated from the cfd simulations and the values due to linear radiation considering the columns wadam1 and the contributions of morison s added mass and drag terms on the braces wadam2 the cfd simulations lead to similar added mass coefficients for smaller amplitudes 1 91 m and 3 82 m however for the largest amplitude 7 64 m the added mass coefficient is 2 7 smaller this decrease is closely related with the variation of kc numbers on each column more details can be found in the discussions about the added mass coefficients for different columns compared to the cfd model potential flow theory wadam1 underestimates the added mass up to 10 furthermore the contribution of braces only accounts for 2 5 percent in the potential flow added mass wadam1 vs wadam2 in addition the results also highlight the weak dependency of added mass on oscillation period in the cfd simulations the linearized damping coefficient decreases with oscillation amplitude and increases with oscillation period considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient in eq 23 the damping has opposite trend with the linearized damping coefficient that means the faster the surge motion is the larger the damping is in the potential flow results the radiation damping wadam1 is completely negligible with respect to the viscous damping wadam2 the linearized damping coefficient in the wadam2 model is close to the quadratic damping coefficient 0 744 in morison s equation compared to the cfd results morison type drag coefficient based on the towing tests in wadam2 underestimates the viscous damping the obtained surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients on individual columns are compared numerically in fig 15 based on other research dütsch et al 1998 gao et al 2020 the added mass coefficient of a circular cylinder is weakly dependent on the kc number when kc 3 for larger kc number the added mass coefficient decreases as kc increases and achieves the minimum value around kc 15 then the added mass coefficient increases with kc hence for the main column kc 2 the added mass coefficient decreases with increasing oscillation amplitude for the upper part of column the added mass coefficient has similar results within 1 under two smaller oscillation amplitudes kc 2 and significantly reduces for the largest amplitude kc 4 for the heave plates kc 2 the weak dependency of added mass coefficient on oscillation amplitudes seems to be valid for longer oscillation period slow surge motion but the added mass coefficient increases with kc for shorter oscillation period all the changes are due to the variations of vortex pattern around the floater the computed hydrodynamic pressures on the aft point b and starboard sides point a of upper part of starboard column are shown in fig 16 the double frequency and negative mean value of hydrodynamic pressures on the starboard side show the occurrence of vortex shedding in the cfd simulations compared to the cfd results potential flow predicts smaller added mass coefficient with a maximum difference of 15 6 200 s sc b except a larger added mass coefficient under largest oscillation amplitude for the upper part of columns uc u sc u additionally the added mass coefficient on the starboard column is larger than the one on the upstream column and this increase is more significant in the cfd simulations dütsch et al 1998 show that the drag coefficient decreases with increasing kc numbers for kc 3 when 3 kc 15 the drag coefficient is weakly dependent on the kc number the same trends can be seen in the cfd simulations fig 15 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as kc increases however for larger kc values such as larger amplitude for the main column mc and upper part of upstream and starboard column uc u sc u the variations of linearized damping coefficients over oscillation amplitude are quite small furthermore the linearized damping coefficient of each column increases with oscillation period the damping coefficient for each column in wadam model has similar results as the total damping coefficient however the underestimation of viscous damping by morison type drag wadam2 does not seems to be valid for all comparisons this also highlights the different drag coefficients instead of a uniform one should be applied in accurate estimations of viscous damping for each column furthermore in the cfd simulations the starboard column has a slightly larger damping compared to the upstream column the shorter distance from the main column along the x direction and the effect of the portside column can explain this additional damping in order to validate whether there are consistent conclusions between free decay and forced oscillation or not the durations of different cycles in the surge free decay are given in table 9 the small variations in durations suggest that the motion amplitude has minor effect on the added mass considering the maximum kc number is 1 8 furthermore from fig 8 the damping is also weakly dependent on the kc in the free decay which is not consistent with conclusions in the forced oscillation the possible reason is that linear damping dominates for very small motion however when the mean motion amplitude in the free decay is close to the motion amplitude in the forced oscillation the estimated added mass and damping are in good agreement as shown in table 10 5 2 forced oscillations in heave for the forced oscillations in heave the kc number is defined based on the heave plate diameter for the upstream and starboard columns the corresponding kc numbers are presented in fig 17 ranging from 0 25 to 7 4 the β varies from 2 23e 06 to 3 62e 07 the total heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients are presented in fig 18 the added mass coefficient increases with oscillation amplitude for all cases the calculated added mass coefficient from the cfd simulations is higher than the one derived from the potential flow theory wadam1 with a maximum increase of 32 7 64 m similar results can be found in previously published research cozijn et al 2005 lopez pavon and souto iglesias 2015 a possible explanation for this increase is that the flow separation and the formation of eddies at the edge of heave plates for the large motion change the phase difference between the pressure and the motion of floater the braces give minor contributions to the total added mass coefficient within 2 finally the added mass coefficient is independent of the oscillation period the linearized damping coefficient is independent of the oscillation period and decreases as the oscillation amplitude increases in the cfd simulations by comparing wadam1 and wadam2 viscous damping dominates and the radiation damping is completely negligible the difference of the computed linearized damping coefficient between wadam1 and wadam2 is close to the quadratic drag coefficient 2 48 by matching the experimental data in morison s equation which underestimates the viscous damping the heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients among different columns are compared in fig 19 the added mass and linearized damping coefficients of the main column are much smaller than the upstream and starboard columns even when dividing by the small diameter which is related to the lack of a heave plate for smaller oscillation amplitudes 0 955 m and 3 82 m cfd and potential flow theory predict similar added mass coefficients for the main column which seems to be independent of the oscillation period and amplitude however for the largest oscillation amplitude 7 64 m the added mass increases sharply and shows significant dependency on the oscillation period this is because the oscillation amplitude is larger than the distance between the ledge see fig 2 and still water line 4 25 m and the occurrence of flow separation and eddies at the ledge gives additional added mass the overestimation for the linearized damping coefficient on the main column by morison type drag suggests that a smaller axial drag coefficient should be applied for the column without the heave plate the contribution of the heave plate is dominant for the heave forces and the added mass and linearized damping coefficients for the upstream and starboard columns show similar trends as the total added mass and linearized damping coefficients furthermore there are no significant differences between the upstream and starboard columns the consistency of conclusions based on free decay and forced oscillation in heave is also investigated from fig 18 the radiation added mass gives a good estimate of the added mass with small heave motion the heave free decay considers motion amplitudes which are smaller than the forced oscillations and there is no significant change in the duration of different cycles during the decay table 11 from fig 9 the linear damping increases with the motion amplitude considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient in eq 23 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as the motion amplitude increases which is the same conclusion as the free decay tests table 12 compares the estimated heave added mass and damping with similar motion amplitude in free decay and forced oscillation the added mass agrees well whereas the damping is quite sensitive to the motion amplitude 5 3 forced oscillations in pitch the total pitch added mass and linearized damping coefficients are compared in fig 20 for small pitch motion the total added mass coefficient is independent of the oscillation period and increases slightly with oscillation amplitude however the total added mass coefficient decreases with oscillation period for the largest pitch motion 0 273 rad a possible explanation is that complex vortex vortex and vortex column interaction can change the vortex pattern around the column for large pitch motions there is a significant underestimation of the pitch added mass coefficient using potential flow theory the contribution of braces to the total pitch added mass coefficient is less than 1 the pitch linearized damping coefficient decreases with the oscillation amplitude and shows a weaker dependency on the oscillation period furthermore the viscous damping dominates and the radiation damping can be neglected wadam1 vs wadam2 the applied morison s drag coefficients by matching experimental data underpredict the viscous damping since the mass distributions of each column are unknown the mass of moment inertia about y axis eq 22 is calculated assuming the mass is uniformly distributed the pitch added mass and linearized damping coefficients among different columns can be seen in fig 21 in the cfd model the main column has some openings at the intersection with the braces where no pressure results are obtained the loss of pressure at these openings leads to the negative added mass coefficient of the main column in the cfd simulations in the potential flow calculation the main column is considered as a closed cylinder this effect on the added mass and linearized damping coefficients is shown in table 13 with a difference in percentage from the results with braces when the main column is built as a closed cylinder without brace in the cfd simulation the added mass coefficient changes to positive table 13 but is also smaller than the potential flow solution presented in fig 21 furthermore the added mass coefficient of the main column seems to be independent of the oscillation amplitude but its magnitude increases with the oscillation period the negative added mass coefficient of main column is useful to consider for further modification of potential flow results in order to better simulate local responses on the semi submersible fwt the interaction between heave plate and braces has minor influence on the added mass coefficient for the upstream and starboard columns table 13 the added mass coefficient of the upstream column has similar behavior as the total added mass coefficient because most of total pitch moment arises from the contribution of the upstream column the added mass coefficient of the starboard column also shows similar trends as the total added mass coefficient except a slight decrease with the oscillation period for the smaller oscillation amplitude linear potential flow theory underestimates the added mass coefficient of upstream column but overestimates the results for the main and starboard columns the pitch linearized damping coefficients of different columns fig 21 appear to weakly depend on the oscillation period and decrease with the oscillation amplitude given both the magnitude of the linearized damping coefficient and the projected area eq 23 the upstream column contributes the most to the damping the morison type drag coefficients by matching experimental data underestimate the viscous pitch damping the interaction between columns and braces reduces the damping on each column table 13 with a minimum decrease of 0 59 for the upstream column and a maximum decrease of 31 44 for the main column similar conclusions can be found between free decay and forced oscillations in pitch the small variations of duration for different cycles table 14 in the pitch free decay are consistent with the constant added mass for small pitch motion in the forced oscillations in pitch furthermore from fig 10 the linear damping increases with the motion amplitude considering the definition of linearized damping coefficient eq 23 the linearized damping coefficient decreases as the motion amplitude increases which is the same conclusion as the forced oscillations table 15 compares the added mass and damping coefficient for the maximum mean pitch motion in the free decay and the minimum pitch motion in the forced oscillation the estimated added mass is in good agreement whereas the calculated damping has a linear relationship with the amplitude 6 conclusions in order to investigate the still water hydrodynamic characteristics of the floater for a semi submersible fwt a series of free decay and forced oscillation tests have been conducted in experiments and in a cfd model the focus is on long periods which are close to the natural periods for rigid body fwt motions in the current work the kc number varies from 0 25 to 7 4 and β is in the range of 2 11e 05 to 3 62e 07 for the free decay better correspondence can be found in the heave and pitch decay with shorter natural periods however for the surge decay with longer period cfd underestimates the damping by 30 compared to the experiment it is hypothesized that the additional damping between spring lines and pulleys as well as coupling of rigid body motions increases the damping in the experiment the uncertainty of experimental data and post processing also contributes to this difference furthermore the linear damping dominates the surge and pitch damping while quadratic damping is found in the heave damping due to the vortex shedding around the edge of heave plates the estimated natural periods of the floater motion are in good agreement with ones calculated from the experiments within 4 5 forced oscillations in surge around the natural periods of surge heave and pitch motion are firstly performed in the cfd model for validation compared to the experimental results the maximum difference of 4 6 for the added mass coefficient and 1 9 for the damping coefficient suggest the cfd model can reproduce the correct hydrodynamic characteristics at low oscillation frequency next the hydrodynamic characteristics of the whole floater and each column are analyzed using the cfd model the results are compared with the results from the potential flow theory with morison type drag the drag coefficients are determined by matching the experimental data for these long periods the surge added mass coefficient seems to be independent of the oscillation amplitude for small surge motion kc 2 and then decreases with the oscillation amplitude a slight period dependency can be found in the surge added mass coefficient furthermore the surge linearized damping coefficient increases towards longer period and smaller motion amplitude the surge added mass and linearized damping coefficients on the starboard column are slightly larger than on the upstream column the heave added mass and linearized damping coefficients show on one hand a small dependence on the oscillation period and on the other hand a larger dependence with the oscillation amplitude most of contributions of added mass and linearized damping coefficients come from the heave plates no difference can be found between the upstream and starboard columns a weak dependency of the pitch added mass coefficient on the oscillation amplitude and period is found for small pitch motion however the pitch added mass coefficient decreases with oscillation period for large pitch motion the pitch linearized damping coefficient has similar behavior as the heave linearized damping coefficient the added mass coefficient derived from the cfd simulation is slightly superior to the one estimated by the potential flow theory in most cases viscous effects give an additional added mass regarding the damping the radiation damping is completely negligible and the viscous damping from vortex shedding dominates the accuracy of capturing the vortex shedding using morison s drag force is sensitive to the drag coefficient finally free decay and forced oscillation tests give consistent conclusions about the trend of added mass and damping coefficients over the amplitude credit authorship contribution

20691,flexible risers are designed with strong anti collapse capacities which enable them to operate in deep water reservoirs however this anti collapse capacity is susceptible to the pipe curvature in the flooded annulus condition for the curved riser sections within the touch down zone significant reduction of collapse capacity can occur once their external sheaths are worn out by the seabed resulting in the so called wet collapse mostly wet collapse studies of curved flexible risers are performed through costly numerical simulations since there are no alternative analytical approaches in view of it this work presents an analytical model for predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers the analytical model is developed based on a spring supported arch model that from our previous work which is able to take the curvature induced factors into account with the stability theories of arched structures the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers can be solved to verify this analytical model 3d full fe models are employed the critical collapse pressures predicted by these two kinds of approach are in good agreement indicating this proposed analytical model can be an useful tool to facilitate the collapse analysis in pipe design stage keywords flexible pipes curvature effect collapse behaviors wet collapse analytical solution nomenclature α half of the

reservoirs to floating vessels they are multi layered tubular structures which consist of helical wound metal bands and extruded thermoplastics rahmati et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 weppenaar and andersen 2014 owing to their internal helical structural layout they can tolerant large bending deformation and be used in different riser configurations brouard et al 2016 simpson and lima 2019 this makes the flexible riser a key device in deep water production clarke et al 2011 lukassen et al 2019 as nowadays hydrocarbon production moves to the reservoirs in water depth of 3000 m murawski et al 2020 flexible risers have to withstand huge hydro static pressure without collapse to predict and design the collapse strength of those tubular structures accurately studies regarding their collapse capacity have been carried out extensively to understand all the possible influential factors like installation loads curvature material hardening as well as radial gaps miyazaki et al 2018 caleyron et al 2017 skjerve et al 2014 axelsson and skjerve 2014 deng et al 2016 lin et al 2016 deng et al 2019 even so the collapse failure of flexible risers is still an issue that have not been fully addressed collapse failure of flexible risers caused by hydro static pressure is commonly divided into two types dry and wet collapse depending on the annulus conditions of flexible risers api 2014a gay neto and martins 2012 dry collapse may occur when the outer sheath is intact and all layers within the riser play a role together to resist the hydro static pressure once the outer sheath is breached as shown in fig 2 crome 2013 mahé 2015 the seawater floods the riser annulus and the external pressure acts directly on the inner sheath this situation named wet collapse represents the most extreme loading condition since the whole external pressure is resisted by the carcass alone other layers mainly the pressure armor contributes to the collapse resistance by restraining the radial deformation of the carcass at present the collapse capacity of a flexible riser is designed based on the wet collapse concept api 2014a b which makes the collapse capacity of flexible risers to be designed conservatively however it was found that the wet collapse resistance is susceptible to the pipe curvature curved collapse tests done by companies such as technipfmc technip paumier et al 2009 and bhge wellstream lu et al 2008 clevelario et al 2010 showed that the wet collapse pressure could be reduced around 10 20 when the pipe samples were bent to their minimum bending radius mbr api 2014b therefore the curvature effect cannot be ignored in the wet collapse analysis of flexible risers curved collapse calculations for the most part are performed by numerical simulations since they allow better insight into the structural integrity and layer interaction as shown in fig 3 due to the structural complexity of flexible pipes however the modeling and the computation in numerical simulations are always time consuming gay neto et al 2012 by contrast analytical models are more convenient in early stages of design for the collapse analysis most of analytical models are developed from a general ring buckling model presented by timoshenko and gere timoshenko and gere 1963 various equivalent layer methods have been proposed to treat the interlocking layers as equivalent homogeneous rings martins et al 2003 li et al 2018a b with this treatment those analytical models simplify the flexible pipe as a concentric ring structure solving the collapse pressure based on the buckling theories of rings mostly those analytical models are used to predict the collapse pressure of straight risers glock 1977 bai et al 2016 the main difficulty of using analytical models in curved collapse is how to address the global curvature effect with a two dimensional ring model in such a context this work presents an analytical model to address the curved wet collapse issue of flexible risers which aims to facilitate the collapse calculations in the pipe design stage prior to this work a mechanism study li et al 2020a was conducted by our team to gain insight into the wet collapse behaviors of curved flexible risers this study reveals that the curvature effect for reducing the wet collapse resistance of flexible risers is the result of three factors the squeeze induced additional ovalization the pitch elongation and the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass among them the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the major contributing factor to the curvature effect following that mechanism study an analytical model is developed in this work to predict the wet collapse pressure of curved risers which is able to take those three factors into account in our previous work li et al 2020b a spring supported arch model was proposed to predict the wet collapse pressure for straight flexible risers with initial ovalization and inter layer gap the arch model is taken as a theoretical framework in this paper to incorporate the curvature effect the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the arch model is first briefly outlined followed by the model development to incorporate the above mentioned three factors section 3 presents the verification of the analytical model in which the 3d full fe models from our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a are employed discussions based on the results from both the analytical and numerical models are given in section 4 the conclusions are given in the final section 2 model development in order to predict the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers a spring supported arch model from our previous work li et al 2020b was used this arch model was proposed for wet collapse analysis of straight risers which is regarded as a theoretical framework in this study to incorporate curvature effect for the curved collapse issue the whole model development is going to be described with two subsections the first subsection briefly outlines the theoretical framework for the collapse analysis while the second subsection clarifies how to introduce the curvature induced factors into this framework 2 1 theoretical framework for the flexible riser with a breached outer sheath the hydro static pressure is mainly withstood by the innermost carcass in this situation the carcass is buckled under the external pressure with a deformation as illustrated in fig 4 a since wet collapse is governed by the buckling strength of the detached portions of the carcass simplification can be made in the theoretical analysis to regard those portions as a circular arch with a new center o as shown in fig 4 b in this figure r θ y is the cylindrical coordinate system whose origin locates at the arch center o x y z is the local cartesian coordinate system of the arch cross section as the radial deformation of the carcass is restrained in the contact regions the surrounded pressure armor together with the liner is treated as springs that supports at the arch ends therefore a spring supported arch model was proposed to predict the wet collapse pressure of straight flexible pipes by using the equivalent layer methods martins et al 2003 li et al 2018a such an arch can be built with equivalent wall thickness and material properties to solve the buckling pressure of this spring supported arch one assumption given by timoshenko and gere 1963 is adopted which assumes that the carcass collapses when its maximum hoop compressive stress reaches the material yield stress with this assumption the wet collapse pressure can be determined by equating the maximum hoop compressive stress of the arch to its material equivalent yield stress for the circular arch subjected to uniform radial pressure the general linear equilibrium equation set for its differential element can be expressed as tong 2005 1 q x n q ρ 0 n q x 0 m q x ρ 0 where m n and q x are the bending moment hoop force and radial shear force on the differential element the positive directions of those internal forces are shown in fig 5 ρ is the arch radius superscript represents θ θ is the angle for an arbitrary section aa of the arch q is the uniform loads along the radial direction using displacements to reformulate eqs 1 then 2 e eq a eq w u ρ 0 e eq a eq w u ρ e eq i eq ρ 3 u iv 2 u u ρ q where u and w as shown in fig 4 b are displacements of the differential element along the radial and circumferential directions separately e denotes the young s modulus a denotes the cross sectional area i is the inertia moment and r is the radius the items with subscript eq refer to the equivalent properties of the carcass for the arch if taking k as 3 k ρ 3 e eq i eq ρ q e eq a eq w u ρ then the general solution of eqs 2 can be written as 4 u k c 1 cos θ k c 2 θ sin θ k w k c 1 sin θ k c 2 sin θ θ cos θ k c 3 θ where c 1 c 3 are constants that determined by the boundary conditions the internal forces at any cross section defined by the angle θ are 5 n e eq a eq k ρ 1 c 3 e eq i eq k ρ 3 1 2 c 2 cos θ m e eq i eq k ρ 2 2 c 2 cos θ 1 q x e eq i eq k ρ 3 2 c 2 sin θ for a spring supported arch model as depicted in fig 4 b it has boundary conditions at its arch ends as 6 w θ α 0 no hoop displacement n θ α n thrust force equilibrium in hoop direction q x k t u θ α 0 force equilibrium in radial direction where n thrust is the hoop thrust force at the arch end α is the half of the included angle of the circular arch k t is the elastic stiffness of the pressure armor together with the liner with the above boundary conditions the formulae of c 1 c 3 can be derived by substituting the coefficients into eqs 5 the maximum compressive stress at the crown point of the arch can be written as a function of the external pressure q since the wet collapse is defined by material yielding therefore the collapse pressure q cr of the arch can be worked out as 7 σ y eq σ θ q cr θ 0 σ y eq n cr t eq 6 m cr t eq 2 0 where σ y is the material yielding stress σ θ is the hoop stress t denotes the wall thickness subscript cr represents the parameters at the moment of collapse 2 2 curvature induced factors in our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a three factors induced by pipe curvature can lead to the decrease of wet collapse resistance which are the deformed cross sectional shape and the pitch elongation of the carcass and the squeeze effect of the liner the first two factors affect the collapse modes while the third one impose an additional ovalization onto the carcass in what follows these factors are introduced to the theoretical framework step by step 2 2 1 cross sectional shape of the carcass the geometry of the circular arch is directly related to the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass under external pressure depending on the initial ovalization types and pipe curvature of flexible pipes the carcass could collapse into symmetrical bi symmetrical or transitional shapes li et al 2020b compared to the bi symmetrical oval shaped carcass a symmetrical one leads to a circular arch with a smaller rise span ratio providing less collapse resistance to the hydro static pressure in this work the carcass with singly and doubly initial ovalization is studied respectively as depicted by the section cc in fig 6 in order to provide a conservative prediction of the wet collapse the singly ovalization in this study is always introduced to the side of the carcass where pitch elongation occurs during the bending considering a carcass with a doubly initial ovalization first as shown in fig 7 the collapse mode of this initial doubly ovalized carcass gradually turns from a bi symmetrical shape to a symmetrical one with the increase of pipe curvature assuming the circumference of the carcass remains unchanged during the collapse process then the arch radius ρ and included angle 2 α can be determined based on the cross sectional shapes as below 8 bi symmetrical 2 π r c 2 r s π 2 β 4 α ρ ρ sin α r s sin β 9 symmetrical 2 π r c 2 r s π β 2 α ρ ρ sin α r s sin β where r s is the distance from the separation point to the ring center at the collapse moment and β is the corresponding angular quantity displayed in fig 7 they can be calculated by referring to our previous work li et al 2020b the items with subscript c refer to the properties of the carcass in this doubly initial ovalized case the bi symmetrical shape is adopted in the wet collapse prediction of straight risers while the symmetrical one is used for the risers bent to their mbr the collapse pressures from these two pipe configurations are regarded as upper and lower bounds in the wet collapse analysis based on these two bounds the wet collapse pressure of risers with a curvature in between can be predicted by interpolation for the carcass with a singly initial ovalization its cross section is assumed to perform a symmetrical shape at the collapse moment no matter the pipe is in a straight or curved configuration therefore the formulas of the symmetrical shape can be used to determine the arch geometry for the riser with a singly initial ovalized carcass by substituting the arch radius and angle into the corresponding equations listed in the theoretical framework this curvature induced shape effect is included 2 2 2 pitch elongation the pitch of the carcass extrados is elongated during the bending as shown in fig 8 this pitch elongation reduces the superposed areas between two carcass profiles within one pitch making the carcass extrados less stiff and easier to be collapsed in our theoretical framework the carcass extrados is treated as an equivalent arch by determining the equivalent properties of the carcass extrados the reduced radial stiffness caused by the pitch elongation is introduced into the arch model for the flexible riser bent with a curvature of κ the elongated pitch of the carcass extrados is given as sævik and ye 2016 10 l c ex l c r c κ 1 where l c ex is the elongated pitch of the carcass extrados l c is the carcass pitch of a straight riser without any external loads κ represents the pipe curvature with the elongated pitch from eq 10 equivalent properties of the carcass extrados can be determined for the arch model a strain energy based equivalent method presented in our previous work li et al 2018a is adopted in this arch model which builds the equivalences between the carcass and its equivalent layer with their membrane stiffness and the absorbed strain energy the strain energy is obtained by subjecting the carcass and its equivalent layer to a radial compression force that could cause the onset of material yielding of the carcass with this strain energy based method the equivalent thickness and young s modulus of the carcass can be determined by 11 u c u eq f 2 r c 1 υ c 2 32 π a eq e eq c π a eq g c 12 r c 2 π 2 8 e eq t eq 3 l c ex π e c a c l c ex e eq t eq where u c and u eq are the strain energy of the carcass and its equivalent layer f is the radial compression force for triggering the onset of material yielding of the carcass υ is the poisson s ratio c is the correction factor for a rectangular cross section in shear langhaar 1962 and g is material shear modulus the equivalent yield stress can be also worked out as 12 σ y eq e eq σ y 2 e c a c l c ex t eq with eqs 11 12 the equivalent properties of the carcass extrados are determined for the arch it should be noted that the strain energy based equivalent layer method used here is just one way to involve the reduction effect of radial stiffness caused by the pitch elongation other equivalent methods such as bending stiffness equivalence per length martins et al 2003 or per area j r m et al 2001 could also be used as alternatives 2 2 3 squeeze effect of the liner owing to the large lay angle and interlocked nature of the carcass the flexural stress introduced by bending can be neglected however the flexural stresses in the polymeric liner can generate a flattening load p s to squeeze the cross section of the carcass sævik and ye 2016 as depicted in fig 9 a gresnigt 1986 for the flexible riser bent with a curvature of κ the squeeze pressure generated by the liner can be calculated as brazier 1927 guarracino 2003 13 p s ξ κ 2 e l t l r l sin ξ where p s is the harmonic squeeze load the items with subscript l refer to the properties of the liner ξ is the angle measured from neutral plane to section aa as illustrated in fig 9 b under this squeeze load the moment equilibrium at the section aa of the carcass gives 14 m ξ m 0 n 0 r c 1 cos ξ r c 2 0 ξ p s ξ cos τ cos ξ d τ where d τ denotes the angle enclosed by the differential element m 0 and n 0 are the bending moment and reaction force at the section that on the neutral plane respectively the reaction force n 0 can be derived as 15 n 0 0 π 2 p s ξ r c sin ξ d ξ π 4 κ 2 e l t l r l r c the bending moment m 0 can be also derived based on the moment area theorem 16 0 π 2 m ξ e c i c r c d ξ 0 17 m 0 2 π π 5 4 κ 2 e l t l r l r c 2 thus eq 14 can be written as 18 m ξ 1 4 cos 2 ξ π 4 cos ξ 8 π 2 κ 2 e l t l r l r c 2 since the differential equation of radial deflection of the carcass is expressed as 19 d 2 ω d ξ 2 ω m ξ r c 2 e eq i eq where ω is the radial deflection caused by squeeze load p s with the conditions given below 20 d ω d ξ ξ 0 d ω d ξ ξ π 2 0 the radial deflection at the arbitrary section of the carcass takes form as 21 ω ξ κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 4 e eq i eq 2 8 π cos 2 ξ 3 4 π ξ sin ξ cos ξ 2 considering the pipe collapse is a plane strain issue then the radial deflection of the carcass at ξ 0 and π 2 can be obtained as 22 ω 0 1 3 π 2 24 π κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 e eq t eq 3 1 υ c 2 1 υ l 2 23 ω π 2 5 3 π 2 4 3 π 24 π κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 e eq t eq 3 1 υ c 2 1 υ l 2 therefore the additional ovalization caused by squeeze load is worked out as 24 δ ad ω π 2 ω 0 2 r c ω π 2 ω 0 where δ ad is the additional ovalization due to the squeeze effect for the straight riser with an initial ovalization δ 0 it performs an ovalization for its curved configuration as 25 δ 0 c δ 0 δ ad where δ 0 is the initial ovalization of the straight riser δ 0 c is the ovalization after bending δ 0 c can be regarded as a new initial ovalization for the spring supported arch model loureiro and pasqualino 2012 besides additional hoop stresses in the carcass are also triggered by the applied squeeze load at the crown point of the arch the maximum compressive hoop stress caused by the squeeze load can be calculated as 26 σ θ ad θ 0 6 m ξ ξ π 2 t eq 2 with this additional hoop stress eq 7 is then improved as 27 σ y eq σ θ q cr θ 0 σ θ ad θ 0 0 by obtaining the new initial ovalization δ 0 c as well as the additional hoop stress the curvature induced squeeze effect is included in this arch model with these three factors involved in the theoretical framework the curvature effect is therefore considered in the wet collapse analysis below is a flowchart see fig 10 which shows the whole prediction procedure of using this arch model in the next section case studies are conducted to verify this analytical model 3 model verification the above section clarifies the development of the analytical model for incorporating the curvature effect to verify this analytical model the finite element models presented in our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a were employed case studies regarding various pipe curvature were carried out in this verification in which the wet collapse pressures were predicted for the carcass with singly and doubly initial ovalization respectively 3 1 doubly initial ovalization in our previous study li et al 2020a two fe models model a and model b were established to study the wet collapse resistance of a 4 internal diameter id bent flexible pipe that with a 0 5 doubly initial ovalization as shown in fig 11 the detailed geometrical and material properties of this 4 pipe can be referred to the work of gay neto and martins 2012 2014 model a was a three layer model with the carcass the inner liner and the pressure armor a boundary condition called bc1 was adopted in model a to prevent the restoring effect in curved collapse analyses which was the nodes on the two lines of inner liner that were only allowed to move along x axis direction after bending the bc1 was then found that had an interference on the collapse behavior of the carcass during the finite element studies therefore model b was developed with an additional outer sheath and bc2 replaced bc1 by moving the fixed lines to the outer surface of the outer sheath the difference between these two fe models is the cross sectional shape effect is excluded in model a due to the improper condition bc1 it adopted for preventing pipe restoration both these fe models were employed to verify the analytical model model b was used to examine the reliability of the arch model in predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved risers with the aid of model a whether those curvature induced factor were correctly considered in the arch model can also be examined the case studies were conducted with a set of radius of curvature which were 3 m mbr 4 m 5 m 6 m 7 m and straight by using the strain energy based equivalent method the equivalent properties for the analytical model in each curved case were work out as table 1 before the curved collapse analysis a comparison was made between the analytical and numerical calculations regarding the pitch elongation and ovalization which was given in table 2 the aim of the comparisons is to show whether these two factors can be correctly estimated by the analytical formulations it can be seen that both numerical and analytical calculations perform an increase of the same magnitude for each factor when the curvature goes up therefore the analytical calculations of these two curvature induced factors can be reliable inputs for the following curved collapse analysis with the equivalent properties and additional ovalization the wet collapse pressures for different curvature were predicted by the analytical model although multiple factors were involved in the curvature effect the cross sectional shape of the carcass was identified by the mechanism study as a major contributing factor to the reduction of the wet collapse strength this should also be reflected by the analytical model in this respect model a and model b were used separately to verify the arch model with and without the incorporation of the shape factor as the doubly initial ovalized carcass within model a always performed an approximate bi symmetrical cross section due to bc1 therefore the bi symmetrical shape was adopted in the corresponding arch model table 3 gives the wet collapse pressures predicted by model a and the arch model for no shape effect incorporated which are in good agreement model b was employed to verify the arch model that incorporated all the curvature induced factors as stated in section 2 the riser curved with a curvature less than mbr 1 presents a transition shape between the bi symmetrical and symmetrical ones this brings barriers to the prediction of the wet collapse pressure for those risers which are not heavily bent to tackle this problem a solution is proposed as follow during the analytical prediction the bi symmetrical shape is adopted in the wet collapse prediction of straight risers while the symmetrical one is used for the risers in mbr based on the pressures from these two pipe configurations the wet collapse pressures for the risers with transitions shape can be interpolated linearly according to their curvature fig 12 plots the collapse pressure given by model b and the analytical model for each curvature with the above mentioned solution the wet collapse pressure for cases with a radius of curvature from 4 7 m were interpolated those data are listed in table 4 which show a good correlation between the analytical and numerical predictions 3 2 singly initial ovalization the analytical model was further verified for predicting the wet collapse pressure of the curved risers which were singly initial ovalized for comparative purposes a singly initial ovalization of 0 5 was imposed to the carcass extrados side of model b as shown in fig 13 by conducting the same curvature cases this verification was made for the riser with such a singly initial ovalization the arch model assumes that it always triggers a symmetrical shape of the carcass at the collapse moment therefore wet collapse pressures of all the cases predicted by the arch model were performed based on this symmetrical shape assumption regardless of the pipe curvature the predictions from the singly initial ovalized model b and the arch model are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the result from the arch model for each pipe curvature is in good agreement with numerical one which shows a maximum error that less than 8 4 result analysis and discussions in section 3 the analytical model is verified by the 3d full finite element models for both singly and doubly initial ovalization according to our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a multiple factors such as pitch elongation and squeeze induced ovalization are involved in the curvature effect among them the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the one which contributes the most to the reduction of curved wet collapse resistance to make sure whether this phenomenon could also be reflected by the analytical model both fe model a and model b were employed in the verification model a was used to verify the analytical model which only incorporates the pitch elongation and the squeeze effect according to table 3 the analytical prediction of wet collapse pressure for each curvature case gives an error around 3 5 by comparing to the results of model a indicating that these two factors are well considered in the analytical model furthermore both the analytical and numerical results perform insignificant reduction of the wet collapse pressure with the increase of curvature radius from to 3 m which are 1 83 and 1 2 respectively it implies that the effects of pitch elongation and squeeze induced ovalization on the reduction of wet collapse resistance are limited by including the shape effect the analytical model was then verified by model b for different initial ovalization types for the doubly initial ovalization the analytical model gives predictions of wet collapse pressure that correlate well with the numerical ones with an error of 3 on average this comparison shows that the analytical model is capable of predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved risers with doubly initial ovalization moreover both of these two models show significant decreases of the wet collapse pressure with the increase of pipe curvature which go up to 9 in the 3m case this indicates that the shape effect does play an important role in the reduction of wet collapse resistance of curved flexible risers fig 14 shows the deformed cross section of the doubly initial ovalized carcass at the collapse moment for each pipe curvature for the singly initial ovalization the predictions from the analytical model also agree well with the numerical results in the curved cases the differences between two kinds of prediction are less than 4 however the analytical model gives a much conservative prediction for the straight riser by comparing to model b this is due to the fact that the applied external pressure can trigger a radial deflection of not only the initial ovalized portion but also the initial unovalized one as shown in fig 13 since ovalized and unovalized portions of the carcass have the closest radial stiffnesses for the riser in a straight configuration a small deflection on the unovalized side could also be caused by the external pressure before the collapse of the ovalized portion as a result the straight case performs a transition shape rather than a symmetrical shape with the increase of curvature the difference of radial stiffness between these two portions goes up the external pressure is unable to cause a significant radial deflection of the unovalized portion before the final collapse from the 7m case displayed in fig 15 an unclosed gap on the pipe intrados at the collapse moment could still be observed when the radius of curvature goes above 5 m there is no gap any more on the pipe intrados for the collapse moment since a symmetrical shape assumption is adopted in the analytical model for the singly initial ovalized carcass the wet collapse pressure is therefore conservatively predicted for the straight riser it should be noted that the deformed shapes of the carcass at the collapse moment do not represent the heart or eight mode in the post buckling phase li et al 2020b for example a bi symmetrical deformed shape of the carcass may also lead to the heart mode this is because the snap through can only occur at a single point if the cross section is not in a perfect symmetrical shape once the snap through takes place the release of strain energy will stabilize any other possible failure points of the carcass immediately this may explain why the heart mode is a typical mode shape that usually found in wet collapse tests paumier et al 2009 in addition the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass can be influenced by the stiffness ratio of pressure armor to carcass malta et al 2012 actually the deformed shape of the carcass at the collapse moment depends on the curvature level symmetry condition of the initial ovalization as well as the stiffness of the pressure armor although the influence of the stiffness of pressure armor is not included in this work further relevant studies should be carried out 5 conclusions following our previous mechanism study an analytical model is established in this paper for predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers this analytical model is developed from a spring supported arch model proposed in our previous work which predicts the curved wet collapse pressure by incorporating the curvature induced factors the 3d full fe models presented in the mechanism study are employed to verify this analytical model based on the whole curved collapse studies several conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 both analytical and numerical studies reveal that the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the major contributing factor in curvature effect for the models includes the pitch elongation and squeeze effect only their results show that the pipe curvature could only trigger a slight decrease of the wet collapse pressure once the shape effect is introduced to those models significant drop of the wet collapse pressure occurs with the increase of pipe curvature 2 the proposed analytical model has a good performance on predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible pipes this analytical model was used to predict the wet collapse pressure for a 4 id flexible pipe with different curvature and initial ovalization types by comparing analytical predictions to the numerical ones the proposed analytical model is verified in which the maximum error is 7 5 3 this analytical model can be an efficient tool for the collapse analysis in pipe design stage the numerical simulation in our case studies consumes 2 3 days on average to finish one job by contrast the computational time required by the proposed analytical model takes only few seconds up to now the analytical models developed for curved collapse analysis of flexible pipes are very limited in public literature although numerical simulations can be an alternative their high computational cost makes them less feasible for the collapse analysis in design stage to fill this gap an analytical model is presented in this work which can take the curvature effect into account the verification given by numerical simulation indicates that this analytical model can be a good choice for curved wet collapse issue credit authorship contribution statement xiao

20691,flexible risers are designed with strong anti collapse capacities which enable them to operate in deep water reservoirs however this anti collapse capacity is susceptible to the pipe curvature in the flooded annulus condition for the curved riser sections within the touch down zone significant reduction of collapse capacity can occur once their external sheaths are worn out by the seabed resulting in the so called wet collapse mostly wet collapse studies of curved flexible risers are performed through costly numerical simulations since there are no alternative analytical approaches in view of it this work presents an analytical model for predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers the analytical model is developed based on a spring supported arch model that from our previous work which is able to take the curvature induced factors into account with the stability theories of arched structures the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers can be solved to verify this analytical model 3d full fe models are employed the critical collapse pressures predicted by these two kinds of approach are in good agreement indicating this proposed analytical model can

reservoirs to floating vessels they are multi layered tubular structures which consist of helical wound metal bands and extruded thermoplastics rahmati et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 weppenaar and andersen 2014 owing to their internal helical structural layout they can tolerant large bending deformation and be used in different riser configurations brouard et al 2016 simpson and lima 2019 this makes the flexible riser a key device in deep water production clarke et al 2011 lukassen et al 2019 as nowadays hydrocarbon production moves to the reservoirs in water depth of 3000 m murawski et al 2020 flexible risers have to withstand huge hydro static pressure without collapse to predict and design the collapse strength of those tubular structures accurately studies regarding their collapse capacity have been carried out extensively to understand all the possible influential factors like installation loads curvature material hardening as well as radial gaps miyazaki et al 2018 caleyron et al 2017 skjerve et al 2014 axelsson and skjerve 2014 deng et al 2016 lin et al 2016 deng et al 2019 even so the collapse failure of flexible risers is still an issue that have not been fully addressed collapse failure of flexible risers caused by hydro static pressure is commonly divided into two types dry and wet collapse depending on the annulus conditions of flexible risers api 2014a gay neto and martins 2012 dry collapse may occur when the outer sheath is intact and all layers within the riser play a role together to resist the hydro static pressure once the outer sheath is breached as shown in fig 2 crome 2013 mahé 2015 the seawater floods the riser annulus and the external pressure acts directly on the inner sheath this situation named wet collapse represents the most extreme loading condition since the whole external pressure is resisted by the carcass alone other layers mainly the pressure armor contributes to the collapse resistance by restraining the radial deformation of the carcass at present the collapse capacity of a flexible riser is designed based on the wet collapse concept api 2014a b which makes the collapse capacity of flexible risers to be designed conservatively however it was found that the wet collapse resistance is susceptible to the pipe curvature curved collapse tests done by companies such as technipfmc technip paumier et al 2009 and bhge wellstream lu et al 2008 clevelario et al 2010 showed that the wet collapse pressure could be reduced around 10 20 when the pipe samples were bent to their minimum bending radius mbr api 2014b therefore the curvature effect cannot be ignored in the wet collapse analysis of flexible risers curved collapse calculations for the most part are performed by numerical simulations since they allow better insight into the structural integrity and layer interaction as shown in fig 3 due to the structural complexity of flexible pipes however the modeling and the computation in numerical simulations are always time consuming gay neto et al 2012 by contrast analytical models are more convenient in early stages of design for the collapse analysis most of analytical models are developed from a general ring buckling model presented by timoshenko and gere timoshenko and gere 1963 various equivalent layer methods have been proposed to treat the interlocking layers as equivalent homogeneous rings martins et al 2003 li et al 2018a b with this treatment those analytical models simplify the flexible pipe as a concentric ring structure solving the collapse pressure based on the buckling theories of rings mostly those analytical models are used to predict the collapse pressure of straight risers glock 1977 bai et al 2016 the main difficulty of using analytical models in curved collapse is how to address the global curvature effect with a two dimensional ring model in such a context this work presents an analytical model to address the curved wet collapse issue of flexible risers which aims to facilitate the collapse calculations in the pipe design stage prior to this work a mechanism study li et al 2020a was conducted by our team to gain insight into the wet collapse behaviors of curved flexible risers this study reveals that the curvature effect for reducing the wet collapse resistance of flexible risers is the result of three factors the squeeze induced additional ovalization the pitch elongation and the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass among them the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the major contributing factor to the curvature effect following that mechanism study an analytical model is developed in this work to predict the wet collapse pressure of curved risers which is able to take those three factors into account in our previous work li et al 2020b a spring supported arch model was proposed to predict the wet collapse pressure for straight flexible risers with initial ovalization and inter layer gap the arch model is taken as a theoretical framework in this paper to incorporate the curvature effect the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the arch model is first briefly outlined followed by the model development to incorporate the above mentioned three factors section 3 presents the verification of the analytical model in which the 3d full fe models from our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a are employed discussions based on the results from both the analytical and numerical models are given in section 4 the conclusions are given in the final section 2 model development in order to predict the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers a spring supported arch model from our previous work li et al 2020b was used this arch model was proposed for wet collapse analysis of straight risers which is regarded as a theoretical framework in this study to incorporate curvature effect for the curved collapse issue the whole model development is going to be described with two subsections the first subsection briefly outlines the theoretical framework for the collapse analysis while the second subsection clarifies how to introduce the curvature induced factors into this framework 2 1 theoretical framework for the flexible riser with a breached outer sheath the hydro static pressure is mainly withstood by the innermost carcass in this situation the carcass is buckled under the external pressure with a deformation as illustrated in fig 4 a since wet collapse is governed by the buckling strength of the detached portions of the carcass simplification can be made in the theoretical analysis to regard those portions as a circular arch with a new center o as shown in fig 4 b in this figure r θ y is the cylindrical coordinate system whose origin locates at the arch center o x y z is the local cartesian coordinate system of the arch cross section as the radial deformation of the carcass is restrained in the contact regions the surrounded pressure armor together with the liner is treated as springs that supports at the arch ends therefore a spring supported arch model was proposed to predict the wet collapse pressure of straight flexible pipes by using the equivalent layer methods martins et al 2003 li et al 2018a such an arch can be built with equivalent wall thickness and material properties to solve the buckling pressure of this spring supported arch one assumption given by timoshenko and gere 1963 is adopted which assumes that the carcass collapses when its maximum hoop compressive stress reaches the material yield stress with this assumption the wet collapse pressure can be determined by equating the maximum hoop compressive stress of the arch to its material equivalent yield stress for the circular arch subjected to uniform radial pressure the general linear equilibrium equation set for its differential element can be expressed as tong 2005 1 q x n q ρ 0 n q x 0 m q x ρ 0 where m n and q x are the bending moment hoop force and radial shear force on the differential element the positive directions of those internal forces are shown in fig 5 ρ is the arch radius superscript represents θ θ is the angle for an arbitrary section aa of the arch q is the uniform loads along the radial direction using displacements to reformulate eqs 1 then 2 e eq a eq w u ρ 0 e eq a eq w u ρ e eq i eq ρ

cross sectional area i is the inertia moment and r is the radius the items with subscript eq refer to the equivalent properties of the carcass for the arch if taking k as 3 k ρ 3 e eq i eq ρ q e eq a eq w u ρ then the general solution of eqs 2 can be written as 4 u k c 1 cos θ k c 2 θ sin θ k w k c 1 sin θ k c 2 sin θ θ cos θ k c 3 θ where c 1 c 3 are constants that determined by the boundary conditions the internal forces at any cross section defined by the angle θ are 5 n e eq a eq k ρ 1 c 3 e eq i eq k ρ 3 1 2 c 2 cos θ m e eq i eq k ρ 2 2 c 2 cos θ 1 q x e eq i eq k ρ 3 2 c 2 sin θ for a spring supported arch model as depicted in fig 4 b it has boundary conditions at its arch ends as 6 w θ α 0 no hoop displacement n θ α n thrust force equilibrium in hoop direction q x k t u θ α 0 force equilibrium in radial direction where n thrust is the hoop thrust force at the arch end α is the half of the included angle of the circular arch k t is the elastic stiffness of the pressure armor together with the liner with the above boundary conditions the formulae of c 1 c 3 can be derived by substituting the coefficients into eqs 5 the maximum compressive stress at the crown point of the arch can be written as a function of the external pressure q since the wet collapse is defined by material yielding therefore the collapse pressure q cr of the arch can be worked out as 7 σ y eq σ θ q cr θ 0 σ y eq n cr t eq 6 m cr t eq 2 0 where σ y is the material yielding stress σ θ is the hoop stress t denotes the wall thickness subscript cr represents the parameters at the moment of collapse 2 2 curvature induced factors in our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a three factors induced by pipe curvature can lead to the decrease of wet collapse resistance which are the deformed cross sectional shape and the pitch elongation of the carcass and the squeeze effect of the liner the first two factors affect the collapse modes while the third one impose an additional ovalization onto the carcass in what follows these factors are introduced to the theoretical framework step by step 2 2 1 cross sectional shape of the carcass the geometry of the circular arch is directly related to the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass under external pressure depending on the initial ovalization types and pipe curvature of flexible pipes the carcass could collapse into symmetrical bi symmetrical or transitional shapes li et al 2020b compared to the bi symmetrical oval shaped carcass a symmetrical one leads to a circular arch with a smaller rise span ratio providing less collapse resistance to the hydro static pressure in this work the carcass with singly and doubly initial ovalization is studied respectively as depicted by the section cc in fig 6 in order to provide a conservative prediction of the wet collapse the singly ovalization in this study is always introduced to the side of the carcass where pitch elongation occurs during the bending considering a carcass with a doubly initial ovalization first as shown in fig 7 the collapse mode of this initial doubly ovalized carcass gradually turns from a bi symmetrical shape to a symmetrical one with the increase of pipe curvature assuming the circumference of the carcass remains unchanged during the collapse process then the arch radius ρ and included angle 2 α can be determined based on the cross sectional shapes as below 8 bi symmetrical 2 π r c 2 r s π 2 β 4 α ρ ρ sin α r s sin β 9 symmetrical 2 π r c 2 r s π β 2 α ρ ρ sin α r s sin β where r s is the distance from the separation point to the ring center at the collapse moment and β is the corresponding angular quantity displayed in fig 7 they can be calculated by referring to our previous work li et al 2020b the items with subscript c refer to the properties of the carcass in this doubly initial ovalized case the bi symmetrical shape is adopted in the wet collapse prediction of straight risers while the symmetrical one is used for the risers bent to their mbr the collapse pressures from these two pipe configurations are regarded as upper and lower bounds in the wet collapse analysis based on these two bounds the wet collapse pressure of risers with a curvature in between can be predicted by interpolation for the carcass with a singly initial ovalization its cross section is assumed to perform a symmetrical shape at the collapse moment no matter the pipe is in a straight or curved configuration therefore the formulas of the symmetrical shape can be used to determine the arch geometry for the riser with a singly initial ovalized carcass by substituting the arch radius and angle into the corresponding equations listed in the theoretical framework this curvature induced shape effect is included 2 2 2 pitch elongation the pitch of the carcass extrados is elongated during the bending as shown in fig 8 this pitch elongation reduces the superposed areas between two carcass profiles within one pitch making the carcass extrados less stiff and easier to be collapsed in our theoretical framework the carcass extrados is treated as an equivalent arch by determining the equivalent properties of the carcass extrados the reduced radial stiffness caused by the pitch elongation is introduced into the arch model for the flexible riser bent with a curvature of κ the elongated pitch of the carcass extrados is given as sævik and ye 2016 10 l c ex l c r c κ 1 where l c ex is the elongated pitch of the carcass extrados l c is the carcass pitch of a straight riser without any external loads κ represents the pipe curvature with the elongated pitch from eq 10 equivalent properties of the carcass extrados can be determined for the arch model a strain energy based equivalent method presented in our previous work li et al 2018a is adopted in this arch model which builds the equivalences between the carcass and its equivalent layer with their membrane stiffness and the absorbed strain energy the strain energy is obtained by subjecting the carcass and its equivalent layer to a radial compression force that could cause the onset of material yielding of the carcass with this strain energy based method the equivalent thickness and young s modulus of the carcass can be determined by 11 u c u eq f 2 r c 1 υ c 2 32 π a eq e eq c π a eq g c 12 r c 2 π 2 8 e eq t eq 3 l c ex π e c a c l c ex e eq t eq where u c and u eq are the strain energy of the carcass and its equivalent layer f is the radial compression force for triggering the onset of material yielding of the carcass υ is the poisson s ratio c is the correction factor for a rectangular cross section in shear langhaar 1962 and g is material shear modulus the equivalent yield stress can be also worked out as 12 σ y eq e eq σ y 2 e c a c l c ex t eq with eqs 11 12 the equivalent properties of the carcass extrados are determined for the arch it should be noted that the strain energy based equivalent layer method used here is just one way to involve the reduction effect of radial stiffness caused by the pitch elongation other equivalent methods such as bending stiffness equivalence per length martins et al 2003 or per area j r m et al 2001 could also be used as alternatives 2 2 3 squeeze effect of the liner owing to the large lay angle and interlocked nature of the carcass the flexural stress introduced by bending can be neglected however the flexural stresses in the polymeric liner can generate a flattening load p s to squeeze the cross section of the carcass sævik and ye 2016 as depicted in fig 9 a gresnigt 1986 for the flexible riser bent with a curvature of κ the squeeze pressure generated by the liner can be calculated as brazier 1927 guarracino 2003 13 p s ξ κ 2 e l t l r l sin ξ where p s is the harmonic squeeze load the items with subscript l refer to the properties of the liner ξ is the angle measured from neutral plane to section aa as illustrated in fig 9 b under this squeeze load the moment equilibrium at the section aa of the carcass gives 14 m ξ m 0 n 0 r c 1 cos ξ r c 2 0 ξ p s ξ cos τ cos ξ d τ where d τ denotes the angle enclosed by the differential element m 0 and n 0 are the bending moment and reaction force at the section that on the neutral plane respectively the reaction force n 0 can be derived as 15 n 0 0 π 2 p s ξ r c sin ξ d ξ π 4 κ 2 e l t l r l r c the bending moment m 0 can be also derived based on the moment area theorem 16 0 π 2 m ξ e c i c r c d ξ 0 17 m 0 2 π π 5 4 κ 2 e l t l r l r c 2 thus eq 14 can be written as 18 m ξ 1 4 cos 2 ξ π 4 cos ξ 8 π 2 κ 2 e l t l r l r c 2 since the differential equation of radial deflection of the carcass is expressed as 19 d 2 ω d ξ 2 ω m ξ r c 2 e eq i eq where ω is the radial deflection caused by squeeze load p s with the conditions given below 20 d ω d ξ ξ 0 d ω d ξ ξ π 2 0 the radial deflection at the arbitrary section of the carcass takes form as 21 ω ξ κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 4 e eq i eq 2 8 π cos 2 ξ 3 4 π ξ sin ξ cos ξ 2 considering the pipe collapse is a plane strain issue then the radial deflection of the carcass at ξ 0 and π 2 can be obtained as 22 ω 0 1 3 π 2 24 π κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 e eq t eq 3 1 υ c 2 1 υ l 2 23 ω π 2 5 3 π 2 4 3 π 24 π κ 2 e l t l r l r c 4 e eq t eq 3 1 υ c 2 1 υ l 2 therefore the additional ovalization caused by squeeze load is worked out as 24 δ ad ω π 2 ω 0 2 r c ω π 2 ω 0 where δ ad is the additional ovalization due to the squeeze effect for the straight riser with an initial ovalization δ 0 it performs an ovalization for its curved configuration as 25 δ 0 c δ 0 δ ad where δ 0 is the initial ovalization of the straight riser δ 0 c is the ovalization after bending δ 0 c can be regarded as a new initial ovalization for the spring supported arch model loureiro and pasqualino 2012 besides additional hoop stresses in the carcass are also triggered by the applied squeeze load at the crown point of the arch the maximum compressive hoop stress caused by the squeeze load can be calculated as 26 σ θ ad θ 0 6 m ξ ξ π 2 t eq 2 with this additional hoop stress eq 7 is then improved as 27 σ y eq σ θ q cr θ 0 σ θ ad θ 0 0 by obtaining the new initial ovalization δ 0 c as well as the additional hoop stress the curvature induced squeeze effect is included in this arch model with these three factors involved in the theoretical framework the curvature effect is therefore considered in the wet collapse analysis below is a flowchart see fig 10 which shows the whole prediction procedure of using this arch model in the next section case studies are conducted to verify this analytical model 3 model verification the above section clarifies the development of the analytical model for incorporating the curvature effect to verify this analytical model the finite element models presented in our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a were employed case studies regarding various pipe curvature were carried out in this verification in which the wet collapse pressures were predicted for the carcass with singly and doubly initial ovalization respectively 3 1 doubly initial ovalization in our previous study li et al 2020a two fe models model a and model b were established to study the wet collapse resistance of a 4 internal diameter id bent flexible pipe that with a 0 5 doubly initial ovalization as shown in fig 11 the detailed geometrical and material properties of this 4 pipe can be referred to the work of gay neto and martins 2012 2014 model a was a three layer model with the carcass the inner liner and the pressure armor a boundary condition called bc1 was adopted in model a to prevent the restoring effect in curved collapse analyses which was the nodes on the two lines of inner liner that were only allowed to move along x axis direction after bending the bc1 was then found that had an interference on the collapse behavior of the carcass during the finite element studies therefore model b was developed with an additional outer sheath and bc2 replaced bc1 by moving the fixed lines to the outer surface of the outer sheath the difference between these two fe models is the cross sectional shape effect is excluded in model a due to the improper condition bc1 it adopted for preventing pipe restoration both these fe models were employed to verify the analytical model model b was used to examine the reliability of the arch model in predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved risers with the aid of model a whether those curvature induced factor were correctly considered in the arch model can also be examined the case studies were conducted with a set of radius of curvature which were 3 m mbr 4 m 5 m 6 m 7 m and straight by using the strain energy based equivalent method the equivalent properties for the analytical model in each curved case were work out as table 1 before the curved collapse analysis a comparison was made between the analytical and numerical calculations regarding the pitch elongation and ovalization which was given in table 2 the aim of the comparisons is to show whether these two factors can be correctly estimated by the analytical formulations it can be seen that both numerical and analytical calculations perform an increase of the same magnitude for each factor when the curvature goes up therefore the analytical calculations of these two curvature induced factors can be reliable inputs for the following curved collapse analysis with the equivalent properties and additional ovalization the wet collapse pressures for different curvature were predicted by the analytical model although multiple factors were involved in the curvature effect the cross sectional shape of the carcass was identified by the mechanism study as a major contributing factor to the reduction of the wet collapse strength this should also be reflected by the analytical model in this respect model a and model b were used separately to verify the arch model with and without the incorporation of the shape factor as the doubly initial ovalized carcass within model a always performed an approximate bi symmetrical cross section due to bc1 therefore the bi symmetrical shape was adopted in the corresponding arch model table 3 gives the wet collapse pressures predicted by model a and the arch model for no shape effect incorporated which are in good agreement model b was employed to verify the arch model that incorporated all the curvature induced factors as stated in section 2 the riser curved with a curvature less than mbr 1 presents a transition shape between the bi symmetrical and symmetrical ones this brings barriers to the prediction of the wet collapse pressure for those risers which are not heavily bent to tackle this problem a solution is proposed as follow during the analytical prediction the bi symmetrical shape is adopted in the wet collapse prediction of straight risers while the symmetrical one is used for the risers in mbr based on the pressures from these two pipe configurations the wet collapse pressures for the risers with transitions shape can be interpolated linearly according to their curvature fig 12 plots the collapse pressure given by model b and the analytical model for each curvature with the above mentioned solution the wet collapse pressure for cases with a radius of curvature from 4 7 m were interpolated those data are listed in table 4 which show a good correlation between the analytical and numerical predictions 3 2 singly initial ovalization the analytical model was further verified for predicting the wet collapse pressure of the curved risers which were singly initial ovalized for comparative purposes a singly initial ovalization of 0 5 was imposed to the carcass extrados side of model b as shown in fig 13 by conducting the same curvature cases this verification was made for the riser with such a singly initial ovalization the arch model assumes that it always triggers a symmetrical shape of the carcass at the collapse moment therefore wet collapse pressures of all the cases predicted by the arch model were performed based on this symmetrical shape assumption regardless of the pipe curvature the predictions from the singly initial ovalized model b and the arch model are listed in table 5 it can be seen that the result from the arch model for each pipe curvature is in good agreement with numerical one which shows a maximum error that less than 8 4 result analysis and discussions in section 3 the analytical model is verified by the 3d full finite element models for both singly and doubly initial ovalization according to our previous mechanism study li et al 2020a multiple factors such as pitch elongation and squeeze induced ovalization are involved in the curvature effect among them the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the one which contributes the most to the reduction of curved wet collapse resistance to make sure whether this phenomenon could also be reflected by the analytical model both fe model a and model b were employed in the verification model a was used to verify the analytical model which only incorporates the pitch elongation and the squeeze effect according to table 3 the analytical prediction of wet collapse pressure for each curvature case gives an error around 3 5 by comparing to the results of model a indicating that these two factors are well considered in the analytical model furthermore both the analytical and numerical results perform insignificant reduction of the wet collapse pressure with the increase of curvature radius from to 3 m which are 1 83 and 1 2 respectively it implies that the effects of pitch elongation and squeeze induced ovalization on the reduction of wet collapse resistance are limited by including the shape effect the analytical model was then verified by model b for different initial ovalization types for the doubly initial ovalization the analytical model gives predictions of wet collapse pressure that correlate well with the numerical ones with an error of 3 on average this comparison shows that the analytical model is capable of predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved risers with doubly initial ovalization moreover both of these two models show significant decreases of the wet collapse pressure with the increase of pipe curvature which go up to 9 in the 3m case this indicates that the shape effect does play an important role in the reduction of wet collapse resistance of curved flexible risers fig 14 shows the deformed cross section of the doubly initial ovalized carcass at the collapse moment for each pipe curvature for the singly initial ovalization the predictions from the analytical model also agree well with the numerical results in the curved cases the differences between two kinds of prediction are less than 4 however the analytical model gives a much conservative prediction for the straight riser by comparing to model b this is due to the fact that the applied external pressure can trigger a radial deflection of not only the initial ovalized portion but also the initial unovalized one as shown in fig 13 since ovalized and unovalized portions of the carcass have the closest radial stiffnesses for the riser in a straight configuration a small deflection on the unovalized side could also be caused by the external pressure before the collapse of the ovalized portion as a result the straight case performs a transition shape rather than a symmetrical shape with the increase of curvature the difference of radial stiffness between these two portions goes up the external pressure is unable to cause a significant radial deflection of the unovalized portion before the final collapse from the 7m case displayed in fig 15 an unclosed gap on the pipe intrados at the collapse moment could still be observed when the radius of curvature goes above 5 m there is no gap any more on the pipe intrados for the collapse moment since a symmetrical shape assumption is adopted in the analytical model for the singly initial ovalized carcass the wet collapse pressure is therefore conservatively predicted for the straight riser it should be noted that the deformed shapes of the carcass at the collapse moment do not represent the heart or eight mode in the post buckling phase li et al 2020b for example a bi symmetrical deformed shape of the carcass may also lead to the heart mode this is because the snap through can only occur at a single point if the cross section is not in a perfect symmetrical shape once the snap through takes place the release of strain energy will stabilize any other possible failure points of the carcass immediately this may explain why the heart mode is a typical mode shape that usually found in wet collapse tests paumier et al 2009 in addition the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass can be influenced by the stiffness ratio of pressure armor to carcass malta et al 2012 actually the deformed shape of the carcass at the collapse moment depends on the curvature level symmetry condition of the initial ovalization as well as the stiffness of the pressure armor although the influence of the stiffness of pressure armor is not included in this work further relevant studies should be carried out 5 conclusions following our previous mechanism study an analytical model is established in this paper for predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible risers this analytical model is developed from a spring supported arch model proposed in our previous work which predicts the curved wet collapse pressure by incorporating the curvature induced factors the 3d full fe models presented in the mechanism study are employed to verify this analytical model based on the whole curved collapse studies several conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 both analytical and numerical studies reveal that the deformed cross sectional shape of the carcass is the major contributing factor in curvature effect for the models includes the pitch elongation and squeeze effect only their results show that the pipe curvature could only trigger a slight decrease of the wet collapse pressure once the shape effect is introduced to those models significant drop of the wet collapse pressure occurs with the increase of pipe curvature 2 the proposed analytical model has a good performance on predicting the wet collapse pressure of curved flexible pipes this analytical model was used to predict the wet collapse pressure for a 4 id flexible pipe with different curvature and initial ovalization types by comparing analytical predictions to the numerical ones the proposed analytical model is verified in which the maximum error is 7 5 3 this analytical model can be an efficient tool for the collapse analysis in pipe design stage the numerical simulation in our case studies consumes 2 3 days on average to finish one job by contrast the computational time required by the proposed analytical model takes only few seconds up to now the analytical models developed for curved collapse analysis of flexible pipes are very limited in public literature although numerical simulations can be an alternative their high computational cost makes them less feasible for the collapse analysis in design stage to fill this gap an analytical model is presented in this work which can take the curvature effect into account the verification given by numerical simulation indicates that this analytical model can be a good choice for curved wet collapse issue credit authorship contribution statement xiao

20692,air bubble curtain anti fouling systems which meet both the environmental standards of suspended solids diffusion and navigation requirements have unique advantages in environmental dredging technology through the bubble plume formed by dense bubble hole jets the bubble curtain blocks the material exchange between the designated area and other areas in the water to prevent the diffusion of suspended pollutants and protect the water environment the protection efficiency of the bubble curtain is determined by the fusion of the bubble flow in the rising process and the stability of the plume under the action of a cross flow the feasibility of a bubble curtain in field engineering is evaluated in this paper using two fluid models the time varying process of bubble fusion and migration in a bubble plume is analyzed the dynamic behavior characteristics of the bubble plume are obtained and the factors influencing the stability of the bubble plume are quantitatively described the results show that the turbidity of the water body decreases in front of and behind the bubble curtain which proves that the bubble curtain system is practical in dredging engineering the number size range and median value of bubbles in the flume are related to the ventilation pressure and pipe structure there are three different phenomena in the half width of the bubble plume at different heights with the general linear model it is concluded that the fusion height of the bubble plume is the most sensitive to the change in the bubble tube hole spacing and that the migration characteristics of the bubble plume are most significantly affected by the air flow at the bubble hole the mechanical analysis of the plume stability shows that the weber number is the most important

diffusion caused by a disturbance to the bottom of the waterway during dredging ship construction will pollute the surrounding water area mcclimans et al 2012 rajasekaran et al 2005 which is contrary to the vigorous ecological environmental protection policy at present a relatively simple measure to prevent the diffusion of suspended solids lee and lee 2003 during the dredging process is to set up a closed geotextile anti pollution curtain around the dredging ship or the whole dredging area to protect the environment however due to the need to frequently open the anti pollution curtain to allow ships to enter and leave the construction area especially when the dredging construction area experiences a busy shipping function its operability is limited or even unfeasible compared with traditional geotextiles wang et al 2020 the air bubble curtain bulson et al 1968 is a technology that can simultaneously meet the requirements of both suspended solids and navigation holzinger and thumfart 2019 in addition in inland lakes and harbor waters the water is relatively static or very slow moving low transverse flow velocity generally speaking the flow velocity is not high it is still a slow flow water body and the disturbance of the flow is not high abdelhaleem et al 2020 zubelzu et al 2019 in water with a low flow velocity or even still water it is more conducive to use bubble curtains which produce a better anti fouling effect research studies on bubble curtains can be divided into two aspects the mechanism of bubble curtains bubble plumes and the application of bubble curtains the formation and stability rensen and roig 2001 of bubble plumes r clift 1978 have mainly been studied in the design optimization of chemical reactors gupta and roy 2013 xiao et al 2013 according to joshi 2001 the plume in the bubble column is divided into three different regional characteristics the distributor influence area where the flow parameters will change with a change in gas distributor the fully developed area where the time average parameters are no longer affected by the static liquid height and gas distributor the gas liquid separation area where the gas phase gradually changes from the dispersed phase in the middle to a continuous phase cerqueira et al 2018 used particle tracking velocimetry ptv to measure the bubble velocity and particle image velocimetry laser induced fluorescence piv lif tracer particles to characterize the bubble plume a group of upward laminar and turbulent bubble flows were analyzed by using this method the results show that the distribution of the turbulence intensity is changed by the axial average velocity and bubble size distribution li et al 2020 used piv to measure the velocity field in the plume and obtained the influence of the plume width centerline velocity volume flux momentum flux momentum amplification factor and entrainment coefficient on plume motion the integral model and general scale of the plume length scale and bubble slip velocity can be used to describe the overall behavior of the bubble plume the common numerical methods for simulating bubble plumes include the euler euler method wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b euler lagrange method buwa et al 2006 chen and hsu 2009 delafosse et al 2018 and volume of fluid method fabregat tomàs et al 2016 liu and luo 2019 xu et al 2013 the two fluid model of the euler euler method is the most common in the simulation of a bubble plume the tfm can accurately determine the continuous motion changes and characteristics of bubble flow amokrane et al 2016 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b studied the bubble plume in a laboratory scale three dimensional bubble column the three dimensional dynamic characteristics of bubble plume migration were investigated by numerical simulation the transient evolution and flow characteristics of the bubble plume were introduced additionally the migration characteristics and oscillation period of the bubble plume were analyzed under the conditions of a high flux and aspect ratio the oscillation characteristics did not appear and the corresponding predicted values were provided vahaji et al 2019 conducted a numerical study of the flow around hydrofoil the bubble size dimensionless velocity and void fraction distribution were obtained under different flow conditions including the angle of attack aoa entrainment coefficient and reynolds number the results show that a change in the aoa has the most significant effect on the bubble distribution yao et al 2019 theoretically and experimentally studied the influencing factors of bubble plumes by using the similarity criterion the experimental results were compared with the theoretical results and the performance of the theoretical model was verified the results show that the optimal ventilation volume flow can improve the efficiency by 8 33 12 38 when monitoring the dredging operation in genoa port cutroneo et al 2014 used a double tube bubble curtain to test the efficiency of the bubble curtain for controlling the diffusion of dredged material and the effectiveness of the measurement method by setting a bubble curtain system a barrier can be formed at the bubble curtain to isolate the water on both sides and control the diffusion of the dredged materials dugué et al 2013 investigated the effect of bubble curtains on the bed morphology and the potential for change scouring and silting outside the channel will endanger the stability of the bund or reduce the navigable width of the channel in the bubble curtain the direction of secondary flow induced by bubbles is changed and its intensity is reduced the maximum bend scour is reduced by approximately 50 which no longer endangers the stability of the bank at the same position the maximum flow velocity and the maximum vertical velocity of the impinging bed also appear and the bubble curtain greatly reduces the deposition of the inner beach dugué et al 2015 studied the inducing mechanism of a bubble curtain on the morphological redistribution of a shallow river and riverbed the bubble curtain induces the secondary flow perpendicular to the pipe and increases the rising speed of the bubbles which in turn strengthens the secondary flow this coupled hydrodynamic morphological behavior explains that the size and intensity of the secondary flow on a moving bed are larger than those on a stationary bed oldeman et al 2020 found that the bubble curtain was successful as a separator for salt and fresh water in the first 30 s however due to the swing of the plume the bubble curtain acted more like a mixer the mixing rate increases with increasing air flow rate and the two mechanisms of particle salt invasion are distinguished when the froude air number is 0 the optimal air flow rate can be determined lu et al 2015 investigated the reliability of a bubble curtain to prevent oil spill diffusion under the action of hydrodynamic water by combining experimental and numerical simulation methods the effects of the pore size structure including the size and spacing of the pore diameter and position of the pipeline on the oil containing effect of the bubble curtain are discussed in detail and different air displacements and water flow velocities are considered the interaction between air plumes and fluid velocities has also been studied do quang et al 1999 the above studies only focused on the feasibility of bubble curtains and the plume characteristics generated by a single bubble hole but did not observe actual engineering data and analyze the bubble fusion and stability under a porous plume the main factors causing the instability of the bubble plume are the horizontal transverse density gradient of the mixed fluid in the bubble plume and the liquid velocity produced by the gas flow that is the ventilation velocity and the transverse flow velocity affect the stability of the bubble plume the bubble plume will be destroyed due to the drag disturbance of a transverse flow and the appearance of a large inertial force li et al 2019 and the bubble plume is unstable fleck and rzehak 2019 when the plume is unstable it will move laterally therefore the migration characteristics of the plume are introduced to quantitatively describe the stability and instability degree of the plume at present quantitative research on the stability characteristics of bubble plumes in bubble curtains is still rare in this paper the combination of experimental and numerical simulation methods using the tfm method the fusion phenomenon and migration behavior of two streams produced by two holes are quantitatively studied the influence of different ventilation flow rates hole spacings and transverse flow velocities on the stability of the bubble plume is discussed the main factors influencing the stability index of the bubble plume are obtained by a general linear model analysis of the mechanical factors section 2 of this paper introduces the field engineering experiment which is performed in the process of dredging and digging a new harbor basin of a port and analyzes the anti pollution effect of the bubble curtain to verify whether the bubble curtain has value in engineering applications section 3 is based on a small laboratory flume to more carefully observe the bubble curtain discuss the movement behavior of the bubble curtain in the still water area and its influence on the surrounding water area and obtain the working mechanism of the bubble curtain section 4 presents the basic equations and settings of the numerical simulation of plume stability section 5 presents the stability analysis including the time varying characteristics principal component analysis and mechanical factor analysis section 6 is the conclusion which not only gives the formation characteristics of the bubble curtain but also offers the main reasons that affect the stability of the bubble curtain 2 field engineering experiment observation fig 1 a shows a schematic diagram of the operation of the bubble curtain the bubble curtain anti fouling system is composed of a perforated hose on the upper part of the sediment and an air compressor on the shore the bubble hole on the hose can produce continuous compressed air from the bottom to the top to form a bubble curtain this bubble curtain drives the ocean current from the bubble outlet to the water surface to form a downward upward movement which forms a backflow in the sealed dredging area thus limiting the dredged suspended solids to the core dredging area there is a transverse flow velocity on the left side of the bubble curtain and the sediment in the dredging area moves after being disturbed by the dredging equipment the bubble curtain makes the bubbles with high momentum move from the bottom to the top through the stimulation forming a diaphragm at the same time the bubble affects the surrounding flow field during the rising process forming a vortex with opposite directions on both sides the sediment is largely confined to the dredged area under the combined influence of the isolation and left vortex fig 1 b shows the actual scene of the application of the bubble curtain in a harbor basin excavation project the track of the bubble curtain on the water surface is not a straight line due to the action of water flow and the position error of the underwater bubble tube laid by the traffic boat many small white areas can be clearly observed around the trajectory all of which are bubbles of different sizes it is concluded that the bubble curtain can successfully form a continuous diaphragm in addition the bubbles are very densely distributed which also shows that the momentum value of bubbles on the water surface is still very large at the same time in the breakwater near the gas supply end of the bubble tube the bending amplitude of the bubble curtain track is not large in a distant wharf the bending is obvious this bending is due to the pressure loss of the bubble curtain which reduces the initial momentum of the bubble fig 1 c shows the data collected by multibeam bathymetry the appearance of a bubble curtain under the water surface can be restored in caris hips software the color change in the figure represents the different depths the redder the color is the smaller the depth is the results clearly indicate that smaller water depths are closer to the bubble curtain this result shows that the bubble curtain has less water content and more bubbles which can successfully block the material exchange between the two sides of the basin the maximum pressure of the bubble tube was 40 psi 2 8 bar the maximum flow rate was 0 12 cubic feet per minute the inner diameter was 24 5 mm and the length of the bubble tube was 80 m field experiments were conducted using rubber hoses with a 1 mm orifice diameter this material is convenient for laying pipes on the sea floor and the orifice size increases with increasing working pressure turbidimetric measurements were performed at several positions on both sides of the bubble curtain by a traffic ship and the coordinates of the sampling points were calibrated by a global positioning system positioning instrument the turbidity meter bockus filtr330 was an acs310 400 portable turbidimeter during the operation the ambient temperature was 302 k during the measurement the water flow velocity was 0 163 m s at a 10 m vertical distance offshore and 0 149 m s at 0 m shore vertical distance from offshore the air supply pressure at the outlet of the air compressor was 3 2 bar and the pressure at the end of the bubble tube was 0 7 bar fig 2 shows the distribution of actual sampling points and the turbidity values at different depths 1 m 3 m and 5 m were measured the t t position is on the dotted line and t t 2 and t t 5 are 10 m from the bubble curtain the transverse flow flows through the bubble curtain area from the source fig 3 shows the turbidity distribution at different sampling points at source location s0 the difference in turbidity values at different heights is the most obvious this difference is because this area belongs to the construction area and there are variations in the pollution at different heights among them the turbidity at 3 m is the highest which also indicates that the construction is near a depth of 3 m pollutants from the source flow into the downstream area along with the flow since there is a corner upstream of t t 1 the turbidity values of different points on the same dotted line are not the same the reason is that the side area of the breakwater is selected for comparison rather than the side of the wharf and the middle area this selection is because the corner topography makes the water that carries the pollutants mainly rush to and collide with the anti wave side and the turbidity value will be higher which better reflects the anti fouling effect of the bubble curtain at the same time the momentum value at the beginning of the bubble curtain pipe is much larger than that at the end of the pipe which can better explain the anti fouling ability of the bubble curtain except for the s0 position of the source the variation trend of other points at different water depths is approximately the same at the source the turbidity fluctuates at different heights due to construction at other sampling points the pollutants at different heights at the same location exhibit a dynamic equilibrium and the turbidity values are approximately equal in addition the variation trend of the turbidity at different depths is basically the same the average turbidity at sources of different depths ranges from 25 to 30 ntu three different data sets were measured at the same place as shown in fig 3 a at the first three measuring points s0 t2 the turbidity at the same depth obviously decreases especially at the third point it decreases to the lowest then it increases at the fourth point gradually decreases and tends to stabilize from the overall trend due to the existence of the bubble curtain the turbidity presents a downward trend the turbidity at the third point is the lowest which is due to the effect of the bubble curtain the backflow generated 5 10 m upstream of the bubble curtain between t2 t3 causes the turbidity to decrease rapidly however near the bubble curtain due to the disturbance of the bubble curtain itself to the water body the turbidity of the water body rises slightly for the first three points the order of turbidity at different depths from high to low is 3 m 5 m and 1 m and the last 4 points show that the order of turbidity from high to low is 5 m 3 m and 1 m this result shows that the suspended solids in the water gradually settle as shown in fig 3 b the turbidity upstream of the bubble curtain is higher than that downstream and the turbidity generally shows a downward trend this trend shows that the bubble curtain can block the diffusion of pollutants and reduce the turbidity at a depth of 3 m due to the intense interaction of the solid liquid and gas and the enhancement of the material exchange and movement at this height the turbidity both upstream and downstream is higher than the corresponding value at other altitudes in the field test observations the transverse flow velocity is generally small without the application of the technology and the bubble curtain is far away from the source of dredging pollution the turbidity around the bubble curtain is dynamically balanced that is to say the turbidity upstream of the bubble curtain is regarded as the turbidity value without the application of the technology which is reasonable and credible comparing the turbidity data of upstream and downstream i e the impact of the technology on turbidity it is found that the technology can effectively prevent diffusion of suspended solids notably since there is only one traffic ship auxiliary test the point by point measurement method was adopted in the measurement of water turbidity the whole measurement process required 2 h during the test the changes in environmental factors affected the water turbidity moreover due to the effect of the propeller wake of the traffic ship the measurement value of water turbidity also had errors so it is difficult to eliminate these errors and calibrate the measured value however through field test observations it can be qualitatively concluded that the bubble curtain system can play a certain role in reducing the turbidity of a water body in practical engineering applications additionally this system can meet the turbidity requirements of the surrounding water body in a dredging construction area which means that the bubble curtain systems have practical application value for dredging engineering 3 laboratory tank test with still water the core content of this section is to study the rising and dynamic characteristics of bubble plume in air bubble curtains in still water and provide the basis for the plume features to prevent the diffusion of suspended solids in dredging engineering the purpose of the experiment is to observe the formation process of bubble curtains by using a camera and to master the distribution of bubbles in the process of bubble curtain formation to prepare for future research on the influence of the disturbance on bubble curtains two kinds of bubble tubes were used a double row hole steel pipe with an angle of 120 and an orifice diameter of 0 5 mm and a single row hole steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 1 mm the rated working pressure of the air compressor was 8 mpa the maximum range of the voltage regulator was 0 25 mpa a 120 double row hole dt symmetrically distributed in the vertical direction of the pipe and has an angle of 60 with the vertical line and a single row hole steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 0 5 mm and a steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 1 mm st were selected for the experiment the water injection depth of the test water tank was 0 8 m as shown in fig 4 one end of the pressure regulator was connected to the air compressor and the other end was connected to the experimental steel pipe the air compressor was turned on and the air valve of the air compressor was opened the pressure regulator was adjusted to 0 05 mpa q1 and 0 1 mpa q2 respectively after the bubble curtain was stable the movement process of the bubbles was observed by a high speed camera and the total number and particle size distribution of the bubbles were recorded first the change in water depth hardly affects the bubble size which has been discussed in many previous references upadhyay et al 2013 and will not be discussed here fig 5 shows the bubble distribution map taken during the test the volume flow corresponding to the ventilation pressure under the test condition is q2 and dt steel pipe is used fig 5 b shows a bubble distribution map obtained by using the image processing method which identifies the bubbles in it the image analysis process in this part is to extract the high speed snapshot file select the target area for gray processing call the function to find the coordinate of the center of the circle and radius of the locked bubble determine the transverse and longitudinal peak values and remove the noise draw the bubble in the original image and obtain the bubble information the map can obtain the number of bubbles and calculate the size distribution of bubbles the bubbles are mainly concentrated in the water area above the pipeline the results show that the bubble particle size is small at the outlet bubble coalescence occurs in the central concentration area and the particle size value significantly increases in table 1 the particle size distribution in the two sides of the middle area is in a small range 0 3 mm at the upper and top interface the bubbles will expand to both sides of the basin and the bubble size distribution is very wide in this area with both bubble coalescence and bubble breaking processes the number of bubbles in the experiment is related to the ventilation pressure and pipe structure with an increase in ventilation pressure the number of bubbles will increase and an increase in the orifice diameter will also increase the number of bubbles the bubble diameter distribution is obviously affected by the structure of the pipeline and is weakly affected by the ventilation pressure the larger the orifice diameter of the pipe is the larger the proportion of large bubbles is the proportion of large bubbles generated by a single row of holes is higher than that of the double row pipes in addition the bubbles distribute symmetrically along the plume centerline when the plume rises and many characteristics of the bubble plume at the same height are symmetrical such as the plume width gas volume fraction and bubble velocity fig 6 shows the plume half width bg at different heights the change trend of bg is only slightly affected by the pipeline structure but obviously affected by the flow rate the first section is the height range 0 0 45 m near the pipeline the plume width is small due to the influence of the sufficient initial momentum the bubbles mainly continue to vertically rise and mainly coalesce the second section is the bubbles at the middle height 0 45 m 0 7 m where the coalescence and breakup of bubbles are in dynamic balance however the momentum carried by bubbles is small and cannot compete with the water resistance the bubbles will move laterally and then there will be axial crushing and coalescence and the plume width will be increased in the third section the height range of bubbles close to the gas liquid interface 0 7 0 8 m will fluctuate at the interface due to the influence of bubble movement and there will be many bubbles adsorbed at the middle height of the fluctuation interface therefore in this section the plume width will first have the maximum peak value the reason is that the plume loss is stable near the interface and the bubbles will rapidly move horizontally toward the interface height at this time the bubbles break up and coalesce with a disorderly movement in addition fig 6 shows that the three segments of plume width can be clearly distinguished when the flow rate is large as shown in fig 6 a at a low flow rate bubbles with a larger particle size distribution are produced in the dt tube which makes the plume half width in the height range of the first and second sections slightly higher than that of the st tube but the trend and values of the two tubes in the third section are consistent this consistency is due to the full development of bubbles in the third section which is no longer affected by the pipeline structure as shown in fig 6 b at a high flow rate the plume half widths within the three height ranges basically coincide and the influence of the flow on the plume motion is much greater than that of the pipeline structure in addition the difference in plume half width between the first and second sections is very significant with increasing flow rate the momentum of bubbles increases the bubbles coalesce break and move more violently and the possibility of bubble change increases the comparison between fig 6 a and b shows that the effect of the discharge on the half width of the plume is mainly concentrated in the height range of the second section followed by the first section and it has little effect on the third section meanwhile the pipeline structure has only a very weak impact on the first section the orifice diameter is the most important factor affecting the bubble diameter while the ventilation flow is the secondary factor with increasing orifice diameter the average value of the bubble diameter increases significantly while with increasing ventilation flow rate the average value of the bubble diameter only increases slightly the bubble motion and particle size distribution in still water are obviously affected by the flow rate and the plume motion can be divided into three different height ranges at the same time the rise of bubbles in still water presents many symmetrical characteristics plume width volume fraction distribution etc 4 mathematical model and simulation settings the numerical simulation is based on the simplified analysis of air bubble curtain in marine dredging engineering to present the plume movement and stability with low transverse flow through two experiments it was proven that the bubble curtain can effectively block the diffusion of pollutants and has a certain anti fouling effect in the actual project in the still water tank the bubble curtain can produce an effective bubble plume and the formation process of the bubble curtain can be observed by a camera to understand the distribution of bubbles in the process of bubble curtain formation however the bubble curtain is bound to be affected by transverse flow in practical applications the influence of a transverse flow disturbance on the stability of the bubble curtain plume needs to be clarified in this section the euler tfm is used to analyze the time varying process of bubble fusion and migration in the bubble plume under the action of transverse flow the dynamic behavior characteristics of the bubble plume are obtained and the factors influencing the stability index of the bubble plume are quantitatively described the tfm model is based on the volume fraction of each phase to construct the mass and momentum conservation equations the model is represented by two sets of conservation equations and the momentum exchange is described by the interaction force as an additional term of each phase in the equation in this study the standard κ ε turbulence model based on the reynolds average navier stokes equation method was used to solve the turbulent effective viscosity of the liquid phase according to the basic closure model the gas liquid interaction includes the closure relationship summarized in table 2 1 t ρ i α i ρ i α i u i 0 2 t ρ i α i u

t e r the stability of the bubble plume includes the fusion process and migration characteristics of a multi bubble flow the offset characteristics include two parts offset distance and tilt angle under the condition of still water and a transverse flow velocity the fusion height of the two bubble flows and the migration characteristics of the main bubble flow in the rising process were analyzed based on the time when the main bubble flow reaches the upper air outlet the fusion height of bubble flow refers to the height of the highest point of the fusion region when the volume fraction of the two bubble flows is approximately equal to that of the two bubble flows the main bubble flow refers to the flow group with a larger volume fraction in the rising bubble flow which is divided into two bubble flows before fusion and one bubble flow after fusion it is not the left and right branch flow generated by bubble flow in motion the reynolds number is defined as follows 5 re u g l l μ l where ug is the gas velocity ll is the characteristic length of water and μl is the kinematic viscosity of water the weber number is defined as follows 6 we ρ g u g 2 l g σ where ρg is the air density ug is the air velocity at the inlet lg is the diameter of the air orifice and σ is the surface tension the dimensionless offset distance id defined as follows 7 η l l where l is the maximum horizontal distance of the bubble offset and l is half of the model width in the model the inclination angle θ is defined as the position where the maximum lateral offset distance of bubble flow is located and the angle between the line segment composed of the central position of the orifice and the vertical line of the orifice center is defined as the inclination angle θ the dimensionless fusion height is defined as follows 8 ζ h h where h is the model height and h is the fusion height when the bubble flow reaches the air outlet the bubble flow is not fused if ζ is larger than 1 the migration characteristics of bubble flow without fusion are not included in this study it is considered that the offset distance is 0 and the offset angle is 0 in previous studies cheng et al 2020a the single hole the single air bubble curtain is greatly affected by the lift force and drag force in the rising motion which exhibits the oscillation and offset phenomenon in the transverse flow the single hole is more prone to instability which makes the air bubble curtain unable to block the diffusion of suspended solids therefore in numerical simulations the double hole model i e two layer bubble curtain with a certain distance is used to explore the plume stability in the air bubble curtain to better guide the anti fouling technology of the air bubble curtain in the actual construction process the anti proliferation effect of the bubble curtain is greatly affected by the surrounding water environment and its own operating conditions this simulation adopts a two dimensional model which is 8 m long and 4 m high the diameter of the orifice at the two inlets is d 0 1 m as shown in fig 7 the simulation was performed in the form of unsteady flow the water phase was the first phase and the air phase was the second phase euler euler method uses implicit physical strength the inlet condition was set as the velocity inlet the air velocity inlet was perpendicular to the boundary line the flow outlet condition was set as the outflow and the bubble outlet condition was set as the pressure outlet for all fixed walls no slip condition was set the selected physical parameters in this paper are shown in table 3 the environmental parameters were the normal temperature and atmospheric pressure the convergence criterion was 1 10 3 for all cases and the turbulent dissipation energy and turbulence dissipation rate were discretized by the second order upwind scheme the actual total flow time of each simulation case is subject to the time when the main bubble flow reaches the upper bubble outlet and the time step was set to 0 002 s which ensures that the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number was always less than 0 5 in the case of maximum velocity the reynolds number ranges from 8000 to 32000 and complete turbulence occurs multiphase turbulence is more complex than single phase turbulence because momentum transfer occurs between the two phases through the phase interface which affects the respective flow field and turbulence thus turbulence models whether gas or liquid include interface terms at the same time bubbles certainly have an effect on liquid phase turbulence the effects of the environmental factors bubble curtain structure and operating conditions on bubble flow fusion and stability were studied considering the effect of the transverse flow the static water condition transverse flow velocity is 0 and transverse flow condition were set the spacing of jet holes was considered for the bubble curtain structure factor and the flow rate of the bubble hole was considered for the operation condition factor the specific working conditions are shown in table 4 5 results and discussion 5 1 verification of the numerical simulation method compared with the experiment of díaz et al 2008 the numerical simulation method in this paper is verified taking the vertical velocity of the liquid phase at a height of 0 25 m it is found that the results of this method are in good agreement with the experimental data fig 8 shows that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data at the vertical velocity instantaneous curve in the vicinity of the center the numerical value obtained by the double euler model slightly underestimates the axial velocity which may be due to the large liquid velocity near the center and the inaccuracy of the drag and lift models which makes the calculated vertical velocity of the liquid phase smaller the calculated results in the region are in good agreement with the experimental data generally the change trend of the axial velocity is consistent in the simulation and experimental result which shows that the selected model in this paper can accurately predict the bubble motion behavior in a liquid phase system 5 2 stability analysis of the bubble plume under transverse flow for the fusion height of bubble flow when the transverse flow velocity is large the left mainstream is combined with the right branch when the transverse flow velocity is small the left mainstream is combined with the right mainstream for the migration characteristics of bubble flow the flow is on the right side of the drainage basin and the bubbles are on the upper side the macroscopic migration of bubble flow is similar but the data values obtained are different taking w2s3q2 as an example the time varying process of the rising and merging of the bubble plume is shown in fig 9 before fusion the bubble flow has an effect on the flow field around the bubbles at the moment of fusion there are four obvious vortices around the bubble flow this effect is because the rising process of the left bubble flow is obviously affected by the transverse flow which makes it shift to the right and then produces a vortex in its left area then the bubble flow is affected by the vortex and swings to the left side forming a small vortex on its right side the right bubble flow is in the middle of the two bubble flows under the influence of the pressure difference first the bubble flow swings to the right forming a vortex on the right under the influence of the right vortex the bubble flow swings to the right and forms a vortex on the left at the same time the bubble flow velocity on the left side is higher than that on the right side which may be caused by the water flow close to the left bubble flow the distribution of the flow field at a large distance from the bubble flow is almost the same after fusion the fusion height of the bubble flow will gradually decrease until the height is close to 0 in fig 9 b the horizontal velocity of the liquid at each point is negative at different times which indicates that there is a vortex in the bubble rising with more time the change in basin around each point becomes increasingly dramatic and the position and intensity of the vortices iteratively change notably the analysis of the migration characteristics is based on the bubble flow movement after the fusion height as shown in fig 10 the velocity vector diagrams of the three examples are analyzed the greater the air flow is the greater the velocity in the basin is the bubble flow moves to the right under the influence of transverse flow there are two large vortices on both sides of bubble flow the flow field on the right side of bubble flow is more disordered than that on the left side this disorder is because the influence of the transverse flow on the right side is weak and the velocity changes sharply in the vortex the velocity in the left region is mainly concentrated in the middle water depth region and the velocity in the right area is mainly concentrated in the upper region near the bubble flow this behavior is related to the opposite direction of the vortices on both sides an air bubble plume can induce the water flow movement 5 3 general linear model analysis based on the stability evaluation index of the bubble plume the fusion characteristics ζ and migration characteristics η and θ of bubble flow were statistically analyzed to establish a comprehensive evaluation index sixteen groups of orthogonal tables with three factors and four levels were generated and the three factors had no interaction the general linear model was used to analyze the variance of multiple factors the third type of sum of squares was selected as shown in table 5 the influence of the three factors on the fusion height is shown in table 6 only the significance of the hole spacing is less than 0 05 therefore in the influence on the fusion height only the hole spacing plays a significant role that is the increase in the hole spacing can make the fusion height continuously increase there is no strong correlation between the air flow and the transverse flow velocity and the fusion height the effect of the three factors on the offset distance is shown in table 7 only the significance of air flow is less than 0 05 therefore only the air flow significantly affects the offset distance i e the air flow and offset distance have a strong correlation and the offset distance increases with increasing flow rate however when the other two factors increase the offset distance does not necessarily increase the influence of the three factors on the migration angle is shown in table 8 in the table the sum of the third type squares of factors s q and error values is larger but combined with the data and the migration process of bubble flow in the experiment the result is credible only the significance of air flow is less than 0 05 therefore only air flow has a significant effect on the offset angle according to tables 7 and 8 the migration characteristics are closely related to the air flow rate but not to the transverse flow velocity and inter hole distance selected in this paper this result is similar to the migration characteristics of single hole bubble flow 5 4 analysis of factors of bubble fusion under transverse flow the key factor that affects the fusion height is the hole spacing which is analyzed in section 5 3 and transverse flow velocity which is a secondary factor the influence of gas volume flux on the bubble fusion height is the weakest so the effect of this factor on the fusion height can be ignored the transverse flow velocity can be divided into four different levels the lowest lower higher and highest levels as shown in fig 11 at the lowest transverse flow velocity the effect of the hole spacing on the height is also very weak this is because the flow velocity is small the water flow will be attenuated by the viscous force and the bubble flow is stable similar to the bubble plume in still water the increase in pore spacing can only delay the fusion time but does not affect bubble fusion at other transverse flow velocities the flow field around the bubble plume will have a multidirectional velocity the bubble flow first affected by transverse flow will swing under the influence of the drag force bubble momentum and lift force and form a vortex on both sides with increasing hole spacing the transverse distance between the two bubbles increases and the bubbles need more momentum to overcome the resistance of water to fuse and gather at this time the transverse flow velocity does not obviously affect the change in fusion height 5 5 analysis of factors of bubble stability under transverse flow the key factors that affect the bubble stability are the gas velocity flux which is explained in section 5 3 and the transverse flow velocity which is a secondary factor the influence of the hole spacing on bubble stability is the weakest so the effect of this factor on bubble stability can be ignored the transverse flow velocity can be divided into four different levels the lowest the lower the higher and the highest values as shown in fig 12 a at the lowest transverse flow velocity the offset distance linearly increases with increasing transverse flow velocity the horizontal flow is small and the inertial force of bubbles plays a major role in the offset distance at other transverse flow velocities the bubble velocity is counterbalanced with the disturbance generated by the transverse flow and the offset distance fluctuates in a small range as shown in fig 12 b under different transverse flow velocities the migration angle fluctuates but with increasing transverse flow velocity the angle generally increases the reason is that the migration angle is related to both the maximum horizontal migration distance and vertical height so the migration angle has a wide range of changes 6 conclusion as an ecological and environmental protection technology that can not only meet the requirements of environmental protection but also meet the navigation requirements it is of great significance to understand the formation characteristics plume fusion and stability characteristics of bubble curtain systems to improve the anti fouling efficiency of bubble curtains from the field engineering experiment it is found that the change trend of turbidity at different water depths is similar showing an overall downward trend from upstream to downstream these findings prove that the bubble curtain system can play a certain role in reducing water turbidity in practical engineering applications and can meet the turbidity requirements of the surrounding water body in dredging construction areas the plume of air bubble curtains in still water is the most basic and pure dynamic process to grasp its dynamic characteristics provides basis and reference for more complex plume movement in dredging engineering taking the formation process of a bubble plume in a flume as the research object the characteristics of bubble formation were studied from an experimental point of view the results show that 1 the number of bubbles increases with increasing ventilation pressure and pipe structure but the bubble diameter distribution is obviously related to the pipe structure and the correlation between the bubble diameter and the pipe structure is weak and with the increase in the orifice diameter the proportion of bubbles with large diameters increases 2 the orifice diameter is the most important factor affecting the bubble diameter while the ventilation pressure is the secondary factor with increasing orifice diameter the average bubble diameter significantly increases 3 in still water the bubble plume exhibits many symmetrical motion properties in the rising process and there will be three different height ranges of the characteristic distribution of the plume in the water area in dredging engineering the disturbance with a low transverse flow is the key to make the bubble curtain ineffective therefore in this paper the core problems in engineering are extracted by numerical simulation method to analyze and solve anti pollution is determined by the turbidity but the mechanism is that the transverse flow makes the bubble curtain unstable and reduces the ability of blocking suspended solids based on the validated cfd model a two dimensional simulation of the bubble curtain formation process under the action of water flow was performed the influence of operation parameters ventilation speed structure parameters hole spacing and environmental parameters transverse flow velocity on the flow field of the bubble curtain was investigated and a statistical analysis was performed in static water the plume stability is only affected by the ventilation flow while the stability of the plume under the transverse flow disturbance will also carry the lateral movement of the plume due to the transverse flow under the action of transverse current the water area is more disordered and the plume will unsteadily move the results show that 1 based on the time varying characteristics of bubble fusion and migration in the bubble plume a smaller air flow rate corresponds to a lower fusion height the left bubble flow migration is more obvious before fusion and the bubble flow presents a concave shape after fusion 2 based on the factor analysis of the bubble plume stability index the hole spacing obviously affects the fusion height and the air flow obviously affects the migration characteristics the results have reference value for the study of anti pollutant diffusion in water environments

20692,air bubble curtain anti fouling systems which meet both the environmental standards of suspended solids diffusion and navigation requirements have unique advantages in environmental dredging technology through the bubble plume formed by dense bubble hole jets the bubble curtain blocks the material exchange between the designated area and other areas in the water to prevent the diffusion of suspended pollutants and protect the water environment the protection efficiency of the bubble curtain is determined by the fusion of the bubble flow in the rising process and the stability of the plume under the action of a cross flow the feasibility of a bubble curtain in field engineering is evaluated in this paper using two fluid models the time varying process of bubble fusion and migration in a bubble plume is analyzed the dynamic behavior characteristics of the bubble plume are obtained and the factors influencing the stability of the bubble plume are quantitatively described the results show that the turbidity of the water body decreases in front of and behind the bubble curtain which proves that the bubble curtain system is practical in dredging engineering the number size range and median value of bubbles in the flume are related to the ventilation pressure and pipe structure there are three different phenomena in the half width of the bubble plume at different heights with the general linear model it is concluded that the fusion height of the bubble plume is the most sensitive to the change in the bubble tube hole spacing and that the migration characteristics of the bubble plume are most significantly affected by the air flow at the bubble hole the mechanical analysis of the plume stability shows that the weber number is the most important

diffusion caused by a disturbance to the bottom of the waterway during dredging ship construction will pollute the surrounding water area mcclimans et al 2012 rajasekaran et al 2005 which is contrary to the vigorous ecological environmental protection policy at present a relatively simple measure to prevent the diffusion of suspended solids lee and lee 2003 during the dredging process is to set up a closed geotextile anti pollution curtain around the dredging ship or the whole dredging area to protect the environment however due to the need to frequently open the anti pollution curtain to allow ships to enter and leave the construction area especially when the dredging construction area experiences a busy shipping function its operability is limited or even unfeasible compared with traditional geotextiles wang et al 2020 the air bubble curtain bulson et al 1968 is a technology that can simultaneously meet the requirements of both suspended solids and navigation holzinger and thumfart 2019 in addition in inland lakes and harbor waters the water is relatively static or very slow moving low transverse flow velocity generally speaking the flow velocity is not high it is still a slow flow water body and the disturbance of the flow is not high abdelhaleem et al 2020 zubelzu et al 2019 in water with a low flow velocity or even still water it is more conducive to use bubble curtains which produce a better anti fouling effect research studies on bubble curtains can be divided into two aspects the mechanism of bubble curtains bubble plumes and the application of bubble curtains the formation and stability rensen and roig 2001 of bubble plumes r clift 1978 have mainly been studied in the design optimization of chemical reactors gupta and roy 2013 xiao et al 2013 according to joshi 2001 the plume in the bubble column is divided into three different regional characteristics the distributor influence area where the flow parameters will change with a change in gas distributor the fully developed area where the time average parameters are no longer affected by the static liquid height and gas distributor the gas liquid separation area where the gas phase gradually changes from the dispersed phase in the middle to a continuous phase cerqueira et al 2018 used particle tracking velocimetry ptv to measure the bubble velocity and particle image velocimetry laser induced fluorescence piv lif tracer particles to characterize the bubble plume a group of upward laminar and turbulent bubble flows were analyzed by using this method the results show that the distribution of the turbulence intensity is changed by the axial average velocity and bubble size distribution li et al 2020 used piv to measure the velocity field in the plume and obtained the influence of the plume width centerline velocity volume flux momentum flux momentum amplification factor and entrainment coefficient on plume motion the integral model and general scale of the plume length scale and bubble slip velocity can be used to describe the overall behavior of the bubble plume the common numerical methods for simulating bubble plumes include the euler euler method wang et al 2019 xiao et al 2017 zhang et al 2020b euler lagrange method buwa et al 2006 chen and hsu 2009 delafosse et al 2018 and volume of fluid method fabregat tomàs et al 2016 liu and luo 2019 xu et al 2013 the two fluid model of the euler euler method is the most common in the simulation of a bubble plume the tfm can accurately determine the continuous motion changes and characteristics of bubble flow amokrane et al 2016 yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a cheng et al 2020b studied the bubble plume in a laboratory scale three dimensional bubble column the three dimensional dynamic characteristics of bubble plume migration were investigated by numerical simulation the transient evolution and flow characteristics of the bubble plume were introduced additionally the migration characteristics and oscillation period of the bubble plume were analyzed under the conditions of a high flux and aspect ratio the oscillation characteristics did not appear and the corresponding predicted values were provided vahaji et al 2019 conducted a numerical study of the flow around hydrofoil the bubble size dimensionless velocity and void fraction distribution were obtained under different flow conditions including the angle of attack aoa entrainment coefficient and reynolds number the results show that a change in the aoa has the most significant effect on the bubble distribution yao et al 2019 theoretically and experimentally studied the influencing factors of bubble plumes by using the similarity criterion the experimental results were compared with the theoretical results and the performance of the theoretical model was verified the results show that the optimal ventilation volume flow can improve the efficiency by 8 33 12 38 when monitoring the dredging operation in genoa port cutroneo et al 2014 used a double tube bubble curtain to test the efficiency of the bubble curtain for controlling the diffusion of dredged material and the effectiveness of the measurement method by setting a bubble curtain system a barrier can be formed at the bubble curtain to isolate the water on both sides and control the diffusion of the dredged materials dugué et al 2013 investigated the effect of bubble curtains on the bed morphology and the potential for change scouring and silting outside the channel will endanger the stability of the bund or reduce the navigable width of the channel in the bubble curtain the direction of secondary flow induced by bubbles is changed and its intensity is reduced the maximum bend scour is reduced by approximately 50 which no longer endangers the stability of the bank at the same position the maximum flow velocity and the maximum vertical velocity of the impinging bed also appear and the bubble curtain greatly reduces the deposition of the inner beach dugué et al 2015 studied the inducing mechanism of a bubble curtain on the morphological redistribution of a shallow river and riverbed the bubble curtain induces the secondary flow perpendicular to the pipe and increases the rising speed of the bubbles which in turn strengthens the secondary flow this coupled hydrodynamic morphological behavior explains that the size and intensity of the secondary flow on a moving bed are larger than those on a stationary bed oldeman et al 2020 found that the bubble curtain was successful as a separator for salt and fresh water in the first 30 s however due to the swing of the plume the bubble curtain acted more like a mixer the mixing rate increases with increasing air flow rate and the two mechanisms of particle salt invasion are distinguished when the froude air number is 0 the optimal air flow rate can be determined lu et al 2015 investigated the reliability of a bubble curtain to prevent oil spill diffusion under the action of hydrodynamic water by combining experimental and numerical simulation methods the effects of the pore size structure including the size and spacing of the pore diameter and position of the pipeline on the oil containing effect of the bubble curtain are discussed in detail and different air displacements and water flow velocities are considered the interaction between air plumes and fluid velocities has also been studied do quang et al 1999 the above studies only focused on the feasibility of bubble curtains and the plume characteristics generated by a single bubble hole but did not observe actual engineering data and analyze the bubble fusion and stability under a porous plume the main factors causing the instability of the bubble plume are the horizontal transverse density gradient of the mixed fluid in the bubble plume and the liquid velocity produced by the gas flow that is the ventilation velocity and the transverse flow velocity affect the stability of the bubble plume the bubble plume will be destroyed due to the drag disturbance of a transverse flow and the appearance of a large inertial force li et al 2019 and the bubble plume is unstable fleck and rzehak 2019 when the plume is unstable it will move laterally therefore the migration characteristics of the plume are introduced to quantitatively describe the stability and instability degree of the plume at present quantitative research on the stability characteristics of bubble plumes in bubble curtains is still rare in this paper the combination of experimental and numerical simulation methods using the tfm method the fusion phenomenon and migration behavior of two streams produced by two holes are quantitatively studied the influence of different ventilation flow rates hole spacings and transverse flow velocities on the stability of the bubble plume is discussed the main factors influencing the stability index of the bubble plume are obtained by a general linear model analysis of the mechanical factors section 2 of this paper introduces the field engineering experiment which is performed in the process of dredging and digging a new harbor basin of a port and analyzes the anti pollution effect of the bubble curtain to verify whether the bubble curtain has value in engineering applications section 3 is based on a small laboratory flume to more carefully observe the bubble curtain discuss the movement behavior of the bubble curtain in the still water area and its influence on the surrounding water area and obtain the working mechanism of the bubble curtain section 4 presents the basic equations and settings of the numerical simulation of plume stability section 5 presents the stability analysis including the time varying characteristics principal component analysis and mechanical factor analysis section 6 is the conclusion which not only gives the formation characteristics of the bubble curtain but also offers the main reasons that affect the stability of the bubble curtain 2 field engineering experiment observation fig 1 a shows a schematic diagram of the operation of the bubble curtain the bubble curtain anti fouling system is composed of a perforated hose on the upper part of the sediment and an air compressor on the shore the bubble hole on the hose can produce continuous compressed air from the bottom to the top to form a bubble curtain this bubble curtain drives the ocean current from the bubble outlet to the water surface to form a downward upward movement which forms a backflow in the sealed dredging area thus limiting the dredged suspended solids to the core dredging area there is a transverse flow velocity on the left side of the bubble curtain and the sediment in the dredging area moves after being disturbed by the dredging equipment the bubble curtain makes the bubbles with high momentum move from the bottom to the top through the stimulation forming a diaphragm at the same time the bubble affects the surrounding flow field during the rising process forming a vortex with opposite directions on both sides the sediment is largely confined to the dredged area under the combined influence of the isolation and left vortex fig 1 b shows the actual scene of the application of the bubble curtain in a harbor basin excavation project the track of the bubble curtain on the water surface is not a straight line due to the action of water flow and the position error of the underwater bubble tube laid by the traffic boat many small white areas can be clearly observed around the trajectory all of which are bubbles of different sizes it is concluded that the bubble curtain can successfully form a continuous diaphragm in addition the bubbles are very densely distributed which also shows that the momentum value of bubbles on the water surface is still very large at the same time in the breakwater near the gas supply end of the bubble tube the bending amplitude of the bubble curtain track is not large in a distant wharf the bending is obvious this bending is due to the pressure loss of the bubble curtain which reduces the initial momentum of the bubble fig 1 c shows the data collected by multibeam bathymetry the appearance of a bubble curtain under the water surface can be restored in caris hips software the color change in the figure represents the different depths the redder the color is the smaller the depth is the results clearly indicate that smaller water depths are closer to the bubble curtain this result shows that the bubble curtain has less water content and more bubbles which can successfully block the material exchange between the two sides of the basin the maximum pressure of the bubble tube was 40 psi 2 8 bar the maximum flow rate was 0 12 cubic feet per minute the inner diameter was 24 5 mm and the length of the bubble tube was 80 m field experiments were conducted using rubber hoses with a 1 mm orifice diameter this material is convenient for laying pipes on the sea floor and the orifice size increases with increasing working pressure turbidimetric measurements were performed at several positions on both sides of the bubble curtain by a traffic ship and the coordinates of the sampling points were calibrated by a global positioning system positioning instrument the turbidity meter bockus filtr330 was an acs310 400 portable turbidimeter during the operation the ambient temperature was 302 k during the measurement the water flow velocity was 0 163 m s at a 10 m vertical distance offshore and 0 149 m s at 0 m shore vertical distance from offshore the air supply pressure at the outlet of the air compressor was 3 2 bar and the pressure at the end of the bubble tube was 0 7 bar fig 2 shows the distribution of actual sampling points and the turbidity values at different depths 1 m 3 m and 5 m were measured the t t position is on the dotted line and t t 2 and t t 5 are 10 m from the bubble curtain the transverse flow flows through the bubble curtain area from the source fig 3 shows the turbidity distribution at different sampling points at source location s0 the difference in turbidity values at different heights is the most obvious this difference is because this area belongs to the construction area and there are variations in the pollution at different heights among them the turbidity at 3 m is the highest which also indicates that the construction is near a depth of 3 m pollutants from the source flow into the downstream area along with the flow since there is a corner upstream of t t 1 the turbidity values of different points on the same dotted line are not the same the reason is that the side area of the breakwater is selected for comparison rather than the side of the wharf and the middle area this selection is because the corner topography makes the water that carries the pollutants mainly rush to and collide with the anti wave side and the turbidity value will be higher which better reflects the anti fouling effect of the bubble curtain at the same time the momentum value at the beginning of the bubble curtain pipe is much larger than that at the end of the pipe which can better explain the anti fouling ability of the bubble curtain except for the s0 position of the source the variation trend of other points at different water depths is approximately the same at the source the turbidity fluctuates at different heights due to construction at other sampling points the pollutants at different heights at the same location exhibit a dynamic equilibrium and the turbidity values are approximately equal in addition the variation trend of the turbidity at different depths is basically the same the average turbidity at sources of different depths ranges from 25 to 30 ntu three different data sets were measured at the same place as shown in fig 3 a at the first three measuring points s0 t2 the turbidity at the same depth obviously decreases especially at the third point it decreases to the lowest then it increases at the fourth point gradually decreases and tends to stabilize from the overall trend due to the existence of the bubble curtain the turbidity presents a downward trend the turbidity at the third point is the lowest which is due to the effect of the bubble curtain the backflow generated 5 10 m upstream of the bubble curtain between t2 t3 causes the turbidity to decrease rapidly however near the bubble curtain due to the disturbance of the bubble curtain itself to the water body the turbidity of the water body rises slightly for the first three points the order of turbidity at different depths from high to low is 3 m 5 m and 1 m and the last 4 points show that the order of turbidity from high to low is 5 m 3 m and 1 m this result shows that the suspended solids in the water gradually settle as shown in fig 3 b the turbidity upstream of the bubble curtain is higher than that downstream and the turbidity generally shows a downward trend this trend shows that the bubble curtain can block the diffusion of pollutants and reduce the turbidity at a depth of 3 m due to the intense interaction of the solid liquid and gas and the enhancement of the material exchange and movement at this height the turbidity both upstream and downstream is higher than the corresponding value at other altitudes in the field test observations the transverse flow velocity is generally small without the application of the technology and the bubble curtain is far away from the source of dredging pollution the turbidity around the bubble curtain is dynamically balanced that is to say the turbidity upstream of the bubble curtain is regarded as the turbidity value without the application of the technology which is reasonable and credible comparing the turbidity data of upstream and downstream i e the impact of the technology on turbidity it is found that the technology can effectively prevent diffusion of suspended solids notably since there is only one traffic ship auxiliary test the point by point measurement method was adopted in the measurement of water turbidity the whole measurement process required 2 h during the test the changes in environmental factors affected the water turbidity moreover due to the effect of the propeller wake of the traffic ship the measurement value of water turbidity also had errors so it is difficult to eliminate these errors and calibrate the measured value however through field test observations it can be qualitatively concluded that the bubble curtain system can play a certain role in reducing the turbidity of a water body in practical engineering applications additionally this system can meet the turbidity requirements of the surrounding water body in a dredging construction area which means that the bubble curtain systems have practical application value for dredging engineering 3 laboratory tank test with still water the core content of this section is to study the rising and dynamic characteristics of bubble plume in air bubble curtains in still water and provide the basis for the plume features to prevent the diffusion of suspended solids in dredging engineering the purpose of the experiment is to observe the formation process of bubble curtains by using a camera and to master the distribution of bubbles in the process of bubble curtain formation to prepare for future research on the influence of the disturbance on bubble curtains two kinds of bubble tubes were used a double row hole steel pipe with an angle of 120 and an orifice diameter of 0 5 mm and a single row hole steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 1 mm the rated working pressure of the air compressor was 8 mpa the maximum range of the voltage regulator was 0 25 mpa a 120 double row hole dt symmetrically distributed in the vertical direction of the pipe and has an angle of 60 with the vertical line and a single row hole steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 0 5 mm and a steel pipe with an orifice diameter of 1 mm st were selected for the experiment the water injection depth of the test water tank was 0 8 m as shown in fig 4 one end of the pressure regulator was connected to the air compressor and the other end was connected to the experimental steel pipe the air compressor was turned on and the air valve of the air compressor was opened the pressure regulator was adjusted to 0 05 mpa q1 and 0 1 mpa q2 respectively after the bubble curtain was stable the movement process of the bubbles was observed by a high speed camera and the total number and particle size distribution of the bubbles were recorded first the change in water depth hardly affects the bubble size which has been discussed in many previous references upadhyay et al 2013 and will not be discussed here fig 5 shows the bubble distribution map taken during the test the volume flow corresponding to the ventilation pressure under the test condition is q2 and dt steel pipe is used fig 5 b shows a bubble distribution map obtained by using the image processing method which identifies the bubbles in it the image analysis process in this part is to extract the high speed snapshot file select the target area for gray processing call the function to find the coordinate of the center of the circle and radius of the locked bubble determine the transverse and longitudinal peak values and remove the noise draw the bubble in the original image and obtain the bubble information the map can obtain the number of bubbles and calculate the size distribution of bubbles the bubbles are mainly concentrated in the water area above the pipeline the results show that the bubble particle size is small at the outlet bubble coalescence occurs in the central concentration area and the particle size value significantly increases in table 1 the particle size distribution in the two sides of the middle area is in a small range 0 3 mm at the upper and top interface the bubbles will expand to both sides of the basin and the bubble size distribution is very wide in this area with both bubble coalescence and bubble breaking processes the number of bubbles in the experiment is related to the ventilation pressure and pipe structure with an increase in ventilation pressure the number of bubbles will increase and an increase in the orifice diameter will also increase the number of bubbles the bubble diameter distribution is obviously affected by the structure of the pipeline and is weakly affected by the ventilation pressure the larger the orifice diameter of the pipe is the larger the proportion of large bubbles is the proportion of large bubbles generated by a single row of holes is higher than that of the double row pipes in addition the bubbles distribute symmetrically along the plume centerline when the plume rises and many characteristics of the bubble plume at the same height are symmetrical such as the plume width gas volume fraction and bubble velocity fig 6 shows the plume half width bg at different heights the change trend of bg is only slightly affected by the pipeline structure but obviously affected by the flow rate the first section is the height range 0 0 45 m near the pipeline the plume width is small due to the influence of the sufficient initial momentum the bubbles mainly continue to vertically rise and mainly coalesce the second section is the bubbles at the middle height 0 45 m 0 7 m where the coalescence and breakup of bubbles are in dynamic balance however the momentum carried by bubbles is small and cannot compete with the water resistance the bubbles will move laterally and then there will be axial crushing and coalescence and the plume width will be increased in the third section the height range of bubbles close to the gas liquid interface 0 7 0 8 m will fluctuate at the interface due to the influence of bubble movement and there will be many bubbles adsorbed at the middle height of the fluctuation interface therefore in this section the plume width will first have the maximum peak value the reason is that the plume loss is stable near the interface and the bubbles will rapidly move horizontally toward the interface height at this time the bubbles break up and coalesce with a disorderly movement in addition fig 6 shows that the three segments of plume width can be clearly distinguished when the flow rate is large as shown in fig 6 a at a low flow rate bubbles with a larger particle size distribution are produced in the dt tube which makes the plume half width in the height range of the first and second sections slightly higher than that of the st tube but the trend and values of the two tubes in the third section are consistent this consistency is due to the full development of bubbles in the third section which is no longer affected by the pipeline structure as shown in fig 6 b at a high flow rate the plume half widths within the three height ranges basically coincide and the influence of the flow on the plume motion is much greater than that of the pipeline structure in addition the difference in plume half width between the first and second sections is very significant with increasing flow rate the momentum of bubbles increases the bubbles coalesce break and move more violently and the possibility of bubble change increases the comparison between fig 6 a and b shows that the effect of the discharge on the half width of the plume is mainly concentrated in the height range of the second section followed by the first section and it has little effect on the third section meanwhile the pipeline structure has only a very weak impact on the first section the orifice diameter is the most important factor affecting the bubble diameter while the ventilation flow is the secondary factor with increasing orifice diameter the average value of the bubble diameter increases significantly while with increasing ventilation flow rate the average value of the bubble diameter only increases slightly the bubble motion and particle size distribution in still water are obviously affected by the flow rate and the plume motion can be divided into three different height ranges at the same time the rise of bubbles in still water presents many symmetrical characteristics plume width volume fraction distribution etc 4 mathematical model and simulation settings the numerical simulation is based on the simplified analysis of air bubble curtain in marine dredging engineering to present the plume movement and stability with low transverse flow through two experiments it was proven that the bubble curtain can effectively block the diffusion of pollutants and has a certain anti fouling effect in the actual project in the still water tank the bubble curtain can produce an effective bubble plume and the formation process of the bubble curtain can be observed by a camera to understand the distribution of bubbles in the process of bubble curtain formation however the bubble curtain is bound to be affected by transverse flow in practical applications the influence of a transverse flow disturbance on the stability of the bubble curtain plume needs to be clarified in this section the euler tfm is used to analyze the time varying process of bubble fusion and migration in the bubble plume under the action of transverse flow the dynamic behavior characteristics of the bubble plume are obtained and the factors influencing the stability index of the bubble plume are quantitatively described the tfm model is based on the volume fraction of each phase to construct the mass and momentum conservation equations the model is represented by two sets of conservation equations and the momentum exchange is described by the interaction force as an additional term of each phase in the equation in this study the standard κ ε turbulence model based on the reynolds average navier stokes equation method was used to solve the turbulent effective viscosity of the liquid phase according to the basic closure model the gas liquid interaction includes the closure relationship summarized in table 2 1 t ρ i α i ρ i α i u i 0 2 t ρ i α i u

t e r the stability of the bubble plume includes the fusion process and migration characteristics of a multi bubble flow the offset characteristics include two parts offset distance and tilt angle under the condition of still water and a transverse flow velocity the fusion height of the two bubble flows and the migration characteristics of the main bubble flow in the rising process were analyzed based on the time when the main bubble flow reaches the upper air outlet the fusion height of bubble flow refers to the height of the highest point of the fusion region when the volume fraction of the two bubble flows is approximately equal to that of the two bubble flows the main bubble flow refers to the flow group with a larger volume fraction in the rising bubble flow which is divided into two bubble flows before fusion and one bubble flow after fusion it is not the left and right branch flow generated by bubble flow in motion the reynolds number is defined as follows 5 re u g l l μ l where ug is the gas velocity ll is the characteristic length of water and μl is the kinematic viscosity of water the weber number is defined as follows 6 we ρ g u g 2 l g σ where ρg is the air density ug is the air velocity at the inlet lg is the diameter of the air orifice and σ is the surface tension the dimensionless offset distance id defined as follows 7 η l l where l is the maximum horizontal distance of the bubble offset and l is half of the model width in the model the inclination angle θ is defined as the position where the maximum lateral offset distance of bubble flow is located and the angle between the line segment composed of the central position of the orifice and the vertical line of the orifice center is defined as the inclination angle θ the dimensionless fusion height is defined as follows 8 ζ h h where h is the model height and h is the fusion height when the bubble flow reaches the air outlet the bubble flow is not fused if ζ is larger than 1 the migration characteristics of bubble flow without fusion are not included in this study it is considered that the offset distance is 0 and the offset angle is 0 in previous studies cheng et al 2020a the single hole the single air bubble curtain is greatly affected by the lift force and drag force in the rising motion which exhibits the oscillation and offset phenomenon in the transverse flow the single hole is more prone to instability which makes the air bubble curtain unable to block the diffusion of suspended solids therefore in numerical simulations the double hole model i e two layer bubble curtain with a certain distance is used to explore the plume stability in the air bubble curtain to better guide the anti fouling technology of the air bubble curtain in the actual construction process the anti proliferation effect of the bubble curtain is greatly affected by the surrounding water environment and its own operating conditions this simulation adopts a two dimensional model which is 8 m long and 4 m high the diameter of the orifice at the two inlets is d 0 1 m as shown in fig 7 the simulation was performed in the form of unsteady flow the water phase was the first phase and the air phase was the second phase euler euler method uses implicit physical strength the inlet condition was set as the velocity inlet the air velocity inlet was perpendicular to the boundary line the flow outlet condition was set as the outflow and the bubble outlet condition was set as the pressure outlet for all fixed walls no slip condition was set the selected physical parameters in this paper are shown in table 3 the environmental parameters were the normal temperature and atmospheric pressure the convergence criterion was 1 10 3 for all cases and the turbulent dissipation energy and turbulence dissipation rate were discretized by the second order upwind scheme the actual total flow time of each simulation case is subject to the time when the main bubble flow reaches the upper bubble outlet and the time step was set to 0 002 s which ensures that the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number was always less than 0 5 in the case of maximum velocity the reynolds number ranges from 8000 to 32000 and complete turbulence occurs multiphase turbulence is more complex than single phase turbulence because momentum transfer occurs between the two phases through the phase interface which affects the respective flow field and turbulence thus turbulence models whether gas or liquid include interface terms at the same time bubbles certainly have an effect on liquid phase turbulence the effects of the environmental factors bubble curtain structure and operating conditions on bubble flow fusion and stability were studied considering the effect of the transverse flow the static water condition transverse flow velocity is 0 and transverse flow condition were set the spacing of jet holes was considered for the bubble curtain structure factor and the flow rate of the bubble hole was considered for the operation condition factor the specific working conditions are shown in table 4 5 results and discussion 5 1 verification of the numerical simulation method compared with the experiment of díaz et al 2008 the numerical simulation method in this paper is verified taking the vertical velocity of the liquid phase at a height of 0 25 m it is found that the results of this method are in good agreement with the experimental data fig 8 shows that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data at the vertical velocity instantaneous curve in the vicinity of the center the numerical value obtained by the double euler model slightly underestimates the axial velocity which may be due to the large liquid velocity near the center and the inaccuracy of the drag and lift models which makes the calculated vertical velocity of the liquid phase smaller the calculated results in the region are in good agreement with the experimental data generally the change trend of the axial velocity is consistent in the simulation and experimental result which shows that the selected model in this paper can accurately predict the bubble motion behavior in a liquid phase system 5 2 stability analysis of the bubble plume under transverse flow for the fusion height of bubble flow when the transverse flow velocity is large the left mainstream is combined with the right branch when the transverse flow velocity is small the left mainstream is combined with the right mainstream for the migration characteristics of bubble flow the flow is on the right side of the drainage basin and the bubbles are on the upper side the macroscopic migration of bubble flow is similar but the data values obtained are different taking w2s3q2 as an example the time varying process of the rising and merging of the bubble plume is shown in fig 9 before fusion the bubble flow has an effect on the flow field around the bubbles at the moment of fusion there are four obvious vortices around the bubble flow this effect is because the rising process of the left bubble flow is obviously affected by the transverse flow which makes it shift to the right and then produces a vortex in its left area then the bubble flow is affected by the vortex and swings to the left side forming a small vortex on its right side the right bubble flow is in the middle of the two bubble flows under the influence of the pressure difference first the bubble flow swings to the right forming a vortex on the right under the influence of the right vortex the bubble flow swings to the right and forms a vortex on the left at the same time the bubble flow velocity on the left side is higher than that on the right side which may be caused by the water flow close to the left bubble flow the distribution of the flow field at a large distance from the bubble flow is almost the same after fusion the fusion height of the bubble flow will gradually decrease until the height is close to 0 in fig 9 b the horizontal velocity of the liquid at each point is negative at different times which indicates that there is a vortex in the bubble rising with more time the change in basin around each point becomes increasingly dramatic and the position and intensity of the vortices iteratively change notably the analysis of the migration characteristics is based on the bubble flow movement after the fusion height as shown in fig 10 the velocity vector diagrams of the three examples are analyzed the greater the air flow is the greater the velocity in the basin is the bubble flow moves to the right under the influence of transverse flow there are two large vortices on both sides of bubble flow the flow field on the right side of bubble flow is more disordered than that on the left side this disorder is because the influence of the transverse flow on the right side is weak and the velocity changes sharply in the vortex the velocity in the left region is mainly concentrated in the middle water depth region and the velocity in the right area is mainly concentrated in the upper region near the bubble flow this behavior is related to the opposite direction of the vortices on both sides an air bubble plume can induce the water flow movement 5 3 general linear model analysis based on the stability evaluation index of the bubble plume the fusion characteristics ζ and migration characteristics η and θ of bubble flow were statistically analyzed to establish a comprehensive evaluation index sixteen groups of orthogonal tables with three factors and four levels were generated and the three factors had no interaction the general linear model was used to analyze the variance of multiple factors the third type of sum of squares was selected as shown in table 5 the influence of the three factors on the fusion height is shown in table 6 only the significance of the hole spacing is less than 0 05 therefore in the influence on the fusion height only the hole spacing plays a significant role that is the increase in the hole spacing can make the fusion height continuously increase there is no strong correlation between the air flow and the transverse flow velocity and the fusion height the effect of the three factors on the offset distance is shown in table 7 only the significance of air flow is less than 0 05 therefore only the air flow significantly affects the offset distance i e the air flow and offset distance have a strong correlation and the offset distance increases with increasing flow rate however when the other two factors increase the offset distance does not necessarily increase the influence of the three factors on the migration angle is shown in table 8 in the table the sum of the third type squares of factors s q and error values is larger but combined with the data and the migration process of bubble flow in the experiment the result is credible only the significance of air flow is less than 0 05 therefore only air flow has a significant effect on the offset angle according to tables 7 and 8 the migration characteristics are closely related to the air flow rate but not to the transverse flow velocity and inter hole distance selected in this paper this result is similar to the migration characteristics of single hole bubble flow 5 4 analysis of factors of bubble fusion under transverse flow the key factor that affects the fusion height is the hole spacing which is analyzed in section 5 3 and transverse flow velocity which is a secondary factor the influence of gas volume flux on the bubble fusion height is the weakest so the effect of this factor on the fusion height can be ignored the transverse flow velocity can be divided into four different levels the lowest lower higher and highest levels as shown in fig 11 at the lowest transverse flow velocity the effect of the hole spacing on the height is also very weak this is because the flow velocity is small the water flow will be attenuated by the viscous force and the bubble flow is stable similar to the bubble plume in still water the increase in pore spacing can only delay the fusion time but does not affect bubble fusion at other transverse flow velocities the flow field around the bubble plume will have a multidirectional velocity the bubble flow first affected by transverse flow will swing under the influence of the drag force bubble momentum and lift force and form a vortex on both sides with increasing hole spacing the transverse distance between the two bubbles increases and the bubbles need more momentum to overcome the resistance of water to fuse and gather at this time the transverse flow velocity does not obviously affect the change in fusion height 5 5 analysis of factors of bubble stability under transverse flow the key factors that affect the bubble stability are the gas velocity flux which is explained in section 5 3 and the transverse flow velocity which is a secondary factor the influence of the hole spacing on bubble stability is the weakest so the effect of this factor on bubble stability can be ignored the transverse flow velocity can be divided into four different levels the lowest the lower the higher and the highest values as shown in fig 12 a at the lowest transverse flow velocity the offset distance linearly increases with increasing transverse flow velocity the horizontal flow is small and the inertial force of bubbles plays a major role in the offset distance at other transverse flow velocities the bubble velocity is counterbalanced with the disturbance generated by the transverse flow and the offset distance fluctuates in a small range as shown in fig 12 b under different transverse flow velocities the migration angle fluctuates but with increasing transverse flow velocity the angle generally increases the reason is that the migration angle is related to both the maximum horizontal migration distance and vertical height so the migration angle has a wide range of changes 6 conclusion as an ecological and environmental protection technology that can not only meet the requirements of environmental protection but also meet the navigation requirements it is of great significance to understand the formation characteristics plume fusion and stability characteristics of bubble curtain systems to improve the anti fouling efficiency of bubble curtains from the field engineering experiment it is found that the change trend of turbidity at different water depths is similar showing an overall downward trend from upstream to downstream these findings prove that the bubble curtain system can play a certain role in reducing water turbidity in practical engineering applications and can meet the turbidity requirements of the surrounding water body in dredging construction areas the plume of air bubble curtains in still water is the most basic and pure dynamic process to grasp its dynamic characteristics provides basis and reference for more complex plume movement in dredging engineering taking the formation process of a bubble plume in a flume as the research object the characteristics of bubble formation were studied from an experimental point of view the results show that 1 the number of bubbles increases with increasing ventilation pressure and pipe structure but the bubble diameter distribution is obviously related to the pipe structure and the correlation between the bubble diameter and the pipe structure is weak and with the increase in the orifice diameter the proportion of bubbles with large diameters increases 2 the orifice diameter is the most important factor affecting the bubble diameter while the ventilation pressure is the secondary factor with increasing orifice diameter the average bubble diameter significantly increases 3 in still water the bubble plume exhibits many symmetrical motion properties in the rising process and there will be three different height ranges of the characteristic distribution of the plume in the water area in dredging engineering the disturbance with a low transverse flow is the key to make the bubble curtain ineffective therefore in this paper the core problems in engineering are extracted by numerical simulation method to analyze and solve anti pollution is determined by the turbidity but the mechanism is that the transverse flow makes the bubble curtain unstable and reduces the ability of blocking suspended solids based on the validated cfd model a two dimensional simulation of the bubble curtain formation process under the action of water flow was performed the influence of operation parameters ventilation speed structure parameters hole spacing and environmental parameters transverse flow velocity on the flow field of the bubble curtain was investigated and a statistical analysis was performed in static water the plume stability is only affected by the ventilation flow while the stability of the plume under the transverse flow disturbance will also carry the lateral movement of the plume due to the transverse flow under the action of transverse current the water area is more disordered and the plume will unsteadily move the results show that 1 based on the time varying characteristics of bubble fusion and migration in the bubble plume a smaller air flow rate corresponds to a lower fusion height the left bubble flow migration is more obvious before fusion and the bubble flow presents a concave shape after fusion 2 based on the factor analysis of the bubble plume stability index the hole spacing obviously affects the fusion height and the air flow obviously affects the migration characteristics the results have reference value for the study of anti pollutant diffusion in water environments

immersion depth and tilt angle in calm water was applied as a function of the advance ratio j and immersion depth h d including the effects of waves and motion the performance of a propeller with heave motion in waves was predicted using the completed estimation equation even though the fluctuation width could not be predicted the trends were very similar the results of this study could be considered useful for predicting a ship s performance in waves keywords propeller performance prediction ship motion regular waves open water performance 1 introduction as the energy efficiency design index eedi regulations have been tightened ships worldwide have had limitations on air pollutant emissions in order to satisfy the regulations many ships tend to become bulky and lower their operating speed because of this tendency the capacity of the engine could be reduced therefore a high level propulsion performance prediction technique is necessary to estimate ship propulsion performance in this regard the international maritime organization imo regulates the minimum horsepower as an interim guideline to prevent ships from losing controllability when operating in severe weather the existing propulsion performance prediction method is based on data in calm water therefore in order to estimate the propulsion performance in more detail it is necessary to analyze the performance change of the propeller in waves ships operating in calm water do not induce changes in the position of the propeller however in the case of ships operating in waves the ship posture could be changed periodically by waves this situation could change the propeller posture also a ship operating in waves could affect the propeller s inflow velocity and immersion depth because of the complex ship motion changes in the inflow velocity can affect the propeller s advance ratio and changes in the immersion depth could cause an interaction between the propeller and the free surface these changes could reduce the propulsion performance of the propeller in order to predict the propulsion performance it is necessary to analyze the interaction between the propeller and free surface much research has been done around the world on these issues there are two main factors in the correlation between the free surface and propellers the first is when the propeller pierces the free surface and the second is air ventilation caused by the rotation of the propeller near the free surface in a related study kempf 1933 studied the effect of the number of blades immersion depth and rotational speed on the air ventilation shiba 1953 studied the air ventilation according to the shape of the propeller koushan et al 2009 conducted a propeller open water test under various wave conditions according to the immersion depth they studied the change in the propeller open water performance in waves it was confirmed that the performance was reduced according to the change of the immersion depth and wave conditions the time series data showed that the thrust and torque were changed according to the wave phase at the same immersion depth similarly kozlowska et al 2009 fixed the rotation speed of the propeller in a bollard condition changed the immersion depth and observed the interaction between the propeller and the free surface the process and the effect of air ventilation on the propeller were analyzed and the amounts of change of thrust and torque were expressed with the rotation speed and immersion depth lee and paik 2018 also analyzed a propeller open water performance which changes according to the changes of the immersion depth and rotational speed under bollard conditions the changes of thrust and torque due to air ventilation were analyzed with the ventilation number califano and steen 2011 and kozlowska et al 2011 tracked the behavior of one blade by rotating a propeller near the free surface the changes of thrust and torque according to the air ventilation were expressed with the blade position also the overall shapes of air ventilation were described kozolowska et al 2017 presented a supplementary estimation method according to the advance ratio and immersion depth the performance change from weather conditions or motion was also studied faltinsen et al 1981 conducted a study of a ship s resistance and propulsion performance in waves in a similar study minsaas et al 1987 studied the thruster capacity required in various weather conditions koushan studied on the propeller performance with sinusoidal heave motion also the change of propeller performance was studied with dynamic positioning koushan 2006b 2007 amini and steen 2011 analyzed the propeller performance in oblique inflow conditions and shamsi and ghassemi 2013 studied a propeller moving in the yaw direction in a previous study paik et al 2017 studied various advance ratios near the free surface to investigate the interaction between a propeller and free surface jang et al 2020 studied the performance change due to the tilt angle and pitch motion according to the immersion depth of the propeller eom et al 2021 studied the change of propeller performance by varying the immersion depth for four advance ratios of j 0 1 0 7 in calm water and waves it was confirmed that the wave phase could affect each of the relative immersion depths and advance ratios in this study a prediction method was developed for the propeller performance with heave motion in waves the range of heave motion was set to include all the changes of the immersion depth from a previous study the performance of the propeller operating at a fixed each immersion depth in calm water was compared with the performance change of the propeller from heave motion in calm water the influence of waves on the propeller was studied in more detail by comparing the effect of waves analyzed at fixed immersion depth and the performance change of the propeller in heave motion in waves finally the prediction method was obtained using the trends of the propeller performance under various conditions 2 conditions of model test and numerical simulation 2 1 propeller specifications and model test equipment a kp458 propeller was used in this study which is the target propeller of the kvlcc2 vessel designed by kriso the specifications and geometry of the kp458 used in the numerical simulation and model test are shown in table 1 and fig 1 the geometry and specifications of the model test equipment are shown in table 2 and fig 2 the model test equipment can measure up to 50 n of thrust therefore 1953 rpm was used to increase the reynolds number to the maximum in the experiment 2 2 numerical method the commercial cfd software star ccm was used for the numerical simulation this software is suitable for analyzing complex fluid flows and supports flexible changes in the grid system it can regenerate a grid shape that is difficult for users to express so simulations are easier to perform star ccm is based on the finite volume method the convection term and the diffusion term are discretized using the second order upstream scheme and the second order central difference method the settings of the numerical simulation are the same as in a numerical method applied in a previous study eom et al 2021 like in the previous study three dimensional implicit unsteady and incompressible flows were applied in the simulation the governing equations are the continuity equation and the rans equation the s s t k ω model was used as the turbulence model the grid systems applied in the simulation are shown in fig 3 grid systems for various conditions were applied by adjusting the grid area according to the simulation conditions based on fig 3 most simulations in calm water used 2 8 m grids and about 3 5 m were used in waves the overset mesh technique was applied to the rotation of the propeller when heave motion was simulated using an overset mesh it was confirmed that the calculation tended to diverge when the interface grid system continuously changed because of heave motion therefore as shown in fig 3 the grid size was set to be maintained in most motion areas as much as possible during heave motion the range of heave motion was set to h d 2 0 0 25 to include the immersion depths considered in a previous study eom et al 2021 a fifth order stokes wave was applied to the wave generation the wave height and wavelength were h r 0 4 and h λ 0 02 respectively the heave motion period was set to 1 s 3 variation of pow characteristics with motion in calm water 3 1 pow performance due to heave motion in a previous study eom et al 2021 the calculation results of a pow simulation and changes in pow performance according to the immersion depth were verified using about 6 0 m grids or more the same numerical simulation method as in the previous study was applied however the number of grids was reduced in this study the calculation of the propeller performance with heave motion requires many iterations for numerical stability because the propeller rotation and heave motion are calculated simultaneously in order to check the repeatability of the heave motion more than 2 periods must be calculated so the simulation takes a long time in order to reduce the overall calculation time and check the trends the grid on the propeller surface was reduced and the grid in the wake area was removed as a result the error with the experimental results was increased however the trend was maintained and efficient calculation was possible the heave motion is outlined in fig 4 the distance from the free surface to the center of the hub is defined as h and the dimensionless value representing the immersion depth ratio is h d heave motion was applied as a sinusoidal function with a period of 1 s the calculation of the heave motion of the propeller in calm water was performed for h d 2 0 0 25 j 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 fig 5 shows the performance change due to the heave motion of the propeller in calm water the propeller starts a heave motion at h d 2 0 depending on the time series the performance change when performing an upward movement from h d 2 0 to h d 0 25 is indicated in red the performance change during the downward movement is shown in blue because the motion is repetitive the performance change is repeated in the next heave motion cycle the thrust and torque decreased compared to the experimental and numerical simulation results that were used for verification but it can be seen that the trend is very similar even when the number of grids is reduced there is a slight difference in the tendency of the thrust and torque changes during upward and downward motion the reason for this tendency is considered that there is some difference in air ventilation when the propeller moves upward or downward near the free surface fig 6 shows the difference in air ventilation when the propeller has an upward motion or downward motion near j 0 3 and h d 0 85 although there is a slight difference in the performance trend during upward motion and downward motion the difference is small so it is not considered in this study from fig 5 it can be seen that the thrust and torque start to decrease at a specific h d for each advance ratio as can be seen in fig 6 interaction between the propeller and the free surface has already occurred near h d 0 85 in the case of j 0 3 however the thrust and torque at j 0 3 in fig 5 show that the performance begins to decrease near h d 0 75 even if interaction between the propeller and free surface occurs the performance change can be considered insignificant until ventilation directly affects the propeller blade the tendency of thrust and torque is changed by the heave motion and shows a similar tendency to the performance change due to the change of fixed immersion depth 3 2 pow performance due to pitch motion a previous study jang et al 2020 already looked at the performance change due to the tilt angle and pitch motion for each immersion depth the overview of pitch motion and performance changes due to tilt angle and pitch motion at h d 2 0 0 5 are shown in fig 7 all thrusts and torques in fig 7 were converted into x direction forces we compared to the performance change of the propeller between pitch motion and a fixed tilt angle according to each immersion depth the performance of the propeller with pitch motion has fluctuations in the time series because the propeller performance changes continuously over time however the overall trend of the average value is similar to the propeller performance due to the fixed tilt angle based on this trend the performance change due to the tilt angle was considered with the change in the inflow velocity an outline and the numerical simulation results are shown in fig 8 and table 3 the tilt angle could induce a decrease of inflow velocity into the propeller by v a 1 c o s θ compared to the inflow velocity in the x direction the prediction value in table 3 is the estimated value obtained by adjusting the advance ratio in the pow curve of 0 by the amount of decrease of this inflow velocity in table 3 it can be seen that the value predicted by adjusting the advance ratio as much as the change in the inflow velocity is quite similar to the value actually calculated at 10 therefore the effect of the pitch motion on the propeller could be predicted by the change of inflow velocity in the general pow curve 3 3 pow performance due to complex ship motion it can be seen that a propeller performing heave motion decreases the performance quite linearly according to the change of immersion depth it is considered that the performance change due to pitch motion in a small range of tilt angles could be predicted by adjusting the inflow velocity so we studied whether these trends occur similarly in the complex motion of heave motion and pitch motion the general outline is shown in fig 9 since it is hard for ships operating in calm water to have repetitive motion heave and pitch motions were extracted under the conditions of λ l p p 1 6 and h 0 06 m for a kvlcc2 ship in order to calculate the change of propeller performance due to complex ship motion in calm water the motion of the ship in waves was extracted for application to the propeller and a numerical simulation was performed at an appropriate arbitrary immersion depth the extracted motion was applied to the propeller as a combination of trigonometric functions fig 10 shows a comparison between the combined trigonometric function and the directly extracted motion it can be seen how well the combined trigonometric function can work when it is applied to cfd the motion extracted from the ship and the result of converting it to a trigonometric function are almost identical fig 11 shows the pow calculation result of the propeller when applying complex ship motion the prediction method will be explained in chapter 5 of this paper the filtered data are the result of reducing noise by using a low pass filter lpf the performance change according to the immersion depth in calm water was assumed to be linear and all values related to the tilt angle and x axis movement due to the pitch motion were applied as the change of the advance ratio as shown in fig 11 the change of the propeller performance due to complex ship motion is very similar to the linear superposition of the propeller performance due to heave motion and pitch motion 4 variation of pow characteristics with heave motion in regular waves eom et al 2021 compared the change of propeller performance over time according to a fixed immersion depth in calm water and waves waves mainly affect the advance ratio at the immersion depth where the interaction of the propeller and free surface does not significantly affect propeller performance on the other hand the change of the relative immersion depth due to the wave phase could affect the propeller performance predominantly in immersion depths where air ventilation has much influence on the propeller performance these trends can also be seen in the propeller performance with heave motion in waves fig 12 shows the change of propeller performance due to the heave motion in waves at j 0 3 and 0 5 over time the wave conditions were h r 0 4 and h λ 0 02 fig 12 shows a comparison of the propeller performance due to heave motion in calm water and waves because the heave motion is the same the cause of all changes is the influence of the waves in order to analyze the effects of waves in more detail the results of j 0 3 with relatively high thrust are shown in fig 13 and compared with the relative immersion depth and advance ratio the relative h d in fig 13 a represents the immersion depth that is changed by the wave phase according to the time series as mentioned the heave motion is the same however the immersion depth can change over time due to the crest and trough of the wave δj in fig 13 b is the effect of the water particle velocity due to waves on the propeller advance ratio the water particle velocity in waves was calculated using airy wave theory at the center of the propeller hub position over time as the propeller goes closer to the free surface the water particle velocity in waves can be increased and has more influence on the advance ratio according to fig 13 a the time at which the immersion depth becomes the lowest during the heave motion is changed from 0 5 s to 0 45 s by the waves accordingly it can be confirmed that the lowest point of the thrust has also changed on the other hand when the influence of the immersion depth on the thrust is insignificant it can be seen that the thrust tends to increase at around 0 3 s and 0 8 s in fig 13 b because the relative advance ratio is decreased due to the trough of the wave the performance change of the propeller with heave motion in waves has the same tendency as that obtained when comparing the performance according to the change of the fixed immersion depth in calm water and waves based on these results we attempted to represent all the effects of waves and motion by changes in the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio 5 development of prediction method for propeller performance in waves using the results obtained we attempted to predict the change of propeller performance in waves all elements of waves and motion are defined as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio an prediction method was developed using the trend according to the immersion depth ratio for each j in calm water first the elements related to the performance of propellers with motion in waves are defined as follows 5 1 k t f v a v p h h t h h p t p θ λ h t in this equation v a is the inflow velocity and is the relative velocity due to the x direction movement of the propeller when a ship with trim makes a pitch motion the propeller could have x direction movement this movement could induce variation in the propeller advance ratio h h is the distance from the hub to the free surface and t h is the period of heave motion h p t p and θ are the change in immersion depth period and tilt angle due to pitch motion λ and h are the wavelength and wave height respectively all these factors are dependent on time t the following equation is obtained by substituting the influence of the wave heave and pitch motion into the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio 5 2 j a t f v a t p θ u t v a c o s θ t v p t u t n d c o s θ t change of tilt angle due to pitch motion over time u t variation of inflow velocity according to the wave phase using airy wave theory 5 3 h d t f h h h p t h t p h t h δ h h t δ h p t δ h w t d h initial condition of immersion depth δ h h t variation of immersion depth by heave motion δ h p t variation of immersion depth by pitch motion δ h w t variation of immersion depth by wave phase if the influences of waves and motion are defined as a function of the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio the function of the propeller performance in waves is simplified as follows 5 4 k t f j a t h d t the thrust is a function of the advance ratio and immersion depth therefore it is necessary to predict the propulsion performance with changes by the advance ratio and immersion depth in calm water three assumptions are made to develop a technique that can predict the propulsion performance at an arbitrary advance ratio and immersion depth in calm water there is an h dc where the thrust begins to decrease in the region of h d h dc the change of thrust is assumed to be linear from the minimum value h dmin ktmin to the point h dc kto in the region of h d h dc the thrust is assumed to be the same as the general pow performance with these assumptions the variation of the thrust can be represented by trend lines in fig 14 the graph in fig 14 a shows the overall trend at each advance ratio kt0 is the pow data at 2 0 h d where the immersion depth is sufficient trend lines are defined in a region where the time series of the thrust begins to oscillate toward the minimum value at each advance ratio h dc is defined as the point where kt0 of each advance ratio and the trend line meet the graph in fig 14 b shows the pow value at 0 15 h d which is a linearly estimated value of h d h dc fig 14 c shows kt0 which is the same as a general pow curve finally h dc according to the advance ratio is shown in fig 14 d using these trend lines a straight line h d m i n k t m i n h d c k t 0 is applied to the section of h d h dc and kt0 is applied to the section of h d h dc if the procedure for kq is performed in the same way the following linear function is created 5 5 k t q t α k t 0 q 0 j a t k t min q min j a t h d c j a t h d min h d t h d min k t min q min j a t β k t 0 q 0 j a t in this equation α and β are functions of 0 and 1 and are activation functions that divide the areas before and after h dc α is 1 for h d t h dc ja t and β is 1 for h d t h dc ja t in this way all changes in the propeller performance due to wave and ship motion are defined as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth a linear prediction method was then developed to predict the propeller performance over time in waves using pow trends at the minimum and maximum immersion depths pow trends at the minimum and maximum immersion depths can be obtained through experiments and simulations but there are many difficulties in defining h dc h dc is a point at which air ventilation begins to affect the propeller performance so it is difficult to express it with an equation at present because various factors such as the number of blades revolutions advance ratio and the thrust can affect the air ventilation in this study the trend curve was used because the calculation was carried out for only a kp458 propeller the time series of the performance change due to the heave motion in waves was predicted to review the prediction method the cfd result at an advance ratio of 0 3 was compared with the result predicted by the prediction method as shown in fig 15 in figs 15 and 2 cycles of the time series are compared in the case of a propeller with heave motion in waves some blades can partly protrude out of the free surface for this reason the thrust of each blade might be different so the thrust can oscillate when air ventilation occurs since this prediction method is linear it is difficult to predict the fluctuation width however when comparing the two cycle average values both kt and 10kq at j 0 3 have an error within 0 2 it can be seen that the overall trend or average value is very similar therefore it can be confirmed that the prediction procedure has high accuracy for the change of propeller performance in waves presented in this study 6 conclusions propeller performance changes were studied with various motions in calm water and waves first the change of the propeller performance with heave motion in calm water was simulated the propeller performance with heave motion in calm water shows a tendency very similar to the propeller performance according to the change of the fixed immersion depth since the grids were reduced to increase the efficiency of numerical simulation the overall thrust and torque slightly decreased however the trend was similar the propeller performance with pitch motion also showed a very similar tendency to the propeller performance due to the change of the fixed tilt angle like a propeller performance with heave motion jang et al 2020 in order to predict the change of propeller performance due to the tilt angle from the general pow curve the tilt angle was applied with the change of the advance ratio it was confirmed that the predicted propeller performance obtained by correcting the inflow velocity as much as the tilt angle in the general pow curve shows a very similar to the change of propeller performance with the tilt angle in addition a simulation was performed on the change of propeller performance with heave motion in waves the effect of waves can be analyzed by comparing the propeller performance with the same heave motion in calm water and waves as a result it was also confirmed that the waves can affect the advance ratio and immersion depth using these trends an prediction method was developed for the change of propeller performance with ship motion in waves wave and motion factors were all applied as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth and so was the propeller performance the prediction method was constructed using the trend of the propeller performance due to the immersion depth in calm water using this method we predicted the propeller performance with complex ship motion in calm water and the propeller performance with heave motion in waves in time series since this study only studied a kp458 propeller the critical h d h dc according to the advance ratio was derived using the trend lines if research is conducted on a greater variety conditions it could be possible to predict the propulsion performance of a ship in waves by an prediction method without

20693,the capacity of the propulsion engine is reduced due to the energy efficiency design index eedi regulations so more precise prediction of the propulsion performance is required the heave and

7 were converted into x direction forces we compared to the performance change of the propeller between pitch motion and a fixed tilt angle according to each immersion depth the performance of the propeller with pitch motion has fluctuations in the time series because the propeller performance changes continuously over time however the overall trend of the average value is similar to the propeller performance due to the fixed tilt angle based on this trend the performance change due to the tilt angle was considered with the change in the inflow velocity an outline and the numerical simulation results are shown in fig 8 and table 3 the tilt angle could induce a decrease of inflow velocity into the propeller by v a 1 c o s θ compared to the inflow velocity in the x direction the prediction value in table 3 is the estimated value obtained by adjusting the advance ratio in the pow curve of 0 by the amount of decrease of this inflow velocity in table 3 it can be seen that the value predicted by adjusting the advance ratio as much as the change in the inflow velocity is quite similar to the value actually calculated at 10 therefore the effect of the pitch motion on the propeller could be predicted by the change of inflow velocity in the general pow curve 3 3 pow performance due to complex ship motion it can be seen that a propeller performing heave motion decreases the performance quite linearly according to the change of immersion depth it is considered that the performance change due to pitch motion in a small range of tilt angles could be predicted by adjusting the inflow velocity so we studied whether these trends occur similarly in the complex motion of heave motion and pitch motion the general outline is shown in fig 9 since it is hard for ships operating in calm water to have repetitive motion heave and pitch motions were extracted under the conditions of λ l p p 1 6 and h 0 06 m for a kvlcc2 ship in order to calculate the change of propeller performance due to complex ship motion in calm water the motion of the ship in waves was extracted for application to the propeller and a numerical simulation was performed at an appropriate arbitrary immersion depth the extracted motion was applied to the propeller as a combination of trigonometric functions fig 10 shows a comparison between the combined trigonometric function and the directly extracted motion it can be seen how well the combined trigonometric function can work when it is applied to cfd the motion extracted from the ship and the result of converting it to a trigonometric function are almost identical fig 11 shows the pow calculation result of the propeller when applying complex ship motion the prediction method will be explained in chapter 5 of this paper the filtered data are the result of reducing noise by using a low pass filter lpf the performance change according to the immersion depth in calm water was assumed to be linear and all values related to the tilt angle and x axis movement due to the pitch motion were applied as the change of the advance ratio as shown in fig 11 the change of the propeller performance due to complex ship motion is very similar to the linear superposition of the propeller performance due to heave motion and pitch motion 4 variation of pow characteristics with heave motion in regular waves eom et al 2021 compared the change of propeller performance over time according to a fixed immersion depth in calm water and waves waves mainly affect the advance ratio at the immersion depth where the interaction of the propeller and free surface does not significantly affect propeller performance on the other hand the change of the relative immersion depth due to the wave phase could affect the propeller performance predominantly in immersion depths where air ventilation has much influence on the propeller performance these trends can also be seen in the propeller performance with heave motion in waves fig 12 shows the change of propeller performance due to the heave motion in waves at j 0 3 and 0 5 over time the wave conditions were h r 0 4 and h λ 0 02 fig 12 shows a comparison of the propeller performance due to heave motion in calm water and waves because the heave motion is the same the cause of all changes is the influence of the waves in order to analyze the effects of waves in more detail the results of j 0 3 with relatively high thrust are shown in fig 13 and compared with the relative immersion depth and advance ratio the relative h d in fig 13 a represents the immersion depth that is changed by the wave phase according to the time series as mentioned the heave motion is the same however the immersion depth can change over time due to the crest and trough of the wave δj in fig 13 b is the effect of the water particle velocity due to waves on the propeller advance ratio the water particle velocity in waves was calculated using airy wave theory at the center of the propeller hub position over time as the propeller goes closer to the free surface the water particle velocity in waves can be increased and has more influence on the advance ratio according to fig 13 a the time at which the immersion depth becomes the lowest during the heave motion is changed from 0 5 s to 0 45 s by the waves accordingly it can be confirmed that the lowest point of the thrust has also changed on the other hand when the influence of the immersion depth on the thrust is insignificant it can be seen that the thrust tends to increase at around 0 3 s and 0 8 s in fig 13 b because the relative advance ratio is decreased due to the trough of the wave the performance change of the propeller with heave motion in waves has the same tendency as that obtained when comparing the performance according to the change of the fixed immersion depth in calm water and waves based on these results we attempted to represent all the effects of waves and motion by changes in the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio 5 development of prediction method for propeller performance in waves using the results obtained we attempted to predict the change of propeller performance in waves all elements of waves and motion are defined as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio an prediction method was developed using the trend according to the immersion depth ratio for each j in calm water first the elements related to the performance of propellers with motion in waves are defined as follows 5 1 k t f v a v p h h t h h p t p θ λ h t in this equation v a is the inflow velocity and is the relative velocity due to the x direction movement of the propeller when a ship with trim makes a pitch motion the propeller could have x direction movement this movement could induce variation in the propeller advance ratio h h is the distance from the hub to the free surface and t h is the period of heave motion h p t p and θ are the change in immersion depth period and tilt angle due to pitch motion λ and h are the wavelength and wave height respectively all these factors are dependent on time t the following equation is obtained by substituting the influence of the wave heave and pitch motion into the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio 5 2 j a t f v a t p θ u t v a c o s θ t v p t u t n d c o s θ t change of tilt angle due to pitch motion over time u t variation of inflow velocity according to the wave phase using airy wave theory 5 3 h d t f h h h p t h t p h t h δ h h t δ h p t δ h w t d h initial condition of immersion depth δ h h t variation of immersion depth by heave motion δ h p t variation of immersion depth by pitch motion δ h w t variation of immersion depth by wave phase if the influences of waves and motion are defined as a function of the advance ratio and immersion depth ratio the function of the propeller performance in waves is simplified as follows 5 4 k t f j a t h d t the thrust is a function of the advance ratio and immersion depth therefore it is necessary to predict the propulsion performance with changes by the advance ratio and immersion depth in calm water three assumptions are made to develop a technique that can predict the propulsion performance at an arbitrary advance ratio and immersion depth in calm water there is an h dc where the thrust begins to decrease in the region of h d h dc the change of thrust is assumed to be linear from the minimum value h dmin ktmin to the point h dc kto in the region of h d h dc the thrust is assumed to be the same as the general pow performance with these assumptions the variation of the thrust can be represented by trend lines in fig 14 the graph in fig 14 a shows the overall trend at each advance ratio kt0 is the pow data at 2 0 h d where the immersion depth is sufficient trend lines are defined in a region where the time series of the thrust begins to oscillate toward the minimum value at each advance ratio h dc is defined as the point where kt0 of each advance ratio and the trend line meet the graph in fig 14 b shows the pow value at 0 15 h d which is a linearly estimated value of h d h dc fig 14 c shows kt0 which is the same as a general pow curve finally h dc according to the advance ratio is shown in fig 14 d using these trend lines a straight line h d m i n k t m i n h d c k t 0 is applied to the section of h d h dc and kt0 is applied to the section of h d h dc if the procedure for kq is performed in the same way the following linear function is created 5 5 k t q t α k t 0 q 0 j a t k t min q min j a t h d c j a t h d min h d t h d min k t min q min j a t β k t 0 q 0 j a t in this equation α and β are functions of 0 and 1 and are activation functions that divide the areas before and after h dc α is 1 for h d t h dc ja t and β is 1 for h d t h dc ja t in this way all changes in the propeller performance due to wave and ship motion are defined as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth a linear prediction method was then developed to predict the propeller performance over time in waves using pow trends at the minimum and maximum immersion depths pow trends at the minimum and maximum immersion depths can be obtained through experiments and simulations but there are many difficulties in defining h dc h dc is a point at which air ventilation begins to affect the propeller performance so it is difficult to express it with an equation at present because various factors such as the number of blades revolutions advance ratio and the thrust can affect the air ventilation in this study the trend curve was used because the calculation was carried out for only a kp458 propeller the time series of the performance change due to the heave motion in waves was predicted to review the prediction method the cfd result at an advance ratio of 0 3 was compared with the result predicted by the prediction method as shown in fig 15 in figs 15 and 2 cycles of the time series are compared in the case of a propeller with heave motion in waves some blades can partly protrude out of the free surface for this reason the thrust of each blade might be different so the thrust can oscillate when air ventilation occurs since this prediction method is linear it is difficult to predict the fluctuation width however when comparing the two cycle average values both kt and 10kq at j 0 3 have an error within 0 2 it can be seen that the overall trend or average value is very similar therefore it can be confirmed that the prediction procedure has high accuracy for the change of propeller performance in waves presented in this study 6 conclusions propeller performance changes were studied with various motions in calm water and waves first the change of the propeller performance with heave motion in calm water was simulated the propeller performance with heave motion in calm water shows a tendency very similar to the propeller performance according to the change of the fixed immersion depth since the grids were reduced to increase the efficiency of numerical simulation the overall thrust and torque slightly decreased however the trend was similar the propeller performance with pitch motion also showed a very similar tendency to the propeller performance due to the change of the fixed tilt angle like a propeller performance with heave motion jang et al 2020 in order to predict the change of propeller performance due to the tilt angle from the general pow curve the tilt angle was applied with the change of the advance ratio it was confirmed that the predicted propeller performance obtained by correcting the inflow velocity as much as the tilt angle in the general pow curve shows a very similar to the change of propeller performance with the tilt angle in addition a simulation was performed on the change of propeller performance with heave motion in waves the effect of waves can be analyzed by comparing the propeller performance with the same heave motion in calm water and waves as a result it was also confirmed that the waves can affect the advance ratio and immersion depth using these trends an prediction method was developed for the change of propeller performance with ship motion in waves wave and motion factors were all applied as functions of the advance ratio and immersion depth and so was the propeller performance the prediction method was constructed using the trend of the propeller performance due to the immersion depth in calm water using this method we predicted the propeller performance with complex ship motion in calm water and the propeller performance with heave motion in waves in time series since this study only studied a kp458 propeller the critical h d h dc according to the advance ratio was derived using the trend lines if research is conducted on a greater variety conditions it could be possible to predict the propulsion performance of a ship in waves by an prediction method without using the trend line or simulations acknowledgements this research was supported by the development of co2 emission dfoc reduction technology for midsize ship under real operation 20007847 of the

20694,a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of a 10 mw floating wind turbine concept named spic at an intermediate water depth of approximately 60 m a fully coupled numerical model was established using the aero hydro servo elastic moor method the experimental and numerical dynamic responses under operational conditions including irregular waves steady and turbulent winds and combined wind wave conditions generally agree well the mean values are well predicted and the powers at motion resonant frequencies wave frequency and tower vibration frequency are captured discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are further addressed by in depth numerical analyses under turbulent winds the discrepancies of dynamic responses at 1p and 2p frequencies are induced mainly by individual blade installation error while the discrepancies at 3p components are caused mainly by the nonuniformity of the wind field in addition in the turbulent wind case with variable blade pitch angles and rotor speed control system the mean tower base bending moment is smaller and the low frequency responses are larger than those in the case with fixed blade pitch angles and a constant rotor speed the reveal of uncertainties is helpful for further guiding the model test of floating wind turbines keywords floating wind turbine experiment numerical simulation turbulent wind control strategy 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most competitive energy resources as it has the advantages of imposing the lowest environmental effect and boasting a high cost efficiency and excellent sustainability wang et al 2018 decastro et al 2019 among all available wind resources offshore winds provide faster and steadier wind speeds more powerful electrical output greater energy yield and fewer visual or noise problems than onshore winds kaldellis et al 2016 therefore an increasing number of floating wind turbines have been designed and adopted to capture offshore wind energy on this basis to reduce the cost of energy wind turbines were upscaled from 5 mw to 8 mw and then 10 mw igwemezie et al 2019 for instance the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine developed by danmarks tekniske universitet has been widely studied bak et al 2013 the significant aerodynamic thrust loads can cause remarkable motion responses of the floating foundation which carries the dtu 10 mw wind turbine oh et al 2018 therefore extensive efforts are required to increase the stability of the foundation the types of floating platforms are mainly composed of spar tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge and the selection of the platform type is affected by the water depth liu et al 2016 in the present research the floating wind turbine is designed for intermediate water depth ranging from 40 m to 60 m and the water depth of 60 m is studied in this study the reason why such a water depth is considered is mainly that several prototype projects of floating wind turbines are planned in waters with a depth between 40 m to 60 m besides the bathymetry of the nearshore seas in guangdong province china is relatively flat where the water depth does not change significantly with distance from the shore several floating wind farms planned in guangdong are also located in water depth of 40 m to 60 m therefore it is of great practical importance to investigate the dynamic behavior of floating wind turbines in intermediate water depths in these water depths a semi submersible platform with good hydrodynamic behavior and cost efficiency is very promising liu et al 2016 in this study a semi submersible floating wind turbine concept designed by the authors named the spic concept is investigated it is composed of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine a flexible tower and a semi submersible platform featuring with three partially inclined side columns spic for short cao et al 2020 2019 to investigate the feasibility of the novel floating wind turbine concept and to analyze the dynamic responses of the whole wind turbine system the experimental study is the most reliable approach viselli 2016 pereira 2014 many people have carried out model tests on semi submersible wind turbines of different concepts in 2010 a model test of the windfloat wind turbine was conducted at uc berkeley to investigate the platform response under the 100 year wave condition in this small scale 1 105 test the wind thrust was applied through an actuator disk roddier et al 2010 the deepcwind concept designed by the university of maine was subjected to free decay tests wave only tests and wind only tests at marin in 2011 goupee et al 2014 koo et al 2014 using a 1 50 froude scaled nrel 5 mw blades a higher wind speed was used to compensate for the aerodynamic thrust then in 2013 a second round of tests was conducted with three performance matched blades a similar model test was performed at the 1 50 scale again at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university in 2015 the dynamic responses caused by the differences between the froude scaled and performance scaled blades were investigated by chen et al 2018 another semi submersible floater equipped with the nrel 5 mw wind turbine named dutch tri floater was tested at the ecole centrale nantes ecn tank under wind and wave loads at the 1 50 scale in 2013 a feedback controlled ducted fan was used to simulate the aerodynamic thrust in a 1 40 model test of a braceless semi submersible called concrete star wind floater azcona et al 2014 the aerodynamic force was calculated through the nrel code fast according to the platform motion measured during the test and in 2015 a real time hybrid model test reathm of another braceless semi submersible wind turbine was conducted at marintek at a 1 30 scale bachynski et al 2016 utilizing tensioned wires connected to the actuators to simulate the aerodynamic thrust in 2017 a model test of the triple spar which is equipped with the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine was performed at dhi denmark with an active blade pitch control for the first time bredmose et al 2017 selected free decay regular wave irregular wave and extreme wave conditions were simulated during the test the performance of each new wind turbine concept should be evaluated for its feasibility under each specific environmental condition the results of such experiments are relatively accurate but it is financially impracticable to simulate the performance of a turbine under all of environmental conditions with model testing oguz et al 2018 therefore the numerical simulation approach should be validated by a comparison with experimental results and then used to predict the performances of floating wind turbines a series of numerical codes including fast jonkman and jonkman 2016 and hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 extending from onshore wind codes and semo reflex reinholdtsen and falkenberg 2001 extending from marine structure codes were developed to establish numerical models and to calculate the dynamic responses of the whole floating wind turbine system christian et al 2009 and roddier et al 2010 validated the hydrodynamic model of windfloat with fast software and considered the effects of the turbine control system the phase ii of the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project was aimed at validating numerical tools through a comparison with test data from the deepcwind wind turbine robertson et al 2017 the simulated ultimate and fatigue loads under eight conditions were obtained and they were decently estimated for the deepcwind wind turbine chen et al 2019 also developed a coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor code called darwind to compare the results of previous tests chen et al 2018 the results showed that darwind has a satisfactory ability to simulate the whole wind turbine system maxime et al 2013 compared the results obtained by the fast code and the model test results of the dutch tri floater semi submersible wind turbine the numerical model was calibrated through decay tests regular wave conditions and constant wind conditions and was proven to be reasonable in surge and pitch degrees of freedom dofs berthelsen et al 2016 simulated the braceless floating wind turbine in reathm at full scale the hydrodynamic motions and loads were calculated by simo and the mooring line responses were obtained through riflex the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental results under cases with or without winds and waves the triple spar wind turbine was remodeled in fast by bredmose et al 2017 and the model was tuned against decay tests of the tower and platform a comparison under regular waves was conducted showing that the surge motion was slightly underestimated by the fast code further remodeling under other complex conditions was being researched the studies mentioned above tried to reimplement model testing by numerical simulation aiming at conducting the simulations by numerical codes that cannot be realized by the model test in this research a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the 10 mw spic wind turbine system at an intermediate water depth the experimental models and facilities were introduced first to ensure the accuracy of the basin model test then a numerical model was established based on the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor method operational irregular waves steady winds at rated wind speed and turbulent winds with different turbulence intensities tis were selected as the environmental conditions the numerical results of the horizontal restoring stiffness free decay tests white noise tests wave only tests wind only tests and wind wave combined tests were compared with the experimental results respectively to validate the rationality of the numerical model on this basis the discrepancies between the numerical simulations and experimental results were further analyzed by considering the effects of individual blade installation mass discrepancy among three blades wind field nonuniformity and different control strategies 2 floating wind turbine model 2 1 numerical model the spic concept wind turbine consists of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine a flexible tower and a semi submersible platform as shown in fig 1 the dtu 10 mw wind turbine is a three blade horizontal axis turbine with the rated wind speed of 11 4 m s and the main parameters are listed in table 1 the tower connects the nacelle to the floating platform with a tower height of 92 6 m and a tower bottom 23 0 m above the water surface the outer diameter of the tower varies linearly from 5 50 m at the tower top to 7 74 m at the tower base the semi submersible platform shown in fig 2 is composed of a central column three partially inclined side columns a submerged pontoon and three bracings and the detailed parameters are given in table 2 more details about the properties of the spic concept can be found in cao et al 2020a b the mooring system which constrains the floating wind turbine at the intermediate water depth of 60 m comprises six catenary mooring lines fig 3 presents the layout of the mooring lines the detailed properties of the numerical mooring line model are listed in table 3 the main parameters of the whole numerical wind turbine system are shown in table 4 the draft and displacement are obtained when the mooring line tension is applied and the mass cog r x x r y y and r z z are considered for the whole wind turbine system except for the mooring system the numerical model was established by using the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor numerical software fast v8 jonkman and jonkman 2016 the aerodynamic force was solved based on blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2015 considering numerous corrections such as tip loss glauert correction dynamic inflow and dynamic stall the hydrodynamic loads applied to the semi submersible platform model were calculated based on the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by potential flow theory the mooring loads were obtained based on the lumped mass method the structural dynamic performance of the flexible structures such as the blades and tower was obtained by using the mode superposition method fast utilized the multibody dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamic performance of the entire floating wind turbine system the detailed theoretical background of this fully coupled analytical method for the numerical model is to be introduced in section 3 2 2 experimental model the experiment of the spic concept wind turbine was conducted at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university with the main scale of 50 m 40 m 10 m this model test was performed at a froude scale of 1 64 at the basin water depth of 0 94 m and the experimental model is shown in fig 4 in this section the experimental spic model and facilities including the rotor model control system model tower model platform model mooring system model wind generating system and instruments are briefly introduced in the model test a performance matched blade model wen et al 2019 that can achieve the target thrust at low reynolds numbers was designed to replace the geometry matched blade the blade length was kept the same the sd2030 airfoil with a smaller thickness was chosen to provide larger lift and drag forces at each section the chord length was expanded by a factor of 1 3 and the twist angle was optimized in the meanwhile to satisfy the aerodynamic performance because the performance matched blade has a longer chord length and larger surface area than the geometry matched blade the former has more difficulty meeting the froude scaling weight therefore two light carbon fiber layers were chosen to form the surface of the hollow structured blade model as presented in fig 4 in fig 5 the span wise load distribution of the performance matched rotor under low re number was compared with that of full scaled rotor under high re number it illustrates that the normal forces of the designed rotor match well with the values of full scaled rotor but the tangential forces are less performed therefore the simulation of the moment around rotation axis is relatively lower it is very difficult to satisfy both thrust similarity and aerodynamic moment similarity at low reynolds number in the meantime through adjusting the blade shape for the dynamic response analysis of the wind turbine the axial thrust is more important so it will give priority to satisfy the similar thrust however the rotation of the rotor will not be affected by the small aerodynamic moment because the servo motor in the nacelle will adjust in real time to meet the constant targeted rotor speed some wind tests on land were then conducted to compare the performance of real and scaled rotor in different wind speeds the constant winds with different wind speeds were generated in turn by the wind generating system and applied to the rotor the aerodynamic thrust caused by inflow wind was recorded and compared with the theoretical thrust as shown in fig 6 however the aerodynamic moment is not the focus of this study which was not measured and calibrated in this paper a motor installed in the nacelle was used to control the rotor speed a manual rotation device was arranged at the blade root to adjust the blade pitch angle and the three blades were adjusted individually at below rated and rated wind speeds the rotor speed was adjusted by the motor to obtain the maximal thrust and the pitch angle was always set at 0 deg at over rated wind speed the rotor speed was controlled to remain unchanged at the rated value and the blade pitch angles were manually adjusted according to different wind speeds at cut out and even larger wind speeds the rotor speed and blade pitch angles were set at 0 rpm and 90 deg respectively during each model test case the rotor speed and pitch angles were fixed regardless of the wind speed for the tower the bending stiffness of the tower sections was scaled to accurately simulate the eigenmodes in the fore aft and side by side directions al6063 was chosen as the material due to its properties of low density and high strength the tower model consisted of eight aluminum tubes with the same inner diameter 20 mm and different outer diameters the outer diameter was determined by the target stiffness scaled from the prototype using towers with scaled stiffness cannot satisfy geometric similarity at the same time because the outer diameter of towers with scaled stiffness will definitely be smaller this will make the drag force generated by the wind acting on the tower very small it will have a certain influence on the test results but when the wind speed is not too high e g at the rated wind speed the drag force of the tower will not have a significant effect on the overall result if other changes and treatments are made to the structure of the tower in order to match the scaled drag force they may affect the natural frequency of the tower the tower s natural frequency is of greater importance during the operating condition and should be carefully modeled in the experiments this experimental study mainly focuses on the dynamic behavior of the floating wind turbine under several operational conditions under the rated wind speed so the processing of scaled tower focused on the simulation of vibration natural frequencies the main parameters and properties of the experimental platform model are listed in tables 2 and 4 fiberglass and wood were used to process the platform model as presented in fig 4 in the model test iron and lead were added to the side columns and the submerged pontoons and adjusted as the ballast to achieve the desired mass center of gravity and radius of inertia of the whole floating wind turbine model the detailed properties of the experimental mooring line model are listed in table 3 in the model test iron chains and lead wire were used to imitate the weight and the spring was set to satisfy the stiffness all of the properties of the mooring system model strictly met the scaling requirements except that the outer diameter of each line was not accurately simulated the wind generating system was used to simulate the wind environment in the model test including steady and unsteady winds the desired wind speed was achieved by varying the rotor speed of the fan and the maximum wind speed can reach 15 m s the wind turbine model was placed at the position of 4 6 m in front of the wind generating system during the experiment so the quality of the effective wind field in this plane was explored when the system was set to generate a wind speed of 1 4 m s the wind speeds at 49 points distributed throughout the square wind field with a side length of 3 2 m were measured by hot wire anemometers the origin of the right handed coordinate system o xyz was at the center of the hub the x axis is oriented along the wind direction and the z axis points up the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity ti at each measurement point are given in fig 7 in the contour of the rotor red line the steadiness and uniformity of the wind field were both considered acceptable during the experiment the physical quantities including the motions and forces were measured by a series of sensors a torque sensor was located in the nacelle to capture the torque of the motor about the shaft bearing a six component load cell was installed at the top of the tower to measure the force and moment six single component load cells were installed at the fairleads to measure the mooring line tensions of the six lines in addition the six degrees of freedom 6dof motions of the wind turbine system were captured and recorded by a noncontact optical motion capture system the coordinate systems used in the model test are presented in fig 8 the global x axis is positive towards the downwind direction of the wind turbine and the global z axis is positive upward the origin is located at the waterplane for the platform coordinate system the directions of axes are same as the global ones but the origin of the platform coordinate system is located on the center of gravity cog of the whole floating wind turbine system all of the motions mentioned below are the rigid body motions relative to the cog the positive directions of the 6dof forces and moments recorded by the load cells at the top and base of the tower are also illustrated in the figure 3 fully coupled analytical method the numerical software fast v8 jonkman and jonkman 2016 developed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel was used to establish a numerical model of the spic concept wind turbine and simulate the corresponding environmental conditions in this study fig 9 illustrates the fully coupled analysis method for calculating the aero hydro servo elastic moor coupled multibody system model at the same time various external environmental conditions are introduced including irregular waves constant or turbulent wind etc to analyze the response characteristics of the numerical model under different environmental conditions fast v8 code solves the time domain fully coupled kinetic equation in eq 1 through the runge kutta method 1 m x f x x u t in the above equation m represents the mass matrix x x and x are the vectors of motion velocity and acceleration respectively u donates the input of the system and f is the force applied to the floating wind turbine including the hydrodynamic forces aerodynamic loads and mooring forces 3 1 hydrodynamic modeling for the spic concept wind turbine considered in this research the hydrodynamic loads were calculated using the hydrodyn module in fast v8 by applying the potential flow theory and morison s equation the hydrodynamic load f h y d r o consists of first order and second order wave excitation force f w a v e 1 and f w a v e 2 radiation force f r a d i a t i o n restoring force f r e s t o r i n g drag force f d r a g and current force f c u r r e n t since the current force is not considered in this study the hydrodynamic load can be expressed as 2 f h y d r o f w a v e 1 f w a v e 2 f r a d i a t i o n f r e s t o r i n g f d r a g the potential flow theory was applied to the floating foundation that was considered as a large volume structure the hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass potential damping first order and second order wave force transfer functions were firstly calculated by solving the boundary value problem newman and lee 2002 in the frequency domain using hydrod software sesam 2016 the meshes of the wet body surface and free surface were established in genie as shown in fig 9 this study adopted the full quadratic transfer functions qtfs to obtain the second order wave force and then these hydrodynamic coefficients calculated in the frequency domain were applied in the time domain by using the convolution technique faltinsen 1993 the restoring force is calculated based on the mean position of the floating structure the morison s equation was used to calculate the viscous drag force that was not considered in the potential flow theory the columns and the lower pontoons are both subjected to the viscous drag force which is proportional to the drag coefficient c d and the square of the relative inflow velocity the drag coefficient mainly depends on the reynolds re and keulegan carpenter kc numbers in this study the c d is selected to give the best agreement with the measured experimental results 3 2 aerodynamic modeling the aerodynamic loads on the rotor and tower were calculated by the aerodyn module the blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2015 was adopted to calculate the thrust on the rotor and power generation under different wind speeds rotation speeds and blade pitch angles the bem theory is a combination of one dimensional momentum theory and blade element theory it assumes steady state potential flow and that the blade elements are independent of each other hansen 2015 based on the bem theory the axial thrust and torque of the element obtained by the one dimensional momentum theory are equivalent to those obtained by the two dimensional blade element theory the axial induction factor and the tangential induction factor can then be determined by iterative calculation besides prandtl s tip loss factor was employed to correct the assumption of an infinite number of blades and glauert correction was applied to the high values of the axial induction factor when the wind turbine is rotating the incoming wind speed and blade speed vary which will cause the angle of attack to change dynamically at a relatively large and varying angle of attack the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil will be significantly different from the static conditions showing hysteresis this phenomenon is called dynamic stall in this study the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model was used to modify aerodynamic characteristics in addition the tower structure of the wind turbine can block the incoming wind flow making the wind speed upstream and downstream different the tower shadow effect directly affects the aerodynamic load on the tower structure the drag force and moment applied to the tower can be calculated by dividing it into many differential elements along the height 3 f t o w e r 1 2 ρ i 1 n c s i d i h i v i 2 where n is the number of segments divided by the height of the tower d i h i v i are the diameter section height and relative wind speed of each tower element respectively c s i is the shape coefficient which is related to the reynolds number 3 3 elastic system modeling the structural dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine and the supporting platform are calculated by the elastodyn module the blades and tower were considered as flexible structures based on the modal superposition method the structural deformations of blades and tower can be expressed as the superposition of a series of natural modes which can effectively reduce the degree of freedom dof of the whole system the numerical model established for the spic concept wind turbine contains 22 dofs including 6 dofs of rigid platform motion first and second fore aft and side to side tower bending modes first and second flapwise blade modes and first edgewise blade mode the yaw dof of the wind turbine drivetrain rotational flexibility dof etc 3 4 mooring system modeling the loads applied by the catenary mooring system were obtained by the moordyn module which is based on the lumped mass mooring line model each mooring line was made up of a series of evenly distributed segments each segment was divided into two parts and the properties of each part were lumped to the two adjacent nodes the segments were replaced by damper spring systems the model considers the axial stiffness damping weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces from the contact with the seabed the mooring equipment specifications was given as steel mooring chains in the software the mooring system is a catenary type and the properties of steel mooring lines including the diameter mass density and eas were given in detail in the moordyn module 3 5 control system modeling the control system consisted of a generator torque controller and a blade pitch controller three different control strategies were introduced in this study strategy a maintained the rotor speed and blade pitch angle at fixed values corresponding to the mean wind speed if the mean wind speed was set as the rated wind speed regardless of whether the relative wind speed was below at or over 11 4 m s the rotor speed was maintained at 9 6 rpm and the blade pitch angle was always 0 deg for strategy b and strategy c both the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles varied with the relative wind speed when the relative wind speed was below the rated wind speed the generator torque controller actively adjusted the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles were fixed at zero to maximize the capture of power both the thrust and the torque increased with the inflow wind speed and the values reached their maxima at the rated wind speed at over rated wind speeds the rotor speed was fixed at 9 6 rpm by the generator torque controller and the pitch angles were regulated by the blade pitch controller to keep the generated power constant at 10 mw with this range torque was maintained whereas the thrust decreased with increasing inflow wind speed the difference between strategy b and c is that a land based pitch controller was used in strategy b while a tuned controller with lower natural frequency was used in strategy c for all three control strategies a b and c when the speed exceeded the cut out wind speed the rotor was controlled to be parked and the pitch angle was set at 90 deg to minimize rotor thrust in fast v8 the servodyn module calls the bladed style dynamic link library dll to realize the abovementioned control mechanism in this study control strategy a was utilized in the numerical tests to simulate different conditions for comparisons with the experimental tests discussions concerning the response differences under these three control mechanisms are to be achieved through numerical simulations and presented in section 6 3 4 environmental conditions for the spic concept floating wind turbine operating at an intermediate water depth of 60 m the experimental and numerical test procedure is described below first the force offset relationship was investigated this process can verify whether the horizontal restoring stiffness of the mooring system is consistent between the experimental model and the numerical model second free decay tests were performed for three important dofs of the body motions for floating wind turbines pitch surge and heave the natural periods and dimensionless damping coefficients of each motion can be obtained through decay curves third white noise tests were conducted to determine the response amplitude operators raos of platform motions the significant wave height hs was set as 5 m and the wave period tp covered the period range from 5 s to 20 s after the preliminary tests for checking the basic performance of the floating wind turbine system the simulation tests were conducted in sequence under various environmental conditions the experimental and numerical tests considered wave only wind only and combined wind wave conditions and the descriptions and parameters are listed in table 5 the operational wave condition ec1 was generated in accordance with the jonswap spectrum as reported in dnv gl 2014 in the wind only tests three rated wind speed conditions with different wind turbulence intensities tis were considered theoretically ec2 was a steady wind condition with a wind speed always equal to 11 4 m s ec3 and ec4 simulated unsteady winds based on the iec kaimal turbulent model and the tis were set as 19 and 22 respectively the time series of the longitudinal wind speed were generated according to the spectrum in the longitudinal direction iec 1999 4 s 1 f 4 σ 1 2 l 1 v 1 6 f l 1 v 5 3 where f is the frequency v is the mean wind speed σ 1 is the standard deviation of the wind speed and l 1 is defined by the turbulence scale parameter 5 l 1 8 10 λ where the turbulence scale parameter λ is expressed as 6 λ 0 7 min 60 hub height the entire wind field seemed to be a uniform wind field without wind shear in theory the combined wind wave conditions ec5 ec7 were combinations of the irregular wave in ec1 and the rated wind speed conditions in ec2 ec4 the wind and wave loads considered in this study were directionally aligned the coordinate systems used in the experimental and numerical test are presented in fig 8 the positive directions of the environmental loads and dynamic responses were defined 5 comparison between the experimental and numerical results the results of the dynamic responses of the spic concept wind turbine from both basin model tests and numerical simulations are presented and compared horizontal restoring stiffness tests and free decay tests were conducted first to validate the natural performances of the mooring system and wind turbine concept cases under wave only wind only and combined wind wave conditions were conducted the basin model test case lasted for approximately 25 min which corresponded to 3 h for the prototype and all the results below were scaled to the full scale the numerical test performed a 3 hour simulation for each case and the full scale results were obtained directly the first 720 s of recorded data were removed from the full scale results to eliminate the transient effect the sampling frequency was set to 50 hz and 6 25 hz in the experimental test and numerical test respectively 5 1 horizontal restoring stiffness test a horizontal restoring stiffness test in the x direction was conducted in the model test and numerical simulation to verify the mooring system by obtaining the relationship between the horizontal forces and offsets in the basin model test a series of initial offsets in the surge direction were applied to the model and the surge restoring forces were recorded in the fast code increasing horizontal forces were applied to the platform and the corresponding horizontal displacements were measured the force displacement relationships obtained from the experimental and numerical tests are shown in fig 10 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results when the offsets are less than 15 m and the force offset relationship is fairly linear in this range for offsets larger than 15 m the horizontal restoring stiffness of the numerical mooring system is slightly less than that of the experimental model and both relationships become slightly nonlinear 5 2 free decay test free decay tests were performed to obtain the natural periods and damping coefficients of the platform motions for a floating wind turbine subjected to wave and wind loads in the downwind direction pitch surge and heave motions are regarded as the most significant motions the experimental and numerical approaches maintained identical initial displacements of the platform in each dof the natural periods and nondimensional damping coefficients of the 3dof motions of the full scale floating wind turbine were calculated and the results are listed in table 6 this table shows table that the numerical natural periods of the pitch surge and heave motions of the spic concept wind turbine all agree well with the test results the nondimensional damping coefficients of free decay motions were all simulated accurately by the numerical simulations as well the coefficients of free decay motion can be obtained through 7 μ 1 π ln φ a i φ a i 1 where φ a i and φ a i 1 are the i th and i 1 th peak or valley values of the decay curve 5 3 white noise test in the white noise tests the time series of the pitch surge and heave motions of spic concept wind turbine were measured the motion response spectrum was obtained by the fast fourier transform fft and the rao was obtained by further calculation 8 h ω s y ω s ζ ω where h ω is the rao s y ω is the power spectral density psd of the wind turbine motion and s ζ ω is the psd of a white noise wave to ensure that the input excitation s y ω of the numerical simulation was the same as that in the model test the time series of the white noise wave elevation measured by the wave gauge in the model test was input into the hydrodyn module of the fast code in fig 11 comparisons of the experimental and numerical raos of pitch surge and heave motions are presented because the wave period covered the range from 5 s to 20 s the wave frequency ranged from 0 31 rad s to 1 26 rad s all three motions have the natural frequencies out of the examined wave frequency range as the wave frequency increases the amplitudes of pitch surge and heave motions all present the decreasing trends these three raos show close agreement between the experimental and numerical results in summary the numerical model is acceptable for simulating the motion response transfer functions on these three dofs of the spic concept wind turbine 5 4 wave only condition wave only tests were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses caused by hydrodynamic forces including the motion responses and structural load responses of the floating wind turbine operational wave condition ec1 described in table 5 was chosen to validate the results of the numerical model during the model test the wave elevations were monitored through the wave gauge installed three meters side away from the wind turbine model the measured time series of wave elevations were scaled to the full scale the measured and target values of h s t p and γ are listed in table 7 in full scale it shows a great agreement between the theoretical and measured results therefore in the numerical simulation the time series of the wave elevations obtained by scaling the measurements in the model test are taken as the input data of the incident wave in this case the wave excitations of the numerical simulation and experiment under ec1 are guaranteed to be identical the numerical time series and power spectra of the three motion modes of the spic concept wind turbine under ec1 are compared with the experimental results in fig 12 the numerical results considered the second order responses using the full qtfs it can be seen from the time series of the pitch surge and heave motions that the numerical model gives similar results as compared to the experimental ones and the slow drift motions and wave frequency motions are all captured successfully more detailed comparisons can be seen in the psd curves obvious wave frequency responses can be observed in the pitch and heave motions and the numerical responses in this frequency range hardly show any difference from the experimental responses in addition significant spectral peaks appear at the natural frequencies of the pitch surge and heave motions in the psd of pitch motion except for a peak at the pitch natural frequency a peak at the natural frequency of surge motion can also be seen which is the result of coupling effect of surge responses compared with the low frequency responses obtained by the experimental test all of the pitch surge and heave resonance responses are simulated accurately by the numerical model the hydrodynamic loads have great influence on the structural load responses as well fig 13 compares the shear force at the tower top in the x direction tfx and the bending moment at the tower base about the y axis bmy under ec1 the response amplitudes and phases of the time series of tfx and bmy both show excellent agreement between the experimental and numerical results in the power spectra of tfx and bmy large wave frequency load responses and relatively small responses at low and high frequencies are observed in the model test and fast results three obvious peaks are presented in the wave frequency range of both tfx and bmy induced by the first order wave force applied to the floating wind turbine in the x direction the fluctuations of tfx and bmy are significantly affected by the first order wave force whereas the relatively smaller low frequency responses indicate that they are less affected by the low frequency slow drift force for tfx the numerical spectrum shows good agreement with the experimental one however the numerical spectrum of bmy is slightly smaller than the experimental spectrum in wave frequency this difference is due to the inertial force the wave force acting on the platform is transmitted to each structure of the floating wind turbine through the rigid platform flexible tower and other structures the power at the wave frequency in the bmy spectrum is directly generated by the inertial force on the tower base under the action of a larger inertial force caused by the larger structural weight in the model test the power at the wave frequency is larger in addition the peak appearing at approximately 2 6 rad s is induced by tower vibration in the model test the tower was fixed on the floating platform which could not be regarded as a rigid boundary because of the platform motion therefore in the numerical simulation the tower base boundary condition should also be tuned to match the experimental results in bmodes bir 2005 the hydrodynamic mass matrix m and the modified stiffness matrix k were given to calculate the tower mode shapes the modified stiffness matrix k which consists of the hydrodynamic stiffness and the mooring system stiffness were obtained through k 4 π 2 m t 2 in which t is the natural period matrix of 6dof motions in this way the tower mode shapes were considered with the effect of real 6dof motions of the floating wind turbine fig 13 shows that the numerical model simulated the natural frequency of tower vibration correctly based on the modified boundary condition fig 14 shows comparisons of the time series and psd of the mooring line tension under ec1 between the experimental and numerical tests due to the inflow wind and wave directions the mooring lines distributed in front of the wind turbine line3 line6 mainly sustain the tension line4 is chosen as an example the experimental and numerical time series and psd match well the fairlead tension of the mooring lines is directly influenced by the surge motion of the floating wind turbine the power is well predicted because of the accurate estimation of the surge resonant response 5 5 wind only condition wind only tests were conducted to validate the numerical simulation model under wind loads one steady wind condition ec2 and two turbulent wind conditions with different tis ec3 and ec4 were chosen to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model it was necessary to strictly simulate the control mode in the experiment therefore the rotor speed and blade pitch angle in the numerical model were set to fixed values of 9 6 rpm and 0 deg respectively the real control mode of the wind turbine described in section 3 4 will be discussed in the following text the mean values of the dynamic responses under ec2 ec4 between the experimental and numerical tests are compared in table 8 under the three wind only conditions the numerical results of all dynamic responses are slightly larger than those of the model test results in the basin model test the large offsets and tilts of the floating wind turbine model decreased the relative wind speed at the rotor plane leading to a smaller thrust applied to the model in addition the individual blade installation and the wind field nonuniformity during the basin model test both decreased the mean values of these responses which will be discussed in detail in sections 6 1 and 6 2 in contrast the relative wind speed at the rotor plane for the numerical wind turbine model did not weaken as the surge and pitch motions increased and the individual blade installation and the wind field nonuniformity did not exist the mean rotor thrusts under the three wind conditions are basically similar because the mean values of the inflow wind speed were set to be identical table 8 shows that the mean values of these dynamic responses decrease slightly with increasing wind speed turbulence intensity for both numerical simulations and experimental tests under the three different wind only conditions the rotor speed and blade pitch angles are set as the corresponding values of the rated wind speed and do not vary with the wind speed the aerodynamic thrust does not increase linearly with the wind speed if the wind speed at each moment is closer to the rated wind speed ti is smaller the mean values of the thrust and other quantities are greater 5 6 combined wind wave condition the coupled effects of combined wind wave conditions were taken into consideration through ec5 ec7 as the most significant dynamic responses the pitch motion tfx bmy and mooring line tension obtained through the experimental and numerical tests were compared in detail fig 15 illustrates the psds of the pitch motions under ec5 ec7 for these three combined wind wave conditions the powers excited at the wave frequency by the identical wave condition are not affected by the ti of the wind speed the low frequency component at the surge natural frequency is significantly excited by the low frequency wind load and magnified with increasing ti in contrast compared with the spectrum in fig 12 a the responses at the pitch natural frequency induced by the difference frequency wave force are obviously suppressed under ec5 ec7 which is attributed to aerodynamic damping the accuracy of the numerical results in these frequency ranges is acceptable for ec5 there is a small excitation peak at the surge natural frequency as well due to the variation in the aerodynamic thrust although the wind speed is regarded as constant in the numerical model the wind load changes at every moment because of the surge motion on the basis that the rotor speed and blade pitch angles remain unchanged however for turbulent wind conditions ec6 and ec7 the low frequency responses of numerical simulation is significantly larger than the results of model test it is mainly caused by the uniformity of wind field in the numerical simulation the wind field was regarded as a completely coherent one a completely coherent air inflow is uniformly distributed across the space at every time instant and the wind speed varies with the time series if the wind speed at a certain point is higher than rated wind speed the speeds at all of other points exceed the rated value at the same time therefore the inflow seen by the rotor is more unstable under this completely coherent uniform wind field on the contrary the real wind field generated during the model test is partially coherent due to the phase lag the wind speeds of each two points are close but different under which circumstance the variation of mean wind speed seen by rotor is relieved therefore because the uniformity of the wind field in the numerical simulation is better than which in the model test the rotor subject to more violent loads in numerical results the effect of wind field nonuniformity will be discussed in detail in the next section another main difference is that the numerical model does not reflect the power at 1 rad s under all three conditions this part of the power is induced by the rotor rotation frequency 1p the reason for this difference at 1p will be explained in the next chapter in addition under ec6 and ec7 the significant spectral peak at approximately 0 4 rad s is ignored by the numerical model these components appear in the time series with a relatively high wind speed this power may be generated by the excitation of the motor when the torque is large due to the high wind speed the psd of the measured motor torque is shown in fig 16 and a considerable response is seen at 0 4 rad s the power excited by the motor as an external excitation is not captured by the numerical model the power spectra of tfx and bmy under ec5 ec7 are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively for the fore aft tfx and bmy the wave frequency components remain unchanged under ec5 ec7 turbulent wind hardly influences the wave frequency responses caused by the incident wave the power in the extreme low frequency range is excited by the turbulent wind load under ec6 and ec7 and it becomes larger as the ti increases compared with the power spectra of the experimental results the numerical model captures the power at low and wave frequencies but ignores the power at 1p 2p and 3p frequencies the loads acting on the fairleads of the mooring lines are essential to be investigated as well the power spectra of the mooring line tension in line4 are illustrated in fig 19 under all three conditions the low frequency components at the surge natural frequency dominate the power spectra the low frequency responses are closely related to wind turbulence 6 uncertainty analysis in this section several aspects responsible for the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are further addressed including the effects of individual blade installation the mass discrepancy among three blades the spatial coherence of the wind field and the control strategies 6 1 effect of individual blade installation during the numerical simulation the pitch angles of the three blades are set to be identical at every moment however both during the model test and during the actual operation of the wind turbine the blade pitch angle of each blade is set individually which implies that initial blade pitch error due to imperfect installation might exist among the three blades therefore two numerical cases with and without individual blade installation error are compared in case1 without individual installation error the pitch angles of the three blades are all set as 0 deg whereas in the case2 with individual installation error the pitch angles of the three blades are set as 1 deg 0 deg and 1 deg the blade speed is fixed to 9 6 rpm corresponding to a rotating frequency 1p of 1 rad s the effects of individual blade installation on the mean values and standard deviations stds of the dynamic responses under ec5 are obtained through the comparison in table 9 when the individual blade installation error exists the mean values are all slightly smaller the relative reductions of all five responses are not more than 0 6 this factor partly contributes to the smaller mean values of the model test results in section 5 4 however the stds of the dynamic responses are generally larger in case2 than in case1 especially for tfx and bmy with the relative differences of 2 9 and 3 1 respectively the effects of individual blade installation are analyzed in detail through an examination of the psds of tower base fore aft bending moment bmy and tower base side side bending moment bmx under ec5 as shown in fig 20 for both bmy and bmx the error of individual blade installation leads to a significant spectral peak at 1p and relatively smaller peaks at 2p and 3p under a uniform wind load different pitch angles among the three blades lead to different normal force and different tangential force acting on each blade in the rotation process the large power of bmy at the 1p frequency is induced by periodic changes of the moment of rotor thrust and the large power of bmx at the 1p frequency is caused by the varying torque acting in the rotor plane as shown in figs 15 and 18 some differences between the numerical and experimental results at the 1p 2p and 3p frequencies can be seen they are partly affected by the slight individual blade installation error 6 2 effect of mass discrepancy among three blades in the experimental and numerical simulations mentioned above three blades with exactly the same mass distribution were strictly adopted however during the manufacturing process of the prototype blades the mass and mass distribution of three blades are difficult to be exactly the same therefore the mass discrepancy among three blades is also worthy of being taken as one of the influence factors in the uncertainty analysis two numerical cases with and without mass discrepancy among three blades are compared in the case with mass discrepancy the mass of blade 1 and blade 3 is 95 and 105 of the mass of blade 2 respectively therefore the total mass of the entire rotor is identical for two cases also in both cases the pitch angles of the three blades are all set as 0 deg and the blade speed is fixed to 9 6 rpm corresponding to a rotating frequency 1p of 1 rad s the effects of mass discrepancy among three blades are also analyzed in detail through the psds of bmy and bmx under ec5 as shown in fig 21 the mass discrepancy among three blades hardly influent the variation of bmy the figure shows a small peak at 1p frequency which can even be ignored and no peak on 2p or 3p this is totally different from the influence of blade pitch angle discrepancy this proves that the mass difference of the three blades does not have a great impact on the aerodynamic thrust due to the blade rotation however it has significant excitation at 1p frequency on the side side applied force or moment in the psd of side side tower base bending moment bmx a significant spectral peak appears at 1p frequency when blade mass discrepancy exists this indicates that aerodynamic torque is more sensitive to periodic rotor rotation than aerodynamic thrust when the weights of three blades are different and the center of gravity is no longer at the hub center this will have an impact on the stability of power generation so it is worth noting 6 3 effect of wind field nonuniformity the wind field is considered to be uniformly distributed across the rotor plane in the numerical simulation in this study however in the model test cases and in actual operation the external wind fields should be considered to exhibit partially spatial coherence to examine the effect of nonuniformity uniform and nonuniform wind fields were respectively generated in combination with irregular waves both wind fields generated the wind spectra according to eq 4 in the iec 61400 1 standard iec 1999 in longitudinal direction and did not generate wind in lateral and vertical directions the mean speeds of longitudinal winds were set as 11 4 m s for both uniform and nonuniform wind fields and the turbulence characteristics were set as level c in iec standard for the uniform wind field at any given moment the wind speeds are identical at all points in the rotor plane however for the nonuniform wind field the wind speeds at different points in the plane are distinct at the same time and the spatial coherence between points i and j is expressed as 9 c o h i j f s i j f s i f s j f where f is the frequency s i f and s j f are power spectral densities and s i j f is the cross spectral density this spatial coherence increases the correlation between the wind components at two points in turbsim jonkman and kilcher 2012 the 3rd edition of iec 61400 1 standard was chosen and the spatial distribution uses an exponential coherence function where the longitudinal component u component of the coherence is 10 c o h i j f exp 12 f r v 2 0 12 r l c 2 where f is the frequency v is the mean wind speed at hub height and r represents the distance between two points i and j the coherence scale parameter l c is determined as 11 l c 5 76 min 60 hub height under the uniform and nonuniform wind fields the mean values and stds of five dynamic responses are given in table 10 the mean values of dynamic responses under nonuniform wind field are all smaller than those under a uniform wind field although the mean wind speed of the nonuniform inflow is identical to that of the uniform wind inflow the mean wind thrust applied to the rotor varies this finding also explains the influence on the smaller mean values of the model test results in section 5 4 however the nonuniformity of the wind field show different influences on different responses the nonuniformity of wind field obviously decreases the stds of pitch motion surge motion and fairlead tension the reduction differences are all around 7 on the contrary under nonuniform wind field the stds of tfx and bmy are 1 85 and 1 68 respectively larger than those obtained under uniform wind field for detailed analysis psds of bmy under two conditions are shown in fig 22 the differences are presented at low frequency range and high frequency range the low frequency components are induced mainly by the slowly varying component of the wind speed in time scale and the speed discrepancy in the space scale and the power of bmy at low frequency range is relatively larger under uniform wind field it can also be seen in fig 18 that the low frequency components obtained by numerical calculation are slightly larger than those obtained by experimental results it is because that the numerical calculation treated the wind field as a uniform one and ignored the decrease of low frequency components caused by the nonuniformity of the wind field in the partially coherent wind field nonuniform wind field the mean wind inflow seen by the rotor is more stable so the low frequency aerodynamic loads applying to the floating wind turbine show smaller fluctuations in addition an obvious high frequency spectral peak can be seen at approximately 3 rad s which is three times the rotating frequency and this is another main reason for the apparent increase in the stds each blade experiences fluctuations in the inflow wind speed due to the space scale turbulence during the rotation process therefore the power at the 3p frequency in fig 18 is induced by the slight nonuniformity of the simulated wind field in summary the nonuniformity of the wind field slightly suppresses the low frequency components of surge pitch and fairlead tension but do not excite the high frequency components thus the stds of these responses show slight decreases as for the load responses of structures such as tfx and bmy the nonuniformity of the wind field suppresses the low frequency responses while stimulates the responses at 3p significantly thus the overall stds are obviously increased 6 4 effect of different control strategies in previous tests the control strategies adopted by the experimental and numerical models under wind conditions were employed to maintain the rotor speed and blade pitch angles at fixed values strategy a the same simple control strategy was used in the comparison between the experimental and the numerical simulations in order to compare the dynamic performances of the wind turbine more clearly however the real control system of the wind turbine was operated as strategy b and c for strategy b and c both the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles varied with the relative wind speed they were controlled dynamically considering the feedback however the pitch controller used in strategy b is the land based controller which was originally utilized on the onshore wind turbine the frequency of blade pitch controller is larger than the pitch natural frequency of general floating wind turbine and strategy c reduced the natural frequency of the pitch controller by modification of proportional gains k p and integral gains k i larsen and hanson 2007 which is more suitable for the floating concept wind turbine to investigate the influences of different control strategies this study utilized the validated numerical model with strategy b and c to predict the dynamic responses of the spic wind turbine under combined wind wave condition ec6 for a comparison with the results following strategy a table 11 compares the mean values and stds between the three different control strategies under ec6 the responses obtained through strategy b and c show obvious smaller average values than those obtained through strategy a and the relative differences are almost as large as around 17 for strategy b and c the rotor receives the rated thrust only at the rated wind speed the rotor would receive relatively smaller thrust at higher or lower wind speeds for larger blade pitch angles and smaller rotor speeds respectively however for strategy a at over rated wind speeds the rotor receives larger thrust as the wind speed increases because the blade pitch angles remain unchanged and the maximum thrust depends on the maximum wind speed under ec6 at below rated wind speeds the rotor speed does not decrease with declining wind speed accounting for the relatively larger rotor thrust therefore under the same turbulent wind conditions the rotor receives larger thrust under strategy a during the whole process the mean values of the other dynamic responses are also affected strategy b and c affects the stds of the responses significantly the effects are especially significant for pitch motion tower top shear force tfx and tower base bending moment bmy for a detailed analysis comparisons among the psds of bmy are given in fig 23 the different control strategies do not influence the bmy responses in the wave frequency range and high frequency range under irregular waves and turbulent winds however the effects can be clearly seen in the low frequency range the bmy spectra show large peak at the platform pitch frequency most pronounced for strategy b and least pronounced for strategy a in strategy b the frequency of pitch controller is higher than the natural frequency of foundation pitch motion which means that pitch controller shows relatively quicker reflex to adjust the aerodynamic loads therefore when the wind turbine is surging and pitching upwind the increasing relative wind speed will lead to the increasing blade pitch angle and the decreasing rotor thrust to cause the forward offset and tilt of the wind turbine in contrast when the wind turbine is surging and pitching downwind the decrease in the relative wind speed will reduce the blade pitch angle and increase the thrust to enhance the backward offset and tilt in this case a negative damping in strategy b is inevitable also for the bmy spectrum obtained under strategy c power at the platform pitch frequency is observable as well but to a much smaller extent compared with strategy b once the wind speed is over the rated speed the frequency of the pitch angle controller is set smaller than the natural frequencies of low frequency motions to mitigate the effect of negative damping larsen and hanson 2007 karimirad and moan 2011 although the tuned controller in strategy c was slowed down to avoid the floating platform pitch instability the presence of active blade pitching still result in the reduced effective damping and the increased aerodynamic excitation bredmose et al 2017 a similar response relationship among three strategies would also be seen at the surge natural frequency of bmy spectra but the hydrodynamic viscous damping on the floating platform results in a positive damping and thereby eliminates the instability 7 conclusions a series of experiments and numerical simulations based on the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor method were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept 10 mw wind turbine at an intermediate water depth the numerical results of horizontal restoring stiffness natural frequencies and motion raos agree well with the experimental results afterwards the dynamic responses under various operational conditions are examined including the pitch surge and heave motions the tower top fore aft shear force tfx the tower base fore aft bending moment bmy and the mooring line tension in general the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is good except for some discrepancies under the steady wind and turbulent wind conditions the mean value of each quantity decreases with increasing turbulence intensity under the combined wind wave condition the wave frequency responses do not change but the power at the surge resonance frequency is increased and the power at the pitch resonance frequency is suppressed the numerical simulation overestimates the low frequency response under turbulent wind conditions and cannot capture the response at approximately 0 4 rad s which is caused by the motor torque as the external excitation in addition the responses at 1p 2p and 3p are completely ignored by the numerical model possible reasons for the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results were further analyzed specifically the effects of individual blade installation the nonuniformity of the wind field and different control strategies were discussed through numerical comparisons in the case of identical inflow wind speeds the mean values of the responses are decreased by both blade installation errors and wind field nonuniformity however the slight individual blade installation error induces the significant responses at 1p and 2p while the spatial coherence of the nonuniform wind field causes the 3p responses the mass discrepancy among three blades shows slight influence on the fore aft applied force or moment but has significant excitation at 1p frequency on the side side applied force or moment in addition the statistical values and low frequency power are greatly affected by the control strategy when the rotor speed and blade pitch angles are adjusted based on strategy b and c the mean values of all five dynamic responses are lower than the values obtained when the blade pitch angles and rotor speed are fixed strategy a the low frequency responses at pitch natural frequency of the fore aft bmy are increased under turbulent wind by the land based controller following strategy b because of negative damping and this phenomenon is mitigatory when the natural frequency of blade pitch controller is tuned smaller in strategy c the reveal of the uncertainties can be helpful for further guiding the model test

20694,a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of a 10 mw floating wind turbine concept named spic at an intermediate water depth of approximately 60 m a fully coupled numerical model was established using the aero hydro servo elastic moor method the experimental and numerical dynamic responses under operational conditions including irregular waves steady and turbulent winds and combined wind wave conditions generally agree well the mean values are well predicted and the powers at motion resonant frequencies wave frequency and tower vibration frequency are captured discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are further addressed by in depth numerical analyses under turbulent winds the discrepancies of dynamic responses at 1p and 2p frequencies are induced mainly by individual blade installation error while the discrepancies at 3p components are caused mainly by the nonuniformity of the wind field in addition in the turbulent wind case with variable blade pitch angles and rotor speed control system the mean tower base bending moment is smaller and the low frequency responses are larger than those in the case with fixed blade pitch angles and a constant rotor speed the reveal of uncertainties is helpful for further guiding the model test of floating wind turbines keywords floating wind turbine experiment numerical simulation turbulent wind control strategy 1 introduction wind energy is one of the most competitive energy resources as it has the advantages of imposing the lowest environmental effect and boasting a high cost efficiency and excellent sustainability wang et al 2018 decastro et al 2019 among all available wind resources offshore winds provide faster and steadier wind speeds more powerful electrical output greater energy yield and fewer visual or noise problems than onshore winds kaldellis et al 2016 therefore an increasing number of floating wind turbines have been designed and adopted to capture offshore wind energy on this basis to reduce the cost of energy wind turbines were upscaled from 5 mw to 8 mw and then 10 mw igwemezie et al 2019 for instance the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine developed by danmarks tekniske universitet has been widely studied bak et al 2013 the significant aerodynamic thrust loads can cause remarkable motion responses of the floating foundation which carries the dtu 10 mw wind turbine oh et al 2018 therefore extensive efforts are required to increase the stability of the foundation the types of floating platforms are mainly composed of spar tension leg platform tlp semi submersible and barge and the selection of the platform type is affected by the water depth liu et al 2016 in the present research the floating wind turbine is designed for intermediate water depth ranging from 40 m to 60 m and the water depth of 60 m is studied in this study the reason why such a water depth is considered is mainly that several prototype projects of floating wind turbines are planned in waters with a depth between 40 m to 60 m besides the bathymetry of the nearshore seas in guangdong province china is relatively flat where the water depth does not change significantly with distance from the shore several floating wind farms planned in guangdong are also located in water depth of 40 m to 60 m therefore it is of great practical importance to investigate the dynamic behavior of floating wind turbines in intermediate water depths in these water depths a semi submersible platform with good hydrodynamic behavior and cost efficiency is very promising liu et al 2016 in this study a semi submersible floating wind turbine concept designed by the authors named the spic concept is investigated it is composed of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine a flexible tower and a semi submersible platform featuring with three partially inclined side columns spic for short cao et al 2020 2019 to investigate the feasibility of the novel floating wind turbine concept and to analyze the dynamic responses of the whole wind turbine system the experimental study is the most reliable approach viselli 2016 pereira 2014 many people have carried out model tests on semi submersible wind turbines of different concepts in 2010 a model test of the windfloat wind turbine was conducted at uc berkeley to investigate the platform response under the 100 year wave condition in this small scale 1 105 test the wind thrust was applied through an actuator disk roddier et al 2010 the deepcwind concept designed by the university of maine was subjected to free decay tests wave only tests and wind only tests at marin in 2011 goupee et al 2014 koo et al 2014 using a 1 50 froude scaled nrel 5 mw blades a higher wind speed was used to compensate for the aerodynamic thrust then in 2013 a second round of tests was conducted with three performance matched blades a similar model test was performed at the 1 50 scale again at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university in 2015 the dynamic responses caused by the differences between the froude scaled and performance scaled blades were investigated by chen et al 2018 another semi submersible floater equipped with the nrel 5 mw wind turbine named dutch tri floater was tested at the ecole centrale nantes ecn tank under wind and wave loads at the 1 50 scale in 2013 a feedback controlled ducted fan was used to simulate the aerodynamic thrust in a 1 40 model test of a braceless semi submersible called concrete star wind floater azcona et al 2014 the aerodynamic force was calculated through the nrel code fast according to the platform motion measured during the test and in 2015 a real time hybrid model test reathm of another braceless semi submersible wind turbine was conducted at marintek at a 1 30 scale bachynski et al 2016 utilizing tensioned wires connected to the actuators to simulate the aerodynamic thrust in 2017 a model test of the triple spar which is equipped with the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine was performed at dhi denmark with an active blade pitch control for the first time bredmose et al 2017 selected free decay regular wave irregular wave and extreme wave conditions were simulated during the test the performance of each new wind turbine concept should be evaluated for its feasibility under each specific environmental condition the results of such experiments are relatively accurate but it is financially impracticable to simulate the performance of a turbine under all of environmental conditions with model testing oguz et al 2018 therefore the numerical simulation approach should be validated by a comparison with experimental results and then used to predict the performances of floating wind turbines a series of numerical codes including fast jonkman and jonkman 2016 and hawc2 larsen and hansen 2007 extending from onshore wind codes and semo reflex reinholdtsen and falkenberg 2001 extending from marine structure codes were developed to establish numerical models and to calculate the dynamic responses of the whole floating wind turbine system christian et al 2009 and roddier et al 2010 validated the hydrodynamic model of windfloat with fast software and considered the effects of the turbine control system the phase ii of the offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project was aimed at validating numerical tools through a comparison with test data from the deepcwind wind turbine robertson et al 2017 the simulated ultimate and fatigue loads under eight conditions were obtained and they were decently estimated for the deepcwind wind turbine chen et al 2019 also developed a coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor code called darwind to compare the results of previous tests chen et al 2018 the results showed that darwind has a satisfactory ability to simulate the whole wind turbine system maxime et al 2013 compared the results obtained by the fast code and the model test results of the dutch tri floater semi submersible wind turbine the numerical model was calibrated through decay tests regular wave conditions and constant wind conditions and was proven to be reasonable in surge and pitch degrees of freedom dofs berthelsen et al 2016 simulated the braceless floating wind turbine in reathm at full scale the hydrodynamic motions and loads were calculated by simo and the mooring line responses were obtained through riflex the numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental results under cases with or without winds and waves the triple spar wind turbine was remodeled in fast by bredmose et al 2017 and the model was tuned against decay tests of the tower and platform a comparison under regular waves was conducted showing that the surge motion was slightly underestimated by the fast code further remodeling under other complex conditions was being researched the studies mentioned above tried to reimplement model testing by numerical simulation aiming at conducting the simulations by numerical codes that cannot be realized by the model test in this research a series of experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the 10 mw spic wind turbine system at an intermediate water depth the experimental models and facilities were introduced first to ensure the accuracy of the basin model test then a numerical model was established based on the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor method operational irregular waves steady winds at rated wind speed and turbulent winds with different turbulence intensities tis were selected as the environmental conditions the numerical results of the horizontal restoring stiffness free decay tests white noise tests wave only tests wind only tests and wind wave combined tests were compared with the experimental results respectively to validate the rationality of the numerical model on this basis the discrepancies between the numerical simulations and experimental results were further analyzed by considering the effects of individual blade installation mass discrepancy among three blades wind field nonuniformity and different control strategies 2 floating wind turbine model 2 1 numerical model the spic concept wind turbine consists of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine a flexible tower and a semi submersible platform as shown in fig 1 the dtu 10 mw wind turbine is a three blade horizontal axis turbine with the rated wind speed of 11 4 m s and the main parameters are listed in table 1 the tower connects the nacelle to the floating platform with a tower height of 92 6 m and a tower bottom 23 0 m above the water surface the outer diameter of the tower varies linearly from 5 50 m at the tower top to 7 74 m at the tower base the semi submersible platform shown in fig 2 is composed of a central column three partially inclined side columns a submerged pontoon and three bracings and the detailed parameters are given in table 2 more details about the properties of the spic concept can be found in cao et al 2020a b the mooring system which constrains the floating wind turbine at the intermediate water depth of 60 m comprises six catenary mooring lines fig 3 presents the layout of the mooring lines the detailed properties of the numerical mooring line model are listed in table 3 the main parameters of the whole numerical wind turbine system are shown in table 4 the draft and displacement are obtained when the mooring line tension is applied and the mass cog r x x r y y and r z z are considered for the whole wind turbine system except for the mooring system the numerical model was established by using the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor numerical software fast v8 jonkman and jonkman 2016 the aerodynamic force was solved based on blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2015 considering numerous corrections such as tip loss glauert correction dynamic inflow and dynamic stall the hydrodynamic loads applied to the semi submersible platform model were calculated based on the hydrodynamic coefficients calculated by potential flow theory the mooring loads were obtained based on the lumped mass method the structural dynamic performance of the flexible structures such as the blades and tower was obtained by using the mode superposition method fast utilized the multibody dynamics to analyze the coupled dynamic performance of the entire floating wind turbine system the detailed theoretical background of this fully coupled analytical method for the numerical model is to be introduced in section 3 2 2 experimental model the experiment of the spic concept wind turbine was conducted at the deepwater offshore basin in shanghai jiao tong university with the main scale of 50 m 40 m 10 m this model test was performed at a froude scale of 1 64 at the basin water depth of 0 94 m and the experimental model is shown in fig 4 in this section the experimental spic model and facilities including the rotor model control system model tower model platform model mooring system model wind generating system and instruments are briefly introduced in the model test a performance matched blade model wen et al 2019 that can achieve the target thrust at low reynolds numbers was designed to replace the geometry matched blade the blade length was kept the same the sd2030 airfoil with a smaller thickness was chosen to provide larger lift and drag forces at each section the chord length was expanded by a factor of 1 3 and the twist angle was optimized in the meanwhile to satisfy the aerodynamic performance because the performance matched blade has a longer chord length and larger surface area than the geometry matched blade the former has more difficulty meeting the froude scaling weight therefore two light carbon fiber layers were chosen to form the surface of the hollow structured blade model as presented in fig 4 in fig 5 the span wise load distribution of the performance matched rotor under low re number was compared with that of full scaled rotor under high re number it illustrates that the normal forces of the designed rotor match well with the values of full scaled rotor but the tangential forces are less performed therefore the simulation of the moment around rotation axis is relatively lower it is very difficult to satisfy both thrust similarity and aerodynamic moment similarity at low reynolds number in the meantime through adjusting the blade shape for the dynamic response analysis of the wind turbine the axial thrust is more important so it will give priority to satisfy the similar thrust however the rotation of the rotor will not be affected by the small aerodynamic moment because the servo motor in the nacelle will adjust in real time to meet the constant targeted rotor speed some wind tests on land were then conducted to compare the performance of real and scaled rotor in different wind speeds the constant winds with different wind speeds were generated in turn by the wind generating system and applied to the rotor the aerodynamic thrust caused by inflow wind was recorded and compared with the theoretical thrust as shown in fig 6 however the aerodynamic moment is not the focus of this study which was not measured and calibrated in this paper a motor installed in the nacelle was used to control the rotor speed a manual rotation device was arranged at the blade root to adjust the blade pitch angle and the three blades were adjusted individually at below rated and rated wind speeds the rotor speed was adjusted by the motor to obtain the maximal thrust and the pitch angle was always set at 0 deg at over rated wind speed the rotor speed was controlled to remain unchanged at the rated value and the blade pitch angles were manually adjusted according to different wind speeds at cut out and even larger wind speeds the rotor speed and blade pitch angles were set at 0 rpm and 90 deg respectively during each model test case the rotor speed and pitch angles were fixed regardless of the wind speed for the tower the bending stiffness of the tower sections was scaled to accurately simulate the eigenmodes in the fore aft and side by side directions al6063 was chosen as the material due to its properties of low density and high strength the tower model consisted of eight aluminum tubes with the same inner diameter 20 mm and different outer diameters the outer diameter was determined by the target stiffness scaled from the prototype using towers with scaled stiffness cannot satisfy geometric similarity at the same time because the outer diameter of towers with scaled stiffness will definitely be smaller this will make the drag force generated by the wind acting on the tower very small it will have a certain influence on the test results but when the wind speed is not too high e g at the rated wind speed the drag force of the tower will not have a significant effect on the overall result if other changes and treatments are made to the structure of the tower in order to match the scaled drag force they may affect the natural frequency of the tower the tower s natural frequency is of greater importance during the operating condition and should be carefully modeled in the experiments this experimental study mainly focuses on the dynamic behavior of the floating wind turbine under several operational conditions under the rated wind speed so the processing of scaled tower focused on the simulation of vibration natural frequencies the main parameters and properties of the experimental platform model are listed in tables 2 and 4 fiberglass and wood were used to process the platform model as presented in fig 4 in the model test iron and lead were added to the side columns and the submerged pontoons and adjusted as the ballast to achieve the desired mass center of gravity and radius of inertia of the whole floating wind turbine model the detailed properties of the experimental mooring line model are listed in table 3 in the model test iron chains and lead wire were used to imitate the weight and the spring was set to satisfy the stiffness all of the properties of the mooring system model strictly met the scaling requirements except that the outer diameter of each line was not accurately simulated the wind generating system was used to simulate the wind environment in the model test including steady and unsteady winds the desired wind speed was achieved by varying the rotor speed of the fan and the maximum wind speed can reach 15 m s the wind turbine model was placed at the position of 4 6 m in front of the wind generating system during the experiment so the quality of the effective wind field in this plane was explored when the system was set to generate a wind speed of 1 4 m s the wind speeds at 49 points distributed throughout the square wind field with a side length of 3 2 m were measured by hot wire anemometers the origin of the right handed coordinate system o xyz was at the center of the hub the x axis is oriented along the wind direction and the z axis points up the mean wind speed and turbulence intensity ti at each measurement point are given in fig 7 in the contour of the rotor red line the steadiness and uniformity of the wind field were both considered acceptable during the experiment the physical quantities including the motions and forces were measured by a series of sensors a torque sensor was located in the nacelle to capture the torque of the motor about the shaft bearing a six component load cell was installed at the top of the tower to measure the force and moment six single component load cells were installed at the fairleads to measure the mooring line tensions of the six lines in addition the six degrees of freedom 6dof motions of the wind turbine system were captured and recorded by a noncontact optical motion capture system the coordinate systems used in the model test are presented in fig 8 the global x axis is positive towards the downwind direction of the wind turbine and the global z axis is positive upward the origin is located at the waterplane for the platform coordinate system the directions of axes are same as the global ones but the origin of the platform coordinate system is located on the center of gravity cog of the whole floating wind turbine system all of the motions mentioned below are the rigid body motions relative to the cog the positive directions of the 6dof forces and moments recorded by the load cells at the top and base of the tower are also illustrated in the figure 3 fully coupled analytical method the numerical software fast v8 jonkman and jonkman 2016 developed by the national renewable energy laboratory nrel was used to establish a numerical model of the spic concept wind turbine and simulate the corresponding environmental conditions in this study fig 9 illustrates the fully coupled analysis method for calculating the aero hydro servo elastic moor coupled multibody system model at the same time various external environmental conditions are introduced including irregular waves constant or turbulent wind etc to analyze the response characteristics of the numerical model under different environmental conditions fast v8 code solves the time domain fully coupled kinetic equation in eq 1 through the runge kutta method 1 m x f x x u t in the above equation m represents the mass matrix x x and x are the vectors of motion velocity and acceleration respectively u donates the input of the system and f is the force applied to the floating wind turbine including the hydrodynamic forces aerodynamic loads and mooring forces 3 1 hydrodynamic modeling for the spic concept wind turbine considered in this research the hydrodynamic loads were calculated using the hydrodyn module in fast v8 by applying the potential flow theory and morison s equation the hydrodynamic load f h y d r o consists of first order and second order wave excitation force f w a v e 1 and f w a v e 2 radiation force f r a d i a t i o n restoring force f r e s t o r i n g drag force f d r a g and current force f c u r r e n t since the current force is not considered in this study the hydrodynamic load can be expressed as 2 f h y d r o f w a v e 1 f w a v e 2 f r a d i a t i o n f r e s t o r i n g f d r a g the potential flow theory was applied to the floating foundation that was considered as a large volume structure the hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass potential damping first order and second order wave force transfer functions were firstly calculated by solving the boundary value problem newman and lee 2002 in the frequency domain using hydrod software sesam 2016 the meshes of the wet body surface and free surface were established in genie as shown in fig 9 this study adopted the full quadratic transfer functions qtfs to obtain the second order wave force and then these hydrodynamic coefficients calculated in the frequency domain were applied in the time domain by using the convolution technique faltinsen 1993 the restoring force is calculated based on the mean position of the floating structure the morison s equation was used to calculate the viscous drag force that was not considered in the potential flow theory the columns and the lower pontoons are both subjected to the viscous drag force which is proportional to the drag coefficient c d and the square of the relative inflow velocity the drag coefficient mainly depends on the reynolds re and keulegan carpenter kc numbers in this study the c d is selected to give the best agreement with the measured experimental results 3 2 aerodynamic modeling the aerodynamic loads on the rotor and tower were calculated by the aerodyn module the blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2015 was adopted to calculate the thrust on the rotor and power generation under different wind speeds rotation speeds and blade pitch angles the bem theory is a combination of one dimensional momentum theory and blade element theory it assumes steady state potential flow and that the blade elements are independent of each other hansen 2015 based on the bem theory the axial thrust and torque of the element obtained by the one dimensional momentum theory are equivalent to those obtained by the two dimensional blade element theory the axial induction factor and the tangential induction factor can then be determined by iterative calculation besides prandtl s tip loss factor was employed to correct the assumption of an infinite number of blades and glauert correction was applied to the high values of the axial induction factor when the wind turbine is rotating the incoming wind speed and blade speed vary which will cause the angle of attack to change dynamically at a relatively large and varying angle of attack the aerodynamic characteristics of the airfoil will be significantly different from the static conditions showing hysteresis this phenomenon is called dynamic stall in this study the beddoes leishman dynamic stall model was used to modify aerodynamic characteristics in addition the tower structure of the wind turbine can block the incoming wind flow making the wind speed upstream and downstream different the tower shadow effect directly affects the aerodynamic load on the tower structure the drag force and moment applied to the tower can be calculated by dividing it into many differential elements along the height 3 f t o w e r 1 2 ρ i 1 n c s i d i h i v i 2 where n is the number of segments divided by the height of the tower d i h i v i are the diameter section height and relative wind speed of each tower element respectively c s i is the shape coefficient which is related to the reynolds number 3 3 elastic system modeling the structural dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine and the supporting platform are calculated by the elastodyn module the blades and tower were considered as flexible structures based on the modal superposition method the structural deformations of blades and tower can be expressed as the superposition of a series of natural modes which can effectively reduce the degree of freedom dof of the whole system the numerical model established for the spic concept wind turbine contains 22 dofs including 6 dofs of rigid platform motion first and second fore aft and side to side tower bending modes first and second flapwise blade modes and first edgewise blade mode the yaw dof of the wind turbine drivetrain rotational flexibility dof etc 3 4 mooring system modeling the loads applied by the catenary mooring system were obtained by the moordyn module which is based on the lumped mass mooring line model each mooring line was made up of a series of evenly distributed segments each segment was divided into two parts and the properties of each part were lumped to the two adjacent nodes the segments were replaced by damper spring systems the model considers the axial stiffness damping weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces from morison s equation and vertical spring damper forces from the contact with the seabed the mooring equipment specifications was given as steel mooring chains in the software the mooring system is a catenary type and the properties of steel mooring lines including the diameter mass density and eas were given in detail in the moordyn module 3 5 control system modeling the control system consisted of a generator torque controller and a blade pitch controller three different control strategies were introduced in this study strategy a maintained the rotor speed and blade pitch angle at fixed values corresponding to the mean wind speed if the mean wind speed was set as the rated wind speed regardless of whether the relative wind speed was below at or over 11 4 m s the rotor speed was maintained at 9 6 rpm and the blade pitch angle was always 0 deg for strategy b and strategy c both the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles varied with the relative wind speed when the relative wind speed was below the rated wind speed the generator torque controller actively adjusted the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles were fixed at zero to maximize the capture of power both the thrust and the torque increased with the inflow wind speed and the values reached their maxima at the rated wind speed at over rated wind speeds the rotor speed was fixed at 9 6 rpm by the generator torque controller and the pitch angles were regulated by the blade pitch controller to keep the generated power constant at 10 mw with this range torque was maintained whereas the thrust decreased with increasing inflow wind speed the difference between strategy b and c is that a land based pitch controller was used in strategy b while a tuned controller with lower natural frequency was used in strategy c for all three control strategies a b and c when the speed exceeded the cut out wind speed the rotor was controlled to be parked and the pitch angle was set at 90 deg to minimize rotor thrust in fast v8 the servodyn module calls the bladed style dynamic link library dll to realize the abovementioned control mechanism in this study control strategy a was utilized in the numerical tests to simulate different conditions for comparisons with the experimental tests discussions concerning the response differences under these three control mechanisms are to be achieved through numerical simulations and presented in section 6 3 4 environmental conditions for the spic concept floating wind turbine operating at an intermediate water depth of 60 m the experimental and numerical test procedure is described below first the force offset relationship was investigated this process can verify whether the horizontal restoring stiffness of the mooring system is consistent between the experimental model and the numerical model second free decay tests were performed for three important dofs of the body motions for floating wind turbines pitch surge and heave the natural periods and dimensionless damping coefficients of each motion can be obtained through decay curves third white noise tests were conducted to determine the response amplitude operators raos of platform motions the significant wave height hs was set as 5 m and the wave period tp covered the period range from 5 s to 20 s after the preliminary tests for checking the basic performance of the floating wind turbine system the simulation tests were conducted in sequence under various environmental conditions the experimental and numerical tests considered wave only wind only and combined wind wave conditions and the descriptions and parameters are listed in table 5 the operational wave condition ec1 was generated in accordance with the jonswap spectrum as reported in dnv gl 2014 in the wind only tests three rated wind speed conditions with different wind turbulence intensities tis were considered theoretically ec2 was a steady wind condition with a wind speed always equal to 11 4 m s ec3 and ec4 simulated unsteady winds based on the iec kaimal turbulent model and the tis were set as 19 and 22 respectively the time series of the longitudinal wind speed were generated according to the spectrum in the longitudinal direction iec 1999 4 s 1 f 4 σ 1 2 l 1 v 1 6 f l 1 v 5 3 where f is the frequency v is the mean wind speed σ 1 is the standard deviation of the wind speed and l 1 is defined by the turbulence scale parameter 5 l 1 8 10 λ where the turbulence scale parameter λ is expressed as 6 λ 0 7 min 60 hub height the entire wind field seemed to be a uniform wind field without wind shear in theory the combined wind wave conditions ec5 ec7 were combinations of the irregular wave in ec1 and the rated wind speed conditions in ec2 ec4 the wind and wave loads considered in this study were directionally aligned the coordinate systems used in the experimental and numerical test are presented in fig 8 the positive directions of the environmental loads and dynamic responses were defined 5 comparison between the experimental and numerical results the results of the dynamic responses of the spic concept wind turbine from both basin model tests and numerical simulations are presented and compared horizontal restoring stiffness tests and free decay tests were conducted first to validate the natural performances of the mooring system and wind turbine concept cases under wave only wind only and combined wind wave conditions were conducted the basin model test case lasted for approximately 25 min which corresponded to 3 h for the prototype and all the results below were scaled to the full scale the numerical test performed a 3 hour simulation for each case and the full scale results were obtained directly the first 720 s of recorded data were removed from the full scale results to eliminate the transient effect the sampling frequency was set to 50 hz and 6 25 hz in the experimental test and numerical test respectively 5 1 horizontal restoring stiffness test a horizontal restoring stiffness test in the x direction was conducted in the model test and numerical simulation to verify the mooring system by obtaining the relationship between the horizontal forces and offsets in the basin model test a series of initial offsets in the surge direction were applied to the model and the surge restoring forces were recorded in the fast code increasing horizontal forces were applied to the platform and the corresponding horizontal displacements were measured the force displacement relationships obtained from the experimental and numerical tests are shown in fig 10 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results when the offsets are less than 15 m and the force offset relationship is fairly linear in this range for offsets larger than 15 m the horizontal restoring stiffness of the numerical mooring system is slightly less than that of the experimental model and both relationships become slightly nonlinear 5 2 free decay test free decay tests were performed to obtain the natural periods and damping coefficients of the platform motions for a floating wind turbine subjected to wave and wind loads in the downwind direction pitch surge and heave motions are regarded as the most significant motions the experimental and numerical approaches maintained identical initial displacements of the platform in each dof the natural periods and nondimensional damping coefficients of the 3dof motions of the full scale floating wind turbine were calculated and the results are listed in table 6 this table shows table that the numerical natural periods of the pitch surge and heave motions of the spic concept wind turbine all agree well with the test results the nondimensional damping coefficients of free decay motions were all simulated accurately by the numerical simulations as well the coefficients of free decay motion can be obtained through 7 μ 1 π ln φ a i φ a i 1 where φ a i and φ a i 1 are the i th and i 1 th peak or valley values of the decay curve 5 3 white noise test in the white noise tests the time series of the pitch surge and heave motions of spic concept wind turbine were measured the motion response spectrum was obtained by the fast fourier transform fft and the rao was obtained by further calculation 8 h ω s y ω s ζ ω where h ω is the rao s y ω is the power spectral density psd of the wind turbine motion and s ζ ω is the psd of a white noise wave to ensure that the input excitation s y ω of the numerical simulation was the same as that in the model test the time series of the white noise wave elevation measured by the wave gauge in the model test was input into the hydrodyn module of the fast code in fig 11 comparisons of the experimental and numerical raos of pitch surge and heave motions are presented because the wave period covered the range from 5 s to 20 s the wave frequency ranged from 0 31 rad s to 1 26 rad s all three motions have the natural frequencies out of the examined wave frequency range as the wave frequency increases the amplitudes of pitch surge and heave motions all present the decreasing trends these three raos show close agreement between the experimental and numerical results in summary the numerical model is acceptable for simulating the motion response transfer functions on these three dofs of the spic concept wind turbine 5 4 wave only condition wave only tests were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses caused by hydrodynamic forces including the motion responses and structural load responses of the floating wind turbine operational wave condition ec1 described in table 5 was chosen to validate the results of the numerical model during the model test the wave elevations were monitored through the wave gauge installed three meters side away from the wind turbine model the measured time series of wave elevations were scaled to the full scale the measured and target values of h s t p and γ are listed in table 7 in full scale it shows a great agreement between the theoretical and measured results therefore in the numerical simulation the time series of the wave elevations obtained by scaling the measurements in the model test are taken as the input data of the incident wave in this case the wave excitations of the numerical simulation and experiment under ec1 are guaranteed to be identical the numerical time series and power spectra of the three motion modes of the spic concept wind turbine under ec1 are compared with the experimental results in fig 12 the numerical results considered the second order responses using the full qtfs it can be seen from the time series of the pitch surge and heave motions that the numerical model gives similar results as compared to the experimental ones and the slow drift motions and wave frequency motions are all captured successfully more detailed comparisons can be seen in the psd curves obvious wave frequency responses can be observed in the pitch and heave motions and the numerical responses in this frequency range hardly show any difference from the experimental responses in addition significant spectral peaks appear at the natural frequencies of the pitch surge and heave motions in the psd of pitch motion except for a peak at the pitch natural frequency a peak at the natural frequency of surge motion can also be seen which is the result of coupling effect of surge responses compared with the low frequency responses obtained by the experimental test all of the pitch surge and heave resonance responses are simulated accurately by the numerical model the hydrodynamic loads have great influence on the structural load responses as well fig 13 compares the shear force at the tower top in the x direction tfx and the bending moment at the tower base about the y axis bmy under ec1 the response amplitudes and phases of the time series of tfx and bmy both show excellent agreement between the experimental and numerical results in the power spectra of tfx and bmy large wave frequency load responses and relatively small responses at low and high frequencies are observed in the model test and fast results three obvious peaks are presented in the wave frequency range of both tfx and bmy induced by the first order wave force applied to the floating wind turbine in the x direction the fluctuations of tfx and bmy are significantly affected by the first order wave force whereas the relatively smaller low frequency responses indicate that they are less affected by the low frequency slow drift force for tfx the numerical spectrum shows good agreement with the experimental one however the numerical spectrum of bmy is slightly smaller than the experimental spectrum in wave frequency this difference is due to the inertial force the wave force acting on the platform is transmitted to each structure of the floating wind turbine through the rigid platform flexible tower and other structures the power at the wave frequency in the bmy spectrum is directly generated by the inertial force on the tower base under the action of a larger inertial force caused by the larger structural weight in the model test the power at the wave frequency is larger in addition the peak appearing at approximately 2 6 rad s is induced by tower vibration in the model test the tower was fixed on the floating platform which could not be regarded as a rigid boundary because of the platform motion therefore in the numerical simulation the tower base boundary condition should also be tuned to match the experimental results in bmodes bir 2005 the hydrodynamic mass matrix m and the modified stiffness matrix k were given to calculate the tower mode shapes the modified stiffness matrix k which consists of the hydrodynamic stiffness and the mooring system stiffness were obtained through k 4 π 2 m t 2 in which t is the natural period matrix of 6dof motions in this way the tower mode shapes were considered with the effect of real 6dof motions of the floating wind turbine fig 13 shows that the numerical model simulated the natural frequency of tower vibration correctly based on the modified boundary condition fig 14 shows comparisons of the time series and psd of the mooring line tension under ec1 between the experimental and numerical tests due to the inflow wind and wave directions the mooring lines distributed in front of the wind turbine line3 line6 mainly sustain the tension line4 is chosen as an example the experimental and numerical time series and psd match well the fairlead tension of the mooring lines is directly influenced by the surge motion of the floating wind turbine the power is well predicted because of the accurate estimation of the surge resonant response 5 5 wind only condition wind only tests were conducted to validate the numerical simulation model under wind loads one steady wind condition ec2 and two turbulent wind conditions with different tis ec3 and ec4 were chosen to ensure the accuracy of the numerical model it was necessary to strictly simulate the control mode in the experiment therefore the rotor speed and blade pitch angle in the numerical model were set to fixed values of 9 6 rpm and 0 deg respectively the real control mode of the wind turbine described in section 3 4 will be discussed in the following text the mean values of the dynamic responses under ec2 ec4 between the experimental and numerical tests are compared in table 8 under the three wind only conditions the numerical results of all dynamic responses are slightly larger than those of the model test results in the basin model test the large offsets and tilts of the floating wind turbine model decreased the relative wind speed at the rotor plane leading to a smaller thrust applied to the model in addition the individual blade installation and the wind field nonuniformity during the basin model test both decreased the mean values of these responses which will be discussed in detail in sections 6 1 and 6 2 in contrast the relative wind speed at the rotor plane for the numerical wind turbine model did not weaken as the surge and pitch motions increased and the individual blade installation and the wind field nonuniformity did not exist the mean rotor thrusts under the three wind conditions are basically similar because the mean values of the inflow wind speed were set to be identical table 8 shows that the mean values of these dynamic responses decrease slightly with increasing wind speed turbulence intensity for both numerical simulations and experimental tests under the three different wind only conditions the rotor speed and blade pitch angles are set as the corresponding values of the rated wind speed and do not vary with the wind speed the aerodynamic thrust does not increase linearly with the wind speed if the wind speed at each moment is closer to the rated wind speed ti is smaller the mean values of the thrust and other quantities are greater 5 6 combined wind wave condition the coupled effects of combined wind wave conditions were taken into consideration through ec5 ec7 as the most significant dynamic responses the pitch motion tfx bmy and mooring line tension obtained through the experimental and numerical tests were compared in detail fig 15 illustrates the psds of the pitch motions under ec5 ec7 for these three combined wind wave conditions the powers excited at the wave frequency by the identical wave condition are not affected by the ti of the wind speed the low frequency component at the surge natural frequency is significantly excited by the low frequency wind load and magnified with increasing ti in contrast compared with the spectrum in fig 12 a the responses at the pitch natural frequency induced by the difference frequency wave force are obviously suppressed under ec5 ec7 which is attributed to aerodynamic damping the accuracy of the numerical results in these frequency ranges is acceptable for ec5 there is a small excitation peak at the surge natural frequency as well due to the variation in the aerodynamic thrust although the wind speed is regarded as constant in the numerical model the wind load changes at every moment because of the surge motion on the basis that the rotor speed and blade pitch angles remain unchanged however for turbulent wind conditions ec6 and ec7 the low frequency responses of numerical simulation is significantly larger than the results of model test it is mainly caused by the uniformity of wind field in the numerical simulation the wind field was regarded as a completely coherent one a completely coherent air inflow is uniformly distributed across the space at every time instant and the wind speed varies with the time series if the wind speed at a certain point is higher than rated wind speed the speeds at all of other points exceed the rated value at the same time therefore the inflow seen by the rotor is more unstable under this completely coherent uniform wind field on the contrary the real wind field generated during the model test is partially coherent due to the phase lag the wind speeds of each two points are close but different under which circumstance the variation of mean wind speed seen by rotor is relieved therefore because the uniformity of the wind field in the numerical simulation is better than which in the model test the rotor subject to more violent loads in numerical results the effect of wind field nonuniformity will be discussed in detail in the next section another main difference is that the numerical model does not reflect the power at 1 rad s under all three conditions this part of the power is induced by the rotor rotation frequency 1p the reason for this difference at 1p will be explained in the next chapter in addition under ec6 and ec7 the significant spectral peak at approximately 0 4 rad s is ignored by the numerical model these components appear in the time series with a relatively high wind speed this power may be generated by the excitation of the motor when the torque is large due to the high wind speed the psd of the measured motor torque is shown in fig 16 and a considerable response is seen at 0 4 rad s the power excited by the motor as an external excitation is not captured by the numerical model the power spectra of tfx and bmy under ec5 ec7 are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively for the fore aft tfx and bmy the wave frequency components remain unchanged under ec5 ec7 turbulent wind hardly influences the wave frequency responses caused by the incident wave the power in the extreme low frequency range is excited by the turbulent wind load under ec6 and ec7 and it becomes larger as the ti increases compared with the power spectra of the experimental results the numerical model captures the power at low and wave frequencies but ignores the power at 1p 2p and 3p frequencies the loads acting on the fairleads of the mooring lines are essential to be investigated as well the power spectra of the mooring line tension in line4 are illustrated in fig 19 under all three conditions the low frequency components at the surge natural frequency dominate the power spectra the low frequency responses are closely related to wind turbulence 6 uncertainty analysis in this section several aspects responsible for the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results are further addressed including the effects of individual blade installation the mass discrepancy among three blades the spatial coherence of the wind field and the control strategies 6 1 effect of individual blade installation during the numerical simulation the pitch angles of the three blades are set to be identical at every moment however both during the model test and during the actual operation of the wind turbine the blade pitch angle of each blade is set individually which implies that initial blade pitch error due to imperfect installation might exist among the three blades therefore two numerical cases with and without individual blade installation error are compared in case1 without individual installation error the pitch angles of the three blades are all set as 0 deg whereas in the case2 with individual installation error the pitch angles of the three blades are set as 1 deg 0 deg and 1 deg the blade speed is fixed to 9 6 rpm corresponding to a rotating frequency 1p of 1 rad s the effects of individual blade installation on the mean values and standard deviations stds of the dynamic responses under ec5 are obtained through the comparison in table 9 when the individual blade installation error exists the mean values are all slightly smaller the relative reductions of all five responses are not more than 0 6 this factor partly contributes to the smaller mean values of the model test results in section 5 4 however the stds of the dynamic responses are generally larger in case2 than in case1 especially for tfx and bmy with the relative differences of 2 9 and 3 1 respectively the effects of individual blade installation are analyzed in detail through an examination of the psds of tower base fore aft bending moment bmy and tower base side side bending moment bmx under ec5 as shown in fig 20 for both bmy and bmx the error of individual blade installation leads to a significant spectral peak at 1p and relatively smaller peaks at 2p and 3p under a uniform wind load different pitch angles among the three blades lead to different normal force and different tangential force acting on each blade in the rotation process the large power of bmy at the 1p frequency is induced by periodic changes of the moment of rotor thrust and the large power of bmx at the 1p frequency is caused by the varying torque acting in the rotor plane as shown in figs 15 and 18 some differences between the numerical and experimental results at the 1p 2p and 3p frequencies can be seen they are partly affected by the slight individual blade installation error 6 2 effect of mass discrepancy among three blades in the experimental and numerical simulations mentioned above three blades with exactly the same mass distribution were strictly adopted however during the manufacturing process of the prototype blades the mass and mass distribution of three blades are difficult to be exactly the same therefore the mass discrepancy among three blades is also worthy of being taken as one of the influence factors in the uncertainty analysis two numerical cases with and without mass discrepancy among three blades are compared in the case with mass discrepancy the mass of blade 1 and blade 3 is 95 and 105 of the mass of blade 2 respectively therefore the total mass of the entire rotor is identical for two cases also in both cases the pitch angles of the three blades are all set as 0 deg and the blade speed is fixed to 9 6 rpm corresponding to a rotating frequency 1p of 1 rad s the effects of mass discrepancy among three blades are also analyzed in detail through the psds of bmy and bmx under ec5 as shown in fig 21 the mass discrepancy among three blades hardly influent the variation of bmy the figure shows a small peak at 1p frequency which can even be ignored and no peak on 2p or 3p this is totally different from the influence of blade pitch angle discrepancy this proves that the mass difference of the three blades does not have a great impact on the aerodynamic thrust due to the blade rotation however it has significant excitation at 1p frequency on the side side applied force or moment in the psd of side side tower base bending moment bmx a significant spectral peak appears at 1p frequency when blade mass discrepancy exists this indicates that aerodynamic torque is more sensitive to periodic rotor rotation than aerodynamic thrust when the weights of three blades are different and the center of gravity is no longer at the hub center this will have an impact on the stability of power generation so it is worth noting 6 3 effect of wind field nonuniformity the wind field is considered to be uniformly distributed across the rotor plane in the numerical simulation in this study however in the model test cases and in actual operation the external wind fields should be considered to exhibit partially spatial coherence to examine the effect of nonuniformity uniform and nonuniform wind fields were respectively generated in combination with irregular waves both wind fields generated the wind spectra according to eq 4 in the iec 61400 1 standard iec 1999 in longitudinal direction and did not generate wind in lateral and vertical directions the mean speeds of longitudinal winds were set as 11 4 m s for both uniform and nonuniform wind fields and the turbulence characteristics were set as level c in iec standard for the uniform wind field at any given moment the wind speeds are identical at all points in the rotor plane however for the nonuniform wind field the wind speeds at different points in the plane are distinct at the same time and the spatial coherence between points i and j is expressed as 9 c o h i j f s i j f s i f s j f where f is the frequency s i f and s j f are power spectral densities and s i j f is the cross spectral density this spatial coherence increases the correlation between the wind components at two points in turbsim jonkman and kilcher 2012 the 3rd edition of iec 61400 1 standard was chosen and the spatial distribution uses an exponential coherence function where the longitudinal component u component of the coherence is 10 c o h i j f exp 12 f r v 2 0 12 r l c 2 where f is the frequency v is the mean wind speed at hub height and r represents the distance between two points i and j the coherence scale parameter l c is determined as 11 l c 5 76 min 60 hub height under the uniform and nonuniform wind fields the mean values and stds of five dynamic responses are given in table 10 the mean values of dynamic responses under nonuniform wind field are all smaller than those under a uniform wind field although the mean wind speed of the nonuniform inflow is identical to that of the uniform wind inflow the mean wind thrust applied to the rotor varies this finding also explains the influence on the smaller mean values of the model test results in section 5 4 however the nonuniformity of the wind field show different influences on different responses the nonuniformity of wind field obviously decreases the stds of pitch motion surge motion and fairlead tension the reduction differences are all around 7 on the contrary under nonuniform wind field the stds of tfx and bmy are 1 85 and 1 68 respectively larger than those obtained under uniform wind field for detailed analysis psds of bmy under two conditions are shown in fig 22 the differences are presented at low frequency range and high frequency range the low frequency components are induced mainly by the slowly varying component of the wind speed in time scale and the speed discrepancy in the space scale and the power of bmy at low frequency range is relatively larger under uniform wind field it can also be seen in fig 18 that the low frequency components obtained by numerical calculation are slightly larger than those obtained by experimental results it is because that the numerical calculation treated the wind field as a uniform one and ignored the decrease of low frequency components caused by the nonuniformity of the wind field in the partially coherent wind field nonuniform wind field the mean wind inflow seen by the rotor is more stable so the low frequency aerodynamic loads applying to the floating wind turbine show smaller fluctuations in addition an obvious high frequency spectral peak can be seen at approximately 3 rad s which is three times the rotating frequency and this is another main reason for the apparent increase in the stds each blade experiences fluctuations in the inflow wind speed due to the space scale turbulence during the rotation process therefore the power at the 3p frequency in fig 18 is induced by the slight nonuniformity of the simulated wind field in summary the nonuniformity of the wind field slightly suppresses the low frequency components of surge pitch and fairlead tension but do not excite the high frequency components thus the stds of these responses show slight decreases as for the load responses of structures such as tfx and bmy the nonuniformity of the wind field suppresses the low frequency responses while stimulates the responses at 3p significantly thus the overall stds are obviously increased 6 4 effect of different control strategies in previous tests the control strategies adopted by the experimental and numerical models under wind conditions were employed to maintain the rotor speed and blade pitch angles at fixed values strategy a the same simple control strategy was used in the comparison between the experimental and the numerical simulations in order to compare the dynamic performances of the wind turbine more clearly however the real control system of the wind turbine was operated as strategy b and c for strategy b and c both the rotor speed and the blade pitch angles varied with the relative wind speed they were controlled dynamically considering the feedback however the pitch controller used in strategy b is the land based controller which was originally utilized on the onshore wind turbine the frequency of blade pitch controller is larger than the pitch natural frequency of general floating wind turbine and strategy c reduced the natural frequency of the pitch controller by modification of proportional gains k p and integral gains k i larsen and hanson 2007 which is more suitable for the floating concept wind turbine to investigate the influences of different control strategies this study utilized the validated numerical model with strategy b and c to predict the dynamic responses of the spic wind turbine under combined wind wave condition ec6 for a comparison with the results following strategy a table 11 compares the mean values and stds between the three different control strategies under ec6 the responses obtained through strategy b and c show obvious smaller average values than those obtained through strategy a and the relative differences are almost as large as around 17 for strategy b and c the rotor receives the rated thrust only at the rated wind speed the rotor would receive relatively smaller thrust at higher or lower wind speeds for larger blade pitch angles and smaller rotor speeds respectively however for strategy a at over rated wind speeds the rotor receives larger thrust as the wind speed increases because the blade pitch angles remain unchanged and the maximum thrust depends on the maximum wind speed under ec6 at below rated wind speeds the rotor speed does not decrease with declining wind speed accounting for the relatively larger rotor thrust therefore under the same turbulent wind conditions the rotor receives larger thrust under strategy a during the whole process the mean values of the other dynamic responses are also affected strategy b and c affects the stds of the responses significantly the effects are especially significant for pitch motion tower top shear force tfx and tower base bending moment bmy for a detailed analysis comparisons among the psds of bmy are given in fig 23 the different control strategies do not influence the bmy responses in the wave frequency range and high frequency range under irregular waves and turbulent winds however the effects can be clearly seen in the low frequency range the bmy spectra show large peak at the platform pitch frequency most pronounced for strategy b and least pronounced for strategy a in strategy b the frequency of pitch controller is higher than the natural frequency of foundation pitch motion which means that pitch controller shows relatively quicker reflex to adjust the aerodynamic loads therefore when the wind turbine is surging and pitching upwind the increasing relative wind speed will lead to the increasing blade pitch angle and the decreasing rotor thrust to cause the forward offset and tilt of the wind turbine in contrast when the wind turbine is surging and pitching downwind the decrease in the relative wind speed will reduce the blade pitch angle and increase the thrust to enhance the backward offset and tilt in this case a negative damping in strategy b is inevitable also for the bmy spectrum obtained under strategy c power at the platform pitch frequency is observable as well but to a much smaller extent compared with strategy b once the wind speed is over the rated speed the frequency of the pitch angle controller is set smaller than the natural frequencies of low frequency motions to mitigate the effect of negative damping larsen and hanson 2007 karimirad and moan 2011 although the tuned controller in strategy c was slowed down to avoid the floating platform pitch instability the presence of active blade pitching still result in the reduced effective damping and the increased aerodynamic excitation bredmose et al 2017 a similar response relationship among three strategies would also be seen at the surge natural frequency of bmy spectra but the hydrodynamic viscous damping on the floating platform results in a positive damping and thereby eliminates the instability 7 conclusions a series of experiments and numerical simulations based on the fully coupled aero hydro servo elastic moor method were conducted to investigate the dynamic responses of the spic concept 10 mw wind turbine at an intermediate water depth the numerical results of horizontal restoring stiffness natural frequencies and motion raos agree well with the experimental results afterwards the dynamic responses under various operational conditions are examined including the pitch surge and heave motions the tower top fore aft shear force tfx the tower base fore aft bending moment bmy and the mooring line tension in general the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is good except for some discrepancies under the steady wind and turbulent wind conditions the mean value of each quantity decreases with increasing turbulence intensity under the combined wind wave condition the wave frequency responses do not change but the power at the surge resonance frequency is increased and the power at the pitch resonance frequency is suppressed the numerical simulation overestimates the low frequency response under turbulent wind conditions and cannot capture the response at approximately 0 4 rad s which is caused by the motor torque as the external excitation in addition the responses at 1p 2p and 3p are completely ignored by the numerical model possible reasons for the discrepancies between the numerical and experimental results were further analyzed specifically the effects of individual blade installation the nonuniformity of the wind field and different control strategies were discussed through numerical comparisons in the case of identical inflow wind speeds the mean values of the responses are decreased by both blade installation errors and wind field nonuniformity however the slight individual blade installation error induces the significant responses at 1p and 2p while the spatial coherence of the nonuniform wind field causes the 3p responses the mass discrepancy among three blades shows slight influence on the fore aft applied force or moment but has significant excitation at 1p frequency on the side side applied force or moment in addition the statistical values and low frequency power are greatly affected by the control strategy when the rotor speed and blade pitch angles are adjusted based on strategy b and c the mean values of all five dynamic responses are lower than the values obtained when the blade pitch angles and rotor speed are fixed strategy a the low frequency responses at pitch natural frequency of the fore aft bmy are increased under turbulent wind by the land based controller following strategy b because of negative damping and this phenomenon is mitigatory when the natural frequency of blade pitch controller is tuned smaller in strategy c the reveal of the uncertainties can be helpful for further guiding the model test
