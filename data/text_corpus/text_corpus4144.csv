20720,the human factor is regarded as one of the most significant topics for sustainable maritime transportation since increasing shipping activities can pose potential hazards to human life the environment and commodity the paper aims to assess the potential contribution of human errors in the maritime industry hence success likelihood index method slim was employed by incorporating interval type 2 fuzzy sets it2fss while slim systematically estimates human error probability hep for the designated task it2fs deals with subjectivity in the process of using experts judgements a loading operation onboard containership was investigated due to its considerable risks for the marine environment safety culture experience fatigue and time limitation were observed as highly effective on crew performance the obtained results indicate that the it2fs slim approach can effectively be applied for determining the vulnerabilities and critical human errors in the operational process the paper is also intended to enhance safety control levels and minimize potential errors in maritime transportation keywords interval type 2 fuzzy sets slim human error maritime transportation 1 introduction maritime transportation is the lifeblood of the global economy since approximately 90 percent of global trading is carried out by vessels akyuz and celik 2018 although uncertainty remains an overriding issue in the current maritime transportation industry international maritime trade continues to expand day to day it is expected to expand with an annual growth rate of 3 5 percent over the next 5 years period unctad 2019 on the other hand maritime is one of the most dangerous industries all over the world and has a history of the considerable amount at disasters and tragic events because of involving wide ranges of hazardous operations accordingly seafarers are continuously exposed to a high level risk every day due to the nature of work aydin et al 2021a kuzu et al 2019 as a global standard setting authority international maritime organization imo 2020 insistently emphasized that at least 80 percent of shipping casualties are related to the human factor likewise human error he is found to be the primary cause of maritime transportation accidents in the maritime accidents investigation reports sarialioğlu et al 2020 harrald et al 1998 he should be taken into consideration as a focal point in the safe operations of maritime transportation in that the consequences of human errors can be rather devastating for the marine environment moreover the assessments of risk carried out separately from the seafarer s safety performance shall lead to insufficient detection in maritime accidents and incidents maritime safety researchers have been seeking proactive solutions to minimize risks and enhance safety level by the understanding of the human contribution to risk completely however konstandinidou et al 2006 evaluated the current methods as limited due to not represent all of the important aspects of human performance in the view of literature research although there are some applicable methods presented in terms of the human reliability assessments ung 2019 xi et al 2017 akyuz et al 2018 the researches predicting the likelihood of human error in critical shipboard operations are rather limited however hep assessments provide to identify and foresee the weaknesses in an operation in which human element leading to a failure aydin et al 2021b castiglia and giardina 2013 following this purpose some traditional techniques considering hep assessments have been utilized to determine the human error contribution to risk such as therp the technique for human error rate prediction martins and maturana 2010 slim success likelihood index method akyuz and celik 2017 akyuz 2016 islam et al 2016 xi and guo 2011 cream cognitive reliability and error analysis method ahn and kurt 2020 zhou et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2017 rashed 2016 heart human error assessment and reduction technique kandemir et al 2019 akyuz and celik 2016 and bn bayesian network rozuhan et al 2020 islam et al 2017 2018 and sherpa systematic human error reduction and prediction approach ernstsen and nazir 2018 in maritime transportation the therp heart and slim are the methodologies that focus on expert judgements and rely on certain mathematical models to calculate heps khan et al 2006 since data are lacking in the maritime industry expert judgements are primarily of interest on the other hand these applied techniques are insufficient to overcome vagueness and inconsistency akyuz and celik 2016 to illustrate the therp can be applied to situations where there are limited data however the technique fails to choose psfs while considering the organizational factors pan and wu 2018 heart is the other approach that relies to a high extent on expert judgements the quantification process of heps is similar to the therp but the heart takes a further step to analyse tasks systematically however identifying the key sub tasks are quite difficult and vague spurgin 2009 the slim is a flexible approach deriving heps from context unlike therp slim relates context to human error nevertheless problems with the determination of the relative importance of psfs and lack of guidance in the choice of psfs are the cons for slim spurgin 2009 unless the expert elicitation process is carried out with care this article aims to investigate the safety performance of seafarers and to calculate hep occurring throughout the cargo operation onboard container ship determining human error contributions to operational risks shall be beneficial being as an early warning indicator because of increasing the awareness about vulnerabilities of the system for risk management in this context the paper presents a quantitative hybrid methodology integrating interval type 2 fuzzy sets it2fs with slim to predict human oriented errors in maritime transportation data scarcity is the motivation for utilising slim since it is heavily based on expert judgement in the process of the proposed it2fs slim approach the slim is capable of determining and quantifying performance shaping factors psfs that highly effective on human safety performance and calculating hep values accordingly the it2fs copes with the vagueness and ambiguity of the linguistic appointments of experts and increases the consistency in the decision making process to achieve this purpose the paper is organised as follows the motivation behind the study and comprehensive literature research about the hep assessments in the maritime industry are provided in this section because of the central role of slim and it2fs in the current work a brief literature review and the theoretical background are presented in section 2 the proposed approach and its integration are explained in detail in section 3 section 4 provides the exemplificative application of the proposed approach into a real time cargo loading operation on board container ship findings and extended discussion are included in section 5 the final section provides the conclusion and the contribution of research to maritime transportation 2 methods this section presents the theoretical background of the methods as well as a brief review of the literature 2 1 slim the slim is the first generation hra technique that was introduced by embrey et al 1984 the main goal of the method is to quantify and predict the hep occurring in specific tasks by focusing on relative factors islam et al 2016 called as psfs that have a considerable effect on human performance the slim commonly relies on the judgements of domain experts in the prediction of the hep process due to the scarce of data park and lee 2008 domain experts select a set of psfs and weight their perceived importance on a given task based on experience and knowledge it is paramount to derive systematic and appropriate psfs rather than all psfs in this context the selection of experts is the core point of the slim in conjunction with the quantification of psfs a success likelihood index sli is elicited utilising experts judgements akyuz 2016 the sli value can be calibrated with human error data to predict occurrence probability to acquire hep values the quantification process is divided into the following main steps in the slim approach i psf derivation ii psf rating iii psf weighting iv sli determination v hep calculation embrey et al 1984 2 2 interval type 2 fuzzy sets type 2 fuzzy logic as an extension of the concept of the conventional fuzzy logic was first introduced by zadeh 1975 the basic principle of systems is similar for both however the membership function of t1fs is crisp whilst the membership function of t2fs is fuzzy accordingly t2fs can express a higher degree of fuzziness besides t2fs copes with the uncertainties much better due to providing more various parameters by comparison with t1fs castillo and melin 2008 an interval type 2 fuzzy set can be defined as a special case of a generalised type 2 fuzzy set mendel 2001 proposed the interval type 2 fuzzy set as a model for words that express different meanings to different people to overcome the uncertainty demirel et al 2019 celik et al 2015 compared to generalised t2fs it2fs is rather proper for utilising in real case applications kahraman et al 2014 the data collected from linguistic expressions of experts are commonly subjective and have limitations in terms of representing the safety performance of humans completely in traditional hep approaches due to their reduced computational effort and feasibility akyuz and celik 2016 the it2fs can tackle complex conditions readily and reflects uncertainties better mendel 2007 after having briefly mentioned the it2fs and the t2fs the definitions of mathematical operations and step by step developments are presented in the following equations celik et al 2016 definition 1 a type 2 fuzzy set a in the universe of discourse x can be characterized by a type 2 membership function μ a x u where j x denotes an interval in 0 1 is shown as follows mendel et al 2006 a x u μ a x u x x u j x 0 1 0 μ a x u 1 the type 2 fuzzy set a is also represented as follows mendel et al 2006 when the elements of the fuzzy numbers are continuous a x x u j x μ a x u x u x x u j x μ a x u u x where j x 0 1 and denotes union over all admissible x and u definition 2 let a be a type 2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse x represented by the type 2 membership function μ a x u if all μ a x u 1 then a is called as an interval type 2 fuzzy set and represented as follows castillo and melin 2008 mendel et al 2006 a x x u j x 1 x u x x u j x 1 u x where j x 0 1 definition 3 in this study a method using the it2fss for handling fuzzy multiple attribute group decision making problems is presented in the model the reference points and the heights of the upper and the lower membership functions of the it2fss are characterised as a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set as depicted in fig 1 mendel et al 2006 a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set a i a i u a i l a i 1 u a

approach it2fs slim this section presents how the it2fss and slim technique is integrated for predicting the probability of human error in maritime transportation the conceptual framework of the integration is depicted in fig 2 the proposed approach consists of eight steps and their brief explanations are as follows step 1 task analysis task analysis is the first step of the proposed method identifying the process tasks that to be carried out to achieve that hierarchical task analysis hta is performed to obtain hep for each task step 2 definition of operational environment this step expresses a real shipboard operation environment in the light of the various conditions such as physical working conditions time of day sea state weather conditions port facility instructions and operational limitations interruptions of operation failure related to port facilities ship the conditions are rather important and should be taken into consideration due to considerably affect human performance during carrying out of each task step 3 psf derivation the psfs such as experience knowledge training workload stress etc have a significant effect upon human performance and they are obtained by experts for each task step 4 psf rating each psf shall be rated by marine experts in this context a value from 1 to 9 in a liner scale is nominated if determined psf has a significant impact upon the relevant task value 1 is assigned by experts step 5 psf weighting each psf has relative importance upon tasks in comparison to others accordingly the nominated values for each psf shall differ from one expert to the other in the conventional slim the experts weigh the psfs subjectively to overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of the expert judgements the it2fs is preferred in the weighting of psfs the it2fs converts the marine experts psf weighting into linguistic variables instead of a percentage value step 6 determination of sli after rating and weighting of psfs the sli value is calculated by using the equation 7 the sli is the essential tool for predicting the cases in which several human errors may occur 7 s l i i 1 n r i w i 0 s l i 1 in equation 7 n expresses the number of psfs r i represents the rating scale of psfs and w i represents the weight of the psfs relative importance step 7 hep calculation once the sli is calculated it then possible to calculate the hep values for each identified task in the operation the conversion of the sli values to hep is achieved by a logarithmic relationship the linear logarithmic function with base 10 log base 10 chien et al 1988 given in equation 8 is the foundational aspect of the slim process 8 l o g h e p a s l i b in the equation above a and b are the constants obtained from the heps for the sub tasks with the highest and lowest slis 4 prediction of human error probability in maritime transportation the case of cargo loading operation in a container ship a real time cargo handling operation on board container ship is select to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach since the loading operation has potential risks for ship crew life port facilities and marine environment 4 1 cargo loading operation in the container ship cargo operation requires effective teamwork to carry out loading and discharging safely and systematically the knowledge of the responsible deck team must be competent for proper cargo stowage and handling chief officer deck officer 2nd 3rd off bosun able seaman electrician for reefer containers and deck cadet are the integral parts of the watchkeeping team and shall monitor the loading operation according to bay plan as well as cargo plan the bay plan includes numerical coordinates of containers relating to bay row and tier that above and below the deck the complete loading operation consists of a couple of processes i pre arrival ii pre loading iii during loading iv after loading v pre departure in the current study the process of during loading iii on board container ship is handled in terms of human safety and ship cargo security the cargo operations became even more important today because the marine environment and eco system face considerable enormous problems in compliance with mandatory and non mandatory regulations of authorities to avoid omissions crucial items need to be checked by the watchkeeping team regularly throughout the operation under the supervision of the chief officer stowage plan ship stability values drafts gm bending moment torsion moment shearing force and trim specific containers such as imdg oh oog and reefers lashings of containers lashing gear visibility line and hatch covers demands great attention larson and pacino 2020 any stage and latest status of container loading operation are also noted to port logbook and ship s journal from time to time 4 2 problem statement loading operation consists of extensive activity that requires the responsible crew to relevant tasks and keeps a caution on other things at the same time on board ship however some factors may force the responsible crew to neglect significant activities which need exacting attention and check in the meantime any omissions lead to serious consequences to human life ship port facility and the marine environment nowadays a high volume of goods is handled on board ship at once in large ports with significant container terminal yu et al 2018 even though a shorter operation time at the port is a positive indicator of the level of port efficiency and quite desired case for ship owners a lot of pressure is put on the all responsible crew to handle the cargo operation efficiently in the face of growing risks in this sense crew performance plays a crucial role in preventing marine causalities and loss of life hence human error prediction is examined during the completion of specific tasks in loading operation onboard container ship to enhance safety performance and minimize potential environmental hazards 4 3 marine experts definition empirical studies and accident data sets are the ideal and optimum sources for human error prediction park and lee 2008 on the other hand the data in maritime transportation is rather limited due to commercial reasons to manage the aforementioned challenge the slim mostly employs the experts judgements in the decision making process since the method is practical for human error prediction the experts are supposed to have extensive knowledge and experience accordingly the following criteria are determinative to form an expert committee in the study i minimum oceangoing master capacity ii minimum 10 years of experience onboard container ship and iii physically participated in loading operation onboard container ship accordingly table 1 illustrates the profile details of marine experts 4 4 a real shipboard operation definition and task analysis to demonstrate the proposed approach a real shipboard loading operation was monitored the selected vessel of a prestigious and reliable container shipping company was instructed to berth at lisbon port in may 2020 the pilot embarked to the vessel at 07 00 h and the vessel was berthed at 08 10 h the operation commenced on the other day with the handling of lashing gearboxes by shore stevedores at 08 15 h the wind force was around 9 knots nm h as sw directional and sea state was smooth the sky was observed as cloudy the visibility was clear and the air temperature was 19 c in a word there was not any environmental obstacle hindering loading operation any other operation such as bunkering has not been carried out throughout the port time the loading operation commenced at 03 15 p m after the completion of discharge operation on may 2 the operation ceased approximately 2 h due to spreader failure till 05 05 p m and then the number of gangs was increased to 2 to continue loading operation as for specific containers that need more attention and meticulous check 8 dangerous cargoes with different imdg classes 3 units are imo class 5 1 2 units are imo class 3 1 unit is imo class 8 and 2 units are imo class 9 were loaded and reached 27 in total on board 16 reefer containers were loaded and plugged cautiously by the electrician similarly 4 oog containers were stowed and lashed gingerly the loading operation was completed at 11 15 a m and all finish time was recorded at 11 20 a m on may 3 the loading process consisted of 24 sub tasks that are illustrated in table 2 each sub task can be identified as a step that the responsible crew has to carry out attentively during the loading process onboard ship to complete loading operation without failure and any loss the relevant sub tasks must be carried out carefully and respectively 4 5 psf derivation in this study seven psf are adopted for the cargo loading operation onboard container ships as given in table 3 five psfs have been determined by the elicitation review team ert consisting of twenty four members the team s job functions are engineering fourteen members health and safety three members operations six members and administrative one member dimattia et al 2005 akyuz 2016 the rest of the psfs are fatigue and safety culture fatigue has a considerable influence on crew safety performance especially throughout the cargo operations due to requires intense work likewise the importance of an effective safety culture in preventing occupational accidents for the maritime industry is regularly highlighted by imo international maritime organization solmaz et al 2020 4 6 psf rating in light of the determined psfs the marine experts assigned a rating for each sub task between 1 and 9 on a linear scale that accurately reflects their judgements table 4 illustrates the calculated geometric means of each psf based on the marine experts assessments 4 7 psf weighting after having calculated the psfs rate the weighting process is conducted in order to enhance the accuracy of the outcome this process is carried out on the basis of the interval type 2 fuzzy linguistic scale developed by chen and lee 2008 each linguistic term being assigned by marine experts is illustrated in table 5 the linguistic variables are converted to the it2fss to transform the judgements of experts into one judgement after having calculated average it2fss values defuzzified it2fs values are attained based on equation 1 table 6 illustrates the it2fss crisp and normalised values of each psf 4 8 determination sli and calculating hep the slis for each sub task are calculated based on equation 7 where a and b are constant the constants are calculated from the slis having the highest and lowest values stojilijkovic and glisovic 2015 the higher calculated sli value describes the lower occurrence probability it means that the hep and the sli values are inversely correlated to each other the calculated sli values are transformed into heps in the next step of the slim approach the calibration equation 8 of slim that including logarithmic relationships is utilized to convert slis into heps table 7 illustrates the sli values and detailed results of hep calculations for sub tasks 1 1 to 1 5 and sub tasks 2 1 to 2 19 of loading operation onboard container ship meantime table 8 presents a basic sample calculation of hep for readers 5 findings and extended discussion in the light of the calculated hep values for each sub task of cargo loading operation the findings point out that success likelihood and safety performance of crew declines drastically towards the end of the operation process the overall average hep value for loading process onboard container ship is found as 5 93e 02 which is acceptable the graphical representation of hep values for each sub task is given in fig 3 additionally safety culture 0 171 experience 0 165 fatigue 0 165 and time limitation 0 158 are the critical psfs that highly influencing crew performance during the loading operation process the most contributory sub task 1 91e 01 to increase hep of the loading operation is 1 5 be aware of the risks of lashing operations on bays at which cargo operations continue the lashing operation is a crucial activity that should be meticulously carried out in compliance with cargo securing manual csm onboard ships besides its importance it is a complex and time consuming activity today a high volume of goods can be handled at once especially in significant container terminals of large ports however it is obvious that limited time at the port increases complexity for seafarers and makes them more prone to error indeed safety culture limited time and complexity are evaluated as dominant psfs by the marine experts for the related task in the study the responsible crew able seaman continue to carry out lashing on bays at which the loading operations continue with the worry of not completing the task in time although that lead to serious risks for human life accordingly the critical conditions relate to lashing operation should be emphasized by conducting safety meetings onboard ship all aspects of operational risks should be proactively identified being risk aware provides that a responsible person is potentially able to prevent error and subsequent consequences 2 14 check if the leakage containers onboard is another significant sub task 1 14e 01 to increase the overall hep of the loading operation cargo operation involves extensive activities that request responsible crew to perform different tasks and keep caution on the other issues at the same time sub task 2 14 might be ignored due to lack of experience and time whereas each container stowed should be kept under strict control throughout the operation if any leakage is identified the container should not be accepted onboard or should be discharged immediately after noticing the crew should be able to better recognize risks before they become issues therefore a detailed checklist to be followed during loading operation should be prepared to remind the further precautions to be taken fatigue training and safety culture are also observed to be influential psfs by the marine experts for sub task 2 14 a better understanding of factors underlying human errors will guide safety managers on the improvement of safety onboard likewise the hep value 7 45e 02 of sub task 2 17 inform the charterer and management office if the container is heavily damaged is rather high when considering the others in the loading operation process onboard container ship in case a heavily damaged container is observed the necessary warning should be made in time to take precautions earlier however some actions might be ignored due to increasing stress and panic besides financial and commercial concerns might arise accordingly stress experience and safety culture are identified as crucial psfs that force crew to make errors by marine experts for this sub task within ship management an effective safety culture provides high awareness of safety issues at all levels of cargo operations in this regard the management office s commitment to safety will determine the crew s attitudes towards the task barriers to effective action lack of risk communication and training tools that help improve risk awareness should be discussed with simultaneous involvement of crew safety inspectors and designated person ashore dpa to provide proactive solutions from a risk reduction standpoint a comprehensive risk analysis using state of the art techniques can help to determine the safety level of operation thereby the critical sub tasks with the highest hep values can be categorised into the high risk operational process demanding strict precautions and control unless the risk is not reduced to the desired level the risk reduction measures including all parameters should be reviewed again to enhance operational safety 6 conclusion ensuring the safety of life and maintaining operational reliability are the main goals of maritime authorities throughout maritime operations at this point human error prediction is a significant consideration especially in preventing marine casualties and loss of life this paper discusses the role of the human factor in a real time loading operation onboard a container ship and estimates occurrence probabilities of human oriented errors to achieve this purpose a hybrid approach integrating it2fss with slim is used since the maritime operations have potential risk for human life port facilities and the marine environment indeed the overall hep value is found to be rather high in the present study accordingly the results obtained are satisfactory and in the range of expectations sub task 1 5 be aware of the risks of lashing operations on bays at which cargo operations continue 2 14 check if the leakage containers onboard and 2 17 inform the charterer and management office if the container is heavily damaged are found as the primary actions where the hep values increased considerably maritime accidents can be reduced by a prudent consideration of human errors in view of the extended calculations it is obvious that the it2fs slim can effectively be applied for hep assessments moreover the proposed approach can be expanded to perform a comprehensive risk assessment by using other methods such as fta and eta within the fuzzy logic environment determining the risks associated with the most important vulnerabilities in the operational process will provide contributions to the ship management companies ship owners and safety managers for enhancing safety thus mitigation precautions might be properly taken for activities in which human error plays a critical role in the triggering of undesired events credit authorship contribution

20720,the human factor is regarded as one of the most significant topics for sustainable maritime transportation since increasing shipping activities can pose potential hazards to human life the environment and commodity the paper aims to assess the potential contribution of human errors in the maritime industry hence success likelihood index method slim was employed by incorporating interval

introduction maritime transportation is the lifeblood of the global economy since approximately 90 percent of global trading is carried out by vessels akyuz and celik 2018 although uncertainty remains an overriding issue in the current maritime transportation industry international maritime trade continues to expand day to day it is expected to expand with an annual growth rate of 3 5 percent over the next 5 years period unctad 2019 on the other hand maritime is one of the most dangerous industries all over the world and has a history of the considerable amount at disasters and tragic events because of involving wide ranges of hazardous operations accordingly seafarers are continuously exposed to a high level risk every day due to the nature of work aydin et al 2021a kuzu et al 2019 as a global standard setting authority international maritime organization imo 2020 insistently emphasized that at least 80 percent of shipping casualties are related to the human factor likewise human error he is found to be the primary cause of maritime transportation accidents in the maritime accidents investigation reports sarialioğlu et al 2020 harrald et al 1998 he should be taken into consideration as a focal point in the safe operations of maritime transportation in that the consequences of human errors can be rather devastating for the marine environment moreover the assessments of risk carried out separately from the seafarer s safety performance shall lead to insufficient detection in maritime accidents and incidents maritime safety researchers have been seeking proactive solutions to minimize risks and enhance safety level by the understanding of the human contribution to risk completely however konstandinidou et al 2006 evaluated the current methods as limited due to not represent all of the important aspects of human performance in the view of literature research although there are some applicable methods presented in terms of the human reliability assessments ung 2019 xi et al 2017 akyuz et al 2018 the researches predicting the likelihood of human error in critical shipboard operations are rather limited however hep assessments provide to identify and foresee the weaknesses in an operation in which human element leading to a failure aydin et al 2021b castiglia and giardina 2013 following this purpose some traditional techniques considering hep assessments have been utilized to determine the human error contribution to risk such as therp the technique for human error rate prediction martins and maturana 2010 slim success likelihood index

vagueness and inconsistency akyuz and celik 2016 to illustrate the therp can be applied to situations where there are limited data however the technique fails to choose psfs while considering the organizational factors pan and wu 2018 heart is the other approach that relies to a high extent on expert judgements the quantification process of heps is similar to the therp but the heart takes a further step to analyse tasks systematically however identifying the key sub tasks are quite difficult and vague spurgin 2009 the slim is a flexible approach deriving heps from context unlike therp slim relates context to human error nevertheless problems with the determination of the relative importance of psfs and lack of guidance in the choice of psfs are the cons for slim spurgin 2009 unless the expert elicitation process is carried out with care this article aims to investigate the safety performance of seafarers and to calculate hep occurring throughout the cargo operation onboard container ship determining human error contributions to operational risks shall be beneficial being as an early warning indicator because of increasing the awareness about vulnerabilities of the system for risk management in this context the paper presents a quantitative hybrid methodology integrating interval type 2 fuzzy sets it2fs with slim to predict human oriented errors in maritime transportation data scarcity is the motivation for utilising slim since it is heavily based on expert judgement in the process of the proposed it2fs slim approach the slim is capable of determining and quantifying performance shaping factors psfs that highly effective on human safety performance and calculating hep values accordingly the it2fs copes with the vagueness and ambiguity of the linguistic appointments of experts and increases the consistency in the decision making process to achieve this purpose the paper is organised as follows the motivation behind the study and comprehensive literature research about the hep assessments in the maritime industry are provided in this section because of the central role of slim and it2fs in the current work a brief literature review and the theoretical background are presented in section 2 the proposed approach and its integration are explained in detail in section 3 section 4 provides the exemplificative application of the proposed approach into a real time cargo loading operation on board container ship findings and extended discussion are included in section 5 the final section provides the conclusion and the contribution of research to maritime transportation 2 methods this section presents the theoretical background of the methods as well as a brief review of the literature 2 1 slim the slim is the first generation hra technique that was introduced by embrey et al 1984 the main goal of the method is to quantify and predict the hep occurring in specific tasks by focusing on relative factors islam et al 2016 called as psfs that have a considerable effect on human performance the slim commonly relies on the judgements of domain experts in the prediction of the hep process due to the scarce of data park and lee 2008 domain experts select a set of psfs and weight their perceived importance on a given task based on experience and knowledge it is paramount to derive systematic and appropriate psfs rather than all psfs in this context the selection of experts is the core point of the slim in conjunction with the quantification of psfs a success likelihood index sli is elicited utilising experts judgements akyuz 2016 the sli value can be calibrated with human error data to predict occurrence probability to acquire hep values the quantification process is divided into the following main steps in the slim approach i psf derivation ii psf rating iii psf weighting iv sli determination v hep calculation embrey et al 1984 2 2 interval type 2 fuzzy sets type 2 fuzzy logic as an extension of the concept of the conventional fuzzy logic was first introduced by zadeh 1975 the basic principle of systems is similar for both however the membership function of t1fs is crisp whilst the membership function of t2fs is fuzzy accordingly t2fs can express a higher degree of fuzziness besides t2fs copes with the uncertainties much better due to providing more various parameters by comparison with t1fs castillo and melin 2008 an interval type 2 fuzzy set can be defined as a special case of a generalised type 2 fuzzy set mendel 2001 proposed the interval type 2 fuzzy set as a model for words that express different meanings to different people to overcome the uncertainty demirel et al 2019 celik et al 2015 compared to generalised t2fs it2fs is rather proper for utilising in real case applications kahraman et al 2014 the data collected from linguistic expressions of experts are commonly subjective and have limitations in terms of representing the safety performance of humans completely in traditional hep approaches due to their reduced computational effort and feasibility akyuz and celik 2016 the it2fs can tackle complex conditions readily and reflects uncertainties better mendel 2007 after having briefly mentioned the it2fs and the t2fs the definitions of mathematical operations and step by step developments are presented in the following equations celik et al 2016 definition 1 a type 2 fuzzy set a in the universe of discourse x can be characterized by a type 2 membership function μ a x u where j x denotes an interval in 0 1 is shown as follows mendel et al 2006 a x u μ a x u x x u j x 0 1 0 μ a x u 1 the type 2 fuzzy set a is also represented as follows mendel et al 2006 when the elements of the fuzzy numbers are continuous a x x u j x μ a x u x u x x u j x μ a x u u x where j x 0 1 and denotes union over all admissible x and u definition 2 let a be a type 2 fuzzy set in the universe of discourse x represented by the type 2 membership function μ a x u if all μ a x u 1 then a is called as an interval type 2 fuzzy set and represented as follows castillo and melin 2008 mendel et al 2006 a x x u j x 1 x u x x u j x 1 u x where j x 0 1 definition 3 in this study a method using the it2fss for handling fuzzy multiple attribute group decision making problems is presented in the model the reference points and the heights of the upper and the lower membership functions of the it2fss are characterised as a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set as depicted in fig 1 mendel et al 2006 a trapezoidal interval type 2 fuzzy set a i a i u a i l a i 1 u a

approach it2fs slim this section presents how the it2fss and slim technique is integrated for predicting the probability of human error in maritime transportation the conceptual framework of the integration is depicted in fig 2 the proposed approach consists of eight steps and their brief explanations are as follows step 1 task analysis task analysis is the first step of the proposed method identifying the process tasks that to be carried out to achieve that hierarchical task analysis hta is performed to obtain hep for each task step 2 definition of operational environment this step expresses a real shipboard operation environment in the light of the various conditions such as physical working conditions time of day sea state weather conditions port facility instructions and operational limitations interruptions of operation failure related to port facilities ship the conditions are rather important and should be taken into consideration due to considerably affect human performance during carrying out of each task step 3 psf derivation the psfs such as experience knowledge training workload stress etc have a significant effect upon human performance and they are obtained by experts for each task step 4 psf rating each psf shall be rated by marine experts in this context a value from 1 to 9 in a liner scale is nominated if determined psf has a significant impact upon the relevant task value 1 is assigned by experts step 5 psf weighting each psf has relative importance upon tasks in comparison to others accordingly the nominated values for each psf shall differ from one expert to the other in the conventional slim the experts weigh the psfs subjectively to overcome the subjectivity and uncertainty of the expert judgements the it2fs is preferred in the weighting of psfs the it2fs converts the marine experts psf weighting into linguistic variables instead of a percentage value step 6 determination of sli after rating and weighting of psfs the sli value is calculated by using the equation 7 the sli is the essential tool for predicting the cases in which several human errors may occur 7 s l i i 1 n r i w i 0 s l i 1 in equation 7 n expresses the number of psfs r i represents the rating scale of psfs and w i represents the weight of the psfs relative importance step 7 hep calculation once the sli is calculated it then possible to calculate the hep values for each identified task in the operation the conversion of the sli values to hep is achieved by a logarithmic relationship the linear logarithmic function with base 10 log base 10 chien et al 1988 given in equation 8 is the foundational aspect of the slim process 8 l o g h e p a s l i b in the equation above a and b are the constants obtained from the heps for the sub tasks with the highest and lowest slis 4 prediction of human error probability in maritime transportation the case of cargo loading operation in a container ship a real time cargo handling operation on board container ship is select to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach since the loading operation has potential risks for ship crew life port facilities and marine environment 4 1 cargo loading operation in the container ship cargo operation requires effective teamwork to carry out loading and discharging safely and systematically the knowledge of the responsible deck team must be competent for proper cargo stowage and handling chief officer deck officer 2nd 3rd off bosun able seaman electrician for reefer containers and deck cadet are the integral parts of the watchkeeping team and shall monitor the loading operation according to bay plan as well as cargo plan the bay plan includes numerical coordinates of containers relating to bay row and tier that above and below the deck the complete loading operation consists of a couple of processes i pre arrival ii pre loading iii during loading iv after loading v pre departure in the current study the process of during loading iii on board container ship is handled in terms of human safety and ship cargo security the cargo operations became even more important today because the marine environment and eco system face considerable enormous problems in compliance with mandatory and non mandatory regulations of authorities to avoid omissions crucial items need to be checked by the watchkeeping team regularly throughout the operation under the supervision of the chief officer stowage plan ship stability values drafts gm bending moment torsion moment shearing force and trim specific containers such as imdg oh oog and reefers lashings of containers lashing gear visibility line and hatch covers demands great attention larson and pacino 2020 any stage and latest status of container loading operation are also noted to port logbook and ship s journal from time to time 4 2 problem statement loading operation consists of extensive activity that requires the responsible crew to relevant tasks and keeps a caution on other things at the same time on board ship however some factors may force the responsible crew to neglect significant activities which need exacting attention and check in the meantime any omissions lead to serious consequences to human life ship port facility and the marine environment nowadays a high volume of goods is handled on board ship at once in large ports with significant container terminal yu et al 2018 even though a shorter operation time at the port is a positive indicator of the level of port efficiency and quite desired case for ship owners a lot of pressure is put on the all responsible crew to handle the cargo operation efficiently in the face of growing risks in this sense crew performance plays a crucial role in preventing marine causalities and loss of life hence human error prediction is examined during the completion of specific tasks in loading operation onboard container ship to enhance safety performance and minimize potential environmental hazards 4 3 marine experts definition empirical studies and accident data sets are the ideal and optimum sources for human error prediction park and lee 2008 on the other hand the data in maritime transportation is rather limited due to commercial reasons to manage the aforementioned challenge the slim mostly employs the experts judgements in the decision making process since the method is practical for human error prediction the experts are supposed to have extensive knowledge and experience accordingly the following criteria are determinative to form an expert committee in the study i minimum oceangoing master capacity ii minimum 10 years of experience onboard container ship and iii physically participated in loading operation onboard container ship accordingly table 1 illustrates the profile details of marine experts 4 4 a real shipboard operation definition and task analysis to demonstrate the proposed approach a real shipboard loading operation was monitored the selected vessel of a prestigious and reliable container shipping company was instructed to berth at lisbon port in may 2020 the pilot embarked to the vessel at 07 00 h and the vessel was berthed at 08 10 h the operation commenced on the other day with the handling of lashing gearboxes by shore stevedores at 08 15 h the wind force was around 9 knots nm h as sw directional and sea state was smooth the sky was observed as cloudy the visibility was clear and the air temperature was 19 c in a word there was not any environmental obstacle hindering loading operation any other operation such as bunkering has not been carried out throughout the port time the loading operation commenced at 03 15 p m after the completion of discharge operation on may 2 the operation ceased approximately 2 h due to spreader failure till 05 05 p m and then the number of gangs was increased to 2 to continue loading operation as for specific containers that need more attention and meticulous check 8 dangerous cargoes with different imdg classes 3 units are imo class 5 1 2 units are imo class 3 1 unit is imo class 8 and 2 units are imo class 9 were loaded and reached 27 in total on board 16 reefer containers were loaded and plugged cautiously by the electrician similarly 4 oog containers were stowed and lashed gingerly the loading operation was completed at 11 15 a m and all finish time was recorded at 11 20 a m on may 3 the loading process consisted of 24 sub tasks that are illustrated in table 2 each sub task can be identified as a step that the responsible crew has to carry out attentively during the loading process onboard ship to complete loading operation without failure and any loss the relevant sub tasks must be carried out carefully and respectively 4 5 psf derivation in this study seven psf are adopted for the cargo loading operation onboard container ships as given in table 3 five psfs have been determined by the elicitation review team ert consisting of twenty four members the team s job functions are engineering fourteen members health and safety three members operations six members and administrative one member dimattia et al 2005 akyuz 2016 the rest of the psfs are fatigue and safety culture fatigue has a considerable influence on crew safety performance especially throughout the cargo operations due to requires intense work likewise the importance of an effective safety culture in preventing occupational accidents for the maritime industry is regularly highlighted by imo international maritime organization solmaz et al 2020 4 6 psf rating in light of the determined psfs the marine experts assigned a rating for each sub task between 1 and 9 on a linear scale that accurately reflects their judgements table 4 illustrates the calculated geometric means of each psf based on the marine experts assessments 4 7 psf weighting after having calculated the psfs rate the weighting process is conducted in order to enhance the accuracy of the outcome this process is carried out on the basis of the interval type 2 fuzzy linguistic scale developed by chen and lee 2008 each linguistic term being assigned by marine experts is illustrated in table 5 the linguistic variables are converted to the it2fss to transform the judgements of experts into one judgement after having calculated average it2fss values defuzzified it2fs values are attained based on equation 1 table 6 illustrates the it2fss crisp and normalised values of each psf 4 8 determination sli and calculating hep the slis for each sub task are calculated based on equation 7 where a and b are constant the constants are calculated from the slis having the highest and lowest values stojilijkovic and glisovic 2015 the higher calculated sli value describes the lower occurrence probability it means that the hep and the sli values are inversely correlated to each other the calculated sli values are transformed into heps in the next step of the slim approach the calibration equation 8 of slim that including logarithmic relationships is utilized to convert slis into heps table 7 illustrates the sli values and detailed results of hep calculations for sub tasks 1 1 to 1 5 and sub tasks 2 1 to 2 19 of loading operation onboard container ship meantime table 8 presents a basic sample calculation of hep for readers 5 findings and extended discussion in the light of the calculated hep values for each sub task of cargo loading operation the findings point out that success likelihood and safety performance of crew declines drastically towards the end of the operation process the overall average hep value for loading process onboard container ship is found as 5 93e 02 which is acceptable the graphical representation of hep values for each sub task is given in fig 3 additionally safety culture 0 171 experience 0 165 fatigue 0 165 and time limitation 0 158 are the critical psfs that highly influencing crew performance during the loading operation process the most contributory sub task 1 91e 01 to increase hep of the loading operation is 1 5 be aware of the risks of lashing operations on bays at which cargo operations continue the lashing operation is a crucial activity that should be meticulously carried out in compliance with cargo securing manual csm onboard ships besides its importance it is a complex and time consuming activity today a high volume of goods can be handled at once especially in significant container terminals of large ports however it is obvious that limited time at the port increases complexity for seafarers and makes them more prone to error indeed safety culture limited time and complexity are evaluated as dominant psfs by the marine experts for the related task in the study the responsible crew able seaman continue to carry out lashing on bays at which the loading operations continue with the worry of not completing the task in time although that lead to serious risks for human life accordingly the critical conditions relate to lashing operation should be emphasized by conducting safety meetings onboard ship all aspects of operational risks should be proactively identified being risk aware provides that a responsible person is potentially able to prevent error and subsequent consequences 2 14 check if the leakage containers onboard is another significant sub task 1 14e 01 to increase the overall hep of the loading operation cargo operation involves extensive activities that request responsible crew to perform different tasks and keep caution on the other issues at the same time sub task 2 14 might be ignored due to lack of experience and time whereas each container stowed should be kept under strict control throughout the operation if any leakage is identified the container should not be accepted onboard or should be discharged immediately after noticing the crew should be able to better recognize risks before they become issues therefore a detailed checklist to be followed during loading operation should be prepared to remind the further precautions to be taken fatigue training and safety culture are also observed to be influential psfs by the marine experts for sub task 2 14 a better understanding of factors underlying human errors will guide safety managers on the improvement of safety onboard likewise the hep value 7 45e 02 of sub task 2 17 inform the charterer and management office if the container is heavily damaged is rather high when considering the others in the loading operation process onboard container ship in case a heavily damaged container is observed the necessary warning should be made in time to take precautions earlier however some actions might be ignored due to increasing stress and panic besides financial and commercial concerns might arise accordingly stress experience and safety culture are identified as crucial psfs that force crew to make errors by marine experts for this sub task within ship management an effective safety culture provides high awareness of safety issues at all levels of cargo operations in this regard the management office s commitment to safety will determine the crew s attitudes towards the task barriers to effective action lack of risk communication and training tools that help improve risk awareness should be discussed with simultaneous involvement of crew safety inspectors and designated person ashore dpa to provide proactive solutions from a risk reduction standpoint a comprehensive risk analysis using state of the art techniques can help to determine the safety level of operation thereby the critical sub tasks with the highest hep values can be categorised into the high risk operational process demanding strict precautions and control unless the risk is not reduced to the desired level the risk reduction measures including all parameters should be reviewed again to enhance operational safety 6 conclusion ensuring the safety of life and maintaining operational reliability are the main goals of maritime authorities throughout maritime operations at this point human error prediction is a significant consideration especially in preventing marine casualties and loss of life this paper discusses the role of the human factor in a real time loading operation onboard a container ship and estimates occurrence probabilities of human oriented errors to achieve this purpose a hybrid approach integrating it2fss with slim is used since the maritime operations have potential risk for human life port facilities and the marine environment indeed the overall hep value is found to be rather high in the present study accordingly the results obtained are satisfactory and in the range of expectations sub task 1 5 be aware of the risks of lashing operations on bays at which cargo operations continue 2 14 check if the leakage containers onboard and 2 17 inform the charterer and management office if the container is heavily damaged are found as the primary actions where the hep values increased considerably maritime accidents can be reduced by a prudent consideration of human errors in view of the extended calculations it is obvious that the it2fs slim can effectively be applied for hep assessments moreover the proposed approach can be expanded to perform a comprehensive risk assessment by using other methods such as fta and eta within the fuzzy logic environment determining the risks associated with the most important vulnerabilities in the operational process will provide contributions to the ship management companies ship owners and safety managers for enhancing safety thus mitigation precautions might be properly taken for activities in which human error plays a critical role in the triggering of undesired events credit authorship contribution

20721,one of the concerns regarding numerical simulation of floating wind turbines fwts in waves is underprediction of resonant responses in the low frequency range in the present work the difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt subject to bichromatic waves are investigated by higher fidelity tools computational fluid dynamics cfd and simplified engineering tools based on potential flow theory with morison type drag the effects of mean pitch angle trim and the wave force distribution on the multimember semisubmersible are assessed compared to the cfd results wave loads estimated by engineering models are in good agreement at the wave frequencies while slightly larger differences occur at the surge and pitch natural frequencies the most significant underprediction of the surge force at the surge natural frequency occurs in the heave plate of the floater compared to the upright floater the increased wave loads on the trimmed floater at the surge natural frequency are more significant than those at the pitch natural frequency furthermore quadratic transfer functions qtfs are estimated based on the cfd model with a set of bichromatic wave cases a new approach is found to use the cfd results to modify the qtfs in lower fidelity engineering tools this approach is validated against experimental measurements in irregular waves good agreement is achieved between measured and numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads by engineering tools with modified qtfs keywords semi submersible floating wind turbine cfd potential flow theory difference frequency loads quadratic transfer functions 1 introduction floating wind turbines fwts can harness the energy from winds over deep water and farther offshore however this technology is still at an early stage of development well validated modelling tools are needed to capture highly nonlinear wave loads on the floater induced by the harsh environments and steep waves in this paper the focus is on a semi submersible fwt the international collaboration projects known as oc4 phase ⅱ and oc5 phase ⅱ verified and validated semi submersible fwt modelling tools through code to code and code to data comparisons larger differences between simulated loads motions and measurements were seen in the low frequency domain robertson et al 2014 2017 although the low frequency wave exciting loads are small these loads can result in large motions due to resonant responses in surge and pitch accurate estimation of difference frequency wave loads is therefore important for capturing global responses coulling et al 2013 other investigations bachynski et al 2016 berthelsen et al 2016 luan et al 2016 have similar findings as the oc4 projects the predictions of low frequency motions were very sensitive to the viscous drag coefficients on the columns and pontoons given that engineering tools based on first and second order potential flow theory with or without morison type drag limit hydrodynamic modelling to linear or weakly nonlinear models and generally underpredict the highly nonlinear difference frequency wave loads it is reasonable to consider higher fidelity modelling tools that account for the fully nonlinear terms of the navier stokes equations such as computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd has been shown to improve predictions of nonlinear wave loads and motions of semi submersible fwts such as capturing shadowing effects and transverse forces from vortex shedding and nonlinear phenomena in steep wave conditions benitz et al 2014 2015 hu et al 2014 liu and hu 2014 rivera arreba et al 2019 ideally one would like to carry out irregular wave simulations to study the difference frequency loads however the substantial computational time of cfd tools makes it difficult to carry out long simulations of irregular waves and cfd simulations of irregular waves may suffer from significant wave damping triggered by an increase in the viscosity around the air water interface devolder et al 2017 therefore bichromatic waves are applied to study the difference frequency wave loads and quadratic transfer functions qtfs in this paper modified qtfs based on the cfd results are validated against experimental results in irregular waves bichromatic waves have also been used to examine the difference frequency wave loads and motions of floating systems by other researchers pessoa and fonseca pessoa et al 2010 fonseca et al 2011 pessoa and fonseca 2015 investigated the slowly varying wave exciting forces and motions of a body with a simple geometry in bichromatic waves experimentally and numerically the numerical models were able to qualitatively represent the measured slowly varying forces namely the order of magnitude of the forces the tendencies along the mean wave period range and the increase with the decreasing water depth ohyama and hsu 1995 examined the slow sway motion of a rectangular body in response to bichromatic waves and found the second order approximation was applicable in a small amplitude range lopez pavon et al 2015 measured second order loads on a semi submersible fwt directly in biochromatic waves and found full qtfs instead of newman s approximation should be implemented for accurate estimation of difference frequency wave loads simos et al 2018 investigated the second order hydrodynamics of a semisubmersible fwt in bichromatic waves and the measured results matched well with the numerical estimations by qtfs the focus of present study which is inspired by the ongoing offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation and uncertainty oc6 project wang et al 2021 is on the investigation of nonlinear difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt subjected to bichromatic waves by cfd and engineering tools the bichromatic waves are generated by adding together two regular waves at different frequencies whose difference coincides with either the surge or pitch natural frequency of the fwt a trimmed floater is additionally modelled to examine the change of wave loads due to trim induced by the mean aerodynamic thrust force meanwhile wave loads on individual columns are extracted to better understand how the nonlinear wave loads change among the different components of semi submersible fwts in order to be able to use the cfd results in practical simulations the difference frequency wave loads from the bichromatic waves are used to modify the qtfs calculated using potential flow theory finally the modified qtfs in the engineering tools are validated by comparing the numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads in irregular waves against experimental measurements the experimental measurements of wave loads on the restrained semi submersible fwt are from phase ⅰ of the oc6 project robertson et al 2020 an irregular wave with significant wave height h s 7 1 m and peak period t p 12 1 s following the jonswap wave spectrum with peak enhancement factor equal to 3 3 is considered all data and results are given at full scale sections 2 and 3 describe the cfd and potential flow theory models respectively the approaches for estimating and modifying the qtfs are described in section 4 in section 5 comparisons of wave exciting loads on the upright and trimmed semi submersible fwt by cfd and engineering tools are shown first followed by the estimations and modifications of qtfs in bichromatic waves and the validations in irregular waves the conclusions are presented in sec 6 2 computational fluid dynamics cfd model the multiphase interfoam solver in openfoam weller et al 1998 is a fully nonlinear navier stokes volume of fluid vof solver which can accurately simulate complex free surface flows and fluid structure interaction extending the interfoam solver with the implementation of the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 generates the wavefoam solver used throughout the current work 2 1 governing equations the governing equations are the two phase incompressible rans equations consisting of a mass conservation and a momentum conservation equation

additional turbulent dynamic viscosity ρ ν t 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 μ e f f α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r ρ ν t where α is one for water zero for air and in between zero and one for all intermediate values the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the air water interface the volume fraction α is advanced in time once the velocity is found by eqs 1 and 2 following an advection equation eq 5 5 α t u i α x i u r i α 1 α x i 0 using a standard finite volume approximation for solving eq 5 will lead to significant smearing of the interface the last term on the left hand side of eq 5 is introduced as an interface compression term berberović et al 2009 it is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 to ensure the stability of the solution a multi dimensional flux limited scheme mules is applied to identify the free surface elevation the volume fraction α is integrated over a vertical line around the air water interface in the waves2foam package 2 2 turbulence model turbulent effects are incorporated in the governing equations by using different transport equations to calculate the turbulent kinematic viscosity the k ω sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 a blending of the k ω wilcox 1998 and the k ε launder and spalding 1983 models has shown good results for simulating two phase flow and predicting wave elevation rahman et al 2007 brown et al 2014 and is applied in this paper the equations for the incompressible k ω sst turbulence model for a single fluid in openfoam are given as 6 k t u j k x j x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k β ω k 7 ω k u j ω x j x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j γ ν t g β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and p k is the production term of k ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity and ω is the specific dissipation rate see menter et al 2003 for details in the present work in order to avoid excessive wave damping due to the increased viscosity around the air water interface devolder et al 2017 fan and anglart 2020 a modified wavefoam solver is built to explicitly consider the density in the incompressible k ω sst model fan and anglart 2020 2 3 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations of the navier stokes vof solver boundary conditions are imposed to all the surfaces in the numerical domain the general denomination of boundary surfaces is given in fig 1 the velocity and the α field at the inlet are given by the applied wave theory here second order bichromatic wave theory madsen and fuhrman 2006 is used the parameters of bichromatic waves are described in table 1 the pressure is specified as zero normal gradient at the inlet boundary k is fixed at zero and ω is set as 0 001 1 s at the outlet all the boundaries are specified as zero normal gradient on the floater surface a no slip boundary condition zero velocity is specified and the pressure is set as zero normal gradient k is fixed at 1e 5 m2 s2 and ω is set as 1 0 1 s for the atmosphere the total pressure is set as zero and an atmospheric boundary condition is set for the velocity and the α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in k is fixed at zero and ω is specified as zero normal gradient at the front back and bottom all the conditions are set as zero normal condition a continuous wall function based on spadling s law dudley brian 1961 switching between low and high reynolds numbers is implemented for the turbulent viscosity hence it requires that the non dimensional wall distance y should be between 10 and 300 for the modified wavefoam solver the bichromatic wave elevation will decrease at the end of simulation if a uniform turbulent viscosity is implemented different values of the turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω at the inlet and floater surface are applied to accurately simulate the flow around the floater while reducing the wave damping the bichromatic waves considered here are chosen such that the first order components are around the peak periods 12 1 s of the irregular wave event and the difference frequency aligns with either the surge s or pitch p natural frequency where the largest wave induced responses can be excited in irregular waves the desired wave amplitude approximately 1 75 m was selected such that the calculated maximum wave height when two waves are added linearly is close to the significant wave height of the irregular wave spectrum 7 1 m tom et al 2019 however for shorter wave periods the same wave amplitude results in steeper waves and increased viscosity around the air water interface as a result the generated wave elevation in the cfd simulation attenuates over the time to avoid excessive attenuation smaller wave heights are applied for the shorter wave periods 2 4 relaxation zones the relaxation zones blue part in fig 1 in the waves2foam toolbox jacobsen et al 2012 are implemented to avoid wave reflection from outlet boundary ⅱ and also to prevent internally reflected waves ⅰ rectangular relaxation zones are defined in this work see bruinsma s work 2018 for details 2 5 computational domain the floater at scale 1 50 was built in the cfd simulations based on the oc5 deepcwind floating wind system robertson et al 2016 the right handed coordinate system originates at the center of the main column at the still water line with positive x being in the direction of propagating waves and z being up as shown in fig 2 the width 3 72 m and water depth 3 6 m of the numerical wave tank are equal to those of the experimental facility the same length 36 m as one in the previous study li and bachynski 2021 is implemented to ensure the reflected waves are dissipated thoroughly in addition the height of the air regime is set to 1 m fig 2 shows the numerical wave tank and floater 2 6 spatial and temporal discretization openfoam is based on finite volume discretization the computational domain is discretized into finite regions in space known as cells the size of a cell in all the directions is 0 12 m after discretization thereafter for the wave generating regime and the floater surface the mesh is refined mesh convergence studies for different mesh levels with 0 001414 s time step table 2 were carried out by comparing the wave elevations and calculated wave loads at wave and difference frequencies for wave p5 the analytical solutions of wave are calculated from second order bichromatic wave theory marthinsen and winterstein 1992 the errors in wave elevations are shown relative to the analytical solutions while the wave loads are compared to those with the finest mesh size level 4 globally the 3 3 level of refinement with 4 4 refinement locally around the cross braces is applied in subsequent simulations in addition 25 cell layers adjacent to the floater surface are generated for the turbulence modelling the thickness of the first layer is 2 0 μm and its expansion ratio is 1 2 the local refinement allows for a high resolution interface while keeping the total number of computational cells around 17 million relatively low in order to ensure numerical stability the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is implemented to determine the time step different fixed time steps with the 3 3 level of mesh refinement are chosen to carry out the time step convergence study of the wave elevations and calculated wave loads for wave p5 and shown in table 3 all the results are obtained through the same method as the mesh convergence studies considering the computational time time step 3 is used in this work the wave loads at the limit of infinite temporal and spatial resolution are calculated based on the richardson extrapolation with the standard power law error estimator eça and hoekstra 2014 the resulting apparent order of convergence if found to be 2 the discretization uncertainty of wave loads is identified as the estimated discretization error multiplied by a suitable safety factor of 1 25 eça and hoekstra 2006 the total uncertainty of wave loads is calculated by combining the temporal and spatial discretization uncertainties in the root sum of squares fashion the uncertainty in the incident wave amplitude is defined as the discretization error of the selected mesh size and time step relative to the analytical solution the results are shown in table 4 the uncertainties in the difference frequency components tend to be much larger than those at the wave frequencies especially for the wave elevation 3 potential flow theory model a numerical model based on potential flow theory is built in sima simo riflex developed by sintef ocean sima is a state of the art time domain code that can address both the hydrodynamic loads simo marintek 2012 and the structural dynamic problem riflex ormberg and passano 2012 in a fully coupled way and has been used to study numerous types of floating wind turbines in present simulations only the floater of the wind turbine is modelled the frequency dependent hydrodynamic properties such as first order potential flow forces and qtfs are estimated based on potential flow theory wamit lee 1995 or modified based on the cfd simulations and subsequently input to sima the viscous forces on the columns and cross braces of the floater are considered by including the drag forces from morison s equation a constant transverse drag coefficient 0 744 based on towing tests robertson et al 2020 is applied for each component of the floater additionally the axial drag force for the heave plate is calculated based on eq 8 where d is the diameter of the heave plate and u is the axial wave velocity here the axial drag coefficient c d a 2 48 based on previous comparisons of a similar engineering tool with experimental data from the deepcwind test campaign robertson et al 2014 8 f d a 1 2 ρ c d a π d 2 4 u u in the potential flow theory model different force contributions are investigated as summarized in table 5 for simulations referred to as sima the generated nonlinear wave elevation from cfd is used as an input while simulations indicated as linear take a time series based on the first order bichromatic theory a simple linear super position of sine signals as input all simulations are carried out in the sima software in both cases when a wave signal is input into the sima software it is treated as a superposition of linear regular waves at different frequencies and all the components are assumed to travel in the positive x direction additionally the time series of bichromatic waves are input into sima software by a high pass filter with a 0 008 hz cut off frequency for all simulations in the current work the difference between sima and linear can be seen in the bottom subplot of fig 4 the comparisons of sima and linear models are used to investigate the effects of nonlinear wave component on the wave and difference frequency wave loads 4 qtf estimation and modification 4 1 analysis of the numerical data the harmonic components mean values and all first and second order harmonics of wave elevation and wave loads are identified by fitting a second order expansion model to the steady state part of the numerical time signal with a least squares procedure in bichromatic waves the wave elevations and wave loads are approximated by eq 9 components above the 2nd order are found to be negligible 9 ι t ι ι 1 c 1 cos ω 1 t ι 1 s 1 sin ω 1 t ι 2 c 1 cos ω 2 t ι 2 s 1 sin ω 2 t ι 1 c 2 cos 2 ω 1 t ι 1 s

and ω 1 ω 2 are the two incident wave frequencies each harmonic component is represented by a sum of cosine and sine parts thus allowing the identification of the phase the first order harmonics at the incident wave frequencies i 1 i 2 and the second order difference frequency component i are all computed in this way considering the computational time of cfd simulations the estimation of harmonic components of wave elevation and wave loads from eq 9 are calculated based on 10 min steady state simulations the estimated pitch moments in p5 from the cfd simulations at different time durations are compared in table 6 as shown the difference frequency wave loads based on 300 s are within 7 of the results after 600 s 4 2 estimation of the qtf the qtf values can be represented by a series of complex numbers a b i for ω 1 ω 2 and a b i for ω 1 ω 2 hence the difference frequency wave loads in bichromatic waves are approximated by 10 f d t f 12 t f 21 t re a 1 a 2 a b i e i ω 1 t ξ

using symmetry relations only the upper left half f 2 f 1 in the left subplot of fig 3 is considered when modifying the potential flow qtfs first based on the cfd simulations the surge force qtf and pitch moment qtf along the surge and pitch natural frequencies dashed line and dashed dotted line in the left subplot of fig 3 are obtained through the method presented in sec 4 2 next the magnitudes and phases of these qtfs and the qtfs estimated by potential flow theory wamit are separately interpolated to obtain values at denser sets of frequencies using an interval of 0 001 hz then the interpolated results from wamit along the surge and pitch natural frequencies are replaced with the interpolated results from cfd simulations to propagate the correction to other parts of the qtf the wamit magnitudes or phases with the same f 2 are extracted and corrected based on the results from cfd model there are two different cases 1 regions with only one value from cfd model f 2 0 082 hz or f 2 0 16 hz 2 regions with two values from cfd model 0 082 hz f 2 0 16 hz in case 1 the gradient is maintained to be the same before and after modification in case 2 the gradient is maintained outside of the surge and pitch natural frequencies f 1 f 2 0 032 hz or f 1 f 2 0 01 hz while the gradient varies linearly between surge and pitch natural frequencies f 2 0 032 hz f 1 0 01 hz an example is shown in the right subplot of fig 3 finally this modified qtf matrix is downsampled to an interval of 0 05 hz and implemented in the sima model 5 results 5 1 wave loads on the upright and trimmed semi submersible fwt in bichromatic waves first we examine the details of difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt in two bichromatic waves wave index s7 p5 the surge forces at the wave and surge natural frequencies in wave s7 are presented in sec 5 1 1 and the pitch moments at the wave and pitch natural frequencies in wave p5 are shown in sec 5 1 2 considering the existence of mean pitch angle for wind turbine during operation wave loads on a 5 trimmed floater are also included the floater is rotated 5 clockwise around point a shown in fig 2 the surge force along x axis and pitch moment around y axis are calculated in the same global coordinate system as the upright condition fig 2 5 1 1 bichromatic wave s7 the wave elevation for wave s7 in the cfd and sima models is shown in fig 4 no significant wave damping can be observed at the end of the cfd simulations a comparison of cfd and linear shows the interaction between two regular waves which leads to the peaks between 0 15 hz and 0 25 hz at frequencies such as f 1 f 2 or 2 f 1 or 2 f 2 the wave amplitudes at these sum frequencies are much smaller than the wave frequency amplitudes note the log scale in the psd the wave amplitudes at the wave frequencies agree with the analytical solution 1 5 m within 1 at the difference frequency the surge natural frequency the wave amplitude from the cfd model is 9 9 smaller than the second order analytical solution 0 0101 m as expected the wave amplitude of the first order bichromatic wave linear at the surge natural frequency is negligible 0 001 m the effect of the cut off frequency 0 008 hz is however visible in the psd of the linear wave elevation the total surge force on the upright floater from the cfd simulation is presented together with sima simulations in fig 5 there is a small numerical damping of the surge force caused by the large turbulent viscosity at the floater boundaries in the cfd simulation compared to the cfd simulations sima slightly underpredicts the surge forces at the wave frequencies within 1 2 smaller than the uncertainty of cfd results in the sima models the linear wave force transfer function dominates at the wave frequencies the surge forces at the surge natural frequency are mainly from the qtf sima2 and the integration of the morison drag forces to the linear free surface sima4 sima4 overpredicts the surge force at the surge natural frequency by 11 compared to the cfd estimations the axial drag forces on the heave plates have no effect on the surge forces sima4 vs sima5 the surge forces using the first order bichromatic wave linear are also shown in fig 5 a comparison of sima1 vs sima2 and linear1 vs linear2 shows that the force contributions from the qtf reduce the surge forces at the wave frequencies if the difference frequency between wave components at other frequencies fig 4 coincides with wave frequencies furthermore the contribution of difference frequency wave components via the linear wave force transfer function sima1 vs linear1 decreases the difference frequency surge force sima2 vs linear2 in addition linear models give the same conclusions as sima models fig 6 compares the surge forces on individual columns of the upright floater between sima and cfd simulations in these cases the qtf for each column is not included in sima results for each column the surge forces at the second wave frequency 0 1 hz are larger than the forces at the first wave frequency 0 09 hz which is opposite the results for total surge forces fig 5 this is due to the frequency dependent phase differences of surge forces on each column in addition all the numerical models predict similar results for the surge forces at the wave frequencies no matter for the upstream column or the starboard column although the diameter of lower part is twice than that of upper part the surge force on the upper part fx2 and fx4 is larger compared to the force on the lower part fx3 and fx5 at the wave frequencies that is because the wave acceleration decreases as one moves further downward the surge forces at the wave frequencies on the starboard column fx4 and fx5 are not significantly different from those on the upstream column fx2 and fx3 due to the lack of the qtf for each column the surge forces at the difference frequency in the sima simulations mainly come from the integration the morison drag force to the linear free surface compared to the cfd results one can observe that sima underpredicts the surge forces on each column at the surge natural frequency and larger underprediction occurs at the lower part of columns fx3 and fx5 in addition in the cfd simulations the surge forces at the surge natural frequency on the starboard column fx4 and fx5 are smaller than those on the upstream column fx2 and fx3 and a larger reduction 33 is found at the lower part of columns fx3 vs fx5 the surge forces on the trimmed and upright floaters are compared in fig 7 for the cfd simulations the surge forces on the trimmed floater at the wave frequencies increase by 4 compared to the upright condition in the sima4 model the linear wave force transfer function is dominant at the wave frequencies hence for the trimmed floater the increasing or decreasing surge forces at the wave peak frequencies mainly depend on the effect of the changed immersed geometry of the floater on the first order hydrodynamic properties the effect of axial drag forces is shown in sima5 of fig 7 as expected for the trimmed floater the axial drag forces on the heave plates have a component along the x axis which slightly increases the surge force to eliminate the effect of changed submerged volume comparisons between surge force amplitudes normalized by the mean displaced submerged volume v are shown in the right y axis of fig 7 a larger portion of the columns is under water after rotating the floater meanwhile the water particle acceleration at the same position on the columns decreases for the trimmed floater considering the changed volume the surge forces at the wave frequencies under trimmed condition decrease in all the numerical simulations an increased surge force at the surge natural frequency is seen for the trimmed condition compared to the cfd simulations the increases in the sima models are small in the sima simulations the axial drag forces on the heave plates have minor contributions to the surge force on the trimmed floater at the surge natural frequency sima4 vs sima5 considering small trimmed angle the difference frequency force in cfd increases more than the change in volume but this is not the case in the sima models for a trimmed floater the flow separation around the edge of heave plate is more significant and the morison drag force underestimates this effect this big difference also highlights that the accuracy of estimated difference frequency wave loads in the engineering tools is sensitive to the drag coefficients even a small change can result in a large variation for the drag coefficients 5 1 2 bichromatic wave p5 the wave simulations of wave p5 are compared in fig 8 like wave s7 no significant wave damping can be seen at the end of the cfd simulations and interaction between two regular waves is also observed cfd vs linear there is good agreement within 1 67 between the analytical solution and different numerical models at the wave frequencies the wave amplitude at the pitch natural frequency in the cfd model is 4 2 larger than the analytical solution of 0 0257 m the pitch moments on the upright floater estimated by the cfd model are compared with sima models in fig 9 like the surge force at the end of the cfd simulations the pitch moment slightly attenuates with time due to the increased turbulent viscosity at the boundaries of the floater compared to the cfd simulations all the sima models predict similar pitch moments at the wave frequencies within 2 6 smaller than the uncertainty of cfd results and pitch natural frequency within 3 6 except for a large underprediction of pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency using sima1 model both in the sima and linear models the linear wave force transfer function is dominant at the wave frequencies meanwhile the axial drag forces on the heave plates sima5 and linear5 increase the pitch moments at the wave frequencies the pitch moment from the qtf sima2 and linear2 dominates at the pitch natural frequency the effect of difference frequency wave components on the difference frequency pitch moment is minor sima2 vs linear2 other force contributions have minor influence at the pitch natural frequency the numerically estimated pitch moments on the upright and trimmed floater are compared in fig 10 for the cfd simulations the pitch moment on the trimmed floater increases by about 11 at the first wave frequency 0 08 hz but decreases slightly 0 15 at the second wave frequency 0 112 hz compared to the moments on the upright floater in the sima4 simulations for the trimmed floater an increasing moment 8 8 occurs at the first wave frequency and a reduction of moment 4 5 appears at the second wave frequency all the variations at the wave frequencies are due to the changed frequency dependent hydrodynamic properties of the floater combining the exact values in fig 9 and ratios in fig 10 pitch moments on the trimmed floaters slightly increase both at the first and second wave frequency compared to the upright floater when considering the axial drag forces on the heave plate sima5 like the surge forces the effect of changed volume is removed in the comparison of pitch moments shown in the right y axis of fig 10 consideration of changed volume leads to a decreasing pitch moment at the second wave frequency under trimmed condition and has minor influence at the first wave frequency in all the numerical simulations the pitch moment on the trimmed floater at the pitch natural frequency increases by 1 7 for the cfd model compared to the one under upright condition in sima models the effect of 5 mean pitch angle on the pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency is not significant this is mainly caused by the small change in the contribution from the qtf which is shown in table 7 like the upright condition the axial drag forces on the heave plates sima5 have minor contributions at the pitch natural frequency furthermore the increase in the pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency is smaller than the increase in the submerged volume 5 2 comparisons and modifications of qtfs in bichromatic waves as shown in table 1 24 sets of bichromatic waves were selected to calculate the qtfs of a restrained upright semi submersible fwt and modify the qtfs from potential flow theory the qtfs before modification are presented in sec 5 2 1 while modifications are presented in sec 5 2 2 and the validations in an irregular wave are shown in sec 5 3 5 2 1 initial qtf comparisons using the approach from sec 4 2 the magnitudes of surge force and pitch moment qtfs are calculated based on different numerical models and presented in fig 11 cfd and sima5 model agree well at the lower wave frequencies while the cfd model predicts larger difference frequency wave loads at higher wave frequencies the contributions of the difference frequency wave by linear wave force transfer function sima1 are negligible in the low frequency range except for the surge forces at the pitch natural frequency for the surge forces at the surge natural frequency the contributions of morison drag forces differences between sima2 and sima5 decrease with increasing wave frequencies while the influences of morison drag forces on the surge forces at the pitch natural frequency are not significant in addition the pitch moments from the qtfs sima2 vs sima5 dominate in the low frequency range in the sima model 5 2 2 qtf modification prior to following the modification procedure from sec 4 3 several effects must be treated specially in the sima model viscous effects are considered by a morison type load model furthermore the difference frequency wave components from treating the cfd generated wave elevation as linear also contribute to the difference frequency wave loads through the linear wave force transfer function hence these two effects are removed from the qtfs estimated from cfd simulations the cfd results after subtracting these effects are referred to as new qtf old qtf is the qtfs estimated in wamit assuming that the morison model captures the viscous effects up to third order and that even higher order effects are small the new qtfs are directly applied in the validation against the irregular wave section 5 3 even though the wave height in the bichromatic wave conditions table 1 differs from the wave height in the irregular wave spectrum 7 1 m the magnitudes and phases of surge force and pitch moment qtfs estimated based on the cfd results are compared with the potential flow theory calculations in fig 12 at the lower wave frequencies generally 0 1 hz there is little discrepancy between cfd and potential flow theory in predicting the magnitudes of surge force and pitch moment qtfs however a larger difference is observed at higher wave frequencies generally 0 1 hz with the cfd model giving larger magnitudes for the phase of surge force and pitch moment qtfs the cfd model gives approximately the opposite phase compared to the potential flow theory which illustrates the limitation of the engineering tools in accurately estimating the phase of difference frequency wave loads this large discrepancy cannot be captured by tuning the morison drag term which simply changes the results 90 out of phase the magnitudes and phases of modified surge force qtfs in the low frequency range are presented together with the qtfs from potential flow theory in fig 13 close to the surge natural frequency the new qtfs have smaller magnitudes for lower incident wave frequencies 0 05 0 09 hz for higher incident wave frequencies the new qtfs have higher magnitudes furthermore for low incident wave frequencies the phase is approximately opposite compared to the phase of qtfs from potential flow theory the comparisons of pitch moment qtfs in the low frequency range are presented in fig 14 compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory the modified qtfs have similar shape and magnitude except for the larger values at the higher wave frequencies like the surge force qtfs the modified pitch moment qtfs have almost opposite phases compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory furthermore the modified qtfs have a bigger gradient in the phase around the mean drift moment diagonal the phase of qtfs from potential flow theory has a local peak trough around the pitch natural frequency however this local peak trough is transferred to the regions between surge and pitch natural frequencies in the modified qtfs due to the approach applied in the qtf modification to check the implementation of the qtf modification the difference frequency wave loads predicted by the sima model with modified qtfs sima6 in bichromatic waves are compared against the cfd results in fig 15 the difference frequency wave loads estimated by the sima model with modified qtfs sima6 are as expected close to the cfd results there is a better agreement among different numerical models at the surge natural frequency compared to the results at the pitch natural frequency in the current study the bichromatic waves are chosen such that the difference corresponds to the surge or pitch natural frequency hence there is a lack of cfd results in the upper left and lower right corners of qtf matrix fig 3 which leads to a slightly larger difference at the pitch natural frequency the largest difference occurs when estimating the wave loads at the pitch natural frequency with the maximum first wave frequency 0 15 hz here the second wave frequency is 0 182 hz close to the maximum frequency 0 185 hz in the qtfs from wamit the uncorrected data between 0 182 hz and 0 185 hz can explain the difference overall around the peak frequencies of the irregular wave in sec 5 3 0 083 hz the numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads by sima model with modified qtfs agree well with cfd results 5 3 validation of modified qtfs against experimental data in this part the experimentally measured wave elevation at the origin is input into sima software by a high pass filter with a 0 008 hz cut off frequency in order to assess the capability of modified qtfs in estimating the difference frequency wave loads a response metric referred to psd sum is adopted in the current study based on work from robertson et al 2020 the psd sum is an integration of the force or moment spectrum in the low frequency range the frequency limits for the integration are 0 005 0 05 hz the numerically estimated difference frequency surge forces in sima model with modified qtfs sima6 and qtfs from wamit sima5 are compared against experimental measurements in fig 16 compared to the results with qtfs from wamit the difference frequency surge force estimated by the modified qtfs agrees better with the experiment data however around the surge natural frequency the modified qtfs still underpredict the wave loads as shown in the right subplot of fig 16 the difference frequency surge force psd sums are calculated for both experimental and numerical results the improvement using the modified qtfs is significant the underestimation of the psd sum is reduced to 2 34 for modified qtfs from 55 07 for the qtfs from wamit this validation also indicates that the cfd model can give better estimation of difference frequency surge forces but has limitations in capturing the surge forces at even lower frequencies the numerically estimated difference frequency pitch moments are compared against experimental measurements in fig 17 like the modified surge force qtfs there is a better agreement of difference frequency pitch moment between experiment and sima model with the modified qtfs sima6 compared to the experimental results the difference frequency pitch moment psd sum with modified qtfs is 11 91 smaller while the result with the qtfs from wamit is 42 71 smaller overall one can conclude that the sima with modified qtfs sima6 can better capture difference frequency wave loads than the qtfs from potential flow theory this also demonstrates the advantages of the cfd model in capturing the nonlinear difference frequency wave loads the more cfd simulations at different sets of frequencies are carried out the more accurate the modified qtfs are and the better the difference frequency wave loads are captured by sima models with modified qtfs 5 conclusions in the current work two numerical models are used to study the nonlinear difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt in bichromatic waves a cfd model and a potential flow theory model with morison type drag sima furthermore the results from cfd model are used to modify the qtfs from potential flow theory and the resulting model is validated against experimental data in an irregular wave the wave loads from cfd and the potential flow model are in good agreement at the wave frequencies in the sima model the difference frequency surge force at the surge natural frequency is mainly from the integration of morison drag force to the linear free surface this contribution decreases with increasing wave frequencies and the surge force from qtfs becomes dominant at the pitch natural frequency the pitch moment from qtfs is dominant in addition the axial drag forces on the heave plates only increase the pitch moment at the wave frequencies and have minor contributions to the difference frequency wave loads in order to better understand the effects of the multimember arrangement of the semi submersible floater surge forces on each column are extracted compared to the cfd results sima underpredicts the difference frequency surge forces on each column and a larger underprediction is seen at the lower part of the columns in addition in the cfd simulations the surge forces at the surge natural frequency on the starboard column are smaller than those on the upstream column and a larger reduction is found at the lower part of columns the effects of 5 mean pitch angle during wind turbine operation on the difference frequency wave loads are also investigated the wave loads are calculated based on the global coordinate system used in upright condition the variations at the wave frequencies are mostly due to the changed immersed geometry and correspondingly changed first order hydrodynamic properties of the floater at the surge natural frequency there is an increase in surge force in both cfd and the potential flow model but the increase in the cfd model is more significant the pitch moments under the trimmed condition are not significantly changed compared to the upright floater however the effects of trim on the motions and loads in the mooring system of fwts are of still interest in the future research when modifying the qtfs based on cfd simulations larger modifications in the magnitude are seen to be required at higher wave frequencies interestingly the cfd model gives approximately the opposite phase compared to the original potential flow results the modification of the qtfs is verified by checking that difference frequency wave loads estimated by the sima model with modified qtfs are close to the cfd results in bichromatic waves the approach is then compared to experimental measurements of difference frequency wave loads in an irregular wave the modified qtfs significantly reduce under prediction of difference frequency wave loads compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory credit authorship contribution statement haoran li conceptualization methodology software validation

20721,one of the concerns regarding numerical simulation of floating wind turbines fwts in waves is underprediction of resonant responses in the low frequency range in the present work the difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt subject to bichromatic waves are investigated by higher fidelity tools computational fluid dynamics cfd and simplified engineering tools based on potential flow theory with morison type drag the effects of mean pitch angle trim and the wave force distribution on the multimember semisubmersible are assessed compared to the cfd results wave loads estimated by engineering models are in good agreement at the wave frequencies while slightly larger differences occur at the surge and pitch natural frequencies the most significant underprediction of the surge force at the surge natural frequency occurs in the heave plate of the floater compared to the upright floater the increased wave loads on the trimmed floater at the surge natural frequency are more significant than those at the pitch natural frequency furthermore quadratic transfer functions qtfs are estimated based on the cfd model with a set of bichromatic wave cases a new approach is found to use the cfd results to modify the qtfs in lower fidelity engineering tools this approach is validated against experimental measurements in irregular waves good agreement is achieved between measured and numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads by engineering tools with modified qtfs keywords semi submersible floating wind turbine cfd potential flow theory difference frequency loads quadratic transfer functions 1 introduction floating wind turbines fwts can harness the energy from winds over deep water and farther offshore however this technology is still at an early stage of development well validated modelling tools are needed to capture highly nonlinear wave loads on the floater induced by the harsh environments and steep waves in this paper the focus is on a semi submersible fwt the international collaboration projects known as oc4 phase ⅱ and oc5 phase ⅱ verified and validated semi submersible fwt modelling tools through code to code and code to data comparisons larger differences between simulated loads motions and measurements were seen in the low frequency domain robertson et al 2014 2017 although the low frequency wave exciting loads are small these loads can result in large motions due to resonant responses in surge and pitch accurate estimation of difference frequency wave loads is therefore important for capturing global responses coulling et al 2013 other investigations bachynski et al 2016 berthelsen et al 2016 luan et al 2016 have similar findings as the oc4 projects the predictions of low frequency motions were very sensitive to the viscous drag coefficients on the columns and pontoons given that engineering tools based on first and second order potential flow theory with or without morison type drag limit hydrodynamic modelling to linear or weakly nonlinear models and generally underpredict the highly nonlinear difference frequency wave loads it is reasonable to consider higher fidelity modelling tools that account for the fully nonlinear terms of the navier stokes equations such as computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd has been shown to improve predictions of nonlinear wave loads and motions of semi submersible fwts such as capturing shadowing effects and transverse forces from vortex shedding and nonlinear phenomena in steep wave conditions benitz et al 2014 2015 hu et al 2014 liu and hu 2014 rivera arreba et al 2019 ideally one would like to carry out irregular wave simulations to study the difference frequency loads however the substantial computational time of cfd tools makes it difficult to carry out long simulations of irregular waves and cfd simulations of irregular waves may suffer from significant wave damping triggered by an increase in the viscosity around the air water interface devolder et al 2017 therefore bichromatic waves are applied to study the difference frequency wave loads and quadratic transfer functions qtfs in this paper modified qtfs based on the cfd results are validated against experimental results in irregular waves bichromatic waves have also been used to examine the difference frequency wave loads and motions of floating systems by other researchers pessoa and fonseca pessoa et al 2010 fonseca et al 2011 pessoa and fonseca 2015 investigated the slowly varying wave exciting forces and motions of a body with a simple geometry in bichromatic waves experimentally and numerically the numerical models were able to qualitatively represent the measured slowly varying forces namely the order of magnitude of the forces the tendencies along the mean wave period range and the increase with the decreasing water depth ohyama and hsu 1995 examined the slow sway motion of a rectangular body in response to bichromatic waves and found the second order approximation was applicable in a small amplitude range lopez pavon et al 2015 measured second order loads on a semi submersible fwt directly in biochromatic waves and found full qtfs instead of newman s approximation should be implemented for accurate estimation of difference frequency wave loads simos et al 2018 investigated the second order hydrodynamics of a semisubmersible fwt in bichromatic waves and the measured results matched well with the numerical estimations by qtfs the focus of present study which is inspired by the ongoing offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation and uncertainty oc6 project wang et al 2021 is on the investigation of nonlinear difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt subjected to bichromatic waves by cfd and engineering tools the bichromatic waves are generated by adding together two regular waves at different frequencies whose difference coincides with either the surge or pitch natural frequency of the fwt a trimmed floater is additionally modelled to examine the change of wave loads due to trim induced by the mean aerodynamic thrust force meanwhile wave loads on individual columns are extracted to better understand how the nonlinear wave loads change among the different components of semi submersible fwts in order to be able to use the cfd results in practical simulations the difference frequency wave loads from the bichromatic waves are used to modify the qtfs calculated using potential flow theory finally the modified qtfs in the engineering tools are validated by comparing the numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads in irregular waves against experimental measurements the experimental measurements of wave loads on the restrained semi submersible fwt are from phase ⅰ of the oc6 project robertson et al 2020 an irregular wave with significant wave height h s 7 1 m and peak period t p 12 1 s following the jonswap wave spectrum with peak enhancement factor equal to 3 3 is considered all data and results are given at full scale sections 2 and 3 describe the cfd and potential flow theory models respectively the approaches for estimating and modifying the qtfs are described in section 4 in section 5 comparisons of wave exciting loads on the upright and trimmed semi submersible fwt by cfd and engineering tools are shown first followed by the estimations and modifications of qtfs in bichromatic waves and the validations in irregular waves the conclusions are presented in sec 6 2 computational fluid dynamics cfd model the multiphase interfoam solver in openfoam weller et al 1998 is a fully nonlinear navier stokes volume of fluid vof solver which can accurately simulate complex free surface flows and fluid structure interaction extending the interfoam solver with the implementation of the wave generation and absorption toolbox waves2foam developed by jacobsen et al 2012 generates the wavefoam solver used throughout the current work 2 1 governing equations the governing equations are the two phase incompressible rans equations consisting of a mass conservation and a momentum conservation equation for an incompressible flow of air and water expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u j u i x j p x i f b i x j μ e f f u i x j where u i i x y z are the fluid velocity in cartesian coordinates ρ is the fluid density p is pressure in excess of the hydrostatic pressure f b is an external body force including gravity and μ e f f is the effective dynamic viscosity furthermore in the vof method the local density ρ within a computational cell is given by water volume fraction α the effective dynamic viscosity μ e f f is calculated by combining a weighted value based on the volume fraction α with the additional turbulent dynamic viscosity ρ ν t 3 ρ α ρ w a t e r 1 α ρ a i r 4 μ e f f α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r ρ ν t where α is one for water zero for air and in between zero and one for all intermediate values the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 is used to track the air water interface the volume fraction α is advanced in time once the velocity is found by eqs 1 and 2 following an advection equation eq 5 5 α t u i α x i u r i α 1 α x i 0 using a standard finite volume approximation for solving eq 5 will lead to significant smearing of the interface the last term on the left hand side of eq 5 is introduced as an interface compression term berberović et al 2009 it is only active in the vicinity of the interface 0 α 1 to ensure the stability of the solution a multi dimensional flux limited scheme mules is applied to identify the free surface elevation the volume fraction α is integrated over a vertical line around the air water interface in the waves2foam package 2 2 turbulence model turbulent effects are incorporated in the governing equations by using different transport equations to calculate the turbulent kinematic viscosity the k ω sst turbulence model menter et al 2003 a blending of the k ω wilcox 1998 and the k ε launder and spalding 1983 models has shown good results for simulating two phase flow and predicting wave elevation rahman et al 2007 brown et al 2014 and is applied in this paper the equations for the incompressible k ω sst turbulence model for a single fluid in openfoam are given as 6 k t u j k x j x j ν σ k ν t k x j p k β ω k 7 ω k u j ω x j x j ν σ ω ν t ω x j γ ν t g β ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and p k is the production term of k ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent kinematic viscosity and ω is the specific dissipation rate see menter et al 2003 for details in the present work in order to avoid excessive wave damping due to the increased viscosity around the air water interface devolder et al 2017 fan and anglart 2020 a modified wavefoam solver is built to explicitly consider the density in the incompressible k ω sst model fan and anglart 2020 2 3 boundary conditions to solve the governing equations of the navier stokes vof solver boundary conditions are imposed to all the surfaces in the numerical domain the general denomination of boundary surfaces is given in fig 1 the velocity and the α field at the inlet are given by the applied wave theory here second order bichromatic wave theory madsen and fuhrman 2006 is used the parameters of bichromatic waves are described in table 1 the pressure is specified as zero normal gradient at the inlet boundary k is fixed at zero and ω is set as 0 001 1 s at the outlet all the boundaries are specified as zero normal gradient on the floater surface a no slip boundary condition zero velocity is specified and the pressure is set as zero normal gradient k is fixed at 1e 5 m2 s2 and ω is set as 1 0 1 s for the atmosphere the total pressure is set as zero and an atmospheric boundary condition is set for the velocity and the α field this means that air and water are allowed to leave the numerical domain while only air is allowed to flow back in k is fixed at zero and ω is specified as zero normal gradient at the front back and bottom all the conditions are set as zero normal condition a continuous wall function based on spadling s law dudley brian 1961 switching between low and high reynolds numbers is implemented for the turbulent viscosity hence it requires that the non dimensional wall distance y should be between 10 and 300 for the modified wavefoam solver the bichromatic wave elevation will decrease at the end of simulation if a uniform turbulent viscosity is implemented different values of the turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω at the inlet and floater surface are applied to accurately simulate the flow around the floater while reducing the wave damping the bichromatic waves considered here are chosen such that the first order components are around the peak periods 12 1 s of the irregular wave event and the difference frequency aligns with either the surge s or pitch p natural frequency where the largest wave induced responses can be excited in irregular waves the desired wave amplitude approximately 1 75 m was selected such that the calculated maximum wave height when two waves are added linearly is close to the significant wave height of the irregular wave spectrum 7 1 m tom et al 2019 however for shorter wave periods the same wave amplitude results in steeper waves and increased viscosity around the air water interface as a result the generated wave elevation in the cfd simulation attenuates over the time to avoid excessive attenuation smaller wave heights are applied for the shorter wave periods 2 4 relaxation zones the relaxation zones blue part in fig 1 in the waves2foam toolbox jacobsen et al 2012 are implemented to avoid wave reflection from outlet boundary ⅱ and also to prevent internally reflected waves ⅰ rectangular relaxation zones are defined in this work see bruinsma s work 2018 for details 2 5 computational domain the floater at scale 1 50 was built in the cfd simulations based on the oc5 deepcwind floating wind system robertson et al 2016 the right handed coordinate system originates at the center of the main column at the still water line with positive x being in the direction of propagating waves and z being up as shown in fig 2 the width 3 72 m and water depth 3 6 m of the numerical wave tank are equal to those of the experimental facility the same length 36 m as one in the previous study li and bachynski 2021 is implemented to ensure the reflected waves are dissipated thoroughly in addition the height of the air regime is set to 1 m fig 2 shows the numerical wave tank and floater 2 6 spatial and temporal discretization openfoam is based on finite volume discretization the computational domain is discretized into finite regions in space known as cells the size of a cell in all the directions is 0 12 m after discretization thereafter for the wave generating regime and the floater surface the mesh is refined mesh convergence studies for different mesh levels with 0 001414 s time step table 2 were carried out by comparing the wave elevations and calculated wave loads at wave and difference frequencies for wave p5 the analytical solutions of wave are calculated from second order bichromatic wave theory marthinsen and winterstein 1992 the errors in wave elevations are shown relative to the analytical solutions while the wave loads are compared to those with the finest mesh size level 4 globally the 3 3 level of refinement with 4 4 refinement locally around the cross braces is applied in subsequent simulations in addition 25 cell layers adjacent to the floater surface are generated for the turbulence modelling the thickness of the first layer is 2 0 μm and its expansion ratio is 1 2 the local refinement allows for a high resolution interface while keeping the total number of computational cells around 17 million relatively low in order to ensure numerical stability the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is implemented to determine the time step different fixed time steps with the 3 3 level of mesh refinement are chosen to carry out the time step convergence study of the wave elevations and calculated wave loads for wave p5 and shown in table 3 all the results are obtained through the same method as the mesh convergence studies considering the computational time time step 3 is used in this work the wave loads at the limit of infinite temporal and spatial resolution are calculated based on the richardson extrapolation with the standard power law error estimator eça and hoekstra 2014 the resulting apparent order of convergence if found to be 2 the discretization uncertainty of wave loads is identified as the estimated discretization error multiplied by a suitable safety factor of 1 25 eça and hoekstra 2006 the total uncertainty of wave loads is calculated by combining the temporal and spatial discretization uncertainties in the root sum of squares fashion the uncertainty in the incident wave amplitude is defined as the discretization error of the selected mesh size and time step relative to the analytical solution the results are shown in table 4 the uncertainties in the difference frequency components tend to be much larger than those at the wave frequencies especially for the wave elevation 3 potential flow theory model a numerical model based on potential flow theory is built in sima simo riflex developed by sintef ocean sima is a state of the art time domain code that can address both the hydrodynamic loads simo marintek 2012 and the structural dynamic problem riflex ormberg and passano 2012 in a fully coupled way and has been used to study numerous types of floating wind turbines in present simulations only the floater of the wind turbine is modelled the frequency dependent hydrodynamic properties such as first order potential flow forces and qtfs are estimated based on potential flow theory wamit lee 1995 or modified based on the cfd simulations and subsequently input to sima the viscous forces on the columns and cross braces of the floater are considered by including the drag forces from morison s equation a constant transverse drag coefficient 0 744 based on towing tests robertson et al 2020 is applied for each component of the floater additionally the axial drag force for the heave plate is calculated based on eq 8 where d is the diameter of the heave plate and u is the axial wave velocity here the axial drag coefficient c d a 2 48 based on previous comparisons of a similar engineering tool with experimental data from the deepcwind test campaign robertson et al 2014 8 f d a 1 2 ρ c d a π d 2 4 u u in the potential flow theory model different force contributions are investigated as summarized in table 5 for simulations referred to as sima the generated nonlinear wave elevation from cfd is used as an input while simulations indicated as linear take a time series based on the first order bichromatic theory a simple linear super position of sine signals as input all simulations are carried out in the sima software in both cases when a wave signal is input into the sima software it is treated as a superposition of linear regular waves at different frequencies and all the components are assumed to travel in the positive x direction additionally the time series of bichromatic waves are input into sima software by a high pass filter with a 0 008 hz cut off frequency for all simulations in the current work the difference between sima and linear can be seen in the bottom subplot of fig 4 the comparisons of sima and linear models are used to investigate the effects of nonlinear wave component on the wave and difference frequency wave loads 4 qtf estimation and modification 4 1 analysis of the numerical data the harmonic components mean values and all first and second order harmonics of wave elevation and wave loads are identified by fitting a second order expansion model to the steady state part of the numerical time signal with a least squares procedure in bichromatic waves the wave elevations and wave loads are approximated by eq 9 components above the 2nd order are found to be negligible 9 ι t ι ι 1 c 1 cos ω 1 t ι 1 s 1 sin ω 1 t ι 2 c 1 cos ω 2 t ι 2 s 1 sin ω 2 t ι 1 c 2 cos 2 ω 1 t ι 1 s

and ω 1 ω 2 are the two incident wave frequencies each harmonic component is represented by a sum of cosine and sine parts thus allowing the identification of the phase the first order harmonics at the incident wave frequencies i 1 i 2 and the second order difference frequency component i are all computed in this way considering the computational time of cfd simulations the estimation of harmonic components of wave elevation and wave loads from eq 9 are calculated based on 10 min steady state simulations the estimated pitch moments in p5 from the cfd simulations at different time durations are compared in table 6 as shown the difference frequency wave loads based on 300 s are within 7 of the results after 600 s 4 2 estimation of the qtf the qtf values can be represented by a series of complex numbers a b i for ω 1 ω 2 and a b i for ω 1 ω 2 hence the difference frequency wave loads in bichromatic waves are approximated by 10 f d t f 12 t f 21 t re a 1 a 2 a b i e i ω 1 t ξ

amplitudes frequencies and phases which can be calculated by eq 9 given the cosine f d c and sine f d s parts of second order difference frequency wave loads from eq 9 the real a and imaginary b parts

using symmetry relations only the upper left half f 2 f 1 in the left subplot of fig 3 is considered when modifying the potential flow qtfs first based on the cfd simulations the surge force qtf and pitch moment qtf along the surge and pitch natural frequencies dashed line and dashed dotted line in the left subplot of fig 3 are obtained through the method presented in sec 4 2 next the magnitudes and phases of these qtfs and the qtfs estimated by potential flow theory wamit are separately interpolated to obtain values at denser sets of frequencies using an interval of 0 001 hz then the interpolated results from wamit along the surge and pitch natural frequencies are replaced with the interpolated results from cfd simulations to propagate the correction to other parts of the qtf the wamit magnitudes or phases with the same f 2 are extracted and corrected based on the results from cfd model there are two different cases 1 regions with only one value from cfd model f 2 0 082 hz or f 2 0 16 hz 2 regions with two values from cfd model 0 082 hz f 2 0 16 hz in case 1 the gradient is maintained to be the same before and after modification in case 2 the gradient is maintained outside of the surge and pitch natural frequencies f 1 f 2 0 032 hz or f 1 f 2 0 01 hz while the gradient varies linearly between surge and pitch natural frequencies f 2 0 032 hz f 1 0 01 hz an example is shown in the right subplot of fig 3 finally this modified qtf matrix is downsampled to an interval of 0 05 hz and implemented in the sima model 5 results 5 1 wave loads on the upright and trimmed semi submersible fwt in bichromatic waves first we examine the details of difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt in two bichromatic waves wave index s7 p5 the surge forces at the wave and surge natural frequencies in wave s7 are presented in sec 5 1 1 and the pitch moments at the wave and pitch natural frequencies in wave p5 are shown in sec 5 1 2 considering the existence of mean pitch angle for wind turbine during operation wave loads on a 5 trimmed floater are also included the floater is rotated 5 clockwise around point a shown in fig 2 the surge force along x axis and pitch moment around y axis are calculated in the same global coordinate system as the upright condition fig 2 5 1 1 bichromatic wave s7 the wave elevation for wave s7 in the cfd and sima models is shown in fig 4 no significant wave damping can be observed at the end of the cfd simulations a comparison of cfd and linear shows the interaction between two regular waves which leads to the peaks between 0 15 hz and 0 25 hz at frequencies such as f 1 f 2 or 2 f 1 or 2 f 2 the wave amplitudes at these sum frequencies are much smaller than the wave frequency amplitudes note the log scale in the psd the wave amplitudes at the wave frequencies agree with the analytical solution 1 5 m within 1 at the difference frequency the surge natural frequency the wave amplitude from the cfd model is 9 9 smaller than the second order analytical solution 0 0101 m as expected the wave amplitude of the first order bichromatic wave linear at the surge natural frequency is negligible 0 001 m the effect of the cut off frequency 0 008 hz is however visible in the psd of the linear wave elevation the total surge force on the upright floater from the cfd simulation is presented together with sima simulations in fig 5 there is a small numerical damping of the surge force caused by the large turbulent viscosity at the floater boundaries in the cfd simulation compared to the cfd simulations sima slightly underpredicts the surge forces at the wave frequencies within 1 2 smaller than the uncertainty of cfd results in the sima models the linear wave force transfer function dominates at the wave frequencies the surge forces at the surge natural frequency are mainly from the qtf sima2 and the integration of the morison drag forces to the linear free surface sima4 sima4 overpredicts the surge force at the surge natural frequency by 11 compared to the cfd estimations the axial drag forces on the heave plates have no effect on the surge forces sima4 vs sima5 the surge forces using the first order bichromatic wave linear are also shown in fig 5 a comparison of sima1 vs sima2 and linear1 vs linear2 shows that the force contributions from the qtf reduce the surge forces at the wave frequencies if the difference frequency between wave components at other frequencies fig 4 coincides with wave frequencies furthermore the contribution of difference frequency wave components via the linear wave force transfer function sima1 vs linear1 decreases the difference frequency surge force sima2 vs linear2 in addition linear models give the same conclusions as sima models fig 6 compares the surge forces on individual columns of the upright floater between sima and cfd simulations in these cases the qtf for each column is not included in sima results for each column the surge forces at the second wave frequency 0 1 hz are larger than the forces at the first wave frequency 0 09 hz which is opposite the results for total surge forces fig 5 this is due to the frequency dependent phase differences of surge forces on each column in addition all the numerical models predict similar results for the surge forces at the wave frequencies no matter for the upstream column or the starboard column although the diameter of lower part is twice than that of upper part the surge force on the upper part fx2 and fx4 is larger compared to the force on the lower part fx3 and fx5 at the wave frequencies that is because the wave acceleration decreases as one moves further downward the surge forces at the wave frequencies on the starboard column fx4 and fx5 are not significantly different from those on the upstream column fx2 and fx3 due to the lack of the qtf for each column the surge forces at the difference frequency in the sima simulations mainly come from the integration the morison drag force to the linear free surface compared to the cfd results one can observe that sima underpredicts the surge forces on each column at the surge natural frequency and larger underprediction occurs at the lower part of columns fx3 and fx5 in addition in the cfd simulations the surge forces at the surge natural frequency on the starboard column fx4 and fx5 are smaller than those on the upstream column fx2 and fx3 and a larger reduction 33 is found at the lower part of columns fx3 vs fx5 the surge forces on the trimmed and upright floaters are compared in fig 7 for the cfd simulations the surge forces on the trimmed floater at the wave frequencies increase by 4 compared to the upright condition in the sima4 model the linear wave force transfer function is dominant at the wave frequencies hence for the trimmed floater the increasing or decreasing surge forces at the wave peak frequencies mainly depend on the effect of the changed immersed geometry of the floater on the first order hydrodynamic properties the effect of axial drag forces is shown in sima5 of fig 7 as expected for the trimmed floater the axial drag forces on the heave plates have a component along the x axis which slightly increases the surge force to eliminate the effect of changed submerged volume comparisons between surge force amplitudes normalized by the mean displaced submerged volume v are shown in the right y axis of fig 7 a larger portion of the columns is under water after rotating the floater meanwhile the water particle acceleration at the same position on the columns decreases for the trimmed floater considering the changed volume the surge forces at the wave frequencies under trimmed condition decrease in all the numerical simulations an increased surge force at the surge natural frequency is seen for the trimmed condition compared to the cfd simulations the increases in the sima models are small in the sima simulations the axial drag forces on the heave plates have minor contributions to the surge force on the trimmed floater at the surge natural frequency sima4 vs sima5 considering small trimmed angle the difference frequency force in cfd increases more than the change in volume but this is not the case in the sima models for a trimmed floater the flow separation around the edge of heave plate is more significant and the morison drag force underestimates this effect this big difference also highlights that the accuracy of estimated difference frequency wave loads in the engineering tools is sensitive to the drag coefficients even a small change can result in a large variation for the drag coefficients 5 1 2 bichromatic wave p5 the wave simulations of wave p5 are compared in fig 8 like wave s7 no significant wave damping can be seen at the end of the cfd simulations and interaction between two regular waves is also observed cfd vs linear there is good agreement within 1 67 between the analytical solution and different numerical models at the wave frequencies the wave amplitude at the pitch natural frequency in the cfd model is 4 2 larger than the analytical solution of 0 0257 m the pitch moments on the upright floater estimated by the cfd model are compared with sima models in fig 9 like the surge force at the end of the cfd simulations the pitch moment slightly attenuates with time due to the increased turbulent viscosity at the boundaries of the floater compared to the cfd simulations all the sima models predict similar pitch moments at the wave frequencies within 2 6 smaller than the uncertainty of cfd results and pitch natural frequency within 3 6 except for a large underprediction of pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency using sima1 model both in the sima and linear models the linear wave force transfer function is dominant at the wave frequencies meanwhile the axial drag forces on the heave plates sima5 and linear5 increase the pitch moments at the wave frequencies the pitch moment from the qtf sima2 and linear2 dominates at the pitch natural frequency the effect of difference frequency wave components on the difference frequency pitch moment is minor sima2 vs linear2 other force contributions have minor influence at the pitch natural frequency the numerically estimated pitch moments on the upright and trimmed floater are compared in fig 10 for the cfd simulations the pitch moment on the trimmed floater increases by about 11 at the first wave frequency 0 08 hz but decreases slightly 0 15 at the second wave frequency 0 112 hz compared to the moments on the upright floater in the sima4 simulations for the trimmed floater an increasing moment 8 8 occurs at the first wave frequency and a reduction of moment 4 5 appears at the second wave frequency all the variations at the wave frequencies are due to the changed frequency dependent hydrodynamic properties of the floater combining the exact values in fig 9 and ratios in fig 10 pitch moments on the trimmed floaters slightly increase both at the first and second wave frequency compared to the upright floater when considering the axial drag forces on the heave plate sima5 like the surge forces the effect of changed volume is removed in the comparison of pitch moments shown in the right y axis of fig 10 consideration of changed volume leads to a decreasing pitch moment at the second wave frequency under trimmed condition and has minor influence at the first wave frequency in all the numerical simulations the pitch moment on the trimmed floater at the pitch natural frequency increases by 1 7 for the cfd model compared to the one under upright condition in sima models the effect of 5 mean pitch angle on the pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency is not significant this is mainly caused by the small change in the contribution from the qtf which is shown in table 7 like the upright condition the axial drag forces on the heave plates sima5 have minor contributions at the pitch natural frequency furthermore the increase in the pitch moment at the pitch natural frequency is smaller than the increase in the submerged volume 5 2 comparisons and modifications of qtfs in bichromatic waves as shown in table 1 24 sets of bichromatic waves were selected to calculate the qtfs of a restrained upright semi submersible fwt and modify the qtfs from potential flow theory the qtfs before modification are presented in sec 5 2 1 while modifications are presented in sec 5 2 2 and the validations in an irregular wave are shown in sec 5 3 5 2 1 initial qtf comparisons using the approach from sec 4 2 the magnitudes of surge force and pitch moment qtfs are calculated based on different numerical models and presented in fig 11 cfd and sima5 model agree well at the lower wave frequencies while the cfd model predicts larger difference frequency wave loads at higher wave frequencies the contributions of the difference frequency wave by linear wave force transfer function sima1 are negligible in the low frequency range except for the surge forces at the pitch natural frequency for the surge forces at the surge natural frequency the contributions of morison drag forces differences between sima2 and sima5 decrease with increasing wave frequencies while the influences of morison drag forces on the surge forces at the pitch natural frequency are not significant in addition the pitch moments from the qtfs sima2 vs sima5 dominate in the low frequency range in the sima model 5 2 2 qtf modification prior to following the modification procedure from sec 4 3 several effects must be treated specially in the sima model viscous effects are considered by a morison type load model furthermore the difference frequency wave components from treating the cfd generated wave elevation as linear also contribute to the difference frequency wave loads through the linear wave force transfer function hence these two effects are removed from the qtfs estimated from cfd simulations the cfd results after subtracting these effects are referred to as new qtf old qtf is the qtfs estimated in wamit assuming that the morison model captures the viscous effects up to third order and that even higher order effects are small the new qtfs are directly applied in the validation against the irregular wave section 5 3 even though the wave height in the bichromatic wave conditions table 1 differs from the wave height in the irregular wave spectrum 7 1 m the magnitudes and phases of surge force and pitch moment qtfs estimated based on the cfd results are compared with the potential flow theory calculations in fig 12 at the lower wave frequencies generally 0 1 hz there is little discrepancy between cfd and potential flow theory in predicting the magnitudes of surge force and pitch moment qtfs however a larger difference is observed at higher wave frequencies generally 0 1 hz with the cfd model giving larger magnitudes for the phase of surge force and pitch moment qtfs the cfd model gives approximately the opposite phase compared to the potential flow theory which illustrates the limitation of the engineering tools in accurately estimating the phase of difference frequency wave loads this large discrepancy cannot be captured by tuning the morison drag term which simply changes the results 90 out of phase the magnitudes and phases of modified surge force qtfs in the low frequency range are presented together with the qtfs from potential flow theory in fig 13 close to the surge natural frequency the new qtfs have smaller magnitudes for lower incident wave frequencies 0 05 0 09 hz for higher incident wave frequencies the new qtfs have higher magnitudes furthermore for low incident wave frequencies the phase is approximately opposite compared to the phase of qtfs from potential flow theory the comparisons of pitch moment qtfs in the low frequency range are presented in fig 14 compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory the modified qtfs have similar shape and magnitude except for the larger values at the higher wave frequencies like the surge force qtfs the modified pitch moment qtfs have almost opposite phases compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory furthermore the modified qtfs have a bigger gradient in the phase around the mean drift moment diagonal the phase of qtfs from potential flow theory has a local peak trough around the pitch natural frequency however this local peak trough is transferred to the regions between surge and pitch natural frequencies in the modified qtfs due to the approach applied in the qtf modification to check the implementation of the qtf modification the difference frequency wave loads predicted by the sima model with modified qtfs sima6 in bichromatic waves are compared against the cfd results in fig 15 the difference frequency wave loads estimated by the sima model with modified qtfs sima6 are as expected close to the cfd results there is a better agreement among different numerical models at the surge natural frequency compared to the results at the pitch natural frequency in the current study the bichromatic waves are chosen such that the difference corresponds to the surge or pitch natural frequency hence there is a lack of cfd results in the upper left and lower right corners of qtf matrix fig 3 which leads to a slightly larger difference at the pitch natural frequency the largest difference occurs when estimating the wave loads at the pitch natural frequency with the maximum first wave frequency 0 15 hz here the second wave frequency is 0 182 hz close to the maximum frequency 0 185 hz in the qtfs from wamit the uncorrected data between 0 182 hz and 0 185 hz can explain the difference overall around the peak frequencies of the irregular wave in sec 5 3 0 083 hz the numerically estimated difference frequency wave loads by sima model with modified qtfs agree well with cfd results 5 3 validation of modified qtfs against experimental data in this part the experimentally measured wave elevation at the origin is input into sima software by a high pass filter with a 0 008 hz cut off frequency in order to assess the capability of modified qtfs in estimating the difference frequency wave loads a response metric referred to psd sum is adopted in the current study based on work from robertson et al 2020 the psd sum is an integration of the force or moment spectrum in the low frequency range the frequency limits for the integration are 0 005 0 05 hz the numerically estimated difference frequency surge forces in sima model with modified qtfs sima6 and qtfs from wamit sima5 are compared against experimental measurements in fig 16 compared to the results with qtfs from wamit the difference frequency surge force estimated by the modified qtfs agrees better with the experiment data however around the surge natural frequency the modified qtfs still underpredict the wave loads as shown in the right subplot of fig 16 the difference frequency surge force psd sums are calculated for both experimental and numerical results the improvement using the modified qtfs is significant the underestimation of the psd sum is reduced to 2 34 for modified qtfs from 55 07 for the qtfs from wamit this validation also indicates that the cfd model can give better estimation of difference frequency surge forces but has limitations in capturing the surge forces at even lower frequencies the numerically estimated difference frequency pitch moments are compared against experimental measurements in fig 17 like the modified surge force qtfs there is a better agreement of difference frequency pitch moment between experiment and sima model with the modified qtfs sima6 compared to the experimental results the difference frequency pitch moment psd sum with modified qtfs is 11 91 smaller while the result with the qtfs from wamit is 42 71 smaller overall one can conclude that the sima with modified qtfs sima6 can better capture difference frequency wave loads than the qtfs from potential flow theory this also demonstrates the advantages of the cfd model in capturing the nonlinear difference frequency wave loads the more cfd simulations at different sets of frequencies are carried out the more accurate the modified qtfs are and the better the difference frequency wave loads are captured by sima models with modified qtfs 5 conclusions in the current work two numerical models are used to study the nonlinear difference frequency wave loads on a restrained semi submersible fwt in bichromatic waves a cfd model and a potential flow theory model with morison type drag sima furthermore the results from cfd model are used to modify the qtfs from potential flow theory and the resulting model is validated against experimental data in an irregular wave the wave loads from cfd and the potential flow model are in good agreement at the wave frequencies in the sima model the difference frequency surge force at the surge natural frequency is mainly from the integration of morison drag force to the linear free surface this contribution decreases with increasing wave frequencies and the surge force from qtfs becomes dominant at the pitch natural frequency the pitch moment from qtfs is dominant in addition the axial drag forces on the heave plates only increase the pitch moment at the wave frequencies and have minor contributions to the difference frequency wave loads in order to better understand the effects of the multimember arrangement of the semi submersible floater surge forces on each column are extracted compared to the cfd results sima underpredicts the difference frequency surge forces on each column and a larger underprediction is seen at the lower part of the columns in addition in the cfd simulations the surge forces at the surge natural frequency on the starboard column are smaller than those on the upstream column and a larger reduction is found at the lower part of columns the effects of 5 mean pitch angle during wind turbine operation on the difference frequency wave loads are also investigated the wave loads are calculated based on the global coordinate system used in upright condition the variations at the wave frequencies are mostly due to the changed immersed geometry and correspondingly changed first order hydrodynamic properties of the floater at the surge natural frequency there is an increase in surge force in both cfd and the potential flow model but the increase in the cfd model is more significant the pitch moments under the trimmed condition are not significantly changed compared to the upright floater however the effects of trim on the motions and loads in the mooring system of fwts are of still interest in the future research when modifying the qtfs based on cfd simulations larger modifications in the magnitude are seen to be required at higher wave frequencies interestingly the cfd model gives approximately the opposite phase compared to the original potential flow results the modification of the qtfs is verified by checking that difference frequency wave loads estimated by the sima model with modified qtfs are close to the cfd results in bichromatic waves the approach is then compared to experimental measurements of difference frequency wave loads in an irregular wave the modified qtfs significantly reduce under prediction of difference frequency wave loads compared to the qtfs from potential flow theory credit authorship contribution statement haoran li conceptualization methodology software validation

20722,air pollution due to marine traffic is strongly rising due to the rapid development of marine traffic and has brought great challenges to maritime policy and management the purpose of this paper is to create a complete emissions inventory for the port of naples and to assess its impact on air quality on an urban scale the study presents a comprehensive global shipping emission inventory of nox so2 and pm based on ais data for the 2018 a bottom up methodology was developed to assess the amounts of atmospheric pollutants emitted by all ships in port and its impact on the atmospheric pollution a matlab code was developed to associate every ais record to the most relevant phases that cover a ship in port to estimate the emissions a database containing the main information regarding over 900 ships was created a gaussian puff model calpuff was used to study the dispersion of the pollutants in the atmosphere and the impact on the urban area the results obtained were compared with data from fixed monitoring stations in the urban area in naples to assess the contribution of ship emissions to air quality the methodology can be used to estimate shipping emissions in other port and or regions and hence may serve as an input for other researchers and policy makers working in this field keywords automatic identification systems ais shipping emissions inventory bottom up method calpuff modelling impact on air quality 1 introduction air pollution is a major environmental risk to health exposure to air pollution can lead to asthma respiratory and cardiovascular diseases lung cancer and premature deaths who 2016 several studies prove a causal relation of human health to ambient concentrations of such pollutants as particulate matter pm and nitrogen oxides no2 and no in urban areas both for short and long term exposures hoek et al 2013 who 2016 short term exposure to air pollutants is closely related to copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cough shortness of breath wheezing asthma respiratory disease and high rates of hospitalization a measurement of morbidity the long term effects associated with air pollution are chronic asthma pulmonary insufficiency cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular mortality one of the major sources of air pollution is the transport sector in fact in the eu in 2016 the transport sector was the main contributor to total emissions of nox and pm2 5 with percentages of 39 and 11 respectively from road transport and 9 and 2 respectively from non road transport including shipping activities guerriero et al 2018 evidence of the importance of the contribution to air pollution by the transport sector was recently provided by the effects of lockdowns due to the sars cov 2 pandemic the imposed restriction of movements determined a significant drop of air pollution levels toascano and murena 2020 shipping is an important part of transportation in fact more than 80 of the world s traded goods by volume is transported by ship unctad 2019 ships are a significant emission source of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxide nox particulate matter pm and volatile organic compounds voc shipping emissions contribute also to secondary particle formation processes in urban areas viana et al 2014 on a global scale international maritime transportation is responsible for a few percent of particulate emissions but with an increment of the risk of significant exposure for coastal populations di natale and carotenuto 2015 mocerino et al 2018 in order to reduce ship exhaust emissions the international maritime organization imo and governments have introduced policies on limiting the sox sulfur oxide emissions from ships buhaug et al 2009 imo 1997 imo 2016a imo 2016b imo 2016c mocerino and rizzuto 2019b unlike airports and other poles of emissions usually far from the inhabited centers ports are usually placed near the city center these centers of exchange of goods and people favor the development of the territory in economic commercial and tourist terms but can jeopardize the quality of the environment numerous initiatives aimed at safeguarding the port environment have been developed in recent years by municipalities port authorities and local authorities and on a global scale by government bodies mocerino and rizzuto 2019a from a regulatory point of view the reference is the marpol 73 78 convention the annex vi of the marpol sets limits for nox and sox emissions from ships of 400 gt gross tonnage and above alternative measures are also allowed to reduce sulfur emissions using exhaust gas cleaners as regards the ghg greenhouse gases in april 2018 the imo adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of ghg emissions from ships with a target to reduce the total annual ghg emissions by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 di natale and carotenuto 2015 a main issue for a feasible assessment of the impact of ship emissions on air quality is the estimation of emissions themselves in order to estimate ship emissions the current methodologies range from full top down to full bottom up approaches miola and ciuffo 2011 in the full top down approach emissions are calculated using proxy variables corbett and fischbeck 1997 corbett et al 1999 skjølsvik et al 2000 endresen et al 2007 in the full bottom up approach the emission rate by each ship in its specific position and during a specific activity hoteling maneuvers or navigation is calculated as the product of an emission factor ef multiplied by the energy output of the engine or the fuel consumption emep eea 2019 the introduction of the automatic identification system ais has increased the availability of ship data therefore bottom up studies alver et al 2018 chen et al 2016 2017 deniz and kılıç 2009 dragovic et al 2018 maragkogianni and papaefthimiou 2015 ng et al 2013 nunes et al 2017 papaefthimiou et al 2016 song 2014 tichavska and tovar 2015 tichavska et al 2017 are generally now more used than top down over the past 20 years interest in studying the impact of maritime emissions on air quality in cities and ports has been growing two approaches are typical i experimental measures of concentration of airborne pollutants contini et al 2011 gobbi et al 2020 merico et al 2016 2017 murena et al 2018 prati et al 2015 ii the use of air quality models aqms aulinger et al 2016 gariazzo et al 2007 deniz and kilic 2010 murena et al 2018b nunes et al 2020 tang et al 2020 ramacher et al 2020 saxe and larsen 2004 furthermore in recent years the common use of an activity based method using the automatic identification system ais has admitted a very accurate way to obtain detailed information of ship specifications and operational data and to derive ship activity therefore nowadays ais data are usually applied to study the impact of ship emissions on the air quality of sea and coastal areas winther et al 2014 suggested a method for estimating emission inventories for arctic shipping starting from ais information and other aspects related to emissions kivekäs et al 2014 introduced a method for assessing the contribution of ship traffic to the concentration of aerosol particles in the downwind of shipping routes which has been identified through ais data ais data have also been used to evaluate green shipping strategies aimed at reducing emissions produced by shipping activities watson et al 2015 for example analyzed the possibility of using an integrated information system of ais data shipping agencies database and port authorities information to reduce and or minimize the time at berth of ships by optimizing their sailing speed some studies on the impact of shipping emissions on air quality were performed coupling ais data with chemical transport models such as camx wrf chem and cmaq aulinger et al 2016 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2017 marelle et al 2016 nunes et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the port of naples was investigated in two recent research papers mocerino et al 2020 murena et al 2018 in order to assess the impact only of emissions from ships passenger traffic on air quality moreover in previous studies ship schedule calendars were adopted instead of ais data therefore this study represents a significant step forward to the present knowledge of the real impact of ship emissions in the urban area of naples in what follows section 2 describes the models adopted and the dataset the area of naples is described in section 2 1 ais data the methodology of data manipulation and the estimation of ship emissions are reported in section 2 2 section 2 3 contains a description of the calmet calpuff model chain analysis of air quality data in the urban area of naples is reported in section 3 1 and ship emission results section 3 2 followed by modelling simulations section 3 3 are presented for the area studied the impact on air quality is then reported section 3 4 with an analysis of the seasonal variations section 3 5 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 area study the port of naples the city of naples where more than one million people live has an area of 119 km2 naples is the third largest city of italy after rome and milan the port of naples occupies the northernmost natural inlet of the gulf of naples and extends for about 12 km from the city center towards its eastern part from west to east there are terminals for all types of ships in 75 berths a deliberation of the port authority of naples of 2015 forces all the vessels entering the port to use fuel with a maximum 0 1 weight of sulfur the port of naples is one of the most important in italy and the mediterranean mocerino and rizzuto 2019a in fact in 2015 it ranked 12th among the busiest european ports in terms of passenger numbers while the 2017 figures place it in 35th place worldwide for tourist cruises in 2019 the port was confirmed third in italy after civitavecchia and venice for cruise traffic with 8 million passengers while the commercial traffic was of about 2 107 tons of goods while excluding the data up to may 2020 altered by the pandemic on a global scale the statistics show how the role of the port has grown over the years the data updated to 2019 compared to those of 2018 show for commercial traffic an increase of 16 9 in the number of teus 681 929 4 39 in the tons of cargo trans ported by liquid bulk and a limited 2 63 for the tons of cargo transported by the solid bulk carriers passengers traffic shows 26 90 1 356 320 in the number of cruise passengers and 1 25 6 851 448 in the number of passengers arriving on ferries and small boats 20 nm 2 2 the bottom up methodology in order to evaluate air emissions due to maritime transport two different approaches are possible bottom up or top down miola and ciuffo 2011 in the full top down approach total emissions are evaluated on a larger scale generally national then using proxy variables e g fuel consumption emissions at local scale are estimated in the full bottom up approach emissions from each single vessel are estimated over a certain period of time depending on the activity phase hoteling or navigation by aggregating these estimates over time and over the whole fleet it is possible to assess the global emissions within a single maritime route or a single geographic cell for example the entire port in our case the full bottom up approach was used in fact it starts from the activity of individual ships in the port and leads to the creation of a complete inventory of emissions relating to the entire port for the year 2018 this inventory represents the emission input for the dispersion model calpuff including an hourly calendar of the ship activities classified as navigation during arrival or departure and hoteling at berth nox so2 and pm emission rates the individuation of typical routes for each pier of the port heights and diameters of the funnels and the speed of the fumes for ship macro categories 2 2 1 ais data the rates of emission have been calculated using a bottom up activity based methodology using ais data ais messages provide static information mmsi number type and length and dynamic information the ship s position i e latitude and longitude course over ground cog speed over ground sog and utc ais transmits signals in a period from 3 s to a few minutes depending on the ship s operation yang et al 2019 the flowsheet describing the use of the ais data is shown in fig 1 the ais data used include more than one million records associated with 922 objects identified by their mmsi maritime mobile service identity numbers and grouped in categories among them those belonging to seven categories have been eliminated because they correspond to stationary objects or to ships lacking adequate information and are not relevant for the purpose of the analysis in this way sailing vessels law enforcers military ops sar aircraft the null category containing ships without data pleasure craft and port tender were excluded from the analysis because their contribution to emissions is null or not relevant overall 141 elements were deleted 84 965 records equal to 7 95 of the total records table 1 reports the main average data max speed power gt and the number of ships of the fleet visiting the port of naples in 2018 subdivided into 45 categories the first column in table 1 represents the initial of five macro categories commercial fishery passenger tanker and other in which all ships have been lumped for the successive dispersion study the last column of the same table counts the number of calls for each category and is one of the results of the matlab code explained in the next paragraph the dataset was handled in order to generate an annual calendar using a matlab code based on the following main steps the import of ais data the definition of code suitable for identifying phases spike warnings and the generation of a calendar and the export of results fig 2 shows a synthetic block diagram showing how ais data are used by the matlab code the matlab code is able to identify the phase of ships on the basis of the analysis of the temporal data of the time delta between records and of the speed data the phases defined are as follows entry to the port navigation in the port the start stop and end phases of mooring at the quay exit from the port and engine start and stop each of these phases is characterized by a unique combination of speed and time delta with respect to the neighboring records to better understand the results of the code table 2 shows the result obtained for a particular container ship as can be observed in table 2 each record is marked with a particular wording the detailed articulation of the ais data allowed the subsequent accurate estimation of emissions obviously the lines corresponding to mooring records between mooring start and mooring end are not reported in table 2 2 2 2 estimation of emission rates for an accurate estimation of the emission rates a database of all the ships visit ing the port of naples in 2018 was created the database contains all the information necessary for the estimation of emission rates category name imo number gross tonnage gt and deadweight dwt from static ais data 53 length l width b and draft t m total power installed onboard p kw and the type of engines maximum speed v kn the number of passengers cars containers etc as a function of the type of vessel unfortunately not all the records contain all the mandatory information for the calculation of emission rates the percentage of missing data was 10 55 for power in stalled onboard and 5 72 for maximum speed table 3 shows the categories for which the percentage of missing data is different from zero in order to fill the missing data regressions based on real data for each category were adopted regressions almost all linear are structured as a function of lbp length between perpendiculars m or gt in fact the database thus constructed consist of as many columns as indicated by the specific characteristics of each ship the regressions for the categories of ships with only one ship were grouped with a category of similar mission profiles for example fish factories fishing vessels and fish carriers were lumped together tables 4 and 5 show the main characteristics of the regressions obtained respectively for power and max speed in both tables the category the type of regression linear y mx q or power y mx q the predictor used and the determination coefficient obtained are reported for each category these regressions filled the gaps in the database in some cases the speed data distribution did not allow for high quality regressions in these cases a constant speed value equal to the average of the speeds of that category was assigned to that category once the database was completed emission rates of nox sox and pm were calculated the reference adopted is the recent emep eea guideline updated 2019 emep eea 2019 the input data necessary are the total power installed onboard the type of engine in stalled onboard hsd i e high speed diesel msd i e medium speed diesel and ssd i e slow speed diesel and the type of fuel used bfo i e bunker fuel oil mdo i e marine diesel oil and mgo i e marine gas oil therefore sfoc specific fuel consumption is given depending on the kind of engine and fuel used for each ship category the adopted procedure gives 213 g kwh 1 for hsd or msd engines using bfo 213 g kwh 1 for the same engines and mdo or mgo 195 and 185 g kwh 1 for ssd using respectively mdo or mgo in order to estimate the emission rates during navigation in port the speed must be known according to ais data three typical speeds for each category of ships were identified two correspond to the arrival and departure and the third corresponds to navigation in the port generally at lower speeds in fig 3 all the mean speeds obtained for each category are reported for example category 17 general cargo has a mean speed during in and out of 6 kn and a mean speed during navigation in port of about 4 kn in the yacht category these values are respectively 7 kn and about 4 kn the average speeds reported in fig 3 are used to calculate the real power of main engines in each of the three phases in out and navigation at reduced speed in port for this aim the cubic law existing between different speeds was used the procedure adopted allows a more accurate estimation of the actual power when ships are moving in port with respect to that using the typical load factors corresponding to the cruise phase the total power of auxiliary engines was evaluated on the basis of the total power onboard and using the load factors reported by trozzi et al trozzi and de laurentis 2019 according to trozzi et al trozzi and de laurentis 2019 during the navigation phase a 30 load factor is assumed for the auxiliary engines during the hoteling phase we assume for all categories that the engine loads are 20 on main engines and 40 on auxiliaries except for tankers in which case the factor load of auxiliary engines is 60 emission factors are defined by eea as function of engine type operational phase and fuels table 6 since each category of ships is characterized by a specific combination of fuel and engine type it is possible to assign the emission factor to each category of ships as function of the activity phase finally emission factors are assigned at each ship depending on the category the ship belongs to and the activity phase the emep eea methodology also provides an estimation of the uncertainty of emission factors as a relative percentage in particular for nox it gives 40 and 30 for sox 30 and 20 while for pm 50 and 40 respectively in maneuvering and in port as regards the emissions of so2 a content of sulfur in fuel equal to 0 1 in port was assumed according to the deliberation of the port authority as an example of the result obtained the following diagrams fig 4 show the emissions of nox so2 and pm in g s 1 during the navigation and hoteling phases as a function of the total power installed onboard the ships 2 2 3 definition of routes in port the first step for the definition of the route in port for each ship requires the identification of the reference pier by analyzing the ais data of each ship category similar routes on the same pier were identified successively for each ship category we merged piers and routes that are very close with the aim to simplify the number of sources in calpuff input file in fig 5 real and merged piers are reported circles include the real piers that have been merged in fig 6 some of the defined routes are reported 2 2 4 definition of sources the height above sea level and the diameter of the funnels are important parameters for studying the dispersion of airborne pollutants the height of the funnels on the baseline is not easy to find from the information generally available therefore 46 general arrangement plans were collected including bulk general cargo pax cargo ships cruises ferries ro ro cargo fishing trawlers oil tankers product tankers chemical tankers supply tugs and container vessels the height of the upper side of the funnel on the baseline and the design depth were measured the difference between these two heights provides the height of the funnel above sea level when the ship is in full load conditions by varying the immersion as a function of the load of the ship this difference changes for a more accurate estimation of the height over baseline hbl data for each macro category were fitted by linear regression equations using lbp as predictive variable h bl m l bp q table 7 shows the parameters of the regression equations and the determination coefficients to obtain the height of the funnel above sea level the ship depth available from the database was subtracted from the value of hbl obtained in fig 7 the values of hbl as a function of the total power installed onboard are reported for all ship macro categories for the estimation of the diameters of the funnels statistics were not relied on because the available database is not sufficiently large and distributed the calculation process starts from the estimation of a design funnel s diameter based on the maxi mum continuous rating of engines onboard assuming an air fuel ratio equal to 33 kg for each kg of fuel 34 kg of exhaust for each kg of fuel an exhaust temperature of 400 c and an exhaust speed of 12 m s 1 bedeke et al 2020 the exhaust flow rate and speed depend on the load conditions of the engine by applying the right load factors the exhaust speed is estimated in correspondence with the navigation in the port and in the hoteling phases for example during the hoteling phase the speed is reduced by 20 2 3 calmet calpuff model the contribution of shipping to air quality in the urban area of naples was assessed using the modelling chain composed by landuse calmet calpuff and calpost the orography in the calculation domain was evaluated using the software landuse the orographic file is included with i surface files containing hourly average values of meteorological parameters measured at ground level at naples airport of capodichino caserta acerra grazzanise and casarea blu indicators in fig 7 ii the overwater sea file containing air sea surface temperature air temperature wind speed and wind direction iii vertical profiles of wind velocity direction and temperature input into calmet producing the 3d weather file meteorological fields for the reference year 2018 were generated by the calmet model for an approximately 3000 km2 cartesian grid subdivided into a 265 265 cell grid system with 200 m cell spacing fig 8 black boundary ten vertical layers were defined at the following heights 0 20 40 80 160 320 640 1200 2000 and 3000 m calpuff california puff modelling system is a multi layer multispecies non steady state lagrangian gaussian puff dispersion model that can simulate the effects of temporally and spatially variable meteorological conditions from point line area or volume sources scire et al 2000 calpuff contains modules for complex terrain effects overwater transport coastal interaction effects building downwash wet and dry removal and simple chemical transformation calpuff model are based on the non steady state gaussian puff model which represents a dispersed plume consisting of several puffs of pollutants each puff is transported by the specific three dimensional wind fields and the size of the puff changes over time by the internal diffusion process with a gaussian distribution the concentration equation as formulated by scire et al 2000 is 1 c q 2 π 3 2 σ x σ y σ z exp d a 2 2 σ x 2 exp d c 2 2 σ y 2 n exp h e 2 n h 2 2 σ z 2 where c is the ground level concentration q is the mass of pollutant in the puff σ x σ y and σ z are the standard deviations of the gaussian distribution in the along cross and vertical wind directions respectively d a and d c are the distances from the puff center to the receptor in the along and cross wind directions h e is the effective height above the ground off the puff center and h is the mixed layer height the summation in the vertical term account for multiple reflections off the mixing lid and the ground in this study in order to model the emission of ships in movements each continuous route of every ship was discretized into a series of virtual geo referenced sources and it was assumed that at these specific points air pollutants were emitted at the time corresponding to the vessel s navigation in this way a point source emission file ptemarb i e a point source emissions file with arbitrarily varying emissions of time dependent emissions was created to simulate real emissions when ships are moving in the port the ptemarb dat file contains two types of records i time invariant and ii time dependent the time invariant records contain for each source the stack height diameter and utm coordinates the time dependent records contain the temperature of the funnel flue gas outlet k the outlet air velocity m s 1 and the pollutant emission rate g s 1 for each hour and for each source the calpuff domain was nested in the calmet domain and is about 32 24 km2 the computational domain is 160 120 cells with 200 m cell spacing fig 8 red boundary chemical transformation module rivad arm3 was adopted to simulate chemical reactions of nox and sox in the atmosphere morris et al 1988 ambient ozone monitoring data for 2018 from the arpac monitoring station were used to develop the hourly ozone monitoring data file ozone dat for modelling since field data for nh3 were not available default values were assumed calculations were performed to evaluate the maximum of the 1 h average concentrations the maximum of the 24 h average concentrations the annual average concentrations of no2 so2 primary particulate matter ppm and secondary inorganic aerosols

environmental agency arpac agenzia regionale per la protezione dell ambiente della campania were analyzed for a comparison with simulation results among all the monitoring stations located inside the study domain those measuring continuously no2 and so2 hourly average and pm10 daily average are considered they are na01 na02 na06 na07 na08 na09 napoli parco virgiliano na pv napoli via epomeo na ve and pomigliano d arco na pa their location is indicated in fig 8 square indicators the analysis of the data from the monitoring stations in 2018 is reported in table 8 the results show that for so2 both the hourly limit 350 μg m 3 should not be exceeded more than 24 times a year and the daily limit 125 μg m 3 not be exceeded more than three times per year are respected for no2 the annual limit was exceeded in four stations na06 na07 na08 and na09 while the maximum hourly average concentrations of no2 were in accordance with the limit established by the eu for the protection of human health 200 μg m 3 cannot be exceeded 18 times a year the situation of pm10 was more critical the number of exceedances of the daily limit 50 μg m 3 cannot be exceeded more than 35 times a year was exceeded at na07 and na pa the na pa monitoring site showed the highest number of exceedances 99 times of the daily limit value and was the only monitoring station that did not comply with the annual limit value of 40 μg m 3 during 2018 3 2 shipping emissions following the methodology reported in section 2 the total ship emissions of the naples port estimated in 2018 are 5418 t year 1 for nox 193 t year 1 for so2 and 602 t year 1 for pm10 the emissions evaluated in this study were compared with estimations based on the regression equations based on the tons of good for commercial ships and for the number of passengers in passenger ships reported in the review by toscano and murena 2019 based on data from several ports fig 9 the 2018 data on tons of goods handled and the number of passengers for naples port were downloaded at https adsptirrenocentrale it as can be seen nox annual emissions estimated are in sufficiently good agreement with those from the regression study toscano and murena 2019 on the contrary our estimation of pm10 is significantly higher with respect to that obtained by toscano and murena 2019 in fact the ratio of annual emissions in these regression equations is 1 3 for nox and 3 2 for pm10 however in both cases we can consider that the assessment of the im pact of ship emissions is conservative emissions during the hoteling phase represent about 95 of the total emissions while about 5 is emitted during navigation in port this result is in agreement with murena et al 2018 the small contribution of emissions during navigation with respect to other ports papaefthimiou et al 2016 depends on the short ship routes at the port of naples the distribution of annual emissions for different ship types is shown in fig 10 for nox and so2 the passenger ships produce the greatest percentage of emissions 52 56 followed by commercial ships 30 34 tankers 9 10 other ships 4 5 and fishing ships 1 for pm10 the largest amount of emission is from commercial ships 52 followed by passenger ships 33 tankers 12 and other ships 5 3 3 modelling simulations meteorological simulation was obtained with calmet model in order to validate the results of calmet simulation with real data meteorological observations at enea center of research portici were compared with calmet simulations supplementary material showing a very good agreement the contour maps of annual average concentration for no2 so2 primary pm10 ppm10 secondary inorganic aerosols sia and total pm as a sum of ppm10 and sia are reported in figs 11 and 12 the area of maximum impact of all pollutants considered is inside the port area and near the industrial area east of the center of naples however a portion of the urban area is also impacted the impact of ship emissions decreases steeply at larger distances from the harbour nox is mainly emitted as nitrogen oxide no in this study the no2 was considered to be 5 nox as in the steam model jalkanen et al 2009 in the atmosphere no is quickly converted to no2 in reaction with ozone thus further from the source atmospheric nox is dominated by no2 a map of modeled annual mean atmospheric concentrations of no2 over the naples area is shown in fig 11a the annual concentration of no2 spatially averaged on the entire model domain is 3 3 μg m 3 5 7 μg m 3 if we consider the area in fig 11a passenger ships contribute with 52 followed by commercial ships 27 tankers and other ships 12 and 9 respectively and fishing ships 1 the highest no2 contributions were found in the port area fig 11b the modeled so2 concentrations in naples are relatively low fig 11b the annual mean concentration of so2 spatially averaged on the entire model domain is about 0 1 μg m 3 0 16 μg m 3 in the area considered in fig 11b the relative contribution of each ship category is similar to that of no2 the concentration levels obtained in this study are much higher than those reported by murena et al 2018 whose estimated maximum values of the annual concentrations of no2 and so2 were 4 and about 0 15 μg m 3 respectively in this study the maximum concentrations of annual average of no2 and so2 were about 140 and 5 μg m 3 respectively the reason for this apparent discrepancy is due to the different ships considered in the two studies in murena et al 2018 only cruise ship emissions during 2016 were considered in this study emissions from all ship categories visiting the port of naples in 2018 are considered however it must be highlighted that the estimation of cruise ship emissions is also different in fact cruise ship emissions in murena et al 2018 were 419 and 14 t year 1 for nox and so2 respectively whereas these values were estimated at 647 nox and 25 t year 1 so2 in this study despite a higher number of calls in 2016 the emissions of cruise ships with the new methodology considered in this study are about 1 5 times higher than the previous estimation this difference can be attributed to the more accuracy oriented procedure adopted in this study the results of so2 concentration in this study are comparable to results obtained by merico et al 2019 those authors used the adms model to calculate a maximum annual average concentration of 5 μg m 3 pm includes primary directly emitted particles and secondary pm formed by chemical processes of emissions in the atmosphere the secondary aerosol formation in calpuff is parameterized by rivad arm3 chemical schemes it calculates the secondary particle formation such as the formation of sulphate and nitrate following so2 and no2 oxidation the maximum concentrations of primary pm fig 12a are located inside the port area and the maximum value is about 12 μg m 3 modeled secondary pm concentrations from shipping are given in fig 12b the secondary pm mainly formed far from the sources tends to disperse and accumulate in the eastern part of naples due to the prevailing wind directions the concentrations of primary pm are comparable to concentrations calculated by kuzu et al 2020 in fact the ground level concentration is 13 1 μg m 3 merico et al 2019 calculated a maximum total pm10 concentration of 5 μg m 3 which is lower than the pm10 calculated in this study by about 14 μg m 3 3 4 impact on air quality the relative impact of ship emissions i e the ratio of concentration due to the ships obtained from simulations with measured concentration was estimated in the location in which the monitoring stations were installed ground concentrations calculated by simulation models were compared with those obtained from air quality monitoring data and the relative contribution was calculated by c csim cobs where c is the percentage of ground concentration due to ship emissions csim is the concentration simulated with calpuff and cobs is the concentration observed by air monitoring stations actually concentration measured at fixed stations is the result of background local and remote sources by comparing model results with real observations the contribution of ship emissions with respect to all other sources background local and remote can be assessed aulinger et al 2016 merico et al 2016 murena et al 2018 to obtain an indication of the contribution of ship emissions to long term and short term exposures to no2 and so2 annual averages and 98th percentiles of hourly averages obtained from the simulation results were compared with the air quality data measured at 9 no2 and 4 so2 receptor points table 9 table 9 shows how the contributions of ship emissions are greater for the receptors near the port area na07 and na06 see fig 8 and lower for receptors located far from the port area as also confirmed by the ground concentration maps fig 11a b in fact with respect to yearly averages for na07 which is closest to the port area the modeled impact of shipping on no2 concentrations is responsible for 64 of the measured concentration while at other stations in the city the impact ranges from 6 to 33 far away to the naples urban area at na pa the contribution to the annual mean is 5 for so2 the annual mean concentration at na07 is 92 the very high contribution concentration is mainly due to the fact that the so2 is a pollutant emitted principally by the ships the contributions for the peak events 98th percentile are greater than those for the annual mean this effect was also observed by murena et al 2018 in some cases the contribution is very high 80 and for na07 it is greater than 100 the latter is an unrealistic result and is an indication that the model overestimates the impact of ship emissions the overestimate of concentrations is probably due to a certain degree of overestimation in the calculation of emissions in fact as previously reported the emission values calculated in this study are greater than the values estimated through the regressions by toscano and murena 2019 fig 9 it is also possible that the model underestimates the dispersive properties of the atmosphere in some conditions simulation results for ppm10 sia and total pm10 were compared to air quality data from the arpac from eight measurement sites table 10 regarding the annual mean concentrations the highest contribution is shown in na07 7 for ppm10 4 sia and 11 total pm10 as regards the other stations we calculated contributions in ranges of 1 2 2 7 and 2 5 for ppm10 sia and total pm10 respectively the contribution of ship emissions at the na pa station is relatively negligible with a contribution of 1 3 5 seasonal variations regarding the effect of seasons on the impact of ship emissions significant differences were found for all pollutants between winter december january and february and summer june july and august with the higher contributions of shipping emissions to the concentration levels registered during the summer period warm season the average no2 concentration calculated over the entire domain in summer is 3 12 μg m 3 5 51 μg m 3 if we consider the urban area near the port area while in winter the average concentration is 2 83 μg m 3 4 83 μg m 3 for so2 on the other hand we calculated an average concentration of 0 09 μg m 3 0 16 μg m 3 for the warm season and 0 08 μg m 3 0 13 μg m 3 for the cold season this is correlated to the fact that ship emissions of nox and so2 are higher in the summer season with respect to the winter the seasonal difference for primary pm is less evident in fact the average concentration over the entire domain is 0 27 μg m 3 in summer and 0 24 μg m 3 in winter 0 47 μg m 3 vs 0 41 μg m 3 if we consider the port area and the difference calculated for the sia 0 36 μg m 3 0 55 μg m 3 and 0 18 μg m 3 0 28 μg m 3 for summer and winter respectively is much higher table 11 shows the average contributions for all the receptors considered for all pollutants for the winter and the summer on average the contribution of no2 pollution in winter is 13 while in summer there is a contribution of 27 if we exclude the na pa monitoring site because it is far away from the port area the contribution increases from 14 in winter to 29 in summer for na07 there is a 29 contribution of no2 in winter and an 85 contribution in summer for so2 there is an average contribution of 24 in winter and 36 in summer without considering the na pa site it is important to note that for na07 the contribution of so2 increases from 60 in winter to 100 in summer this is also true for primary pm10 sia and total pm10 with a contribution of 2 in winter and 3 in summer for primary pm10 2 in winter and 4 in summer for sia and 3 in winter and 7 in summer for total pm10 this pattern seems to be related to the increase in ship traffic during summer due to the improved meteorological conditions that allow for improved navigation which increases traffic and subsequently emissions and atmospheric pollution the calculated average increases in emissions in summer compared to winter were 17 18 and 16 respectively for nox so2 and pm10 4 conclusion the impact of ship emissions in the water city of naples was investigated for the year 2018 using ais data to estimate shipping activities and shipping emissions through a matlab code according to the results total estimated emissions for nox so2 and pm10 were 5418 193 and 602 t year 1 respectively the annual emission results were compared with the regression study reported by toscano and murena 2019 the comparison shows that the emissions calculated in this study are 1 3 times higher for nox and 3 2 times higher for pm10 emissions during the hoteling phase represent about 95 of the total emissions while about 5 is emitted during the navigation in port the passenger ships and commercial ships contributed about 90 to the total emissions the contribution of shipping emissions to air quality has been assessed comparing the annual mean and the 98th percentile of 1 h or 24 h averages between calpuff results and observations of fixed monitoring stations the contribution to annual mean is in the range of 5 64 for no2 1 92 for so2 and 1 11 for total pm10 as the sum of primary pm10 and sia in dependence of the distance of the receptor from the port the contribution to peak short term is generally greater than that of the annual average this finding indicates a possibly more significant contribution of ship emissions to peak values events at receptor point na07 the contribution calculated for the 98th percentiles of 1 h averages of no2 and so2 is higher than 100 this result indicates a possible overestimation of actual contribution that may be due to both an overestimation in the calculation of emissions or to an underestimation of the dispersive properties of the atmosphere in some conditions therefore the contribution of annual average values could be also overestimated finally the contributions to pollutants concentrations in winter december january and february and summer june july and august were analyzed the results show that the ship emission contribution is higher in summer that during winter in fact on average the contribution to no2 at selected fixed receptors at air quality stations in winter was 13 while in summer it was 27 for so2 the average contribution was 24 in winter and 36 in summer for total pm10 it was 3 in winter and 7 in summer this is due to the higher ship traffic during summer an emission increment of 17 18 and 16 respectively for nox so2 and pm10 from summer to winter was calculated future analysis would deep some theoretical aspects regarding both emission factors and atmospheric dispersion a more feasible assessment of emission factors requires the knowledge of the distribution of weight of ships in each macro category and use of ais data with the aim to better characterize the timing and the areas of manoeuvring in the port to model short term albeit important emission peaks moreover the performances of the model adopted could be improved by the use of specific cfd simulations or wind tunnel experiments to better define the parameters governing the dispersion phenomenon inside the urban area toscano et al 2021 the methodology developed in this paper can have numerous applications in many issues regarding environment public health economy policy and society in fact works like this allow the policy makers of cities and port authorities to become aware of the problem and develop

20722,air pollution due to marine traffic is strongly rising due to the rapid development of marine traffic and has brought great challenges to maritime policy and management the purpose of this paper is to create a complete emissions inventory for the port of naples and to assess its impact on air quality on an urban scale the study presents a comprehensive global shipping emission inventory of nox so2 and pm based on ais data for the 2018 a bottom up methodology was developed to assess the amounts of atmospheric pollutants emitted by all ships in port and its impact on the atmospheric pollution a matlab code was developed to associate every ais record to the most relevant phases that cover a ship in port to estimate the emissions a database containing the main information regarding over 900 ships was created a gaussian puff model calpuff was used to study the dispersion of the pollutants in the atmosphere and the impact on the urban area the results obtained were compared with data from fixed monitoring stations in the urban area in naples to assess the contribution of ship emissions to air quality the methodology can be used to estimate shipping emissions in other port and or regions and hence may serve as an input for other researchers and policy makers working in this field keywords automatic identification systems ais shipping emissions inventory bottom up method calpuff modelling impact on air quality 1 introduction air pollution is a major environmental risk to health exposure to air pollution can lead to asthma respiratory and cardiovascular diseases lung cancer and premature deaths who 2016 several studies prove a causal relation of human health to ambient concentrations of such pollutants as particulate matter pm and nitrogen oxides no2 and no in urban areas both for short and long term exposures hoek et al 2013 who 2016 short term exposure to air pollutants is closely related to copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cough shortness of breath wheezing asthma respiratory disease and high rates of hospitalization a measurement of morbidity the long term effects associated with air pollution are chronic asthma pulmonary insufficiency cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular mortality one of the major sources of air pollution is the transport sector in fact in the eu in 2016 the transport sector was the main contributor to total emissions of nox and pm2 5 with percentages of 39 and 11 respectively from road transport and 9 and 2 respectively from non road transport including shipping activities guerriero et al 2018 evidence of the importance of the contribution to air pollution by the transport sector was recently provided by the effects of lockdowns due to the sars cov 2 pandemic the imposed restriction of movements determined a significant drop of air pollution levels toascano and murena 2020 shipping is an important part of transportation in fact more than 80 of the world s traded goods by volume is transported by ship unctad 2019 ships are a significant emission source of sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxide nox particulate matter pm and volatile organic compounds voc shipping emissions contribute also to secondary particle formation processes in urban areas viana et al 2014 on a global scale international maritime transportation is responsible for a few percent of particulate emissions but with an increment of the risk of significant exposure for coastal populations di natale and carotenuto 2015 mocerino et al 2018 in order to reduce ship exhaust emissions the international maritime organization imo and governments have introduced policies on limiting the sox sulfur oxide emissions from ships buhaug et al 2009 imo 1997 imo 2016a imo 2016b imo 2016c mocerino and rizzuto 2019b unlike airports and other poles of emissions usually far from the inhabited centers ports are usually placed near the city center these centers of exchange of goods and people favor the development of the territory in economic commercial and tourist terms but can jeopardize the quality of the environment numerous initiatives aimed at safeguarding the port environment have been developed in recent years by municipalities port authorities and local authorities and on a global scale by government bodies mocerino and rizzuto 2019a from a regulatory point of view the reference is the marpol 73 78 convention the annex vi of the marpol sets limits for nox and sox emissions from ships of 400 gt gross tonnage and above alternative measures are also allowed to reduce sulfur emissions using exhaust gas cleaners as regards the ghg greenhouse gases in april 2018 the imo adopted an initial strategy on the reduction of ghg emissions from ships with a target to reduce the total annual ghg emissions by at least 50 by 2050 compared to 2008 di natale and carotenuto 2015 a main issue for a feasible assessment of the impact of ship emissions on air quality is the estimation of emissions themselves in order to estimate ship emissions the current methodologies range from full top down to full bottom up approaches miola and ciuffo 2011 in the full top down approach emissions are calculated using proxy variables corbett and fischbeck 1997 corbett et al 1999 skjølsvik et al 2000 endresen et al 2007 in the full bottom up approach the emission rate by each ship in its specific position and during a specific activity hoteling maneuvers or navigation is calculated as the product of an emission factor ef multiplied by the energy output of the engine or the fuel consumption emep eea 2019 the introduction of the automatic identification system ais has increased the availability of ship data therefore bottom up studies alver et al 2018 chen et al 2016 2017 deniz and kılıç 2009 dragovic et al 2018 maragkogianni and papaefthimiou 2015 ng et al 2013 nunes et al 2017 papaefthimiou et al 2016 song 2014 tichavska and tovar 2015 tichavska et al 2017 are generally now more used than top down over the past 20 years interest in studying the impact of maritime emissions on air quality in cities and ports has been growing two approaches are typical i experimental measures of concentration of airborne pollutants contini et al 2011 gobbi et al 2020 merico et al 2016 2017 murena et al 2018 prati et al 2015 ii the use of air quality models aqms aulinger et al 2016 gariazzo et al 2007 deniz and kilic 2010 murena et al 2018b nunes et al 2020 tang et al 2020 ramacher et al 2020 saxe and larsen 2004 furthermore in recent years the common use of an activity based method using the automatic identification system ais has admitted a very accurate way to obtain detailed information of ship specifications and operational data and to derive ship activity therefore nowadays ais data are usually applied to study the impact of ship emissions on the air quality of sea and coastal areas winther et al 2014 suggested a method for estimating emission inventories for arctic shipping starting from ais information and other aspects related to emissions kivekäs et al 2014 introduced a method for assessing the contribution of ship traffic to the concentration of aerosol particles in the downwind of shipping routes which has been identified through ais data ais data have also been used to evaluate green shipping strategies aimed at reducing emissions produced by shipping activities watson et al 2015 for example analyzed the possibility of using an integrated information system of ais data shipping agencies database and port authorities information to reduce and or minimize the time at berth of ships by optimizing their sailing speed some studies on the impact of shipping emissions on air quality were performed coupling ais data with chemical transport models such as camx wrf chem and cmaq aulinger et al 2016 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2017 marelle et al 2016 nunes et al 2020 tang et al 2020 the port of naples was investigated in two recent research papers mocerino et al 2020 murena et al 2018 in order to assess the impact only of emissions from ships passenger traffic on air quality moreover in previous studies ship schedule calendars were adopted instead of ais data therefore this study represents a significant step forward to the present knowledge of the real impact of ship emissions in the urban area of naples in what follows section 2 describes the models adopted and the dataset the area of naples is described in section 2 1 ais data the methodology of data manipulation and the estimation of ship emissions are reported in section 2 2 section 2 3 contains a description of the calmet calpuff model chain analysis of air quality data in the urban area of naples is reported in section 3 1 and ship emission results section 3 2 followed by modelling simulations section 3 3 are presented for the area studied the impact on air quality is then reported section 3 4 with an analysis of the seasonal variations section 3 5 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methods 2 1 area study the port of naples the city of naples where more than one million people live has an area of 119 km2 naples is the third largest city of italy after rome and milan the port of naples occupies the northernmost natural inlet of the gulf of naples and extends for about 12 km from the city center towards its eastern part from west to east there are terminals for all types of ships in 75 berths a deliberation of the port authority of naples of 2015 forces all the vessels entering the port to use fuel with a maximum 0 1 weight of sulfur the port of naples is one of the most important in italy and the mediterranean mocerino and rizzuto 2019a in fact in 2015 it ranked 12th among the busiest european ports in terms of passenger numbers while the 2017 figures place it in 35th place worldwide for tourist cruises in 2019 the port was confirmed third in italy after civitavecchia and venice for cruise traffic with 8 million passengers while the commercial traffic was of about 2 107 tons of goods while excluding the data up to may 2020 altered by the pandemic on a global scale the statistics show how the role of the port has grown over the years the data updated to 2019 compared to those of 2018 show for commercial traffic an increase of 16 9 in the number of teus 681 929 4 39 in the tons of cargo trans ported by liquid bulk and a limited 2 63 for the tons of cargo transported by the solid bulk carriers passengers traffic shows 26 90 1 356 320 in the number of cruise passengers and 1 25 6 851 448 in the number of passengers arriving on ferries and small boats 20 nm 2 2 the bottom up methodology in order to evaluate air emissions due to maritime transport two different approaches are possible bottom up or top down miola and ciuffo 2011 in the full top down approach total emissions are evaluated on a larger scale generally national then using proxy variables e g fuel consumption emissions at local scale are estimated in the full bottom up approach emissions from each single vessel are estimated over a certain period of time depending on the activity phase hoteling or navigation by aggregating these estimates over time and over the whole fleet it is possible to assess the global emissions within a single maritime route or a single geographic cell for example the entire port in our case the full bottom up approach was used in fact it starts from the activity of individual ships in the port and leads to the creation of a complete inventory of emissions relating to the entire port for the year 2018 this inventory represents the emission input for the dispersion model calpuff including an hourly calendar of the ship activities classified as navigation during arrival or departure and hoteling at berth nox so2 and pm emission rates the individuation of typical routes for each pier of the port heights and diameters of the funnels and the speed of the fumes for ship macro categories 2 2 1 ais data the rates of emission have been calculated using a bottom up activity based methodology using ais data ais messages provide static information mmsi number type and length and dynamic information the ship s position i e latitude and longitude course over ground cog speed over ground sog and utc ais transmits signals in a period from 3 s to a few minutes depending on the ship s operation yang et al 2019 the flowsheet describing the use of the ais data is shown in fig 1 the ais data used include more than one million records associated with 922 objects identified by their mmsi maritime mobile service identity numbers and grouped in categories among them those belonging to seven categories have been eliminated because they correspond to stationary objects or to ships lacking adequate information and are not relevant for the purpose of the analysis in this way sailing vessels law enforcers military ops sar aircraft the null category containing ships without data pleasure craft and port tender were excluded from the analysis because their contribution to emissions is null or not relevant overall 141 elements were deleted 84 965 records equal to 7 95 of the total records table 1 reports the main average data max speed power gt and the number of ships of the fleet visiting the port of naples in 2018 subdivided into 45 categories the first column in table 1 represents the initial of five macro categories commercial fishery passenger tanker and other in which all ships have been lumped for the successive dispersion study the last column of the same table counts the number of calls for each category and is one of the results of the matlab code explained in the next paragraph the dataset was handled in order to generate an annual calendar using a matlab code based on the following main steps the import of ais data the definition of code suitable for identifying phases spike warnings and the generation of a calendar and the export of results fig 2 shows a synthetic block diagram showing how ais data are used by the matlab code the matlab code is able to identify the phase of ships on the basis of the analysis of the temporal data of the time delta between records and of the speed data the phases defined are as follows entry to the port navigation in the port the start stop and end phases of mooring at the quay exit from the port and engine start and stop each of these phases is characterized by a unique combination of speed and time delta with respect to the neighboring records to better understand the results of the code table 2 shows the result obtained for a particular container ship as can be observed in table 2 each record is marked with a particular wording the detailed articulation of the ais data allowed the subsequent accurate estimation of emissions obviously the lines corresponding to mooring records between mooring start and mooring end are not reported in table 2 2 2 2 estimation of emission rates for an accurate estimation of the emission rates a database of all the ships visit ing the port of naples in 2018 was created the database contains all the information necessary for the estimation of emission rates category name imo number gross tonnage gt and deadweight dwt from static ais data 53 length l width b and draft t m total power installed onboard p kw and the type of engines maximum speed v kn the number of passengers cars containers etc as a function of the type of vessel unfortunately not all the records contain all the mandatory information for the calculation of emission rates the percentage of missing data was 10 55 for power in stalled onboard and 5 72 for maximum speed table 3 shows the categories for which the percentage of missing data is different from zero in order to fill the missing data regressions based on real data for each category were adopted regressions almost all linear are structured as a function of lbp length between perpendiculars m or gt in fact the database thus constructed consist of as many columns as indicated by the specific characteristics of each ship the regressions for the categories of ships with only one ship were grouped with a category of similar mission profiles for example fish factories fishing vessels and fish carriers were lumped together tables 4 and 5 show the main characteristics of the regressions obtained respectively for power and max speed in both tables the category the type of regression linear y mx q or power y mx q the predictor used and the determination coefficient obtained are reported for each category these regressions filled the gaps in the database in some cases the speed data distribution did not allow for high quality regressions in these cases a constant speed value equal to the average of the speeds of that category was assigned to that category once the database was completed emission rates of nox sox and pm were calculated the reference adopted is the recent emep eea guideline updated 2019 emep eea 2019 the input data necessary are the total power installed onboard the type of engine in stalled onboard hsd i e high speed diesel msd i e medium speed diesel and ssd i e slow speed diesel and the type of fuel used bfo i e bunker fuel oil mdo i e marine diesel oil and mgo i e marine gas oil therefore sfoc specific fuel consumption is given depending on the kind of engine and fuel used for each ship category the adopted procedure gives 213 g kwh 1 for hsd or msd engines using bfo 213 g kwh 1 for the same engines and mdo or mgo 195 and 185 g kwh 1 for ssd using respectively mdo or mgo in order to estimate the emission rates during navigation in port the speed must be known according to ais data three typical speeds for each category of ships were identified two correspond to the arrival and departure and the third corresponds to navigation in the port generally at lower speeds in fig 3 all the mean speeds obtained for each category are reported for example category 17 general cargo has a mean speed during in and out of 6 kn and a mean speed during navigation in port of about 4 kn in the yacht category these values are respectively 7 kn and about 4 kn the average speeds reported in fig 3 are used to calculate the real power of main engines in each of the three phases in out and navigation at reduced speed in port for this aim the cubic law existing between different speeds was used the procedure adopted allows a more accurate estimation of the actual power when ships are moving in port with respect to that using the typical load factors corresponding to the cruise phase the total power of auxiliary engines was evaluated on the basis of the total power onboard and using the load factors reported by trozzi et al trozzi and de laurentis 2019 according to trozzi et al trozzi and de laurentis 2019 during the navigation phase a 30 load factor is assumed for the auxiliary engines during the hoteling phase we assume for all categories that the engine loads are 20 on main engines and 40 on auxiliaries except for tankers in which case the factor load of auxiliary engines is 60 emission factors are defined by eea as function of engine type operational phase and fuels table 6 since each category of ships is characterized by a specific combination of fuel and engine type it is possible to assign the emission factor to each category of ships as function of the activity phase finally emission factors are assigned at each ship depending on the category the ship belongs to and the activity phase the emep eea methodology also provides an estimation of the uncertainty of emission factors as a relative percentage in particular for nox it gives 40 and 30 for sox 30 and 20 while for pm 50 and 40 respectively in maneuvering and in port as regards the emissions of so2 a content of sulfur in fuel equal to 0 1 in port was assumed according to the deliberation of the port authority as an example of the result obtained the following diagrams fig 4 show the emissions of nox so2 and pm in g s 1 during the navigation and hoteling phases as a function of the total power installed onboard the ships 2 2 3 definition of routes in port the first step for the definition of the route in port for each ship requires the identification of the reference pier by analyzing the ais data of each ship category similar routes on the same pier were identified successively for each ship category we merged piers and routes that are very close with the aim to simplify the number of sources in calpuff input file in fig 5 real and merged piers are reported circles include the real piers that have been merged in fig 6 some of the defined routes are reported 2 2 4 definition of sources the height above sea level and the diameter of the funnels are important parameters for studying the dispersion of airborne pollutants the height of the funnels on the baseline is not easy to find from the information generally available therefore 46 general arrangement plans were collected including bulk general cargo pax cargo ships cruises ferries ro ro cargo fishing trawlers oil tankers product tankers chemical tankers supply tugs and container vessels the height of the upper side of the funnel on the baseline and the design depth were measured the difference between these two heights provides the height of the funnel above sea level when the ship is in full load conditions by varying the immersion as a function of the load of the ship this difference changes for a more accurate estimation of the height over baseline hbl data for each macro category were fitted by linear regression equations using lbp as predictive variable h bl m l bp q table 7 shows the parameters of the regression equations and the determination coefficients to obtain the height of the funnel above sea level the ship depth available from the database was subtracted from the value of hbl obtained in fig 7 the values of hbl as a function of the total power installed onboard are reported for all ship macro categories for the estimation of the diameters of the funnels statistics were not relied on because the available database is not sufficiently large and distributed the calculation process starts from the estimation of a design funnel s diameter based on the maxi mum continuous rating of engines onboard assuming an air fuel ratio equal to 33 kg for each kg of fuel 34 kg of exhaust for each kg of fuel an exhaust temperature of 400 c and an exhaust speed of 12 m s 1 bedeke et al 2020 the exhaust flow rate and speed depend on the load conditions of the engine by applying the right load factors the exhaust speed is estimated in correspondence with the navigation in the port and in the hoteling phases for example during the hoteling phase the speed is reduced by 20 2 3 calmet calpuff model the contribution of shipping to air quality in the urban area of naples was assessed using the modelling chain composed by landuse calmet calpuff and calpost the orography in the calculation domain was evaluated using the software landuse the orographic file is included with i surface files containing hourly average values of meteorological parameters measured at ground level at naples airport of capodichino caserta acerra grazzanise and casarea blu indicators in fig 7 ii the overwater sea file containing air sea surface temperature air temperature wind speed and wind direction iii vertical profiles of wind velocity direction and temperature input into calmet producing the 3d weather file meteorological fields for the reference year 2018 were generated by the calmet model for an approximately 3000 km2 cartesian grid subdivided into a 265 265 cell grid system with 200 m cell spacing fig 8 black boundary ten vertical layers were defined at the following heights 0 20 40 80 160 320 640 1200 2000 and 3000 m calpuff california puff modelling system is a multi layer multispecies non steady state lagrangian gaussian puff dispersion model that can simulate the effects of temporally and spatially variable meteorological conditions from point line area or volume sources scire et al 2000 calpuff contains modules for complex terrain effects overwater transport coastal interaction effects building downwash wet and dry removal and simple chemical transformation calpuff model are based on the non steady state gaussian puff model which represents a dispersed plume consisting of several puffs of pollutants each puff is transported by the specific three dimensional wind fields and the size of the puff changes over time by the internal diffusion process with a gaussian distribution the concentration equation as formulated by scire et al 2000 is 1 c q 2 π 3 2 σ x σ y σ z exp d a 2 2 σ x 2 exp d c 2 2 σ y 2 n exp h e 2 n h 2 2 σ z 2 where c is the ground level concentration q is the mass of pollutant in the puff σ x σ y and σ z are the standard deviations of the gaussian distribution in the along cross and vertical wind directions respectively d a and d c are the distances from the puff center to the receptor in the along and cross wind directions h e is the effective height above the ground off the puff center and h is the mixed layer height the summation in the vertical term account for multiple reflections off the mixing lid and the ground in this study in order to model the emission of ships in movements each continuous route of every ship was discretized into a series of virtual geo referenced sources and it was assumed that at these specific points air pollutants were emitted at the time corresponding to the vessel s navigation in this way a point source emission file ptemarb i e a point source emissions file with arbitrarily varying emissions of time dependent emissions was created to simulate real emissions when ships are moving in the port the ptemarb dat file contains two types of records i time invariant and ii time dependent the time invariant records contain for each source the stack height diameter and utm coordinates the time dependent records contain the temperature of the funnel flue gas outlet k the outlet air velocity m s 1 and the pollutant emission rate g s 1 for each hour and for each source the calpuff domain was nested in the calmet domain and is about 32 24 km2 the computational domain is 160 120 cells with 200 m cell spacing fig 8 red boundary chemical transformation module rivad arm3 was adopted to simulate chemical reactions of nox and sox in the atmosphere morris et al 1988 ambient ozone monitoring data for 2018 from the arpac monitoring station were used to develop the hourly ozone monitoring data file ozone dat for modelling since field data for nh3 were not available default values were assumed calculations were performed to evaluate the maximum of the 1 h average concentrations the maximum of the 24 h average concentrations the annual average concentrations of no2 so2 primary particulate matter ppm and secondary inorganic aerosols sia resulting from emissions of nox and from emissions of so2 and the sum of ppm and sia below 10 μm pm10 3 results 3 1 analysis of air quality data air quality data provided by the regional environmental agency arpac agenzia regionale per la protezione dell ambiente della campania were analyzed for a comparison with simulation results among all the monitoring stations located inside the study domain those measuring continuously no2 and so2 hourly average and pm10 daily average are considered they are na01 na02 na06 na07 na08 na09 napoli parco virgiliano na pv napoli via epomeo na ve and pomigliano d arco na pa their location is indicated in fig 8 square indicators the analysis of the data from the monitoring stations in 2018 is reported in table 8 the results show that for so2 both the hourly limit 350 μg m 3 should not be exceeded more than 24 times a year and the daily limit 125 μg m 3 not be exceeded more than three times per year are respected for no2 the annual limit was exceeded in four stations na06 na07 na08 and na09 while the maximum hourly average concentrations of no2 were in accordance with the limit established by the eu for the protection of human health 200 μg m 3 cannot be exceeded 18 times a year the situation of pm10 was more critical the number of exceedances of the daily limit 50 μg m 3 cannot be exceeded more than 35 times a year was exceeded at na07 and na pa the na pa monitoring site showed the highest number of exceedances 99 times of the daily limit value and was the only monitoring station that did not comply with the annual limit value of 40 μg m 3 during 2018 3 2 shipping emissions following the methodology reported in section 2 the total ship emissions of the naples port estimated in 2018 are 5418 t year 1 for nox 193 t year 1 for so2 and 602 t year 1 for pm10 the emissions evaluated in this study were compared with estimations based on the regression equations based on the tons of good for commercial ships and for the number of passengers in passenger ships reported in the review by toscano and murena 2019 based on data from several ports fig 9 the 2018 data on tons of goods handled and the number of passengers for naples port were downloaded at https adsptirrenocentrale it as can be seen nox annual emissions estimated are in sufficiently good agreement with those from the regression study toscano and murena 2019 on the contrary our estimation of pm10 is significantly higher with respect to that obtained by toscano and murena 2019 in fact the ratio of annual emissions in these regression equations is 1 3 for nox and 3 2 for pm10 however in both cases we can consider that the assessment of the im pact of ship emissions is conservative emissions during the hoteling phase represent about 95 of the total emissions while about 5 is emitted during navigation in port this result is in agreement with murena et al 2018 the small contribution of emissions during navigation with respect to other ports papaefthimiou et al 2016 depends on the short ship routes at the port of naples the distribution of annual emissions for different ship types is shown in fig 10 for nox and so2 the passenger ships produce the greatest percentage of emissions 52 56 followed by commercial ships 30 34 tankers 9 10 other ships 4 5 and fishing ships 1 for pm10 the largest amount of emission is from commercial ships 52 followed by passenger ships 33 tankers 12 and other ships 5 3 3 modelling simulations meteorological simulation was obtained with calmet model in order to validate the results of calmet simulation with real data meteorological observations at enea center of research portici were compared with calmet simulations supplementary material showing a very good agreement the contour maps of annual average concentration for no2 so2 primary pm10 ppm10 secondary inorganic aerosols sia and total pm as a sum of ppm10 and sia are reported in figs 11 and 12 the area of maximum impact of all pollutants considered is inside the port area and near the industrial area east of the center of naples however a portion of the urban area is also impacted the impact of ship emissions decreases steeply at larger distances from the harbour nox is mainly emitted as nitrogen oxide no in this study the no2 was considered to be 5 nox as in the steam model jalkanen et al 2009 in the atmosphere no is quickly converted to no2 in reaction with ozone thus further from the source atmospheric nox is dominated by no2 a map of modeled annual mean atmospheric concentrations of no2 over the naples area is shown in fig 11a the annual concentration of no2 spatially averaged on the entire model domain is 3 3 μg m 3 5 7 μg m 3 if we consider the area in fig 11a passenger ships contribute with 52 followed by commercial ships 27 tankers and other ships 12 and 9 respectively and fishing ships 1 the highest no2 contributions were found in the port area fig 11b the modeled so2 concentrations in naples are relatively low fig 11b the annual mean concentration of so2 spatially averaged on the entire model domain is about 0 1 μg m 3 0 16 μg m 3 in the area considered in fig 11b the relative contribution of each ship category is similar to that of no2 the concentration levels obtained in this study are much higher than those reported by murena et al 2018 whose estimated maximum values of the annual concentrations of no2 and so2 were 4 and about 0 15 μg m 3 respectively in this study the maximum concentrations of annual average of no2 and so2 were about 140 and 5 μg m 3 respectively the reason for this apparent discrepancy is due to the different ships considered in the two studies in murena et al 2018 only cruise ship emissions during 2016 were considered in this study emissions from all ship categories visiting the port of naples in 2018 are considered however it must be highlighted that the estimation of cruise ship emissions is also different in fact cruise ship emissions in murena et al 2018 were 419 and 14 t year 1 for nox and so2 respectively whereas these values were estimated at 647 nox and 25 t year 1 so2 in this study despite a higher number of calls in 2016 the emissions of cruise ships with the new methodology considered in this study are about 1 5 times higher than the previous estimation this difference can be attributed to the more accuracy oriented procedure adopted in this study the results of so2 concentration in this study are comparable to results obtained by merico et al 2019 those authors used the adms model to calculate a maximum annual average concentration of 5 μg m 3 pm includes primary directly emitted particles and secondary pm formed by chemical processes of emissions in the atmosphere the secondary aerosol formation in calpuff is parameterized by rivad arm3 chemical schemes it calculates the secondary particle formation such as the formation of sulphate and nitrate following so2 and no2 oxidation the maximum concentrations of primary pm fig 12a are located inside the port area and the maximum value is about 12 μg m 3 modeled secondary pm concentrations from shipping are given in fig 12b the secondary pm mainly formed far from the sources tends to disperse and accumulate in the eastern part of naples due to the prevailing wind directions the concentrations of primary pm are comparable to concentrations calculated by kuzu et al 2020 in fact the ground level concentration is 13 1 μg m 3 merico et al 2019 calculated a maximum total pm10 concentration of 5 μg m 3 which is lower than the pm10 calculated in this study by about 14 μg m 3 3 4 impact on air quality the relative impact of ship emissions i e the ratio of concentration due to the ships obtained from simulations with measured concentration was estimated in the location in which the monitoring stations were installed ground concentrations calculated by simulation models were compared with those obtained from air quality monitoring data and the relative contribution was calculated by c csim cobs where c is the percentage of ground concentration due to ship emissions csim is the concentration simulated with calpuff and cobs is the concentration observed by air monitoring stations actually concentration measured at fixed stations is the result of background local and remote sources by comparing model results with real observations the contribution of ship emissions with respect to all other sources background local and remote can be assessed aulinger et al 2016 merico et al 2016 murena et al 2018 to obtain an indication of the contribution of ship emissions to long term and short term exposures to no2 and so2 annual averages and 98th percentiles of hourly averages obtained from the simulation results were compared with the air quality data measured at 9 no2 and 4 so2 receptor points table 9 table 9 shows how the contributions of ship emissions are greater for the receptors near the port area na07 and na06 see fig 8 and lower for receptors located far from the port area as also confirmed by the ground concentration maps fig 11a b in fact with respect to yearly averages for na07 which is closest to the port area the modeled impact of shipping on no2 concentrations is responsible for 64 of the measured concentration while at other stations in the city the impact ranges from 6 to 33 far away to the naples urban area at na pa the contribution to the annual mean is 5 for so2 the annual mean concentration at na07 is 92 the very high contribution concentration is mainly due to the fact that the so2 is a pollutant emitted principally by the ships the contributions for the peak events 98th percentile are greater than those for the annual mean this effect was also observed by murena et al 2018 in some cases the contribution is very high 80 and for na07 it is greater than 100 the latter is an unrealistic result and is an indication that the model overestimates the impact of ship emissions the overestimate of concentrations is probably due to a certain degree of overestimation in the calculation of emissions in fact as previously reported the emission values calculated in this study are greater than the values estimated through the regressions by toscano and murena 2019 fig 9 it is also possible that the model underestimates the dispersive properties of the atmosphere in some conditions simulation results for ppm10 sia and total pm10 were compared to air quality data from the arpac from eight measurement sites table 10 regarding the annual mean concentrations the highest contribution is shown in na07 7 for ppm10 4 sia and 11 total pm10 as regards the other stations we calculated contributions in ranges of 1 2 2 7 and 2 5 for ppm10 sia and total pm10 respectively the contribution of ship emissions at the na pa station is relatively negligible with a contribution of 1 3 5 seasonal variations regarding the effect of seasons on the impact of ship emissions significant differences were found for all pollutants between winter december january and february and summer june july and august with the higher contributions of shipping emissions to the concentration levels registered during the summer period warm season the average no2 concentration calculated over the entire domain in summer is 3 12 μg m 3 5 51 μg m 3 if we consider the urban area near the port area while in winter the average concentration is 2 83 μg m 3 4 83 μg m 3 for so2 on the other hand we calculated an average concentration of 0 09 μg m 3 0 16 μg m 3 for the warm season and 0 08 μg m 3 0 13 μg m 3 for the cold season this is correlated to the fact that ship emissions of nox and so2 are higher in the summer season with respect to the winter the seasonal difference for primary pm is less evident in fact the average concentration over the entire domain is 0 27 μg m 3 in summer and 0 24 μg m 3 in winter 0 47 μg m 3 vs 0 41 μg m 3 if we consider the port area and the difference calculated for the sia 0 36 μg m 3 0 55 μg m 3 and 0 18 μg m 3 0 28 μg m 3 for summer and winter respectively is much higher table 11 shows the average contributions for all the receptors considered for all pollutants for the winter and the summer on average the contribution of no2 pollution in winter is 13 while in summer there is a contribution of 27 if we exclude the na pa monitoring site because it is far away from the port area the contribution increases from 14 in winter to 29 in summer for na07 there is a 29 contribution of no2 in winter and an 85 contribution in summer for so2 there is an average contribution of 24 in winter and 36 in summer without considering the na pa site it is important to note that for na07 the contribution of so2 increases from 60 in winter to 100 in summer this is also true for primary pm10 sia and total pm10 with a contribution of 2 in winter and 3 in summer for primary pm10 2 in winter and 4 in summer for sia and 3 in winter and 7 in summer for total pm10 this pattern seems to be related to the increase in ship traffic during summer due to the improved meteorological conditions that allow for improved navigation which increases traffic and subsequently emissions and atmospheric pollution the calculated average increases in emissions in summer compared to winter were 17 18 and 16 respectively for nox so2 and pm10 4 conclusion the impact of ship emissions in the water city of naples was investigated for the year 2018 using ais data to estimate shipping activities and shipping emissions through a matlab code according to the results total estimated emissions for nox so2 and pm10 were 5418 193 and 602 t year 1 respectively the annual emission results were compared with the regression study reported by toscano and murena 2019 the comparison shows that the emissions calculated in this study are 1 3 times higher for nox and 3 2 times higher for pm10 emissions during the hoteling phase represent about 95 of the total emissions while about 5 is emitted during the navigation in port the passenger ships and commercial ships contributed about 90 to the total emissions the contribution of shipping emissions to air quality has been assessed comparing the annual mean and the 98th percentile of 1 h or 24 h averages between calpuff results and observations of fixed monitoring stations the contribution to annual mean is in the range of 5 64 for no2 1 92 for so2 and 1 11 for total pm10 as the sum of primary pm10 and sia in dependence of the distance of the receptor from the port the contribution to peak short term is generally greater than that of the annual average this finding indicates a possibly more significant contribution of ship emissions to peak values events at receptor point na07 the contribution calculated for the 98th percentiles of 1 h averages of no2 and so2 is higher than 100 this result indicates a possible overestimation of actual contribution that may be due to both an overestimation in the calculation of emissions or to an underestimation of the dispersive properties of the atmosphere in some conditions therefore the contribution of annual average values could be also overestimated finally the contributions to pollutants concentrations in winter december january and february and summer june july and august were analyzed the results show that the ship emission contribution is higher in summer that during winter in fact on average the contribution to no2 at selected fixed receptors at air quality stations in winter was 13 while in summer it was 27 for so2 the average contribution was 24 in winter and 36 in summer for total pm10 it was 3 in winter and 7 in summer this is due to the higher ship traffic during summer an emission increment of 17 18 and 16 respectively for nox so2 and pm10 from summer to winter was calculated future analysis would deep some theoretical aspects regarding both emission factors and atmospheric dispersion a more feasible assessment of emission factors requires the knowledge of the distribution of weight of ships in each macro category and use of ais data with the aim to better characterize the timing and the areas of manoeuvring in the port to model short term albeit important emission peaks moreover the performances of the model adopted could be improved by the use of specific cfd simulations or wind tunnel experiments to better define the parameters governing the dispersion phenomenon inside the urban area toscano et al 2021 the methodology developed in this paper can have numerous applications in many issues regarding environment public health economy policy and society in fact works like this allow the policy makers of cities and port authorities to become aware of the problem and develop

20723,autonomous underwater vehicle auv is widely used in marine scientific research and military an underwater vehicle launch tube with a turbopump as power input is deemed to be the prior method to launch auv a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a launch tube system of auv is built to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and the launch parameters during the launch process the overset mesh methodology and 6 degree of freedom 6 dof dynamic mesh are applied in the numerical simulation the results show that the auv is launched out of the tube at 12 65 m s 1 in 0 454s which also proves the high efficiency of the launch method due to the blocking effect of the auv in the launch tube the pump is started at a low flow rate condition however the performance of the pump changes sharply when the auv passes through the seal rings meanwhile the auv velocity variation is related to its position too it is accelerated by the pump before passing through the second seal ring but then slows down since the pressure difference between the head and the tail of the auv no longer provides momentum keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv launch process and parameters computational fluid dynamics cfd overset methodology pressure pulsation 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is a kind of unmanned underwater vehicle which has been widely used in deep sea and ocean exploration inspection marine military and other fields there are four methods for launching auvs including air launching launching from the underwater platform launching from a launch tube and launching from an underwater vehicle topside wigley et al 2018 baker 2013 in the 1990s the united states has used launch tubes to carry and launch uuv a 660 mm launch tube was installed on the los angeles ssn 691 submarine to test the launch and recovery of uuvs at sea suhe huang et al 2018 considered that the launch tube is the most suitable equipment for the underwater vehicle to launch auv because of high initial velocity and low equipment consumption the auv launch velocity is the main factor affecting the feasibility of this method because the auv should not collide with the underwater vehicle s wave board when launching the velocity of the auv should be as high as possible guoliang li et al 2013 therefore auv self propelled launch from the tube is not the best choice so there are two ejection systems based on high pressure air xiaofang zhang et al 2009 or turbine pumps zhaohui wu et al 2000 as power input respectively however seawater is likely to pour into the tube and bubbles may generate during the launch process when using the high pressure air method therefore especially in the field of military the turbine pump will be used to launch auv out of the underwater vehicle to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the auv launch by an underwater vehicle launch tube the main methods are experimental and computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical method cfd is proved to be applicable in the study of auv launch and recovery tao zhang et al 2017 discussed the collision problem when the auv is recovered by a cone shaped dock by adams a commercial software the results agree well with that of the pool experiments guang pan et al 2013 build a mathematic model to predict the auv launching a towed buoyage for reorientation based on the arbitrary lagrange euler ale numerical algorithm yao shi et al 2019 studied the influence of different head shapes water entry velocities and entry angles of auvs on impact load during the process of high velocity auv launch from the air dantas and barros 2013 used cfd software to study the individual and interaction effects of bare hull and control surface in auv navigation dong zhang et al 2019 found that a multi auv system sailing in a specific configuration can reduce resistance and experiments have verified that reliable numerical results can be obtained by the transition sst model according to the experimental data of phoenix submarine farhood et al 2010 carried out numerical research on mun explorer auv and obtained the hydrodynamic characteristics such as lift drag resistance and torque their group then completed a two dimensional simulation to predict the performance during horizontal zigzag manoeuvres based on trial data in the past and a towing tank test farhood and christopher 2013 barros et al 2012 considered that when the ducted propeller was used as the power source the maneuverability of auv would be affected so they built the modeling of the hydrodynamic forces and moment by cfd and check it cfd can obtain the dynamic characteristics of auv in special cases mitra et al 2020 focused on the hydrodynamic performance of auv in the environment of continental slopes and estuaries randeni et al 2015 of the australian maritime college studied the surge force swing force and yaw moment coefficients on the auv when approaching the large underwater vehicle by cfd and the cfd results were verified by experiments and it can provide adequate interaction predictions the overset methodology also known as overlapping meshes is a cfd methodology widely used to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of underwater equipment boger and dreyer 2006 it can be used to simulate the 6 degree of freedom 6 dof motion of complex structures in this method the complex computational domain is divided into a background cell zone and component cell zone and the meshes of the two zones overlap nest or cover each other the data is transferred to the boundary of the two zones chase et al 2013 and martin et al 2015 reported their study to predict the submarine motion based on the overset methodology respectively in summary this paper presents the hydraulic characteristics of the auv launch by a launch tube with a turbine pump as the power source the launch parameters the launch velocity and time of the auv are obtained based on cfd cfd solver ansys fluent the pump performance and the flow field during the launch process are also studied to provide comprehensive support for the experiments of the auv launch 2 numerical method 2 1 geometry a launch tube system is shown in fig 1 including the pipeline water tank turbine pump launch tube and an auv besides a giant cylindrical water tank long enough diameter 6800 mm is used as the ocean environment of the study the auv is accelerated by the pump and the parameters of the pump are shown in table 1 the pump is assembled in the 1000 mm diameter water tank a cylinder with a density 1000 kg m 3 length 1700 mm and diameter 180 mm is the model of auv to prevent the leakage of the high pressure medium in the launch tube during the launching process the seal ring is usually assembled in the tube the section shape of the seal ring is various to pass the extensions attached to the auv therefore the seal ring is designed and produced based on specific auvs in this study the section shape of the seal ring is simplified as a circular section with equal area to the real structure so that the mesh quality especially for the overset mesh can be improved in the cfd model so two 185 4 mm diameter seal rings a length 100 mm and b length 30 mm are assembled which are located in two sections of a a and b b the clearance between the seal ring and the auv is 2 7 mm except for the two seal rings the launch tube is divided into two sections with different diameters 250 mm and 222 mm to launch the auv the pump will start up and gradually reach the rated speed from static to provide water for the launch tube and accelerate the auv in the process the axial displacement of the auv from the initial position to the end of the tube is 2400 mm which is the launch travel in addition the distance for the auv passing through the connected pipeline and the two seal rings are 941 1131 mm 1221 mm and 2291 mm respectively to simplify the launch process it is considered that the auv has only axial displacement ignoring the other five dof 2 2 mesh generation and convergence study the first step of the simulation is to discretize the system fluid domain into a finite number of elements namely the process of meshing ansys icem cfd integrated computer engineering and manufacturing code for cfd provides advanced mesh generation and it is used to create the mesh elements of the models there are two main mesh schemes one is the hexahedral mesh the other is the tetrahedral mesh compared with the tetrahedral mesh the hexahedral mesh generation method can reduce the number of elements and improve the quality of mesh especially the node distribution in a specific part can be controlled besides the convergence of calculation can be improved at the same time in the overlapping meshes of the background and components when using the overset methodology the hexahedral meshes can avoid the appearance of orphan meshes generate when a receiver cell cannot find a valid donor cell by controlling the location of nodes and the size of the meshes therefore all parts of the system are discretized by the hexahedral meshes among them the mesh generation of the pump is completed by ansys turbogrid this software can generate high quality hexahedral meshes for the complex impeller and guide vane domains in a short time the boundary layer is generated near the blade wall to ensure the accuracy of the turbulent wall function some structures are simplified for example the geometry of the elliptical head of the water tank is simplified while only 4500 mm length of the giant water tank is selected for mesh generation which reduces the number of meshes without affecting the accuracy of the simulation to prevent the influence of mesh numbers on simulation results roache 1994 suggested a grid convergence index gci report the results of grid convergence studies the gci is a measure of the percentage of the simulation value is away from the asymptotic numerical value in this study grid convergence studies of the pump domain and the launch tube domain which are the most fundamental are examined before the simulation of the launch system to ensure accuracy three mesh schemes of the pump the domains of the impeller and the guide vane are generated a pair of inlet and outlet pipe is modeled and merged with the pump domain in the grid convergence study to ensure the stability of inflow and outflow the mesh number of the 3 schemes are 1561221 coarse 2027979 medium and 2931796 fine the process of mesh refinement is described by the grid refinement ratio r which is equal to the ratio of the mesh size because the pump mesh contains multiple fluid domains and the blade structure is complex it is difficult to determine r by limiting the mesh size therefore compute an effective grid refinement ratio based on the mesh number as equation 1 1 r fine n fine n medium 1 d where n is the total number of grids and d is the dimension of the flow domain r medium is computed

overview of the mesh number the pressure difference and the gci of each mesh scheme is in table 2 gci gets smaller as the mesh number increases which means better grid convergence scheme medium fits the convergence of gci 1 and is selected to proceed with the simulation the prototype pump is produced including the pump casing impeller guide vane etc and then it is assembled with the variable frequency motor in the experiments the performance of the pump is tested under different flow rates and shaft speeds meanwhile based on the examined mesh the performance is then simulated fig 2 shows the flow head q h curve under different conditions except for the conditions of relatively small and large flow rates the results of the simulation agree well with that of the experiments this proves the accuracy of the simulation and the data will be used for the quasi steady state analysis in chapter 4 1 for the motion simulation of the auv in the launch tube the overset methodology is applied the overset mesh includes background zones and component zones background zones are the cell zones that make up the background mesh of the computational domain while component zones overlay background zones and have overset boundaries near where they connect to the background ansys fluent in this study the component zone is the mesh of auv and its surrounding fluid while the background zone includes the launch tube and part of the giant water tank it is necessary to ensure that the size ratio of component mesh and background mesh is not greater than 1 2 when generating the overset meshes and the number of overlapping layers of component mesh and background mesh at the gap is not less than 4 fig 3 a is the mesh of auv and its surrounding fluid i e the component mesh because the clearance between auv and the seal ring is the minimum which is 2 7 mm a total of four layers of meshes are generated and each layer is 0 625 mm thick the axial size of the grid is l mm fig 3 b is the mesh of the launch tube which is part of the background mesh the radiuses of different parts vary so the mesh is generated in stages 1 the central area and the area within 90 mm which are also the overlapping area with the auv mesh are split by m nodes respectively 2 the clearance which has 4 layers the same as the auv mesh 3 the area between 92 7 111 mm and 111 125 mm which are the fluid fields of the two parts of the launch tube are split by n nodes with boundary layers for a cylindrical structure such as the launch tube to be background mesh it is necessary to ensure the consistency of axial radial and circumferential dimensions with component mesh at the same time to realize the optimization of data transmission between nodes the size of the component and background mesh in this study is set the same 1 the axial size of the launch tube grid is l which is equal to the auv mesh 2 the central area of the auv mesh is split by m nodes the same as that of the launch tube mesh meanwhile when the auv enters the giant water tank the giant water tank becomes the background mesh of the auv similarly to improve the overlapping meshes at this stage the mesh needs to be generated according to the size of the component mesh however the geometric size of the giant water tank is very large compared with the tube so the mesh number will be inappropriate therefore the tank zone is divided into two parts part 1 which is 1000 mm long and connects with the launch tube and part 2 which is 3500 mm long connecting with the pipeline and pump the mesh size of part 1 is following the size of the auv mesh and the launch tube mesh the mesh size of part 2 is larger and the number is smaller and it is only encrypted at the junction of part 2 and the pipeline as shown in fig 3 c for the grid convergence study of the overset mesh the launch tube part 1 of the giant water tank and the auv are the computational domain the boundaries are pressure inlet of 400000 pa and pressure outlet of 0 pa respectively as shown in fig 4 a three mesh schemes of the launch tube and part 1 of the giant water tank are generated by adjusting the parameters m n and l gci is applied to examine the mesh the parameters of gci for the launch tube r fine 1 16 and r medium 1 14 the criterion parameter is the velocity of the auv when leaving the tube the overset methodology is used in the grid convergence study the red wireframe in fig 4 b is the overset boundary of the component mesh and the zone inside it is the overlapping of background and component while the green wireframe is the wall boundary of auv after initialization the background cells inside the green wireframe are classified as dead cells the meshes without data interchange and cut the component mesh and background mesh inside the red wireframe are paired to be solver cells and receiver cells as shown in fig 4 b in all three schemes there is no orphan cell the mesh schemes the parameters and the gci of each scheme are shown in table 3 the results verify that both scheme medium and scheme fine fit grid convergence but better flow field details and result accuracy will depend on a larger mesh number and mesh layers considering the significance of the flow status in the launch tube scheme fine is selected for the simulation meanwhile the velocity v and the displacement d of the auv for different mesh schemes are shown in fig 5 in all three simulations the velocity curves and the displacement curves almost coincide respectively indicating the grid convergence at the same time the auv is accelerated by the pressure difference between the head and the tail whereas there are some turning points in the velocity curves which are related to the auv position these points indicate that the flow state and the pressure distribution in the tube change as the motion of the auv and this phenomenon is discussed in chapter 4 2 finally the total number of meshes is 10029083 of which 7189734 are used as background mesh of the giant water tank and launch tube 73500 are auv meshes as component mesh and 1844858 are for the pump the mesh scheme is shown in fig 6 2 3 boundary conditions and solver parameters there is no additional inlet or outlet for the whole system is as a loop liquid water is the medium the walls are non slip the atmospheric pressure is defined as the reference pressure the pump impeller zone is the rotating zone and its rotating speed increases linearly from 0 to 3000r min 1 within 0 3s and keep 3000r min 1 then this mesh rotation process is controlled by dynamic mesh and udf user defined function the whole cfd model is divided into several parts and every pair of the connection flow passage is created into an interface except for the overset interface part in the overset interface setting the launch tube and part 1 of the giant water tank are background zones while auv and its adjacent meshes are component zones the 6 dof in dynamic mesh is used to simulate the movement of auv the external forces torque and motion of auv are solved by numerical integration of the pressure and shear stress on the object s surface because only the displacement of auv in the launch direction is considered the motion of auv in the study is one dof translation without other translation and rotation meanwhile the auv is regarded as a rigid body without structural deformation the mass of the auv model is 43 15 kg the standard k ω model is set as the turbulence model and it includes the modification of compressibility and shear flow diffusion based on the wilcox k ω model along with the modification for low reynolds number effects which enhance the accuracy to predict the low reynolds number flow in the water tank the coupled scheme of the pressure velocity coupling solution method is used because it is compatible with the overset methodology presto pressure staggering option scheme is used for pressure interpolation it is based on the discrete continuity balance to compute the pressure of a node presto is recommended for the simulation of rotating flows so it is chosen considering the accuracy of the pump flow field ansys fluent and the second order upwind spatial discretization is for momentum k and ω the transient formulation is solved by the first order implicit solver cfl courant number condition is an important concept in the stability and convergence analysis of cfd courant et al 1967 cfl is named after the proposers courant friedrichs and lewy cfl condition indicates a numerical method can be convergent only if its numerical domain of dependence contains the true domain of dependence of the partial differential equation at least in the limit as dt and dx go to zero the courant number is a parameter to balance the convergence and efficiency of the simulation at the setting of the coupled scheme and implicit solver the courant number could be set as 100 or higher ansys fluent in this paper the courant number is 50 to ensure better convergence so the maximum time step δt can be calculated by equation 9 9 δ t cfl δ x u where δx is the mesh size m u is the velocity of the numerical domain m s 1 the minimum δx is introduced in chapter 2 2 which is the layer thickness of the clearance 0 625 mm in the grid convergence study the velocity in the domain is monitored the maximum u is 49 7 m s 1 at the impeller blade edge clearance in the pump and 30 9 m s 1 in the launch tube and the former is substituted into equation 9 so the maximum δt is 6 29 10 4s finally δt is set as 5 10 4s the total number of time steps is 1000 and the calculating time is 0 5s 3 results the starting process of the launch system of no load condition without auv is also simulated to compare the difference of the flow field and launch parameters in the system between the no load and auv launch conditions the auv launch based on the overset method is named case 1 and the no load condition is named case 2 the most important parameters are the launch velocity of the auv and the launch time for case 1 the velocity is obtained directly by monitoring the moving velocity of the auv wall in case 2 the flow rate at the cross section of the seal ring b is monitored and the velocity of the fluid is the quotient of the flow rate and the cross section area then it is applied as the emission velocity of the medium for the displacement of auv and the displacement of fluid in case 2 the average velocity of two consecutive time steps is multiplied by the length of the time step which is the moving distance of auv in this time length the total displacement is obtained by accumulating the displacement of each time step according to the structure of the launch system when the displacement reaches 2 4m the launch process is finished the velocity and displacement changes of case 1 and case 2 are shown in fig 7 for case 1 the velocity of auv increases slowly in the first 0 2s which is because the pump starts from static and the initial power is low the velocity of auv increases rapidly as the rotation speed of the pump reaches the maximum then the velocity variation is noticed to be influenced due to the position of the auv the increase in auv velocity has slowed down at t1 0 333s 0 352s and t2 0 359s which is the time the tail of auv reaches the connected pipeline and then passes through seal ring a the velocity reaches the peak value at t3 0 445s when the tail of the auv reaches seal ring b and then it drops slowly when t 0 454s the tail of the auv leaves the tube and the whole of the auv enters the giant water tank the launch velocity of auv is 12 65 m s then the velocity of auv keeps decreasing for case 2 when the launch system is no load the fluid velocity in the launch tube rises slowly in the initial time then increases rapidly and is always higher than that of the case launching auv at 0 402 s the displacement of the fluid in the launch tube reaches 2 4m it can be considered that the initial fluid in the tube is emitted out the velocity is 15 25 m s and is higher than that of the auv launch after that the velocity of the fluid remains stable to sum up in this study the launch system can provide the auv with a launch velocity of 12 65 m s and a launch time of 0 454s although it is slightly less than the no load condition it is still a time saving and high launch velocity method 4 discussion the influence of the auv launch on the components of the system is discussed by comparing the pump performance between case 1 and 2 besides the motion of auv in the tube and the flow characteristics of the fluid in the launch tube are studied in four stages 4 1 pump performance in the launch process the pump performance of case 1 and case 2 is shown in fig 8 for case 2 the head and flow rate of the pump gradually increases with rotating speed at 0 3s the pump rotor reaches the rated speed and the head reaches the maximum value 45 88m then the head decreases gradually at the end of the calculation time it decreases to the rated head and varies slightly the flow rate increase to the peak value at 0 4s which is the rated flow and then remains unchanged this start up law is consistent with that reported in reference zhifeng li et al 2011 hong gao et al 2013 for case 1 most of the flow channels are blocked before the ejection of auv furthermore the clearance between auv and the seal rings is small compared with case 2 it is similar to the situation that the pump starts when the valve is at a small opening namely the pump starts under a low flow rate condition at this time the pump head grows faster when the rotor reaches the rated speed the peak value of the head is higher than that of the no load case while the flow rate increases slowly and the peak value is lower in particular the performance of the pump changes as the auv position changing the tail of the auv passes through seal ring a at t2 which means the flow section of seal ring a is no longer the clearance but the whole cross section this process is similar to a valve open event and then the flow rate increases and the head pulsates slightly due to the flow condition change then when the tail of auv passes through the seal ring b at t2 moment the blocking effect of auv on the tube flow channel disappears absolutely the flow rate keeps rising and the condition change induces an obvious head pulsation which subsides as time indeed the launch process is transient the transient effect of a pump will deviate the head from the quasi steady state based on the different rotation speeds of the pump and the flow rate the quasi steady head data of the pump are obtained by the numerical method using the pump cfd model in the numerical simulations the rotation speed and flow rate at the corresponding time are input parameters then the head coefficient c h is introduced to analyze the deviation between the launch process and the quasi steady state c h is obtained by equation 10 zhifeng li et al 2010 where u 2 is the velocity at impeller outlet m s 1 which can be calculated based on the rotation speed n and the impeller diameter d 282 mm by equation 11 the parameters and results of the quasi steady state are shown in table 4 c h along with the change rate of flow is shown in fig 9 10 c h 2 g h u 2 2 11 u 2 2 π d n 60 one main characteristic of the transient effect is the deviation between transient and quasi steady c h in the start up process in the rotation speed increase process c h of the launch process is always bigger than that of quasi steady transient c h is approximately equal to quasi steady c h after the speed reaches the maximum then which means the flow state in the pump tends to steady state wei li et al 2016 however the auv passes through the two seal rings at t2 and t3 which is similar to the valve open event for the pump and causes transient effects making certain c h deviation meanwhile the change of flow rate surges but there is a time lag between the peak and t2 and t3 another main characteristic of the transient effect of the pump in the launch process is rotor stator interactions each time the impeller blade sweeps the guide vane blade the pressure in the pump and downstream pipeline will change periodically hua zhang et al 2015 quanzhong liu et al 2013 a monitoring point is set in the middle of two blades of the guide vane two groups of pressure variation data are collected to analyze the rotor stator interaction of the pump in the launch process 1 in consideration that the rotation speed is changing during the speed increase process the monitoring point pressure data of 0 44s 0 5s when the rotation speed is stable is extracted to be group 1 2 the monitoring point pressure data of the pump operating in the steady rated condition is group 2 the pressure variation of the monitoring point is calculated by fast fourier transform fft and the frequency diagram of pressure pulsation is obtained as shown in fig 10 when the pump is operating the impeller rotates periodically and the pressure in the fluid field will pulsate once every revolution the frequency of this influence is called the shaft frequency f shaft which is obtained from the rotating speed r min 1 60 s every time the impeller blade sweeps the guide vane it will also cause pressure pulsation this frequency is called the blade frequency f blade which is obtained by the rotating speed r min 1 blade number 60 s in the two groups of data f shaft is 50 hz and f blade is 250 hz obvious f shaft and f blade are found in the analysis of steady state data and the amplitude of f blade is much higher than that of f shaft the peak of f blade in the launch process is a little higher however the comprehensive auv motion in the launch process induces intensive flow state variation which means the operating condition of the pump varies at any time this is the reason for the pressure variation in the guide vane which reflects as the high amplitude low frequency pulsation 4 2 auv motion and flow characteristics in the launch tube in different stages in the launch process when the auv moves to different positions in the tube not only the pump performance varies but also the flow characteristics of the fluid in the tube are changing according to the structure of the launch tube the launch process is divided into four stages 1 the initial state till the tail of the auv reaches the connected pipeline 2 the tail of the auv reaches the connected pipeline till reaches seal ring b 3 the tail of the auv passes through the seal ring b 4 the auv leaves the tube and enters the giant water tank the flow field of 0 2s 0 345s 0 442s and 0 5s is analyzed for each stage respectively fig 11 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 2s the first stage where the overall diagram is the pressure diagram and the partially enlarged region shows the streamline and velocity diagram at this time the pump is under the condition of low rotation speed and the head and the flow rate are low so the fluid velocity in the field is low moreover both the water tank and pipeline will cause certain hydraulic losses so the fluid pressure in the tube is also low the auv blocked the flow from the pipeline to the launch tube therefore the fluid routes into two directions when entering the launch tube the fluid in the tail of the tube converges by the wall and pushes the tail of the auv to move meanwhile vortex β forms in this area the small clearance between seal ring a and auv narrows the flow passage rapidly so the fluid velocity in the clearance increases significantly then vortices form due to that the cross sectional area increases when the fluid passes through seal ring a finally the fluid flows into the giant water tank and at the seal ring b the velocity increases slightly due to the decrease of the cross sectional area of the flow channel fig 12 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 345s the second stage at this time the tail of the auv has reached the connected pipeline and the head of the auv has entered the giant water tank in this stage the pump head is at the peak value of the whole launch process so the pressure in the tube is much higher compared with that of the first stage besides the pressure difference between the head and tail of the auv is significant and the momentum provided by the pressure difference accelerates the auv rapidly the fluid flowing into the launch tube from the pipeline is no longer diffluent due to the blocking of the auv but flows downward along the launching direction another vortex β 2 forms in the tail of the tube and vortex α forms at the connection auv pushes the fluid movement of its head at the water tank due to the friction between the fluid and the auv wall and the viscosity of the fluid two vortex regions form on both sides of the auv and are named as γ l and γ r according to the relative location of the vortices in addition the flow state in the launch tube changes a lot in this stage due to the motion of the auv there are three sub stages the auv passing through the connected pipeline the auv reaches seal ring a and the auv passing through seal ring a which change the interaction modes between the auv and the fluid fig 13 shows the streamlines and the velocity diagram in the three sub stages the auv stops blocking the flow channel of seal ring a as the motion so more fluid flows into seal ring a and the velocity of fluid here increases at the same time vortex α moves to the middle of the launch tube and expands to almost the whole flow channel when the auv passes through sear ring a leading to that the fluid in the tail of the tube hardly interacts with the fluid from the pipeline but forms an internal circulation fig 14 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 442s the third stage at this time the tail of the auv passes through seal ring b the blocking effect of the clearance between seal rings and the auv no longer exists which makes the flow rate increase again at this time the fluid flowing into the tube flows downward along the launching direction and gathers on the wall of the launch tube due to inertia forming a high speed region meanwhile the pressure difference between the head and tail of auv no longer provides momentum so the velocity of auv decreases gradually due to the resistance and viscosity of the fluid the position and scale of the vortices α β 1 and β 2 change slightly and the circulation of the fluid at the tail of the tube becomes clear and still does not interact with the fluid flowing into the tube so the fluid velocity in this area is lower than in other areas as more parts of the auv enters the giant water tank the scale of the γ vortex becomes larger and γ l then splits fig 15 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 5s the fourth stage at this time auv has completely entered the giant water tank the flow rate in the pipeline increases and the pump head decreases gradually due to the blocking effect of the auv disappears as a result the pressure in the launch tube has decreased while the high velocity area downstream of the tube also expands due to the further increase in flow rate the scale of the vortices at the auv wall expands and finally splits into several sub vortices 5 conclusion the launch process of auv by a launch tube is simulated based on cfd the launch parameters of auv the pump performance variation and flow characteristics in the system are obtained 1 based on the launch system in this study the auv can be launched out of the launch tube at 12 65 m s 1 in 0 454s short launch time and high launch velocity prove that this launch method is an excellent program 2 during the launch process of auv the head and the flow rate of the pump increase gradually with the rotor rotation speed however the pump is at a low flow rate start up process due to that the auv blocks most of the flow channel of the launch tube comparing with the no load case the flow state in the pump would have tended to be quasi steady when the rotation speed reaches the maximum however the auv passing through the two seal rings induces obvious variation in the performance of the pump which leads to a deviation from the quasi steady state and more serious pressure pulsation 3 the position change of auv leads to the variation of the flow characteristics of the launch system the launch process of auv is divided into four stages according to the position of auv the auv is accelerated in the first two stages which is before the auv passing through the connected pipeline and seal ring b respectively however the auv slows down after passing through seal ring b and entering the giant water tank entirely and these are the last two stages credit authorship contribution

20723,autonomous underwater vehicle auv is widely used in marine scientific research and military an underwater vehicle launch tube with a turbopump as power input is deemed to be the prior method to launch auv a computational fluid dynamics cfd model of a launch tube system of auv is built to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and the launch parameters during the launch process the overset mesh methodology and 6 degree of freedom 6 dof dynamic mesh are applied in the numerical simulation the results show that the auv is launched out of the tube at 12 65 m s 1 in 0 454s which also proves the high efficiency of the launch method due to the blocking effect of the auv in the launch tube the pump is started at a low flow rate condition however the performance of the pump changes sharply when the auv passes through the seal rings meanwhile the auv velocity variation is related to its position too it is accelerated by the pump before passing through the second seal ring but then slows down since the pressure difference between the head and the tail of the auv no longer provides momentum keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv launch process and parameters computational fluid dynamics cfd overset methodology pressure pulsation 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicle auv is a kind of unmanned underwater vehicle which has been widely used in deep sea and ocean exploration inspection marine military and other fields there are four methods for launching auvs including air launching launching from the underwater platform launching from a launch tube and launching from an underwater vehicle topside wigley et al 2018 baker 2013 in the 1990s the united states has used launch tubes to carry and launch uuv a 660 mm launch tube was installed on the los angeles ssn 691 submarine to test the launch and recovery of uuvs at sea suhe huang et al 2018 considered that the launch tube is the most suitable equipment for the underwater vehicle to launch auv because of high initial velocity and low equipment consumption the auv launch velocity is the main factor affecting the feasibility of this method because the auv should not collide with the underwater vehicle s wave board when launching the velocity of the auv should be as high as possible guoliang li et al 2013 therefore auv self propelled launch from the tube is not the best choice so there are two ejection systems based on high pressure air xiaofang zhang et al 2009 or turbine pumps zhaohui wu et al 2000 as power input respectively however seawater is likely to pour into the tube and bubbles may generate during the launch process when using the high pressure air method therefore especially in the field of military the turbine pump will be used to launch auv out of the underwater vehicle to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the auv launch by an underwater vehicle launch tube the main methods are experimental and computational fluid dynamics cfd the numerical method cfd is proved to be applicable in the study of auv launch and recovery tao zhang et al 2017 discussed the collision problem when the auv is recovered by a cone shaped dock by adams a commercial software the results agree well with that of the pool experiments guang pan et al 2013 build a mathematic model to predict the auv launching a towed buoyage for reorientation based on the arbitrary lagrange euler ale numerical algorithm yao shi et al 2019 studied the influence of different head shapes water entry velocities and entry angles of auvs on impact load during the process of high velocity auv launch from the air dantas and barros 2013 used cfd software to study the individual and interaction effects of bare hull and control surface in auv navigation dong zhang et al 2019 found that a multi auv system sailing in a specific configuration can reduce resistance and experiments have verified that reliable numerical results can be obtained by the transition sst model according to the experimental data of phoenix submarine farhood et al 2010 carried out numerical research on mun explorer auv and obtained the hydrodynamic characteristics such as lift drag resistance and torque their group then completed a two dimensional simulation to predict the performance during horizontal zigzag manoeuvres based on trial data in the past and a towing tank test farhood and christopher 2013 barros et al 2012 considered that when the ducted propeller was used as the power source the maneuverability of auv would be affected so they built the modeling of the hydrodynamic forces and moment by cfd and check it cfd can obtain the dynamic characteristics of auv in special cases mitra et al 2020 focused on the hydrodynamic performance of auv in the environment of continental slopes and estuaries randeni et al 2015 of the australian maritime college studied the surge force swing force and yaw moment coefficients on the auv when approaching the large underwater vehicle by cfd and the cfd results were verified by experiments and it can provide adequate interaction predictions the overset methodology also known as overlapping meshes is a cfd methodology widely used to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of underwater equipment boger and dreyer 2006 it can be used to simulate the 6 degree of freedom 6 dof motion of complex structures in this method the complex computational domain is divided into a background cell zone and component cell zone and the meshes of the two zones overlap nest or cover each other the data is transferred to the boundary of the two zones chase et al 2013 and martin et al 2015 reported their study to predict the submarine motion based on the overset methodology respectively in summary this paper presents the hydraulic characteristics of the auv launch by a launch tube with a turbine pump as the power source the launch parameters the launch velocity and time of the auv are obtained based on cfd cfd solver ansys fluent the pump performance and the flow field during the launch process are also studied to provide comprehensive support for the experiments of the auv launch 2 numerical method 2 1 geometry a launch tube system is shown in fig 1 including the pipeline water tank turbine pump launch tube and an auv besides a giant cylindrical water tank long enough diameter 6800 mm is used as the ocean environment of the study the auv is accelerated by the pump and the parameters of the pump are shown in table 1 the pump is assembled in the 1000 mm diameter water tank a cylinder with a density 1000 kg m 3 length 1700 mm and diameter 180 mm is the model of auv to prevent the leakage of the high pressure medium in the launch tube during the launching process the seal ring is usually assembled in the tube the section shape of the seal ring is various to pass the extensions attached to the auv therefore the seal ring is designed and produced based on specific auvs in this study the section shape of the seal ring is simplified as a circular section with equal area to the real structure so that the mesh quality especially for the overset mesh can be improved in the cfd model so two 185 4 mm diameter seal rings a length 100 mm and b length 30 mm are assembled which are located in two sections of a a and b b the clearance between the seal ring and the auv is 2 7 mm except for the two seal rings the launch tube is divided into two sections with different diameters 250 mm and 222 mm to launch the auv the pump will start up and gradually reach the rated speed from static to provide water for the launch tube and accelerate the auv in the process the axial displacement of the auv from the initial position to the end of the tube is 2400 mm which is the launch travel in addition the distance for the auv passing through the connected pipeline and the two seal rings are 941 1131 mm 1221 mm and 2291 mm respectively to simplify the launch process it is considered that the auv has only axial displacement ignoring the other five dof 2 2 mesh generation and convergence study the first step of the simulation is to discretize the system fluid domain into a finite number of elements namely the process of meshing ansys icem cfd integrated computer engineering and manufacturing code for cfd provides advanced mesh generation and it is used to create the mesh elements of the models there are two main mesh schemes one is the hexahedral mesh the other is the tetrahedral mesh compared with the tetrahedral mesh the hexahedral mesh generation method can reduce the number of elements and improve the quality of mesh especially the node distribution in a specific part can be controlled besides the convergence of calculation can be improved at the same time in the overlapping meshes of the background and components when using the overset methodology the hexahedral meshes can avoid the appearance of orphan meshes generate when a receiver cell cannot find a valid donor cell by controlling the location of nodes and the size of the meshes therefore all parts of the system are discretized by the hexahedral meshes among them the mesh generation of the pump is completed by ansys turbogrid this software can generate high quality hexahedral meshes for the complex impeller and guide vane domains in a short time the boundary layer is generated near the blade wall to ensure the accuracy of the turbulent wall function some structures are simplified for example the geometry of the elliptical head of the water tank is simplified while only 4500 mm length of the giant water tank is selected for mesh generation which reduces the number of meshes without affecting the accuracy of the simulation to prevent the influence of mesh numbers on simulation results roache 1994 suggested a grid convergence index gci report the results of grid convergence studies the gci is a measure of the percentage of the simulation value is away from the asymptotic numerical value in this study grid convergence studies of the pump domain and the launch tube domain which are the most fundamental are examined before the simulation of the launch system to ensure accuracy three mesh schemes of the pump the domains of the impeller and the guide vane are generated a pair of inlet and outlet pipe is modeled and merged with the pump domain in the grid convergence study to ensure the stability of inflow and outflow the mesh number of the 3 schemes are 1561221 coarse 2027979 medium and 2931796 fine the process of mesh refinement is described by the grid refinement ratio r which is equal to the ratio of the mesh size because the pump mesh contains multiple fluid domains and the blade structure is complex it is difficult to determine r by limiting the mesh size therefore compute an effective grid refinement ratio based on the mesh number as equation 1 1 r fine n fine n medium 1 d where n is the total number of grids and d is the dimension of the flow domain r medium is computed by the grid number of the medium scheme and coarse scheme as a result r fine 1 13 and r medium 1 09 the pressure difference δp between the pipeline inlet and outlet is set as the criterion parameter

overview of the mesh number the pressure difference and the gci of each mesh scheme is in table 2 gci gets smaller as the mesh number increases which means better grid convergence scheme medium fits the convergence of gci 1 and is selected to proceed with the simulation the prototype pump is produced including the pump casing impeller guide vane etc and then it is assembled with the variable frequency motor in the experiments the performance of the pump is tested under different flow rates and shaft speeds meanwhile based on the examined mesh the performance is then simulated fig 2 shows the flow head q h curve under different conditions except for the conditions of relatively small and large flow rates the results of the simulation agree well with that of the experiments this proves the accuracy of the simulation and the data will be used for the quasi steady state analysis in chapter 4 1 for the motion simulation of the auv in the launch tube the overset methodology is applied the overset mesh includes background zones and component zones background zones are the cell zones that make up the background mesh of the computational domain while component zones overlay background zones and have overset boundaries near where they connect to the background ansys fluent in this study the component zone is the mesh of auv and its surrounding fluid while the background zone includes the launch tube and part of the giant water tank it is necessary to ensure that the size ratio of component mesh and background mesh is not greater than 1 2 when generating the overset meshes and the number of overlapping layers of component mesh and background mesh at the gap is not less than 4 fig 3 a is the mesh of auv and its surrounding fluid i e the component mesh because the clearance between auv and the seal ring is the minimum which is 2 7 mm a total of four layers of meshes are generated and each layer is 0 625 mm thick the axial size of the grid is l mm fig 3 b is the mesh of the launch tube which is part of the background mesh the radiuses of different parts vary so the mesh is generated in stages 1 the central area and the area within 90 mm which are also the overlapping area with the auv mesh are split by m nodes respectively 2 the clearance which has 4 layers the same as the auv mesh 3 the area between 92 7 111 mm and 111 125 mm which are the fluid fields of the two parts of the launch tube are split by n nodes with boundary layers for a cylindrical structure such as the launch tube to be background mesh it is necessary to ensure the consistency of axial radial and circumferential dimensions with component mesh at the same time to realize the optimization of data transmission between nodes the size of the component and background mesh in this study is set the same 1 the axial size of the launch tube grid is l which is equal to the auv mesh 2 the central area of the auv mesh is split by m nodes the same as that of the launch tube mesh meanwhile when the auv enters the giant water tank the giant water tank becomes the background mesh of the auv similarly to improve the overlapping meshes at this stage the mesh needs to be generated according to the size of the component mesh however the geometric size of the giant water tank is very large compared with the tube so the mesh number will be inappropriate therefore the tank zone is divided into two parts part 1 which is 1000 mm long and connects with the launch tube and part 2 which is 3500 mm long connecting with the pipeline and pump the mesh size of part 1 is following the size of the auv mesh and the launch tube mesh the mesh size of part 2 is larger and the number is smaller and it is only encrypted at the junction of part 2 and the pipeline as shown in fig 3 c for the grid convergence study of the overset mesh the launch tube part 1 of the giant water tank and the auv are the computational domain the boundaries are pressure inlet of 400000 pa and pressure outlet of 0 pa respectively as shown in fig 4 a three mesh schemes of the launch tube and part 1 of the giant water tank are generated by adjusting the parameters m n and l gci is applied to examine the mesh the parameters of gci for the launch tube r fine 1 16 and r medium 1 14 the criterion parameter is the velocity of the auv when leaving the tube the overset methodology is used in the grid convergence study the red wireframe in fig 4 b is the overset boundary of the component mesh and the zone inside it is the overlapping of background and component while the green wireframe is the wall boundary of auv after initialization the background cells inside the green wireframe are classified as dead cells the meshes without data interchange and cut the component mesh and background mesh inside the red wireframe are paired to be solver cells and receiver cells as shown in fig 4 b in all three schemes there is no orphan cell the mesh schemes the parameters and the gci of each scheme are shown in table 3 the results verify that both scheme medium and scheme fine fit grid convergence but better flow field details and result accuracy will depend on a larger mesh number and mesh layers considering the significance of the flow status in the launch tube scheme fine is selected for the simulation meanwhile the velocity v and the displacement d of the auv for different mesh schemes are shown in fig 5 in all three simulations the velocity curves and the displacement curves almost coincide respectively indicating the grid convergence at the same time the auv is accelerated by the pressure difference between the head and the tail whereas there are some turning points in the velocity curves which are related to the auv position these points indicate that the flow state and the pressure distribution in the tube change as the motion of the auv and this phenomenon is discussed in chapter 4 2 finally the total number of meshes is 10029083 of which 7189734 are used as background mesh of the giant water tank and launch tube 73500 are auv meshes as component mesh and 1844858 are for the pump the mesh scheme is shown in fig 6 2 3 boundary conditions and solver parameters there is no additional inlet or outlet for the whole system is as a loop liquid water is the medium the walls are non slip the atmospheric pressure is defined as the reference pressure the pump impeller zone is the rotating zone and its rotating speed increases linearly from 0 to 3000r min 1 within 0 3s and keep 3000r min 1 then this mesh rotation process is controlled by dynamic mesh and udf user defined function the whole cfd model is divided into several parts and every pair of the connection flow passage is created into an interface except for the overset interface part in the overset interface setting the launch tube and part 1 of the giant water tank are background zones while auv and its adjacent meshes are component zones the 6 dof in dynamic mesh is used to simulate the movement of auv the external forces torque and motion of auv are solved by numerical integration of the pressure and shear stress on the object s surface because only the displacement of auv in the launch direction is considered the motion of auv in the study is one dof translation without other translation and rotation meanwhile the auv is regarded as a rigid body without structural deformation the mass of the auv model is 43 15 kg the standard k ω model is set as the turbulence model and it includes the modification of compressibility and shear flow diffusion based on the wilcox k ω model along with the modification for low reynolds number effects which enhance the accuracy to predict the low reynolds number flow in the water tank the coupled scheme of the pressure velocity coupling solution method is used because it is compatible with the overset methodology presto pressure staggering option scheme is used for pressure interpolation it is based on the discrete continuity balance to compute the pressure of a node presto is recommended for the simulation of rotating flows so it is chosen considering the accuracy of the pump flow field ansys fluent and the second order upwind spatial discretization is for momentum k and ω the transient formulation is solved by the first order implicit solver cfl courant number condition is an important concept in the stability and convergence analysis of cfd courant et al 1967 cfl is named after the proposers courant friedrichs and lewy cfl condition indicates a numerical method can be convergent only if its numerical domain of dependence contains the true domain of dependence of the partial differential equation at least in the limit as dt and dx go to zero the courant number is a parameter to balance the convergence and efficiency of the simulation at the setting of the coupled scheme and implicit solver the courant number could be set as 100 or higher ansys fluent in this paper the courant number is 50 to ensure better convergence so the maximum time step δt can be calculated by equation 9 9 δ t cfl δ x u where δx is the mesh size m u is the velocity of the numerical domain m s 1 the minimum δx is introduced in chapter 2 2 which is the layer thickness of the clearance 0 625 mm in the grid convergence study the velocity in the domain is monitored the maximum u is 49 7 m s 1 at the impeller blade edge clearance in the pump and 30 9 m s 1 in the launch tube and the former is substituted into equation 9 so the maximum δt is 6 29 10 4s finally δt is set as 5 10 4s the total number of time steps is 1000 and the calculating time is 0 5s 3 results the starting process of the launch system of no load condition without auv is also simulated to compare the difference of the flow field and launch parameters in the system between the no load and auv launch conditions the auv launch based on the overset method is named case 1 and the no load condition is named case 2 the most important parameters are the launch velocity of the auv and the launch time for case 1 the velocity is obtained directly by monitoring the moving velocity of the auv wall in case 2 the flow rate at the cross section of the seal ring b is monitored and the velocity of the fluid is the quotient of the flow rate and the cross section area then it is applied as the emission velocity of the medium for the displacement of auv and the displacement of fluid in case 2 the average velocity of two consecutive time steps is multiplied by the length of the time step which is the moving distance of auv in this time length the total displacement is obtained by accumulating the displacement of each time step according to the structure of the launch system when the displacement reaches 2 4m the launch process is finished the velocity and displacement changes of case 1 and case 2 are shown in fig 7 for case 1 the velocity of auv increases slowly in the first 0 2s which is because the pump starts from static and the initial power is low the velocity of auv increases rapidly as the rotation speed of the pump reaches the maximum then the velocity variation is noticed to be influenced due to the position of the auv the increase in auv velocity has slowed down at t1 0 333s 0 352s and t2 0 359s which is the time the tail of auv reaches the connected pipeline and then passes through seal ring a the velocity reaches the peak value at t3 0 445s when the tail of the auv reaches seal ring b and then it drops slowly when t 0 454s the tail of the auv leaves the tube and the whole of the auv enters the giant water tank the launch velocity of auv is 12 65 m s then the velocity of auv keeps decreasing for case 2 when the launch system is no load the fluid velocity in the launch tube rises slowly in the initial time then increases rapidly and is always higher than that of the case launching auv at 0 402 s the displacement of the fluid in the launch tube reaches 2 4m it can be considered that the initial fluid in the tube is emitted out the velocity is 15 25 m s and is higher than that of the auv launch after that the velocity of the fluid remains stable to sum up in this study the launch system can provide the auv with a launch velocity of 12 65 m s and a launch time of 0 454s although it is slightly less than the no load condition it is still a time saving and high launch velocity method 4 discussion the influence of the auv launch on the components of the system is discussed by comparing the pump performance between case 1 and 2 besides the motion of auv in the tube and the flow characteristics of the fluid in the launch tube are studied in four stages 4 1 pump performance in the launch process the pump performance of case 1 and case 2 is shown in fig 8 for case 2 the head and flow rate of the pump gradually increases with rotating speed at 0 3s the pump rotor reaches the rated speed and the head reaches the maximum value 45 88m then the head decreases gradually at the end of the calculation time it decreases to the rated head and varies slightly the flow rate increase to the peak value at 0 4s which is the rated flow and then remains unchanged this start up law is consistent with that reported in reference zhifeng li et al 2011 hong gao et al 2013 for case 1 most of the flow channels are blocked before the ejection of auv furthermore the clearance between auv and the seal rings is small compared with case 2 it is similar to the situation that the pump starts when the valve is at a small opening namely the pump starts under a low flow rate condition at this time the pump head grows faster when the rotor reaches the rated speed the peak value of the head is higher than that of the no load case while the flow rate increases slowly and the peak value is lower in particular the performance of the pump changes as the auv position changing the tail of the auv passes through seal ring a at t2 which means the flow section of seal ring a is no longer the clearance but the whole cross section this process is similar to a valve open event and then the flow rate increases and the head pulsates slightly due to the flow condition change then when the tail of auv passes through the seal ring b at t2 moment the blocking effect of auv on the tube flow channel disappears absolutely the flow rate keeps rising and the condition change induces an obvious head pulsation which subsides as time indeed the launch process is transient the transient effect of a pump will deviate the head from the quasi steady state based on the different rotation speeds of the pump and the flow rate the quasi steady head data of the pump are obtained by the numerical method using the pump cfd model in the numerical simulations the rotation speed and flow rate at the corresponding time are input parameters then the head coefficient c h is introduced to analyze the deviation between the launch process and the quasi steady state c h is obtained by equation 10 zhifeng li et al 2010 where u 2 is the velocity at impeller outlet m s 1 which can be calculated based on the rotation speed n and the impeller diameter d 282 mm by equation 11 the parameters and results of the quasi steady state are shown in table 4 c h along with the change rate of flow is shown in fig 9 10 c h 2 g h u 2 2 11 u 2 2 π d n 60 one main characteristic of the transient effect is the deviation between transient and quasi steady c h in the start up process in the rotation speed increase process c h of the launch process is always bigger than that of quasi steady transient c h is approximately equal to quasi steady c h after the speed reaches the maximum then which means the flow state in the pump tends to steady state wei li et al 2016 however the auv passes through the two seal rings at t2 and t3 which is similar to the valve open event for the pump and causes transient effects making certain c h deviation meanwhile the change of flow rate surges but there is a time lag between the peak and t2 and t3 another main characteristic of the transient effect of the pump in the launch process is rotor stator interactions each time the impeller blade sweeps the guide vane blade the pressure in the pump and downstream pipeline will change periodically hua zhang et al 2015 quanzhong liu et al 2013 a monitoring point is set in the middle of two blades of the guide vane two groups of pressure variation data are collected to analyze the rotor stator interaction of the pump in the launch process 1 in consideration that the rotation speed is changing during the speed increase process the monitoring point pressure data of 0 44s 0 5s when the rotation speed is stable is extracted to be group 1 2 the monitoring point pressure data of the pump operating in the steady rated condition is group 2 the pressure variation of the monitoring point is calculated by fast fourier transform fft and the frequency diagram of pressure pulsation is obtained as shown in fig 10 when the pump is operating the impeller rotates periodically and the pressure in the fluid field will pulsate once every revolution the frequency of this influence is called the shaft frequency f shaft which is obtained from the rotating speed r min 1 60 s every time the impeller blade sweeps the guide vane it will also cause pressure pulsation this frequency is called the blade frequency f blade which is obtained by the rotating speed r min 1 blade number 60 s in the two groups of data f shaft is 50 hz and f blade is 250 hz obvious f shaft and f blade are found in the analysis of steady state data and the amplitude of f blade is much higher than that of f shaft the peak of f blade in the launch process is a little higher however the comprehensive auv motion in the launch process induces intensive flow state variation which means the operating condition of the pump varies at any time this is the reason for the pressure variation in the guide vane which reflects as the high amplitude low frequency pulsation 4 2 auv motion and flow characteristics in the launch tube in different stages in the launch process when the auv moves to different positions in the tube not only the pump performance varies but also the flow characteristics of the fluid in the tube are changing according to the structure of the launch tube the launch process is divided into four stages 1 the initial state till the tail of the auv reaches the connected pipeline 2 the tail of the auv reaches the connected pipeline till reaches seal ring b 3 the tail of the auv passes through the seal ring b 4 the auv leaves the tube and enters the giant water tank the flow field of 0 2s 0 345s 0 442s and 0 5s is analyzed for each stage respectively fig 11 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 2s the first stage where the overall diagram is the pressure diagram and the partially enlarged region shows the streamline and velocity diagram at this time the pump is under the condition of low rotation speed and the head and the flow rate are low so the fluid velocity in the field is low moreover both the water tank and pipeline will cause certain hydraulic losses so the fluid pressure in the tube is also low the auv blocked the flow from the pipeline to the launch tube therefore the fluid routes into two directions when entering the launch tube the fluid in the tail of the tube converges by the wall and pushes the tail of the auv to move meanwhile vortex β forms in this area the small clearance between seal ring a and auv narrows the flow passage rapidly so the fluid velocity in the clearance increases significantly then vortices form due to that the cross sectional area increases when the fluid passes through seal ring a finally the fluid flows into the giant water tank and at the seal ring b the velocity increases slightly due to the decrease of the cross sectional area of the flow channel fig 12 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 345s the second stage at this time the tail of the auv has reached the connected pipeline and the head of the auv has entered the giant water tank in this stage the pump head is at the peak value of the whole launch process so the pressure in the tube is much higher compared with that of the first stage besides the pressure difference between the head and tail of the auv is significant and the momentum provided by the pressure difference accelerates the auv rapidly the fluid flowing into the launch tube from the pipeline is no longer diffluent due to the blocking of the auv but flows downward along the launching direction another vortex β 2 forms in the tail of the tube and vortex α forms at the connection auv pushes the fluid movement of its head at the water tank due to the friction between the fluid and the auv wall and the viscosity of the fluid two vortex regions form on both sides of the auv and are named as γ l and γ r according to the relative location of the vortices in addition the flow state in the launch tube changes a lot in this stage due to the motion of the auv there are three sub stages the auv passing through the connected pipeline the auv reaches seal ring a and the auv passing through seal ring a which change the interaction modes between the auv and the fluid fig 13 shows the streamlines and the velocity diagram in the three sub stages the auv stops blocking the flow channel of seal ring a as the motion so more fluid flows into seal ring a and the velocity of fluid here increases at the same time vortex α moves to the middle of the launch tube and expands to almost the whole flow channel when the auv passes through sear ring a leading to that the fluid in the tail of the tube hardly interacts with the fluid from the pipeline but forms an internal circulation fig 14 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 442s the third stage at this time the tail of the auv passes through seal ring b the blocking effect of the clearance between seal rings and the auv no longer exists which makes the flow rate increase again at this time the fluid flowing into the tube flows downward along the launching direction and gathers on the wall of the launch tube due to inertia forming a high speed region meanwhile the pressure difference between the head and tail of auv no longer provides momentum so the velocity of auv decreases gradually due to the resistance and viscosity of the fluid the position and scale of the vortices α β 1 and β 2 change slightly and the circulation of the fluid at the tail of the tube becomes clear and still does not interact with the fluid flowing into the tube so the fluid velocity in this area is lower than in other areas as more parts of the auv enters the giant water tank the scale of the γ vortex becomes larger and γ l then splits fig 15 shows the pressure diagram velocity diagram and streamline of the flow field at 0 5s the fourth stage at this time auv has completely entered the giant water tank the flow rate in the pipeline increases and the pump head decreases gradually due to the blocking effect of the auv disappears as a result the pressure in the launch tube has decreased while the high velocity area downstream of the tube also expands due to the further increase in flow rate the scale of the vortices at the auv wall expands and finally splits into several sub vortices 5 conclusion the launch process of auv by a launch tube is simulated based on cfd the launch parameters of auv the pump performance variation and flow characteristics in the system are obtained 1 based on the launch system in this study the auv can be launched out of the launch tube at 12 65 m s 1 in 0 454s short launch time and high launch velocity prove that this launch method is an excellent program 2 during the launch process of auv the head and the flow rate of the pump increase gradually with the rotor rotation speed however the pump is at a low flow rate start up process due to that the auv blocks most of the flow channel of the launch tube comparing with the no load case the flow state in the pump would have tended to be quasi steady when the rotation speed reaches the maximum however the auv passing through the two seal rings induces obvious variation in the performance of the pump which leads to a deviation from the quasi steady state and more serious pressure pulsation 3 the position change of auv leads to the variation of the flow characteristics of the launch system the launch process of auv is divided into four stages according to the position of auv the auv is accelerated in the first two stages which is before the auv passing through the connected pipeline and seal ring b respectively however the auv slows down after passing through seal ring b and entering the giant water tank entirely and these are the last two stages credit authorship contribution

20724,the presented paper numerically studies on the wavestar wave energy converter wec with multi point absorber around the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform the wavestar concept is selected as suitable point absorbers in conduction with floating wind turbine supported by deepcwind semisubmersible the effects of the wavestars mechanism on the power extraction and deepcwind semisubmersible movement were investigated using the potential flow based boundary element method bem in ansys aqwa software in time domain for two different wave incident angles the deepcwind semisubmersible floating wind turbine design was simulated and the results were compared with the available experimental data uncoupled simulations in which the response amplitude operator rao motions and fairlead tensions are prescribed according to the experimental data show relatively good agreement in fairlead tensions finally various numbers of the wavestars wec of point absorbers are mounted around the deepcwind semisubmersible the numerical results of the surge heave and pitch motions absorbed power and wave contour under multi point absorber are presented and discussed keywords deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform wavestar rao motions multi point absorber rotational pto damping power 1 introduction the wavestar machine attracts energy from wave power with floats that rise and fall with the up and down motion of waves the floats are attached by arms to a platform that stands on legs secured to the sea floor the motion of the floats is transferred via hydraulics into the rotation of a generator producing electricity as sketched in fig 1 a comprehensive works have been done by wavestar dong energy aalborg university and energinet dk during almost two decades to evaluate in practice the idea of combining the energy production from wind and wave technologies in the atlantic sea and the pacific ocean the rated effect of different configurations fig 1 b is shown the torque acted on the arm and then transmitted to the pto to extract the power output one approach of the wavestar configuration with 60 float has a rated effect of 18 mw and provides the possibility to add a wind turbine of 9 mw as shown in fig 1 c wavestar is currently requesting the european union eu for support through horizon 2020 in may wavestar has formed an industrial consortium with the purpose to produce the first full scale 1 mw wavestar wec to be tested commercially the consortium behind the eu application consists among others of stx ifp en dnv and aalborg gent and cantabria universities wavestarenergy website 2020 although the wind energy industry matured this industry suitable for only specific locations and limited to a relatively shallow depth site at further depths floating foundations become more competitive than fixed bottom foundations van 2017 in addition the offshore wind turbines are becoming more attractive than onshore wind turbines because wind direction and speed are more consistent across the deep water offshore areas than onshore areas in the future combining wave energy converters and floating wind turbine into one hybrid system could result in higher energy achievement and lower costs which could make offshore energy cost competitive with fossil fuels according to international renewable energy agency irena in general 67 of the current wave energy converter wec concepts are floating and 64 of wecs have been planned for offshore application and more than half of wec are point absorbers irena 2014 in particular three different types of point absorber wecs can be categorized by energy conversion principles bottom referenced submerged heave buoy e g ceto buoy mann 2011 small bottom referenced heaving buoy e g sea based sea based 2018 and floating two body heaving converter e g wavebob weber et al 2009 to absorb more power production by wec they are usually used in wave farms or arrays there are two different types of point absorber arrays namely floating and bottom fixed heave buoy arrays the first type is a group of wec attached to a platform from the upside e g wavestar hansen et al 2013 or bottom side e g pontoon power converter 2018 while the second type is an optimized layout of heaving buoys attached to the seabed since wave energy technology is not fully developed still particularly due to the high costs of the technology the suitable combination of wecs and offshore wind turbine in the same platform provides significant opportunities to increase the system energy yield and reduce the cost of power production because electrical infrastructure the mooring system and other structural components can be shared by one platform ding et al 2015 besides due to the environmentally relation between wave and wind conditions barth and eecen 2006 the idea of wave and wind technological synergies is gaining further attractive so this reduces the space required for arrays of such devices borg et al 2013 currently there are numerous of hybrid wind wave energy concepts in different stages of development which can be mounted on the semisubmersible platform tension leg platforms tlps and spars substructure in general terms a spar is a deep draft floating platform and this property leads to lower response in heave motion than semisubmersible platform and reduced wave exciting forces in the vertical direction but because the spar type has small water plane area contribution it makes more roll and pitch motions tlps have better angular and heave platform motions but there are three major problems for tlp system the first one is the complexity of the mooring and cost of installation the second one is the structural frequency coupling between the tendon and mast and the last one is the effect of tidal variations on the mooring line tension roddier et al 2010 undoubtedly the windwavefloat wwf is one of the best known hybrid wind wave energy concept and combine the wecs and the wind turbine as a one hybrid system the windfloat is a triangular semisubmersible wind turbine platform formed by 3 columns and integrated with four different types of wecs the hywind is the other type of floating wind turbine one possible way for the adding wecs into the hywind floating platform is a torus shape wec to be installed around a core of the spar this concept has been proposed and investigated by moan et al 2012 under the name the spar torus concept stc hywind platform and motions in extreme weather conditions as well as power production have been investigated by several studies moan et al 2012 muliawan et al 2013a muliawan et al 2013b and muliawan et al 2013c another type of hybrid system is based on the tlp which can be combined with three point absorbers bachynski et al 2013 or rotating flaps gao et al 2016 the combination of a multi point absorber wave energy converter mpawec and a pressure coupling hydrostatic transmission proposed by do et al 2018 mathematical models of the hydraulic components were presented and simulations were carried out they showed that the overall efficiency of the proposed system is 27 3 recently kamarloei et al 2020 presented an experimental study of wavestar wave energy converters concentrically arranged and attached on a floating offshore platform model their experimental results showed that the interaction between buoys and platform has a positive effect on the platform heave and pitch motions cheng et al 2019 carried out fully coupled simulations of hydrodynamic responses for the stc concept and evaluated its power performance li et al 2018a b c d studied the aero hydro mooring coupled analysis in time domain to predict the power production and dynamic responses of a hybrid offshore floating renewable energy system include wind turbine tidal turbine and wec also fatigue damage and short term extreme response of a hybrid device combines a floating wind turbine a wec and two tidal turbines presented by li et al 2018a b c d homayoun et al 2019 investigated the shapes of heave type wec on power performance of hybrid monopile wind turbine and a floating buoy regarding the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform it consists of 3 columns with an angular distance of 120 deg and one main column where the wind turbine is mounted see fig 2 b the columns themself are connected via cross braces to achieve stability and structural integrity below the outer columns heave plates are mounted to rise the vertical stiffness of the platform to avoid excessive heave motion of the

platform and wavestar point absorber device is presented and discussed 3 1 wavestar and deepcwind characteristics for validation purposes the present results are compared with the experimental data of the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform and wavestar point absorber device which were used as two separate projects carried out by coulling et al 2013 and jakobson et al 2016 the experimental work on the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform model was performed by the university of maine deepcwind program at maritime research institute netherlands offshore wind wave basin coulling et al 2013 furthermore the experiment on the wavestar point absorber device model was performed at the coast ocean wave basin at plymouth university in november 2013 jakobson et al 2016 the coast ocean wave basin had got 35 m length 15 m width and 3 m depth when the adjustable floor is at the lowest position it should be indicated that the experimental model has been tested in 1 5 and 1 50 scale model tests for the wavestar point absorber device and the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform respectively characteristics of the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform and the wavestar point absorber device for both model and prototype are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively scale for the model and prototype for the deepcwind is 1 50 and scale for the wavestar is 1 5 the schematic

traces for the 1 5 scale wavestar point absorber device under four rotational pto experimental damping factors i e d e x p 0 50 100 and 200 n m s it should be indicated that all of the simulations are based on cases with the input wave height h 0 1m wave period t 1 4s wavelength λ 3 06 m and wave steepness h λ 0 033 the obtained results have acceptable values compared to the experimental data presented by windt et al 2020 for all scenarios of both pto position and velocity inspection of fig 4 reveals that the amplitude of the position is decreased when the damping value increases when the damping is zero the amplitude of the position is around 2 5 cm but for damping is 200 nms the amplitude of the position is about 0 5 cm 3 3 deepcwind validation in order to validate the numerical results of the rao response motions for the deepcwind semisubmersible platform test data due to wave excitation seven different regular waves were considered and the response of this platform in the absence of wind was investigated the selected sea states characterized by period t and wave height h for regular waves are listed in table 3 fig 5 compares the predicted platform motion rao values in surge heave and pitch with those of the experimental data inspection of fig 5 shows that there is relatively good agreement between numerical results and experimental data for deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform at three motions of the surge heave and pitch under seven sea states rao surge is minimum at regular wave 1 while maximum rao surge is found at regular waves 4 and 7 for rao heave difference between maximum and minimum are very much which are 0 05 m and 1 3 respectively there is not so much difference for all regular waves regarding to the rao pitch the numerical results of fairlead tension are also compared with the experimental data for regular wave 5 with h 10 304 m and t 12 1s to achieve the desired steady state result for both experimental test hall and goupee 2015 and the numerical simulation in time domain simulations in ansys aqwa were done till 1060 s the time history of mooring line tension in fairlead is shown in fig 6 for mooring line 1 and mooring lines 2 and 3 it should be indicated that due to the symmetry between mooring line 2 and 3 similar results were obtained this comparison shows that simulation results for the mooring line is good agreement with the data from model tests nevertheless it can be observed that there is relatively a good agreement between the deepcwind test data and numerical simulation results 4 results and discussion the semisubmersible platform consists of the three pillar column and a tower for wind turbine connecting some rods between them three wavestar point absorbers ws1 ws2 and ws3 are mounted around the platform as shown in fig 7 the radius of all wavestar point absorbers in this work is 5 m here the effect of the pto damping results of the raos and absorbed power are presented and discussed 4 1 pto damping effect to achieve the highest power production eight pto damping coefficients are considered and the obtained results are compared in fig 8 under regular wave with a height of 1 2 m and a wave period of 9 5 s it is indicated that the power production is obtained for pto damping from 5e7 to 2e8 n m s which have an uptrend for all three wavestar and then show a downtrend for pto damping between 2e8 4e8 n m s power production for ws1 and ws3 is similar due to symmetrical arrangement according to extracted power given in fig 8 the highest power is obtained when the pto damping is around 2e8 nms b p t o 2 e 8 n m s in this point the extracted power of the ws2 is given 16 higher than ws1 or ws3 hereafter the all results are calculated and presented when the pto damping value is 2e8 nms and pto stiffness is zero k p t o 0 4 2 different configurations of the multi point absorber of wavestar to study the effect of wavestar on the global responses of the deepcwind semisubmersible platform as well as the power production hybrid wave wind system include different number of wavestar and a floating wind turbine on a deepcwind semisubmersible platform has been investigated the wecs system consist of 3 groups of point absorber that are placed 120 apart each group of point absorber consists of 1 2 3 and 4 wavestar respectively with 20 deg difference in the radial direction clockwise to each other fig 9 shows the position of the wavestar ws in 4 case studies of hybrid wave wind system in top view 4 3 raos the time history of the rao heave motion for deepcwind platform and wavestar for 4 case studies are compared in fig 10 simulations are carried out for airy wave condition with the wave height of 1 2 m and wave period of 9 5 s and for two wave directions it can be seen that out phase displacement for wavestar and the platform could result in higher energy achievement see fig 14 for instance as shown in fig 10 in the case of 12 wavestar and wave direction 0 ws1 is nearly out of phase with platform while ws4 is almost in phase with the platform movement hence according to fig 10 low energy achievement belong to ws4 20 kw and high energy achievement belong to ws1 77 8 kw overall the same phase leads to lower power production and vice versa as can be seen in fig 11 by increasing the wavestar number in both wave directions 0 and 180 deepcwind pitch motions decrease hence adding wavestar can lead to better stability of platform addition to boost energy production fig 12 indicates that adding wavestar can reduce surge motion that may be due to wave path change induced by wavestar fig 13 compares the results of platform rao motion for different wavestars at different wave periods result shows that increasing wave period from 6 s to 12 s reduce heave motion in all four case study pitch motion increase for wave period from 6 s to 9 s and then decrease from 9 s to 12 s surge motion shows that increasing wave period leads to decreasing platform surge motion 4 4 wave elevation to observe the effect of wave elevation around hybrid wave wind system wave contours in both wave directions 0 and 180 is shown in fig 14 as shown in this figure wave structure interaction changes wave height and direction due to radiation and diffraction that produce by wavestar and platform movement orientation of each structure relative to wave incident direction influence on wave height and direction in this effect on wavestar performance the wavestar stiffness is lower than that of the platform while the wavestar due to the low stiffness and its size has less effect on the wave surface contours than platform 4 5 absorbed power fig 15 compares the results of absorbed power for different wavestars at two wave directions 0 and 180 deg from the comparison between all four case studies means 3 6 9 and 12 wavestar it can be observed that in general the absorbed power in wave direction of 180 is bigger than wave direction of 0 it is also evident that the total absorbed power in wave direction of 180 for 3 wavestars is 36 larger than that of the wave direction of 0 besides it is found that by increasing the number of wavestars the difference between total powers for both wave direction become lower so for 6 9 and 12 wavestars total powers is 32 26 and 17 respectively differences between results in two directions have two main reasons the first is wavestar orientation relative incident wave direction it is clear in all case studies that closer orientation leads to higher power the second reason is because wave structure interaction changes wave height and direction and this leads to the most amount of power for a suitable position of wavestar than wave direction fig 16 shows the all wavestar power in different wave period with constant wave height equal to 1 2 m it is indicated that when the number of wavestar are 9 and 12 ws1 absorbed more power in case of 6 wavestars ws1 and ws3 produce more power and in the case of 3 wavestars the ws2 gives more power fig 17 shows total absorbed power for different wavestar numbers versus wave period with increasing the wavestar numbers lead to increase total absorbed power as can be observed for 3ws the total power changes very small against wave period while for 12ws it is significantly changed generally for all number of ws the maximum power occurs when the wave period equals to 8 s except for 3ws and 6ws are found higher absorbed power at wave period of 6 s in order to better compare between the presented systems different parameters can be presented capture width ratio cwr is given by c w r t o t a l p o w e r w w a v e p o w e r w m f l o a t d i a m e t e r m where d 10 m is the float diameter in all case study and wave power can be written as follow p w a v e ρ g 2 h 2 t b 32 π so that b is the width of wave crest and is considered equal to 1 m by defining the cwr to rao ratio as c w r f l o a t n u m b e r r a o p l a t f o r m for different wave periods the corresponding plots are obtained and shown in fig 18 as shown in this figure in heave motion increasing wave periods leads to decreasing absorbed power to rao ratio for all different wavestar number in pitch motion by increasing wave periods from 6 s to 9 s the power to rao ratio decreases and then increases from 9 s to 12 s in the case of surge motion from 6 s to 7 s its ratio increase and then decrease from 7 s to 12 s generally increasing wavestar number lead to increasing the absorbed power to rao ratio for all wave periods also more power is obtained when the wave period is around 6 and 7 s 5 conclusion this paper presented a hybrid wind wave energy concept include wecs by point absorbers and deepcwind floating turbine that simulated for chahbahar coastal environmental conditions with wave height of 1 2 m and wave period of 9 5 s and water depth of 100 m the wavestar concept selected as suitable point absorbers in synergy with floating wind turbine supported by deepcwind semisubmersible platform this wecs concentrically arrangement and attached to a semisubmersible structure the time domain analysis was performed to investigate the effects of wavestar numbers on power production and platform movement for two different wave directions the bem was employed as a numerical method in time domain and frequency domain analysis by ansys aqwa software the most important results of these analyses are given below the power production is greatly dependent on the damping coefficient and the suitable value of the damping coefficient is obtained by 2e8 n m s for hybrid system with floating wavestar in the case of 3 wavestars the power production in ws2 was 16 percent higher than ws1 ws3 because ws2 has better orientation than ws1 or ws3 relative to wave direction more wavestar can lead to better stability of the hybrid system by reducing the platform pitch motion in phase displacement between wavestar and platform could result in higher energy achievement wave structure interaction can change wave height and direction due to radiation and diffraction that produce by the movement of the wavestar and platform orientation of each structure relative to wave incident direction influence on wave height and direction in this effect on wavestar performance in general the power production in wave direction 180 is larger than wave direction 0 the total power production in wave direction equals180 for 3 wavestars is 36 larger than that of the zero angle wave direction by increasing the number of wavestar the difference between total power for both wave directions become lower so for 6 9 and 12 wavestar in wave direction equal to zero total powers is 32 26 and 17 lower than wave direction equals 180 respectively closer orientation between wavestar and wave direction leads to a higher power increasing wavestar number leads to increasing the power to rao ratio for all wave periods increasing wave period from 6 s to 12 s reduces heave and surge motions in all four case studies pitch motion increases for wave period from 6 s to 9 s and then decreases from 9 s to 12 s funding there are no any financial support and no

20724,the presented paper numerically studies on the wavestar wave energy converter wec with multi point absorber around the deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform the wavestar concept is selected as suitable point absorbers in conduction with floating wind turbine supported by deepcwind semisubmersible the effects of the wavestars mechanism on the power extraction and deepcwind semisubmersible movement were investigated using the potential flow based boundary element method bem in ansys aqwa software in time domain for two different wave incident angles the deepcwind semisubmersible floating wind turbine design was simulated and the results were compared with the available experimental data uncoupled simulations in which the response amplitude operator rao motions and fairlead tensions are prescribed according to the experimental data show relatively good agreement in fairlead tensions finally various numbers of the wavestars wec of point absorbers are mounted around the deepcwind semisubmersible the numerical results of the surge heave and pitch motions absorbed power and wave contour under multi point absorber are presented and discussed keywords deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform wavestar rao motions multi point absorber rotational pto damping power 1 introduction the wavestar machine attracts energy from wave power with floats that rise and fall with the up and down motion of waves the floats are attached by arms to a platform that stands on legs secured to the sea floor the motion of the floats is transferred via hydraulics into the rotation of a generator producing electricity as sketched in fig 1 a comprehensive works have been done by wavestar dong energy aalborg university and energinet dk during almost two decades to evaluate in practice the idea of combining the energy production from wind and wave technologies in the atlantic sea and the pacific ocean the rated effect of different configurations fig 1 b is shown the torque acted on the arm and then transmitted to the pto to extract the power output one approach of the wavestar configuration with 60 float has a rated effect of 18 mw and provides the possibility to add a wind turbine of 9 mw as shown in fig 1 c wavestar is currently requesting the european union eu for support through horizon 2020 in may wavestar has formed an industrial consortium with the purpose to produce the first full scale 1 mw wavestar wec to be tested commercially the consortium behind the eu application consists among others of stx ifp en dnv and aalborg gent and cantabria universities wavestarenergy website 2020 although the wind energy industry matured this industry suitable for only specific locations and limited to a relatively shallow depth site at further depths floating foundations become more competitive than fixed bottom foundations van 2017 in addition the offshore wind turbines are becoming more attractive than onshore wind turbines because wind direction and speed are more consistent across the deep water offshore areas than onshore areas in the future combining wave energy converters and floating wind turbine into one hybrid system could result in higher energy achievement and lower costs which could make offshore energy cost competitive with fossil fuels according to international renewable energy agency irena in general 67 of the current wave energy converter wec concepts are floating and 64 of wecs have been planned for offshore application and more than half of wec are point absorbers irena 2014 in particular three different types of point absorber wecs can be categorized by energy conversion principles bottom referenced submerged heave buoy e g ceto buoy mann 2011 small bottom referenced heaving buoy e g sea based sea based 2018 and floating two body heaving converter e g wavebob weber et al 2009 to absorb more power production by wec they are usually used in wave farms or arrays there are two different types of point absorber arrays namely floating and bottom fixed heave buoy arrays the first type is a group of wec attached to a platform from the upside e g wavestar hansen et al 2013 or bottom side e g pontoon power converter 2018 while the second type is an optimized layout of heaving buoys attached to the seabed since wave energy technology is not fully developed still particularly due to the high costs of the technology the suitable combination of wecs and offshore wind turbine in the same platform provides significant opportunities to increase the system energy yield and reduce the cost of power production because electrical infrastructure the mooring system and other structural components can be shared by one platform ding et al 2015 besides due to the environmentally relation between wave and wind conditions barth and eecen 2006 the idea of wave and wind technological synergies is gaining further attractive so this reduces the space required for arrays of such devices borg et al 2013 currently there are numerous of hybrid wind wave energy concepts in different stages of development which can be mounted on the semisubmersible platform tension leg platforms tlps and spars substructure in general terms a spar is a deep draft floating platform and this property leads to lower response in heave motion than semisubmersible platform and reduced wave exciting forces in the vertical direction but because the spar type has small water plane area contribution it makes more roll and pitch motions tlps have better angular and heave platform motions but there are three major problems for tlp system the first one is the complexity of the mooring and cost of installation the second one is the structural frequency coupling between the tendon and mast and the last one is the effect of tidal variations on the mooring line tension roddier et al 2010 undoubtedly the windwavefloat wwf is one of the best known hybrid wind wave energy concept and combine the wecs and the wind turbine as a one hybrid system the windfloat is a triangular semisubmersible wind turbine platform formed by 3 columns and integrated with four different types of wecs the hywind is the other type of floating wind turbine one possible way for the adding wecs into the hywind floating platform is a torus shape wec to be installed around a core of the spar this concept has been proposed and investigated by moan et al 2012 under the name the spar torus concept stc hywind platform and motions in extreme weather conditions as well as power production have been investigated by several studies moan et al 2012 muliawan et al 2013a muliawan et al 2013b and muliawan et al 2013c another type of hybrid system is based on the tlp which can be combined with three point absorbers bachynski et al 2013 or rotating flaps gao et al 2016 the combination of a multi point absorber wave energy converter mpawec and a pressure coupling hydrostatic transmission proposed by do et al 2018 mathematical models of the hydraulic components were presented and simulations were carried out they showed that the overall efficiency of the proposed system is 27 3 recently kamarloei et al 2020 presented an experimental study of wavestar wave energy converters concentrically arranged and attached on a floating offshore platform model their experimental results showed that the interaction between buoys and platform has a positive effect on the platform heave and pitch motions cheng et al 2019 carried out fully coupled simulations of hydrodynamic responses for the stc concept and evaluated its power performance li et al 2018a b c d studied the aero hydro mooring coupled analysis in time domain to predict the power production and dynamic responses of a hybrid offshore floating

based on cases with the input wave height h 0 1m wave period t 1 4s wavelength λ 3 06 m and wave steepness h λ 0 033 the obtained results have acceptable values compared to the experimental data presented by windt et al 2020 for all scenarios of both pto position and velocity inspection of fig 4 reveals that the amplitude of the position is decreased when the damping value increases when the damping is zero the amplitude of the position is around 2 5 cm but for damping is 200 nms the amplitude of the position is about 0 5 cm 3 3 deepcwind validation in order to validate the numerical results of the rao response motions for the deepcwind semisubmersible platform test data due to wave excitation seven different regular waves were considered and the response of this platform in the absence of wind was investigated the selected sea states characterized by period t and wave height h for regular waves are listed in table 3 fig 5 compares the predicted platform motion rao values in surge heave and pitch with those of the experimental data inspection of fig 5 shows that there is relatively good agreement between numerical results and experimental data for deepcwind semisubmersible floating platform at three motions of the surge heave and pitch under seven sea states rao surge is minimum at regular wave 1 while maximum rao surge is found at regular waves 4 and 7 for rao heave difference between maximum and minimum are very much which are 0 05 m and 1 3 respectively there is not so much difference for all regular waves regarding to the rao pitch the numerical results of fairlead tension are also compared with the experimental data for regular wave 5 with h 10 304 m and t 12 1s to achieve the desired steady state result for both experimental test hall and goupee 2015 and the numerical simulation in time domain simulations in ansys aqwa were done till 1060 s the time history of mooring line tension in fairlead is shown in fig 6 for mooring line 1 and mooring lines 2 and 3 it should be indicated that due to the symmetry between mooring line 2 and 3 similar results were obtained this comparison shows that simulation results for the mooring line is good agreement with the data from model tests nevertheless it can be observed that there is relatively a good agreement between the deepcwind test data and numerical simulation results 4 results and discussion the semisubmersible platform consists of the three pillar column and a tower for wind turbine connecting some rods between them three wavestar point absorbers ws1 ws2 and ws3 are mounted around the platform as shown in fig 7 the radius of all wavestar point absorbers in this work is 5 m here the effect of the pto damping results of the raos and absorbed power are presented and discussed 4 1 pto damping effect to achieve the highest power production eight pto damping coefficients are considered and the obtained results are compared in fig 8 under regular wave with a height of 1 2 m and a wave period of 9 5 s it is indicated that the power production is obtained for pto damping from 5e7 to 2e8 n m s which have an uptrend for all three wavestar and then show a downtrend for pto damping between 2e8 4e8 n m s power production for ws1 and ws3 is similar due to symmetrical arrangement according to extracted power given in fig 8 the highest power is obtained when the pto damping is around 2e8 nms b p t o 2 e 8 n m s in this point the extracted power of the ws2 is given 16 higher than ws1 or ws3 hereafter the all results are calculated and presented when the pto damping value is 2e8 nms and pto stiffness is zero k p t o 0 4 2 different configurations of the multi point absorber of wavestar to study the effect of wavestar on the global responses of the deepcwind semisubmersible platform as well as the power production hybrid wave wind system include different number of wavestar and a floating wind turbine on a deepcwind semisubmersible platform has been investigated the wecs system consist of 3 groups of point absorber that are placed 120 apart each group of point absorber consists of 1 2 3 and 4 wavestar respectively with 20 deg difference in the radial direction clockwise to each other fig 9 shows the position of the wavestar ws in 4 case studies of hybrid wave wind system in top view 4 3 raos the time history of the rao heave motion for deepcwind platform and wavestar for 4 case studies are compared in fig 10 simulations are carried out for airy wave condition with the wave height of 1 2 m and wave period of 9 5 s and for two wave directions it can be seen that out phase displacement for wavestar and the platform could result in higher energy achievement see fig 14 for instance as shown in fig 10 in the case of 12 wavestar and wave direction 0 ws1 is nearly out of phase with platform while ws4 is almost in phase with the platform movement hence according to fig 10 low energy achievement belong to ws4 20 kw and high energy achievement belong to ws1 77 8 kw overall the same phase leads to lower power production and vice versa as can be seen in fig 11 by increasing the wavestar number in both wave directions 0 and 180 deepcwind pitch motions decrease hence adding wavestar can lead to better stability of platform addition to boost energy production fig 12 indicates that adding wavestar can reduce surge motion that may be due to wave path change induced by wavestar fig 13 compares the results of platform rao motion for different wavestars at different wave periods result shows that increasing wave period from 6 s to 12 s reduce heave motion in all four case study pitch motion increase for wave period from 6 s to 9 s and then decrease from 9 s to 12 s surge motion shows that increasing wave period leads to decreasing platform surge motion 4 4 wave elevation to observe the effect of wave elevation around hybrid wave wind system wave contours in both wave directions 0 and 180 is shown in fig 14 as shown in this figure wave structure interaction changes wave height and direction due to radiation and diffraction that produce by wavestar and platform movement orientation of each structure relative to wave incident direction influence on wave height and direction in this effect on wavestar performance the wavestar stiffness is lower than that of the platform while the wavestar due to the low stiffness and its size has less effect on the wave surface contours than platform 4 5 absorbed power fig 15 compares the results of absorbed power for different wavestars at two wave directions 0 and 180 deg from the comparison between all four case studies means 3 6 9 and 12 wavestar it can be observed that in general the absorbed power in wave direction of 180 is bigger than wave direction of 0 it is also evident that the total absorbed power in wave direction of 180 for 3 wavestars is 36 larger than that of the wave direction of 0 besides it is found that by increasing the number of wavestars the difference between total powers for both wave direction become lower so for 6 9 and 12 wavestars total powers is 32 26 and 17 respectively differences between results in two directions have two main reasons the first is wavestar orientation relative incident wave direction it is clear in all case studies that closer orientation leads to higher power the second reason is because wave structure interaction changes wave height and direction and this leads to the most amount of power for a suitable position of wavestar than wave direction fig 16 shows the all wavestar power in different wave period with constant wave height equal to 1 2 m it is indicated that when the number of wavestar are 9 and 12 ws1 absorbed more power in case of 6 wavestars ws1 and ws3 produce more power and in the case of 3 wavestars the ws2 gives more power fig 17 shows total absorbed power for different wavestar numbers versus wave period with increasing the wavestar numbers lead to increase total absorbed power as can be observed for 3ws the total power changes very small against wave period while for 12ws it is significantly changed generally for all number of ws the maximum power occurs when the wave period equals to 8 s except for 3ws and 6ws are found higher absorbed power at wave period of 6 s in order to better compare between the presented systems different parameters can be presented capture width ratio cwr is given by c w r t o t a l p o w e r w w a v e p o w e r w m f l o a t d i a m e t e r m where d 10 m is the float diameter in all case study and wave power can be written as follow p w a v e ρ g 2 h 2 t b 32 π so that b is the width of wave crest and is considered equal to 1 m by defining the cwr to rao ratio as c w r f l o a t n u m b e r r a o p l a t f o r m for different wave periods the corresponding plots are obtained and shown in fig 18 as shown in this figure in heave motion increasing wave periods leads to decreasing absorbed power to rao ratio for all different wavestar number in pitch motion by increasing wave periods from 6 s to 9 s the power to rao ratio decreases and then increases from 9 s to 12 s in the case of surge motion from 6 s to 7 s its ratio increase and then decrease from 7 s to 12 s generally increasing wavestar number lead to increasing the absorbed power to rao ratio for all wave periods also more power is obtained when the wave period is around 6 and 7 s 5 conclusion this paper presented a hybrid wind wave energy concept include wecs by point absorbers and deepcwind floating turbine that simulated for chahbahar coastal environmental conditions with wave height of 1 2 m and wave period of 9 5 s and water depth of 100 m the wavestar concept selected as suitable point absorbers in synergy with floating wind turbine supported by deepcwind semisubmersible platform this wecs concentrically arrangement and attached to a semisubmersible structure the time domain analysis was performed to investigate the effects of wavestar numbers on power production and platform movement for two different wave directions the bem was employed as a numerical method in time domain and frequency domain analysis by ansys aqwa software the most important results of these analyses are given below the power production is greatly dependent on the damping coefficient and the suitable value of the damping coefficient is obtained by 2e8 n m s for hybrid system with floating wavestar in the case of 3 wavestars the power production in ws2 was 16 percent higher than ws1 ws3 because ws2 has better orientation than ws1 or ws3 relative to wave direction more wavestar can lead to better stability of the hybrid system by reducing the platform pitch motion in phase displacement between wavestar and platform could result in higher energy achievement wave structure interaction can change wave height and direction due to radiation and diffraction that produce by the movement of the wavestar and platform orientation of each structure relative to wave incident direction influence on wave height and direction in this effect on wavestar performance in general the power production in wave direction 180 is larger than wave direction 0 the total power production in wave direction equals180 for 3 wavestars is 36 larger than that of the zero angle wave direction by increasing the number of wavestar the difference between total power for both wave directions become lower so for 6 9 and 12 wavestar in wave direction equal to zero total powers is 32 26 and 17 lower than wave direction equals 180 respectively closer orientation between wavestar and wave direction leads to a higher power increasing wavestar number leads to increasing the power to rao ratio for all wave periods increasing wave period from 6 s to 12 s reduces heave and surge motions in all four case studies pitch motion increases for wave period from 6 s to 9 s and then decreases from 9 s to 12 s funding there are no any financial support and no
