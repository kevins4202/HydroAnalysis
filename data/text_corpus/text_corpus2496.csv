12480,the perforated baffle can significantly enhance the performance of the constructed wetland in the present study the effects of perforation shape number of baffles baffle position and perforation location on the flow pattern of wetlands were investigated using nacl impulse response tracer test and perforated baffles were used to improve the nitrogen removal rate of the constructed wetland the perforated baffle optimizes the flow pattern by reducing the peak height of the rtd curve and delaying the peak occurrence time triangle perforation exhibits better flow pattern optimization due to its smaller area when the inlet flow rate is 100 ml min the mean residence time tm increases by 0 25 h the position of the perforated baffle has a more significant effect on the flow pattern being able to better extend hydraulic residence time hrt when located at the height of h 2 substrate in addition the perforation locations of two adjacent baffles are not on the same vertical line which can increase the horizontal water flow velocity and improve the space utilization of the wetland compared to the control check constructed wetland ckcw without baffles the perforated baffled constructed wetland pbcw exhibited a higher nh4 n removal rate of 84 53 7 48 during stable operation this is mainly because the perforated baffle improves the utilization of dissolved oxygen do while improving the water flow distribution and extending the hrt in conclusion perforated baffles have considerable potential to alleviate shock loading and enhance the performance of constructed wetlands graphical

introduction as the economic level of china s rural areas has increased significantly the amount of domestic sewage discharge has also increased leading to a yearly increase in pollutant discharge loads 1 2 it not only destroys the rural water environment but also has a great potential risk to the water safety of rural residents compared with urban domestic sewage rural domestic sewage has the remarkable characteristics of decentralized discharge and imperfect sewage network which makes it difficult to carry out centralized sewage treatment mode in rural areas 3 4 decentralized sewage treatment technology can realize the nearby treatment and utilization of domestic sewage which is more suitable for rural areas 5 7 constructed wetland as a decentralized sewage treatment process relying on the triple synergistic effect of physical chemical and microorganisms can efficiently treat sewage and has been widely used in rural areas because of its low cost simple operation easy management and high landscape value 8 9 rural domestic sewage is a typical unsteady flow the peak discharge periods are mostly concentrated in the daily mealtime with the highest water consumption from 6 30 8 30 am and 18 30 20 30 pm and smaller discharges in the evening 10 12 however in the current research on the treatment of rural domestic sewage by constructed wetlands the fluctuation of water inflow is often ignored and continuous flow with relatively stable water inflow is adopted this actually does not conform to the flow characteristics of rural domestic sewage the hydraulic load rate hlr is closely related to the removal of pollutants previous studies have shown that the removal rate of pollutants decreases with the increase of hlr when unsteady flow enters the constructed wetland the shock loading changes the water level and volume within the wetland causing significant changes in the internal flow pattern which in turn exhibits unsteady treatment performance 13 14 the flow pattern determines the hydraulic residence time hrt of the constructed wetland under the shock loading the hrt of the system is greatly shortened and the contact time between pollutants and plants substrates and microorganisms is insufficient resulting in a rapid decrease in pollutant removal rate within a short period of time singh and chakraborty 15 found that when experiencing heavy rainfall the hrt of unsheltered constructed wetland was shortened and the sulfate removal rate was only 51 34 which was significantly lower than that of sheltered constructed wetland 60 29 in addition influent flow plays an important role in regulating the density structure distribution and activity of microorganisms attached to the constructed wetlands 16 18 sudden changes in influent flow have the potential to scour away microorganisms attached to the wetland thereby greatly reducing the water purification performance of the wetland 19 sukias et al 20 found that after the shock loading ceases it usually takes 2 4 days for constructed wetlands to recover or nearly so to the previous treatment level therefore when treating unsteady flow such as rural domestic sewage the constructed wetland is required to have certain resilience that is the system has sufficient resistance and recovery to cope with shock loading 21 multi stage constructed wetlands also known as combined wetlands have been widely used in recent years to treat unsteady flow by combining the same type or different types of constructed wetlands to enhance the hydraulic and biochemical processes they have a better buffering capacity to cope with shock loading 22 24 jiang and chui 25 found that multi stage constructed wetlands can still ensure stable treatment performance under seasonal changes storm events and shock loadings of pollutants li et al 26 used a five stage surface flow constructed wetland in the treatment of rural domestic wastewater the pollutant removal rate can reach 90 although multi stage constructed wetlands can achieve relatively stable pollutant removal rates they usually require larger footprints and more complex structures which also increases the difficulty of operation saeed et al 27 designed a floating constructed wetland without expanding the footprint using the mature root system of large plants and a complex biofilm network to enhance system resistance the removal rate of nh4 n was consistently maintained between 40 0 and 56 0 under continuous enhanced hydraulic shock loading however the floating constructed wetland is strongly dependent on the plant roots and is highly influenced by the season and the plants can hardly function during the seedling stage as well as the wilting stage therefore in order to realize the sustainability of constructed wetland in rural domestic sewage treatment it is very necessary to build an efficient wetland system that neither increases the footprint nor is affected by seasons as we all know pollutants in wetlands are removed in the process of flowing with water therefore the removal mechanism of pollutants can be enhanced by optimizing the flow pattern 28 29 in recent years the use of baffles to modify the internal structure of wetlands to achieve flow pattern optimization has received widespread attention sathe and munavalli 30 used baffles to induce plug flow in conventional bio rack wetland system cbrws and found that baffles have a more significant removal effect on dissolved organics than using multispecies vegetation jain et al 31 developed a novel composite baffled horizontal flow constructed wetland filter unit bhfcw fu which expands the flow path by 9 times overcoming the large area requirements of traditional constructed wetland and achieving removal efficiencies of 99 50 93 73 and 87 05 for turbidity phenol and cod respectively however wang et al 32 obtained through numerical simulations that when the water flow is blocked by the baffle to change the direction of motion it will inevitably lead to a certain dead zone shih and wang 33 proposed that short circuit flow and dead zones can be avoided when water flows uniformly through a wetland pistoresi et al 34 used computational fluid dynamics cfd and a transparent prototype to find that inserting perforated baffles under high flow rate conditions can significantly improve the uniformity of flow distribution zhang et al 35 aimed at the uneven flow distribution in traditional plenum chambers by inserting perforated plates to improve flow uniformity the flow distribution uniformity in typical chambers with an aspect ratio w h of 1 1 was improved by 87 50 pilotelli et al 36 used perforated plates in large size thermal energy storage to minimize the flow maldistribution of water layers at different temperatures forming an innovative internal flow distribution configuration for large thermal energy storage in addition perforated baffles are also used to reduce pressure and mitigate sloshing chen et al 37 applied perforated plate to high pressure reducing valve and found that perforated baffles can reduce both pressure and velocity gradients nimisha et al 38 utilized the concepts of computational fluid dynamics cfd to comprehensively consider various response parameters in numerical models of liquid tanks with perforated baffle plates and developed development of an efficient slosh damping configuration for the perforated baffle plate bellezi et al 39 numerically investigated the optimal geometry of the perforated vertical baffle plate to mitigate the sloshing in a rectangular tank under pitch excitation for different filling rates it can be seen that perforated baffles can not only improve the uniformity of water flow but also alleviate shock loading making them very suitable for enhancing the performance of constructed wetlands under unstable flow firstly perforated baffles are suitable for various types of constructed wetlands including surface flow horizontal subsurface flow and vertical flow secondly the perforated baffle has a simple structure does not need to increase the floor area of the wetland and has low daily maintenance costs more importantly perforated baffles have high potential for later application and development if the problem of rapid replacement of baffles can be solved a combination of parameters such as hole density size and shape can be used to quickly respond to different shock loading making it highly flexible in application although perforated baffles have been tried to do some applications in many fields to solve their practical problems with satisfactory results however after investigation there are no reports on perforated baffles being laid in constructed wetlands to improve performance this study systematically discussed the effect of perforated baffles on the flow pattern of constructed wetlands under unsteady flow a perforated baffled constructed wetland pbcw was constructed and its operation status was monitored for a long time the objectives of this study were 1 to verify the feasibility of perforated baffles to resist the shock loading 2 to reveal the mechanism of perforated baffles on flow pattern optimization 3 to identify the best way to lay the perforated baffle and 4 to evaluate the effect of perforated baffles on nitrogen removal performance of constructed wetlands thereby providing a new approach for enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands under unsteady flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 vfcw and perforation baffle design the experiments were conducted using a laboratory scale vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw installed at the school of water conservancy and environment university of jinan jinan china 116 96 e 36 61 n vfcw is made of pvc plastic and is a rectangular structure with length width and height of 0 25 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m respectively the outlet is set at the bottom of the vfcw and the height of the outlet pipe is adjusted according to the law of connected vessels to keep the internal water level in line with the substrate height to avoid the effect of different particle size matrix on the internal water flow pattern therefore only quartz sand with φ 10 20 mm was used for filling with a filling height of 40 cm after actual measurement the effective volume of the whole vfcw system was about 9 l the influent was tap water without any treatment which was delivered to the vfcw by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j longer chn the perforated baffle has a length and width of 25 cm this dimension is the same as the length and width of the vfcw to ensure that it can be placed horizontally in the internal substrate chen et al 37 mentioned that the typical parameters of perforated baffles include shape row orifice diameter etc and found that circular and rhombic perforations help achieve better hydrodynamics for hydrogen hao et al 40 also considered the perforation shape in their research on projectile impact resistance of perforated baffle and designed three different perforation shapes circle triangle and square it can be seen that the perforation shape always plays a key role in dealing with different types of shock loads gas liquid solid therefore this study selects three common perforation shapes including circle square and triangle with reference to the design of the above scholars each perforated baffle has 25 perforations the diameter of perforations circle or side length square and triangle d 2 cm and the distance between perforations l 2 cm fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of vfcw and perforated baffle used in this study 2 2 impulse response tracer test procedure in this study nacl was selected as the tracer in order to ensure that the quartz sand used in vfcw would not affect the concentration of nacl injected a static adsorption test was required place 400 ml of quartz sand repeatedly rinsed with distilled water into a 1000 ml beaker and then pour 500 ml of nacl solution with concentrations of 250 mg l 500 mg l and 1000 mg l measure the conductivity of the solution in the beaker every 30 min after 12 h the conductivity of the solution in the beaker did not change significantly indicating that the quartz sand did not have a strong adsorption effect on the nacl tracer in addition through three static adsorption experiments of nacl solutions with different concentrations the interference of nacl concentration on the experimental results was eliminated and it was finally determined that nacl was suitable as a tracer for this study the dosage of nacl was referred to our previous study 41 and the dosage was able to theoretically increase the conductivity of the water body within the whole vfcw by 200 μs cm before each tracer test increase the flow of water inlet and outlet to flush the substrate so as to avoid the influence of nacl added in the last experiment on the conductivity use a portable multi parameter analyzer hq30d hach usa to measure the conductivity of the influent multiple times and use the average value as the background value when the conductivity value of wetland effluent is close to the background value adjust the rotational speed of the peristaltic pump to obtain the required flow rate q referring to the method of sun et al 42 the nacl solution was instantaneously pulsed into vfcw the conductivity of the effluent is measured every minute until it recovers or approaches the background value and remains stable 2 3 hydraulic performance indices the residence time distribution density n t can be obtained by standardizing the instantaneous conductivity value according to eq 1 43 and then the residence time distribution density graph namely rtd curve can be obtained by plotting the time t as the abscissa from the repeated tracer tests the one with the highest nacl recovery rate was selected for rtd curve drawing and analysis 1 n t e t e w m n a c l q λ n a λ c l m where t is the time after the start of the pulse experiment h e t is the instantaneous conductivity value at the outlet at moment t s m ew denotes the reference background value s m mnacl is the molar mass of nacl g mol mnacl 58 44 g

residence time tn and the mean residence time tm are shown in eq 2 and eq 3 tn assumes that all water masses entering the constructed wetland flow out of the constructed wetland at the same time expressed as the ratio of the effective volume of the wetland to the volumetric flow rate in fact the flow of water inside the wetland does not have a similar path of motion and equal residence time as in the ideal state but will move in different routes and subsequently also have different hrt 2 t n v q 3 t m 0 n t tdt 0 n t dt where v is the effective volume m3 q is the volume flow rate m3 h the effective volume ratio e is the ratio of tm to tn when e is 1 it means that there is a rapid outflow phenomenon in the system and the water flow is concentrated along the priority flow channel to flow out of the system in a short period of time which shows that the rtd curve peaks very early and reaches the peak quickly when e is 1 there are stagnant areas inside the reaction system and it is difficult to flow out of the system once the water enters these areas in a short period of time 4 e t m t n in order to reflect the internal hydraulic performance of the constructed wetland substrate more comprehensively the peak time tp of rtd curve was considered by persson 44 tp was read directly on the rtd curve and the ratio of it to the tn was used as the hydraulic efficiency λ as shown in eq 5 λ 0 75 indicates good hydraulic efficiency 0 5 λ 0 75 indicates satisfactory hydraulic efficiency λ 0 5 indicates poor hydraulic efficiency 5 λ t p t n 2 4 construction and operation of pbcw the size of the pbcw is the same as the vfcw parameters described in 2 1 and a baffle with triangle perforation is placed at h 2 of the substrate height a control check constructed wetland ckcw without perforated baffles was also set up in the experiment the bed of pbcw and ckcw was sequentially packed from bottom to top with 10 cm of gravel as a support layer 30 cm of quartz sand as the main substrate layer which could provide adsorption sites for microorganisms and contaminants and 10 cm of the sand to grow plants acorus calamus l commonly found in rural areas was selected and planted at a density of 25 plants in each wetland system a perforated pvc pipe 50 cm high and 5 cm diameter was installed in the center of the systems for measuring dissolved oxygen do concentration inside the wetland system the systems were inoculated with activated sludge 50 ml 10 g tss l from reclaimed water treatment station of jinan university jinan china after inoculation was completed the wetland system was fed by a peristaltic pump with synthetic wastewater which included tap water nh4cl 191 mg l ch3coohna 192 4 mg l k2hpo4 3h2o 37 2 mg l feso4 7h2o 20 mg l mgso4 12 mg l and cacl2 22 5 mg l

mapping all statistical analyses were done using software spss 22 0 spss inc chicago usa the results were expressed as the mean values standard deviations x sd and the figures were produced using origin 2018 originlab inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of perforation shape on flow pattern perforated baffles with circle square and triangle perforation were placed at h 2 of the substrate height of the above vfcw and compared with the flow pattern without baffles as shown in fig 2a when the influent water is between 60 and 400 ml min each perforated baffle can slow down the flow rate inside the constructed wetland and extend the tm when the inlet flow rate is 100 200 ml min the baffle has the most obvious effect on extending tm among the three different perforation shapes triangle perforation has a better effect extending tm by 0 1 h especially when the inlet flow rate is 100 ml min tm can be extended by 0 25 h when the inlet flow rate is 100 200 ml min select the one with the highest nacl recovery in the tracer test to draw the rtd curve as shown in fig 2b d the rtd curves at each flow rate after adding perforated baffles with different perforation shapes have similarity with the case without baffles possessing the same number of peaks and variation trends among them the rtd curves with and without perforated baffle are double peaks at the inlet flow rate of 100 ml min fig 2b it indicates that there is a certain degree of short flow phenomenon inside the wetland at that inlet flow rate 45 part of the tracer enters the wetland and reaches the outlet quickly with the priority flow forming the first peak the rest of the tracer moves with the flow and then forms the second peak although adding perforated baffles cannot completely eliminate the short flow phenomenon it can delay the time when the tracer appears in the effluent in addition with the increase of inlet flow as shown in fig 2c and d the rtd curve becomes a single peak it can be seen that the short flow phenomenon in the wetland can be alleviated by appropriately increasing the inflow flow so that the internal flow gradually approaches the push flow pattern in general adding perforated baffles can change the internal flow pattern of vfcw by delaying the peak appearance and reducing the peak height thereby extending the hrt among the three perforation shapes the rtd curve with triangle perforations has the lowest peak height and the latest peak appearance time so it has the best effect on extending hrt use eq 4 and eq 5 to calculate the e and λ of a vfcw with different perforated baffles as shown in table 1 perforated baffles optimize the space utilization of the system with circle perforation and triange perforation improving e relatively significantly when the inlet flow is 100 ml min there is no difference in the e between square perforation and no baffle but the λ decreases significantly as can be seen from fig 2b d the rtd curve of square perforation first reaches the peak and rapidly falls back which indicates that there is a rapid outflow phenomenon of the water flow the water flows out of the system in a short time along the priority flow channel the difference in perforation area may be the main reason for the above phenomenon the areas of circle square and triangle perforation are π 4 and 3 respectively triangle perforation has water better blocking effect at the same inflow rate while square perforation with larger area tend to generate preferential flow therefore in addition to the inlet flow rate area of perforation is also the main factor causing the difference in hrt e and λ 3 2 effect of the number of perforated baffles on the flow pattern after determining that the perforated baffle can serve to optimize the flow pattern inside the constructed wetland the number of perforated baffles was further investigated the perforation shape is selected as a triangle and the number of baffles is increased from one to two respectively placed at h 3 and 2h 3 of the height of the wetland substrate layer in a previous study kilani and ogunrombi 46 mentioned that the higher the number of baffles in a pond the closer the pond is to the ideal push flow pattern and the higher the removal efficiency shahrokhi et al 47 also concluded that an appropriate increase in the number of baffles can dissipate the incoming kinetic energy and create a uniform flow field in the pond the more baffles the closer to the ideal push flow pattern the higher the removal efficiency however the results of this experiment are different from the above conclusions as shown in fig 3a the tm of two perforated baffles is slightly higher than that without baffles but it is significantly inferior to that of one perforated baffle when the flow rate is 100 ml min fig 3b the peak value of the rtd curve of the two perforated baffles is higher and reaches the peak value earlier as the flow rate increases fig 3c d the similarity of rtd curves gradually increases and the peak size and time to peak tend to be the same however compared to one perforated baffle the rtd curves of two perforated baffles fall back faster after reaching the peak as can be seen from table 2 the e and the λ of the two perforated baffles are also significantly worse than those of the one perforated baffle with the same results reflected by the tm and the rtd curves since the first perforated baffle near the inlet cannot block the water flow the flow path of the water to the second perforated baffle will be relatively larger in addition due to the acceleration of gravity on the flow the perforated baffle near the outlet cannot slow down the flow velocity the final reflection is that when two baffles are evenly laid the extension effect of hrt is worse than that of one baffle farjood et al 48 also found in his research on perforated baffles that baffles close to the inlet cannot effectively influence the flow but when placed far away from the inlet the incoming water will travel a longer distance with the initial velocity resulting in a decline in baffle performance 3 3 effect of baffle position and perforation location on flow pattern as the perforated baffle at the height of h 2 substrate has obviously optimized the flow pattern in the wetland combining the above findings we can speculate that when two perforated baffles are used only the first perforated baffle is placed at the height of h 2 substrate can achieve the optimization of the flow pattern therefore the placement position of the perforated baffles is changed from 2h 3 and h 3 of the substrate height to h 2 and h 4 meanwhile the perforation locations of the upper and lower baffles have also changed the perforation are located on the same vertical line and different vertical lines respectively to compare the effect of the perforation locations on flow pattern the specific settings are shown in fig 4 the effects of baffle position and perforation location on the tm are shown in fig 5a when the number of perforated baffles is two and the first baffle is placed at h 2 of the substrate height the extension effect on tm is close to that of one baffle among them when the perforation location is not on the same vertical line it has a better optimization effect on the water flow which is basically the same as the tm of one perforated baffle when the two baffle perforations are on the same vertical line as shown in fig 5b d the rtd curve starts to rise relatively earlier and reaches its peak relatively earlier the reason may be that the two baffles are close to each other which makes the water pass through the vertical upper and lower perforations quickly and the space utilization between the two baffles becomes lower so the rtd curve emerges and reaches the peak time relatively earlier when the perforation positions of the two baffles are not on the same vertical line the problem of water passing through the vertical upper and lower perforations quickly is avoided which increases the velocity of the water in the horizontal direction and the space utilization between the two baffles is improved so the tm is relatively longer the experimental results in table 3 also provide good support for the above analysis as the e and the λ increase slightly when the two baffle perforations are not on the same vertical line compared to the same vertical line however the tm e and λ were not significantly improved compared to the laying of one perforated baffle therefore under the condition that the perforated baffle has a certain perforation size the effect of baffle position on the flow pattern is more important compared to the number of baffles 3 4 long term nitrogen removal in pbcw the dynamics of nitrogen concentrations in ckcw and pbcw were monitored over the course of 170 days as shown in fig 6a the influent nh4 n concentration was always maintained at about 50 mg l under low temperature conditions the activities of plants and microorganisms will be limited leading to decreased nutrient removal performance in wetlands 49 after 120 days of operation there was a certain degree of increase in the effluent nh4 n concentration of both ckcw and pbcw due to the decrease in temperature the effluent nh4 n concentrations were 9 76 4 47 and 5 59 3 47 mg l for ckcw and pbcw respectively during the whole steady operation period thus the nh4 n removal efficiencies of ckcw and pbcw were 80 11 9 64 and 84 53 7 48 respectively the higher nh4 n removal by pbcw compared to ckcw indicated that pbcw was able to utilize longer hrt under the same influent conditions to allow fully contact of nitrogen with plant substrate and microorganism thus enhancing the nitrogen removal mechanism since the influent is simulated low c n ratio domestic wastewater the denitrification process will be limited by the carbon source so the effluent of both ckcw and pbcw showed different degrees of no3 n accumulation as shown in fig 6b the no3 n concentrations in the effluent of ckcw and pbcw were 18 99 3 56 and 19 88 4 58 respectively during the stable operation stage similar results have been reported in other studies of constructed wetlands treating low carbon to nitrogen ratio effluents 50 51 the higher nh4 n removal rate of pbcw was the main reason for the higher no3 n concentration in the effluent than that of ckcw no2 n is the intermediate product in the denitrification process as shown in fig 6c the no2 n concentration of ckcw and pbcw quickly reached the peak at the start up stage which were 1 263 mg l and 3 044 mg l respectively after that the no2 n concentrations decreased rapidly and the no2 n was almost absent in the effluent of ckcw and pbcw at about 50 days to further analyze the difference in nitrogen removal between ckcw and pbcw the do concentration changes in ckcw and pbcw were monitored as shown in fig 6d the average do concentration in ckcw during steady operation was 1 16 0 27 mg l however the average do concentration in pbcw was 1 11 0 5 mg l it is shown that perforated baffles improve the utilization of do while optimizing the internal flow pattern and extending the hrt in constructed wetlands 4 conclusions in this study the effects of perforation shape number of baffles baffle position and perforation location on the internal flow pattern of constructed wetlands were discussed and the improvement of nitrogen removal performance in constructed wetlands was achieved using perforated baffles the key findings of this study can be drawn as follows a perforated baffles can achieve an extension of tm by reducing the peak height and delaying the peak occurrence time of the rtd curve the perforation area is the main reason for the difference in hydraulic characteristics within constructed wetlands compared to circle and square perforation triangle with smaller perforation area can better cope with shock loading improve e and λ while avoiding causing priority flow b the position of perforated baffles is more important than the number of baffles in this study when two perforated baffles are installed and the first baffle is located at the height of the h 2 substrate the extension of tm and enhancement of hydraulic performance can be achieved in addition the perforation locations of the upper and lower baffles are on the different vertical line which can increase the horizontal flow velocity and improve the space utilization rate of the constructed wetlands c perforated baffles can improve the nitrogen removal performance of constructed wetlands during stable operation the nh4 n removal rate of pbcw reaches 84 53 7 48 pbcw can utilize longer hrt to make nitrogen more fully contact with plant substrate and microorganism more importantly the utilization rate of do is improved during this process thereby enhancing the biological nitrogen removal mechanism declaration of competing

location on the flow pattern of wetlands were investigated using nacl impulse response tracer test and perforated baffles were used to improve the nitrogen removal rate of the constructed wetland the perforated baffle optimizes the flow pattern by reducing the peak height of the rtd curve and delaying the peak occurrence time triangle perforation exhibits better flow pattern optimization due to its smaller area when the inlet flow rate is 100 ml min the mean residence time tm increases by 0 25 h the position of the perforated baffle has a more significant effect on the flow pattern being able to better extend hydraulic residence time hrt when located at the height of h 2 substrate in addition the perforation locations of two adjacent baffles are not on the same vertical line which can increase the horizontal water flow velocity and improve the space utilization of the wetland compared to the control check constructed wetland ckcw without baffles the perforated baffled constructed wetland pbcw exhibited a higher nh4 n removal rate of 84 53 7 48 during stable operation this is mainly because the perforated baffle improves the utilization of dissolved oxygen do while improving the water flow distribution and extending the hrt in conclusion perforated baffles have considerable potential to alleviate shock loading and enhance the performance of constructed wetlands graphical

cbrws and found that baffles have a more significant removal effect on dissolved organics than using multispecies vegetation jain et al 31 developed a novel composite baffled horizontal flow constructed wetland filter unit bhfcw fu which expands the flow path by 9 times overcoming the large area requirements of traditional constructed wetland and achieving removal efficiencies of 99 50 93 73 and 87 05 for turbidity phenol and cod respectively however wang et al 32 obtained through numerical simulations that when the water flow is blocked by the baffle to change the direction of motion it will inevitably lead to a certain dead zone shih and wang 33 proposed that short circuit flow and dead zones can be avoided when water flows uniformly through a wetland pistoresi et al 34 used computational fluid dynamics cfd and a transparent prototype to find that inserting perforated baffles under high flow rate conditions can significantly improve the uniformity of flow distribution zhang et al 35 aimed at the uneven flow distribution in traditional plenum chambers by inserting perforated plates to improve flow uniformity the flow distribution uniformity in typical chambers with an aspect ratio w h of 1 1 was improved by 87 50 pilotelli et al 36 used perforated plates in large size thermal energy storage to minimize the flow maldistribution of water layers at different temperatures forming an innovative internal flow distribution configuration for large thermal energy storage in addition perforated baffles are also used to reduce pressure and mitigate sloshing chen et al 37 applied perforated plate to high pressure reducing valve and found that perforated baffles can reduce both pressure and velocity gradients nimisha et al 38 utilized the concepts of computational fluid dynamics cfd to comprehensively consider various response parameters in numerical models of liquid tanks with perforated baffle plates and developed development of an efficient slosh damping configuration for the perforated baffle plate bellezi et al 39 numerically investigated the optimal geometry of the perforated vertical baffle plate to mitigate the sloshing in a rectangular tank under pitch excitation for different filling rates it can be seen that perforated baffles can not only improve the uniformity of water flow but also alleviate shock loading making them very suitable for enhancing the performance of constructed wetlands under unstable flow firstly perforated baffles are suitable for various types of constructed wetlands including surface flow horizontal subsurface flow and vertical flow secondly the perforated baffle has a simple structure does not need to increase the floor area of the wetland and has low daily maintenance costs more importantly perforated baffles have high potential for later application and development if the problem of rapid replacement of baffles can be solved a combination of parameters such as hole density size and shape can be used to quickly respond to different shock loading making it highly flexible in application although perforated baffles have been tried to do some applications in many fields to solve their practical problems with satisfactory results however after investigation there are no reports on perforated baffles being laid in constructed wetlands to improve performance this study systematically discussed the effect of perforated baffles on the flow pattern of constructed wetlands under unsteady flow a perforated baffled constructed wetland pbcw was constructed and its operation status was monitored for a long time the objectives of this study were 1 to verify the feasibility of perforated baffles to resist the shock loading 2 to reveal the mechanism of perforated baffles on flow pattern optimization 3 to identify the best way to lay the perforated baffle and 4 to evaluate the effect of perforated baffles on nitrogen removal performance of constructed wetlands thereby providing a new approach for enhanced nitrogen removal in constructed wetlands under unsteady flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 vfcw and perforation baffle design the experiments were conducted using a laboratory scale vertical flow constructed wetland vfcw installed at the school of water conservancy and environment university of jinan jinan china 116 96 e 36 61 n vfcw is made of pvc plastic and is a rectangular structure with length width and height of 0 25 m 0 25 m and 0 5 m respectively the outlet is set at the bottom of the vfcw and the height of the outlet pipe is adjusted according to the law of connected vessels to keep the internal water level in line with the substrate height to avoid the effect of different particle size matrix on the internal water flow pattern therefore only quartz sand with φ 10 20 mm was used for filling with a filling height of 40 cm after actual measurement the effective volume of the whole vfcw system was about 9 l the influent was tap water without any treatment which was delivered to the vfcw by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j longer chn the perforated baffle has a length and width of 25 cm this dimension is the same as the length and width of the vfcw to ensure that it can be placed horizontally in the internal substrate chen et al 37 mentioned that the typical parameters of perforated baffles include shape row orifice diameter etc and found that circular and rhombic perforations help achieve better hydrodynamics for hydrogen hao et al 40 also considered the perforation shape in their research on projectile impact resistance of perforated baffle and designed three different perforation shapes circle triangle and square it can be seen that the perforation shape always plays a key role in dealing with different types of shock loads gas liquid solid therefore this study selects three common perforation shapes including circle square and triangle with reference to the design of the above scholars each perforated baffle has 25 perforations the diameter of perforations circle or side length square and triangle d 2 cm and the distance between perforations l 2 cm fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of vfcw and perforated baffle used in this study 2 2 impulse response tracer test procedure in this study nacl was selected as the tracer in order to ensure that the quartz sand used in vfcw would not affect the concentration of nacl injected a static adsorption test was required place 400 ml of quartz sand repeatedly rinsed with distilled water into a 1000 ml beaker and then pour 500 ml of nacl solution with concentrations of 250 mg l 500 mg l and 1000 mg l measure the conductivity of the solution in the beaker every 30 min after 12 h the conductivity of the solution in the beaker did not change significantly indicating that the quartz sand did not have a strong adsorption effect on the nacl tracer in addition through three static adsorption experiments of nacl solutions with different concentrations the interference of nacl concentration on the experimental results was eliminated and it was finally determined that nacl was suitable as a tracer for this study the dosage of nacl was referred to our previous study 41 and the dosage was able to theoretically increase the conductivity of the water body within the whole vfcw by 200 μs cm before each tracer test increase the flow of water inlet and outlet to flush the substrate so as to avoid the influence of nacl added in the last experiment on the conductivity use a portable multi parameter analyzer hq30d hach usa to measure the conductivity of the influent multiple times and use the average value as the background value when the conductivity value of wetland effluent is close to the background value adjust the rotational speed of the peristaltic pump to obtain the required flow rate q referring to the method of sun et al 42 the nacl solution was instantaneously pulsed into vfcw the conductivity of the effluent is measured every minute until it recovers or approaches the background value and remains stable 2 3 hydraulic performance indices the residence time distribution density n t can be obtained by standardizing the instantaneous conductivity value according to eq 1 43 and then the residence time distribution density graph namely rtd curve can be obtained by plotting the time t as the abscissa from the repeated tracer tests the one with the highest nacl recovery rate was selected for rtd curve drawing and analysis 1 n t e t e w m n a c l q λ n a λ c l m where t is the time after the start of the pulse experiment h e t is the instantaneous conductivity value at the outlet at moment t s m ew denotes the reference background value s m mnacl is the molar mass of nacl g mol mnacl 58 44 g

residence time tn and the mean residence time tm are shown in eq 2 and eq 3 tn assumes that all water masses entering the constructed wetland flow out of the constructed wetland at the same time expressed as the ratio of the effective volume of the wetland to the volumetric flow rate in fact the flow of water inside the wetland does not have a similar path of motion and equal residence time as in the ideal state but will move in different routes and subsequently also have different hrt 2 t n v q 3 t m 0 n t tdt 0 n t dt where v is the effective volume m3 q is the volume flow rate m3 h the effective volume ratio e is the ratio of tm to tn when e is 1 it means that there is a rapid outflow phenomenon in the system and the water flow is concentrated along the priority flow channel to flow out of the system in a short period of time which shows that the rtd curve peaks very early and reaches the peak quickly when e is 1 there are stagnant areas inside the reaction system and it is difficult to flow out of the system once the water enters these areas in a short period of time 4 e t m t n in order to reflect the internal hydraulic performance of the constructed wetland substrate more comprehensively the peak time tp of rtd curve was considered by persson 44 tp was read directly on the rtd curve and the ratio of it to the tn was used as the hydraulic efficiency λ as shown in eq 5 λ 0 75 indicates good hydraulic efficiency 0 5 λ 0 75 indicates satisfactory hydraulic efficiency λ 0 5 indicates poor hydraulic efficiency 5 λ t p t n 2 4 construction and operation of pbcw the size of the pbcw is the same as the vfcw parameters described in 2 1 and a baffle with triangle perforation is placed at h 2 of the substrate height a control check constructed wetland ckcw without perforated baffles was also set up in the experiment the bed of pbcw and ckcw was sequentially packed from bottom to top with 10 cm of gravel as a support layer 30 cm of quartz sand as the main substrate layer which could provide adsorption sites for microorganisms and contaminants and 10 cm of the sand to grow plants acorus calamus l commonly found in rural areas was selected and planted at a density of 25 plants in each wetland system a perforated pvc pipe 50 cm high and 5 cm diameter was installed in the center of the systems for measuring dissolved oxygen do concentration inside the wetland system the systems were inoculated with activated sludge 50 ml 10 g tss l from reclaimed water treatment station of jinan university jinan china after inoculation was completed the wetland system was fed by a peristaltic pump with synthetic wastewater which included tap water nh4cl 191 mg l ch3coohna 192 4 mg l k2hpo4 3h2o 37 2 mg l feso4 7h2o 20 mg l mgso4 12 mg l and cacl2 22 5 mg l

mapping all statistical analyses were done using software spss 22 0 spss inc chicago usa the results were expressed as the mean values standard deviations x sd and the figures were produced using origin 2018 originlab inc usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of perforation shape on flow pattern perforated baffles with circle square and triangle perforation were placed at h 2 of the substrate height of the above vfcw and compared with the flow pattern without baffles as shown in fig 2a when the influent water is between 60 and 400 ml min each perforated baffle can slow down the flow rate inside the constructed wetland and extend the tm when the inlet flow rate is 100 200 ml min the baffle has the most obvious effect on extending tm among the three different perforation shapes triangle perforation has a better effect extending tm by 0 1 h especially when the inlet flow rate is 100 ml min tm can be extended by 0 25 h when the inlet flow rate is 100 200 ml min select the one with the highest nacl recovery in the tracer test to draw the rtd curve as shown in fig 2b d the rtd curves at each flow rate after adding perforated baffles with different perforation shapes have similarity with the case without baffles possessing the same number of peaks and variation trends among them the rtd curves with and without perforated baffle are double peaks at the inlet flow rate of 100 ml min fig 2b it indicates that there is a certain degree of short flow phenomenon inside the wetland at that inlet flow rate 45 part of the tracer enters the wetland and reaches the outlet quickly with the priority flow forming the first peak the rest of the tracer moves with the flow and then forms the second peak although adding perforated baffles cannot completely eliminate the short flow phenomenon it can delay the time when the tracer appears in the effluent in addition with the increase of inlet flow as shown in fig 2c and d the rtd curve becomes a single peak it can be seen that the short flow phenomenon in the wetland can be alleviated by appropriately increasing the inflow flow so that the internal flow gradually approaches the push flow pattern in general adding perforated baffles can change the internal flow pattern of vfcw by delaying the peak appearance and reducing the peak height thereby extending the hrt among the three perforation shapes the rtd curve with triangle perforations has the lowest peak height and the latest peak appearance time so it has the best effect on extending hrt use eq 4 and eq 5 to calculate the e and λ of a vfcw with different perforated baffles as shown in table 1 perforated baffles optimize the space utilization of the system with circle perforation and triange perforation improving e relatively significantly when the inlet flow is 100 ml min there is no difference in the e between square perforation and no baffle but the λ decreases significantly as can be seen from fig 2b d the rtd curve of square perforation first reaches the peak and rapidly falls back which indicates that there is a rapid outflow phenomenon of the water flow the water flows out of the system in a short time along the priority flow channel the difference in perforation area may be the main reason for the above phenomenon the areas of circle square and triangle perforation are π 4 and 3 respectively triangle perforation has water better blocking effect at the same inflow rate while square perforation with larger area tend to generate preferential flow therefore in addition to the inlet flow rate area of perforation is also the main factor causing the difference in hrt e and λ 3 2 effect of the number of perforated baffles on the flow pattern after determining that the perforated baffle can serve to optimize the flow pattern inside the constructed wetland the number of perforated baffles was further investigated the perforation shape is selected as a triangle and the number of baffles is increased from one to two respectively placed at h 3 and 2h 3 of the height of the wetland substrate layer in a previous study kilani and ogunrombi 46 mentioned that the higher the number of baffles in a pond the closer the pond is to the ideal push flow pattern and the higher the removal efficiency shahrokhi et al 47 also concluded that an appropriate increase in the number of baffles can dissipate the incoming kinetic energy and create a uniform flow field in the pond the more baffles the closer to the ideal push flow pattern the higher the removal efficiency however the results of this experiment are different from the above conclusions as shown in fig 3a the tm of two perforated baffles is slightly higher than that without baffles but it is significantly inferior to that of one perforated baffle when the flow rate is 100 ml min fig 3b the peak value of the rtd curve of the two perforated baffles is higher and reaches the peak value earlier as the flow rate increases fig 3c d the similarity of rtd curves gradually increases and the peak size and time to peak tend to be the same however compared to one perforated baffle the rtd curves of two perforated baffles fall back faster after reaching the peak as can be seen from table 2 the e and the λ of the two perforated baffles are also significantly worse than those of the one perforated baffle with the same results reflected by the tm and the rtd curves since the first perforated baffle near the inlet cannot block the water flow the flow path of the water to the second perforated baffle will be relatively larger in addition due to the acceleration of gravity on the flow the perforated baffle near the outlet cannot slow down the flow velocity the final reflection is that when two baffles are evenly laid the extension effect of hrt is worse than that of one baffle farjood et al 48 also found in his research on perforated baffles that baffles close to the inlet cannot effectively influence the flow but when placed far away from the inlet the incoming water will travel a longer distance with the initial velocity resulting in a decline in baffle performance 3 3 effect of baffle position and perforation location on flow pattern as the perforated baffle at the height of h 2 substrate has obviously optimized the flow pattern in the wetland combining the above findings we can speculate that when two perforated baffles are used only the first perforated baffle is placed at the height of h 2 substrate can achieve the optimization of the flow pattern therefore the placement position of the perforated baffles is changed from 2h 3 and h 3 of the substrate height to h 2 and h 4 meanwhile the perforation locations of the upper and lower baffles have also changed the perforation are located on the same vertical line and different vertical lines respectively to compare the effect of the perforation locations on flow pattern the specific settings are shown in fig 4 the effects of baffle position and perforation location on the tm are shown in fig 5a when the number of perforated baffles is two and the first baffle is placed at h 2 of the substrate height the extension effect on tm is close to that of one baffle among them when the perforation location is not on the same vertical line it has a better optimization effect on the water flow which is basically the same as the tm of one perforated baffle when the two baffle perforations are on the same vertical line as shown in fig 5b d the rtd curve starts to rise relatively earlier and reaches its peak relatively earlier the reason may be that the two baffles are close to each other which makes the water pass through the vertical upper and lower perforations quickly and the space utilization between the two baffles becomes lower so the rtd curve emerges and reaches the peak time relatively earlier when the perforation positions of the two baffles are not on the same vertical line the problem of water passing through the vertical upper and lower perforations quickly is avoided which increases the velocity of the water in the horizontal direction and the space utilization between the two baffles is improved so the tm is relatively longer the experimental results in table 3 also provide good support for the above analysis as the e and the λ increase slightly when the two baffle perforations are not on the same vertical line compared to the same vertical line however the tm e and λ were not significantly improved compared to the laying of one perforated baffle therefore under the condition that the perforated baffle has a certain perforation size the effect of baffle position on the flow pattern is more important compared to the number of baffles 3 4 long term nitrogen removal in pbcw the dynamics of nitrogen concentrations in ckcw and pbcw were monitored over the course of 170 days as shown in fig 6a the influent nh4 n concentration was always maintained at about 50 mg l under low temperature conditions the activities of plants and microorganisms will be limited leading to decreased nutrient removal performance in wetlands 49 after 120 days of operation there was a certain degree of increase in the effluent nh4 n concentration of both ckcw and pbcw due to the decrease in temperature the effluent nh4 n concentrations were 9 76 4 47 and 5 59 3 47 mg l for ckcw and pbcw respectively during the whole steady operation period thus the nh4 n removal efficiencies of ckcw and pbcw were 80 11 9 64 and 84 53 7 48 respectively the higher nh4 n removal by pbcw compared to ckcw indicated that pbcw was able to utilize longer hrt under the same influent conditions to allow fully contact of nitrogen with plant substrate and microorganism thus enhancing the nitrogen removal mechanism since the influent is simulated low c n ratio domestic wastewater the denitrification process will be limited by the carbon source so the effluent of both ckcw and pbcw showed different degrees of no3 n accumulation as shown in fig 6b the no3 n concentrations in the effluent of ckcw and pbcw were 18 99 3 56 and 19 88 4 58 respectively during the stable operation stage similar results have been reported in other studies of constructed wetlands treating low carbon to nitrogen ratio effluents 50 51 the higher nh4 n removal rate of pbcw was the main reason for the higher no3 n concentration in the effluent than that of ckcw no2 n is the intermediate product in the denitrification process as shown in fig 6c the no2 n concentration of ckcw and pbcw quickly reached the peak at the start up stage which were 1 263 mg l and 3 044 mg l respectively after that the no2 n concentrations decreased rapidly and the no2 n was almost absent in the effluent of ckcw and pbcw at about 50 days to further analyze the difference in nitrogen removal between ckcw and pbcw the do concentration changes in ckcw and pbcw were monitored as shown in fig 6d the average do concentration in ckcw during steady operation was 1 16 0 27 mg l however the average do concentration in pbcw was 1 11 0 5 mg l it is shown that perforated baffles improve the utilization of do while optimizing the internal flow pattern and extending the hrt in constructed wetlands 4 conclusions in this study the effects of perforation shape number of baffles baffle position and perforation location on the internal flow pattern of constructed wetlands were discussed and the improvement of nitrogen removal performance in constructed wetlands was achieved using perforated baffles the key findings of this study can be drawn as follows a perforated baffles can achieve an extension of tm by reducing the peak height and delaying the peak occurrence time of the rtd curve the perforation area is the main reason for the difference in hydraulic characteristics within constructed wetlands compared to circle and square perforation triangle with smaller perforation area can better cope with shock loading improve e and λ while avoiding causing priority flow b the position of perforated baffles is more important than the number of baffles in this study when two perforated baffles are installed and the first baffle is located at the height of the h 2 substrate the extension of tm and enhancement of hydraulic performance can be achieved in addition the perforation locations of the upper and lower baffles are on the different vertical line which can increase the horizontal flow velocity and improve the space utilization rate of the constructed wetlands c perforated baffles can improve the nitrogen removal performance of constructed wetlands during stable operation the nh4 n removal rate of pbcw reaches 84 53 7 48 pbcw can utilize longer hrt to make nitrogen more fully contact with plant substrate and microorganism more importantly the utilization rate of do is improved during this process thereby enhancing the biological nitrogen removal mechanism declaration of competing

sulphate in 20 ml 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi solutions respectively as previously stated similar optimum ph time and nanocomposite mass dose parameters were used the effect of adsorptive capture temperature factor is typically used to monitor and observe how the sorption process varies when the reaction temperature rises or decreases this was performed by 25 0 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite dosage using u vi solution 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 and varied masses 2 40 mg at the specified optimum ph time and the applied temperatures were 298 308 and 328 k the procedure was then finished following the previous steps and the thermodynamic parameters were estimated at these temperatures to evaluate the regeneration of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite and desorption of the captured u vi from surface 0 5 g of the nano rgo tio2 cmc was mingled with 200 ml of u vi 30 mg l 1 and shaking for 30 min the desorption liquid 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl was combined nano rgo tio2 cmc u vi and shaken for 1 h then this mixture was filtrated desiccated and reused in successive capture processes of u vi for repetitive five times 2 4 adsorptive capture of u vi using multistage micro column water samples from diverse sources were collected and used to assess the ability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite for adsorptive capture and uptake of u vi each sample was anatomized for the u vi identification before being spiked or sent directly onto the packed multistage micro column comprised of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the treatment and removal of u vi from diverse water samples such as drinking water sea water and industrial effluent were examined and carried out as follows a 1 0 l water was run on a packed micro column using 100 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite under a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 by air pressure the outflowing was compiled to investigate and determine u vi concentration the average capture values of u vi from various water samples by nano rgo tio2 cmc were measured and calculated using eq 1 where co mg l 1 is the metal concentration before the removal process and c is the metal concentration after recovery by the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the structural conformation and characterization of the assembled nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were carried out utilizing several instrumentations as tga xrd ft ir sem and surface area analysis sem was implemented to investigate the morphology of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite this revealed a homogeneous particles distribution in aggregate structures fig 1a depicts the shape and particle size of nano rgo tio2 cmc representing homogenous and uniformly distributed particles the particle size range of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was determined and found as 15 41 26 42 nm moreover fig 1b demonstrates the hr tem image of nano rgo tio2 cmc with magnification order x50 000 to clearly refer to 15 67 nm as the average particle size the ft ir investigation of go rgo nano tio2 cmc and the newly fabricated nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is presented in fig 2 the ft ir spectrum of go refers to a large number of various oxygen containing functional groups due to the oxidation process the weak peak at 2972 8 cm 1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of ch group while the peak at 1706 cm 1 corresponds to co the other peaks at 1571 5 and 1475 1 cm 1 are related to cc and coh bond vibrations respectively another peak appears at 1042 4 cm 1 is due to co vibrational of epoxy peroxide or ether groups all the above peaks are distinguishing the go structure however in the case of rgo the accredited bands at 1706 1475 1 and 1042 4 cm 1 of cooh coh and co groups respectively were declined in their intensity due to the partial reduction of these groups furthermore all other related peaks were found less intense due to the reduction process 39 the ft ir of nano tio2 denotes to the existence of multiple characteristic peaks at 3461 3 and 1649 5 cm 1 of oh and tioh respectively strong bands at 482 3 and 603 1 cm 1 are related to tio bond and stretching mode of tioti respectively 40 the ft ir spectrum of cmc is distinguished by the presence of five firm peaks at 1738 9 1586 1 1370 1 1219 8 and 1047 3 cm 1 which are directly ascribed to co co ch cc and coh of primarily alcohol bonds receptively moreover two other bands at 3251 6 and 2922 cm 1 are referring to the oh and ch stretching respectively the ft ir spectrum of the nano rgo tio2 cmc exhibited a new peak at 540 1 cm 1 to prove the coupling between ti and o of rgo and cmc generally the bands at 1300 1600 cm 1 were produced due to the formation of ti o c vibration which confirm the effective interaction between titanium and carbon and thus the impregnation of tio2 on rgo besides the absorption band below 1000 cm 1 in nano rgo tio2 cmc composite indicates a combination of tioti and tioc vibrations due to the chemical interaction of tio2 with rgo furthermore the peak intensities at 1737 cm 1 co and 1219 cm 1 coh were significantly weakened in the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite finally the ft ir studies affirm that titanium oxide and cmc have been grafted onto the surface of rgo during the preparation process the x ray diffraction pattern of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was also studied the predicted positions of distinct nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite characteristic peaks are shown in fig 3a this revealed multiple strong reflections unique peaks at 2θ 36 42 54 57 63 and 69 based on the xrd pattern presented in fig 3a these peaks are characteristic of tio2 and rgo in composite crystallite nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 44 in addition several other peaks at 2θ 19 28 32 46 and 57 are evident for the existence of cmc in the assembled nanocomposite 45 moreover the computed particle size of nano rgo tio2 cmc 16 88 nm as determined by bragg s equation is close to the identified value from the sem no noticeable xrd peaks from impurities indicated that the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was purely synthesized tga was also monitored to provide data on the heat degradation of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the tga thermogram of the novel nano rgo tio2 cmc is shown in fig 3b it is evident that the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite exhibit three successive degradation steps the first thermal decomposition process was attributed to water molecule volatilization attached to the surface of the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite at a temperature ranging from 33 5 to 180 2 c in a 1 73 mg loss 10 67 loss the weight loss in the second decomposition stage of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was 25 5 at a temperature ranging from 180 2 to 310 5 c resulting from the degradation of functional groups containing oxygen into tio2 cmc and rgo 46 then the weight loss in the third decomposition step was 7 68 at 310 5 800 c and this result is because more stable functional groups have been eliminated besides these results are primarily related to the total loss of cmc and the partial breakdown of rgo according to fig 3c the sorption desorption isotherm is categorized as a type iii to indicate that the adsorbent adsorbate interaction is weaker than the adsorbate adsorbate interaction according to the bet method the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite exhibited a surface area 10 9 m2 g a pore volume 0 345 m3 g 1 and an average pore radius 16 6 ao 3 2 u vi adsorptive capture properties by nano rgo tio2 cmc the characteristics of u vi adsorptive capture are determined mainly by the collaboration between the u vi and surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 47 this procedure is of tremendous industrial and environmental significance due to its potential uses in removing u vi from the aquatic environment and industrial cleanup assessing u vi adsorptive capture r is an essential way to evaluate the adsorption performance of the newly nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite several major regulating parameters are relevant in assessing u vi capture from contaminated water in the case of batch adsorption the effects of contact solution ph contact time mass of employed nanocomposite initial u vi concentration and the influence of competing species are used in the micro column method flow rate influences the removal of u vi with varied concentrations 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 from water by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 3 2 1 the ph contribution in u vi capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc the role of ph on the recovery of u vi by the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was investigated as one of the most critical predominate factors in the adsorptive capture process 12 48 this experiment was carried out at a range of ph 1 0 10 0 using various concentrations of u vi such as 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the values of u vi adsorptive capture were then computed as illustrated in fig 4a the extraction efficiency of different concentrations of u vi was inhibited at low ph 1 3 owing to high solubility of u vi ions at low ph values furthermore u vi exist in the most mobile ions uo2 2 at low ph while the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is positively charged under this condition the active binding surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were occupied by hydrogen ions to favor strong electrostatic repulsion and to lower the adsorptive capture of u vi however as the ph of the contact solution increased to 4 and 5 the surface of nano rgo tio2 cmc became less positively charged and the electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged u vi decreased leading to an improvement in the adsorptive capture process the identified maximum adsorptive capture values of u vi ph 5 and 6 was corresponding to 91 9 and 93 2 30 mg l 1 u vi concentration 93 2 and 94 1 15 mg l 1 u vi concentration as well as 84 6 and 97 6 5 mg l 1 u vi concentration respectively thus one can conclude that with increasing the ph of contact solution the electrostatic dissonance between the two interrelating species was dropped the surface charge of the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is nearly constant across the ph range 1 4 as detected in fig 4b as an illustration of the point of zero charge as a result increasing the ph to 5 6 may enhance the adsorptive capture percentage values because the change of uo2 2 into other species such as positively charged hydroxyl u vi variants rather than functional groups on the nanocomposite surface as previously reported 12 48 these forms of conversion which are primarily dependent on the value of ph resulted in the existence of uo2 4 oh 2 6 uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 4 oh 6 2 and uo2 2 oh 2 2 at ph 4 0 4 5 5 0 and 6 0 respectively because these hydroxyl u vi species are positively charged and larger than uo2 2 ions they have a high propensity to bind with the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite as illustrated in fig 4a however the decrease in u vi adsorptive capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was shown as the ph increased 6 0 this behavior is due to the generation of some negatively charged hydroxy u vi species such as uo2 oh 5 3 uo3 oh 3 uo2 oh 4 2 and uo2 3 oh 8 2 that have a lower propensity to bind with the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite as the positively charged ions are only able to extract under such high ph conditions 49 50 3 2 2 effect of contact time on adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc and kinetic study batch adsorption approach was implemented to assess the influence of time on the adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the importance of the time effect was mainly aimed at monitoring the rapidness of binding and adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc 51 the investigation of time effect was applied at 1 30 min using optimum ph 6 mass dosage 25 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite with three different concentrations of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the adsorptive capture values for u vi vs time are revealed in fig 4c the findings of this research factor indicate that the maximum adsorptive capture values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were reached to 93 2 and 94 1 at 10 min of contact time upon using 30 mg l 1 and 5 min upon using 15 mg l 1 initial u vi concentrations respectively to confirm rapid extraction and recovery of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc when the initial u vi concentration was 5 mg l 1 the adsorptive capture values remained consistent versus the increase in contact duration from 1 to 30 min after one minute of shaking the maximum adsorptive capture percentage values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were obtained yielding 97 6 these results confirm that the adsorptive capture of u vi ions by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was highly fast and independent on the contact time at low initial u vi with the maximum interaction between nanocomposite and u vi reaching at 1 min kinetic models and their evaluations are critical because they help in understanding the adsorption design and mechanism in this study nano rgo tio2 cmc was found to remove nearly all u vi in one minute and then stabilized to reach equilibrium fig 4c this is owing to the accumulation of u vi with increasing contact time making it nearly impossible to diffuse further into the adsorbent structure at higher energy sites this result demonstrates that the kinetics system was speedy which is advantageous because fast kinetics are highly desired in some applications so the kinetic models cannot be utilized to designate the adsorption performance of u vi at low concentrations 5 and 10 mg l 1 in contrast 30 mg l 1 data were used to fit with four models and the kinetic results are provided table 3 and fig 1s the pseudo first order was not applicable due to the concluded r2 value 0 5693 the pseudo second order appears to be more appropriate for representing the data of adsorptive capture of u vi r2 0 9999 to indicate that it is the most acceptable kinetic expression to describe the u vi adsorption for pseudo second order the qe cal 22 5 mg g 1 was found close to the qe exp 22 3 mg g 1 to refer that the presence of a majority of functionalities for interactions between u vi and nano rgo tio2 cmc the characterized r2 values were 0 8708 and 0 7722 by elovich and intraparticle diffusion models respectively it can be illustrious that the linear fit curves of these two models did not exhibit better adaptableness so this finding indicates that there was no chemical adsorption between the activation sites on the nano rgo tio2 cmc surface and u vi the outcomes of this study refer that the dominant factor influencing u vi adsorptive capture is the electrostatic interaction between ionic groups onto the nano rgo tio2 cmc with u vi 3 2 3 effect of nanocomposite dosage on adsorptive capture of u vi the influence of nanocomposite dosage is usually a significant contribution to the nanocomposite sorbate combination process and the capture removal values of u vi ions this factor depends on comparing u vi and accessible surface functionalities from the amount used of nanocomposite as a result adsorptive capture of u vi ions was monitored and assessed under optimal buffering conditions and varied dosages ranging from 2 to 40 mg the starting u vi concentrations were 5 15 or 30 mg l 1 and the outlined results are graphed in fig 4d it is evident that as the dose of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was increased the adsorptive capture of u vi increased at low nanocomposite dosages as 2 5 mg the percentage values were found 77 2 78 4 and 71 8 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively accordingly the u vi concentration is deficient when compared versus the nanocomposite mass dose at low nanocomposite mass dosages the number of surface active functionalities were smaller than the number of u vi in the solution these data also explain the competition for binding with surface functional groups that are readily and easily accessible 49 furthermore the highest recovery values of u vi were determined to be 93 2 30 mg l 1 94 1 15 mg l 1 and 97 6 5 mg l 1 by using 25 30 and 40 mg respectively increasing the dosage of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was identified to enhance the availability of increased i active functionalities ii surface area and iii applicable sites for sorption this situation is expected to achieve sufficient interaction between the positive charge u vi and the functional groups onto nano rgo tio2 cmc 3 2 4 initial u vi concentration on adsorptive capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc and isotherm models the initial u vi concentration governs the sorption process this factor was carried out under ph 6 0 10 min contact time and 25 mg nanocomposite mass as illustrated in fig 4e the u vi adsorptive capture using nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were detected as 97 2 94 1 and 93 1 respectively when the starting concentration of uo2 2 in solution was chosen as 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 furthermore upon using 50 60 70 and 80 mg l 1 concentrations the percentage adsorptive capture of u vi were detected as 93 6 92 9 91 3 and 89 3 respectively this behavior is related to the presence of excess of u vi compared to the number of surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 52 to understand the adsorption mechanism the isotherms for the adsorption process must be evaluated the experimental data are suggested to be meticulously modeled using applicable linear see fig 2s and nonlinear models via langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r these models were utilized to assess the fitting process of u vi capture onto nano rgo tio2 cmc and the computed parameters from these models are compiled in table 4 and presented in fig 5 it is evident that the characterized r2 values by langmuir are close to 1 0 for the linear 0 9976 and nonlinear 0 9815 to refer to monolayer capture interaction of u vi capture onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the most critical adsorptive parameter is the qmax values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc which were found 39 27 mg g 1 for linear and 99 35 mg g 1 nonlinear according to the langmuir results furthermore freundlich isotherm relays on multilayer adsorption on nano rgo tio2 cmc surface with no interaction between adsorbed species 43 the n values were identified as 1 53 and 1 64 for linear and nonlinear expressions respectively these values show that nano rgo tio2 cmc has a good affinity for efficient capture of u vi the temkin adsorption energy values bt were identified as 195 05 j mol 1 for both linear and nonlinear expressions these results refer to a chemical adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the fitting of data of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc confirmed that the d r model results were significantly closer to freundlich and langmuir as seen by the r2 values the e value indicates whether the adsorption mechanism as either chemical or physical adsorption it is generally known that the magnitude of e values between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 refer to a chemical adsorption interaction and the e values 8 kj mol 1indicate aphysical adsorption mechanism the computed e values for adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc were characterized as 8 28 and 14 61 kj mol 1 by linear and nonlinear expressions respectively to indicate and reveal that the binding of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was mainly based on a chemisorption process via an ion pair interaction and complex formation 53 54 3 2 5 effect of competing ions on adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc other coexisting and competitive ions in water may influence the capture and uptake of u vi by the constructed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite this experiment was studied at the optimal ph shaking time and nanocomposite mass as 6 0 15 min and 20 mg respectively fig 6 shows u vi recovery values compared to the removal values in the absence of competing species it shows that for various concentrations of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the adsorption capture and uptake of u vi was declined from 97 6 to 95 8 94 1 to 93 0 and 93 2 to 88 9 in presence of zinc sulphate respectively according to the previous results this behavior is related to the ability of zinc ions and u vi to compete for attachment to the same surface functionalities on the surface of nano rgo tio2 cmc the adsorption percentages for another set of competing ions were found to change from 97 0 to 97 6 93 0 to 94 1 and 92 3 to 93 1 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively based on the outlined results in fig 6 the adsorptive capture of u vi was found less significant in presence of nacl kcl and nh4no3 by providing u vi percentage removal as 97 0 93 0 97 6 93 1 and 97 2 93 0 respectively to account for the less interfering behavior of these salts as well as their contributions with respect to ionic strength factor similarly cacl2 and mgso4 were found to also exhibit less impact on the adsorptive capture of u vi by providing 97 0 92 3 and 97 1 92 3 respectively therefore it is concluded that k i na i nh4 mg ii and ca ii were not competing to bind with the active surface sites on nano rgo tio2 cmc to favor less interfering contribution on the adsorptive capture of u vi 55 3 2 6 temperature contribution on adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc and thermodynamic study this factor is typically used to monitor and observe how the sorption process varies under different reaction temperatures the temperature influence on the tendency of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 removal by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was investigated at ph 6 0 10 min and 20 mg dosage using three different temperatures 25 35 and 55 c 56 and table 5 compiles the results of this study the lowest detected adsorptive capture values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc were determined at 55 c as 75 0 89 8 and 92 1 by 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi concentrations respectively under the sorption operation at 25 c the highest percentage values were yielded as 83 1 94 1 and 94 3 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi concentrations respectively these data denote that the newly constructed nanocomposite could capture and recover u vi from water over a varied temperature the δg δh and δs thermodynamic parameters were also computed and evaluated in this study eqs 9 11 are generally employed to calculate δg δh and δs as provided in table 2 the intercept and slope from the generated straight line between ln k vs 1000 t were used to obtain the values of δh and δs table 6 the computed δh were found 13 02 15 03 and 9 85 kj mol 1 for 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively these results indicate that the process of adsorption is exothermic for 5 mg l 1 the δg values were 3 39 2 88 and 2 39 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively for 15 mg l 1 the δg values were 6 32 5 43 and 5 32 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively for 30 mg l 1 the δg values were 6 40 6 48 and 6 09 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively these findings demonstrate that when the temperature increased the δg values increased furthermore the negative δg values confirm that the adsorptive capture values of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was spontaneous by facilitating the adsorption operation 12 so the u vi adsorption at low temperatures is desirable moreover the computed enthalpy values were 31 84 29 35 and 11 09 j mol 1 k 1 besides the negative values of δs indicate a decrease in randomness u vi species at the solid liquid boundary in the adsorption process 12 43 3 3 adsorptive capture of u vi from water samples by nano rgo tio2 cmc the potential applicability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite in adsorptive capture values of u vi from diverse water samples was evaluated using a micro column method 17 water samples were sampled from tap seawater and industrial utility and spiked with u vi at 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 table 7 summarizes the recovery data of u vi from the numerous water samples for 5 mg l 1 u vi the removal percentage from tap water sea water and wastewater using nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were determined to be 99 5 1st 95 3 3rd and 94 8 3rd respectively the percentage recovery of u vi from tap water sea water and wastewater utilizing nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 15 mg l 1 u vi reached 97 6 93 3 and 93 5 after the third fourth and third trial respectively in the case of 30 mg l 1 u vi 96 9 3rd 92 5 4th and 94 1 4th were recovered from tap water sea water and wastewater utilizing nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the outlined results refer to the maximal potential adsorptive capture of u vi from various water matrices after the first or third run for 5 mg l 1 u vi whereas 15 and 30 mg l 1 were established after the third or fourth runs 3 4 desorption regeneration and reusability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite many attempts have been made to recycle the utilized nanocomposite regenerate and reuse the regenerated form 43 following repeated processing cycles the competency of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is of a significant economic aspect in this hcl was employed as a recycling agent to regenerate the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite according to the inquiry the adsorptive capture values of u vi were 95 8 94 38 93 18 and 85 58 for the first second third and fourth cycles respectively after the 5th cycle the effectiveness of u vi capture and uptake was 83 3 according to the listed findings the reusability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is superior with respect to recovery of u vi from various real water matrices as a result the evaluated nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite demonstrated reasonable reuse potential indicating that water contaminants can be recovered frequently 4 conclusion this study was established to assess the adsorption proficiency via adsorptive capture of u vi by the assembled nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite from aqueous solutions sem assessment determined that the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite achieved a nanosized range 15 41 26 42 nm it was found that nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite resulted in 97 7 94 1 and 93 3 in u vi adsorptive capture at ph 6 0 for 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively langmuir expression was utilized to assess the fitting process of u vi adsorption onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the nano rgo tio2 cmc also exhibited rapid adsorptive capture by reaching up to 97 7 94 1 and 93 2 within 1 5 and 10 min respectively for 30 mg l 1 u vi the pseudo second order seemed appropriate for representing the u vi adsorption data the computed e values were characterized as 8 28 and 14 61 kj mol 1 by linear and nonlinear expressions respectively to indicate and reveal that the binding mechanism of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc is mainly based on a chemisorption type of interaction via ion pair and or complex formation according to thermodynamic parameters the negative δg values displayed that the adsorption capture and uptake of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was spontaneous which facilitated the adsorption operation the δh values indicated that the process of adsorption was exothermic the current nano rgo tio2 cmc revealed a tolerable adsorption removal after the 5th cycle of adsorption desorption process of u vi by using hcl as desorption agent besides the investigated nano rgo tio2 cmc retained good reutilizing stability with 83 3 u vi removal efficiency after the 5th stage the results proved that nano rgo tio2 cmc is a very appealing adsorbent for u vi as compared to other previously reported adsorbents table 8 and can be utilized in water remediation methods

carboxymethylcellulose cmc to create a newly designed nanocomposite nano rgo tio2 cmc via facile microwave heating technique the average particle size of this nanocomposite was determined by xrd as 16 88 nm several major influencing parameters were optimized to assess u vi capture and uptake by nano rgo tio2 cmc at the optimum ph 6 0 the maximum u vi capture were 93 2 30 mg l 1 94 1 15 mg l 1 and 97 6 5 mg l 1 rapid u vi recovery was established 5 10 min and the pseudo second order was referred as the appropriate model to represent the adsorptive capture of u vi r2 0 9999 langmuir model was

well as chemical radioactivity represent a substantial risk to humans 2 uranium mainly appears in the oxidation states 3 4 5 and 6 the radioactive heavy metal s most prevalent and stable oxidation states are the tetravalent and hexavalent states manifesting as the linear u vi as uo2 2 in acidic aqueous solutions 3 6 while uranium iv is insoluble in water and often precipitates uranium vi produces soluble ions and can thus be swallowed posing severe health concerns to humans 7 uranium penetrates the water resources from the mining process and nuclear industry expansion 8 9 the impact of u vi penetration in some bodily organs such as kidneys lungs brain and liver health problems including chronic renal dysfunction congenital difficulties immune system damage and various cancers have been reported 8 uranium removal from wastewater has become a key topic in environmental chemistry 10 21 because of the low uranium concentration levels characterization and detection of uranium

employed for removal of uranium from wastewater was also reported 35 graphene has attracted exciting applications due to its unique physicochemical and biological characteristics 10 the graphene intrinsic features are generally improved when mixed with different metal oxides and organic polymers creating a synergistic impact in various applications 23 graphene oxide go is a kind of graphite that may be mechanically and oxidatively treated to develop new adsorbents for organic contaminants in wastewater as capturing of u vi in addition graphene oxide based nanocomposites have been proposed as specific materials and therefore attracted interest for numerous applications including sensing gas storage biomedical applications drug delivery energy storage catalysis and separation due to their high porosity and unique structural characteristics moreover go and its reduced form rgo have emerged as superior uranium adsorbents 36 37 based on the above facts a novel nanocomposite was devised to generate multi functionalized nanocomposite by surface impregnating titanium dioxide tio2 and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc onto reduced graphene oxide rgo to produce nano rgo tio2 cmc the reason for selection of cmc is mainly based on the presence of hydroxyl functional groups which are aimed to load on the surface of the designed nanocomposite to enable strong binding with u vi via different modes of interaction sem ft ir xrd tga and bet surface area analysis were used to characterize the developed new nanocomposite with the aim to investigate the performance of nano rgo tio2 cmc as a novel nanocomposite for the adsorptive capture of u vi from water samples by the batch and micro column systems all experimental controlling parameters were monitored optimized and evaluated according to capture reaction ph nanocomposite mass dose u vi concentration temperature shaking time and other competing ion species 2 experimental 2 1 reagents table 1 list out and compiles

the following steps were used to synthesize go according to a previously described method 38 in a 500 ml beaker 2 0 g of graphite flakes were supplemented to nano3 and then concentrated h2so4 98 was added to the blend of graphite flakes hno3 over a beaker of ice with stirring for 2 h after that 6 0 g of potassium permanganate was slowly added to the resulting mixture at temperature 15 c the resulting mixture was transferred to a heated plate with a magnetic stirrer at 35 c under continuous stirring for 2 days until a pale brownish color was obtained continue dilution by adding 200 ml of distilled water dw with continuously stirring finally 10 ml of h2o2 was inserted into the dilute solution to terminate the reaction resulting in a yellow suspension the resultant was rinsed and centrifuged with hcl 10 followed by numerous rounds of washing dw the generated substance go was filtered dried at 95 c and then treated with hydrazine hydrate to produce rgo 39 2 2 2 synthesis of rgo

desiccated at 60 c for 6 h to produce the aimed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite scheme 1 depicts a graphical representation for the production of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 2 2 4 standard uranium solution the stock solution was prepared from u vi acetate 1000 mg l 1 and the working solutions of u vi were prepared by successive dilution the u vi concentration was detected by the l ascorbic acid method via a uv vis spectrophotometric methodology at λmax 360 nm 41 2 3 adsorptive capture studies of uranium vi the following batch approach was used to explore the influence of ph on the adsorptive capture and uptake of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 25 0 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was added to 20 ml 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi solution in a measuring flask the ph of the solution described above was monitored to the desired ph using either hcl or naoh ph 1 0 10 0 after that the resultant was shaken at ambient temperature for 10 min a uv vis spectrophotometric methodology was used to determine the absorbance of u vi at λmax 360 nm the method above was repeated 3 times and the average value was computed according to eq 1 as listed in table 2 to calculate the u vi recovery the salt addition method was performed to figure out the point of zero charge phpzc of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite in this 40 ml of sodium chloride 0 01 mol l 1 was mixed with 0 2 g of nano rgo tio2 cmc and the initial ph phi was changed from 2 to 10 by adding 0 1 mol l 1 of naoh or hcl these blends were mixed at room temperature for 4 h and after reaching to the equilibration at 24 h the final ph value of each solution was detected by graphing δph ph final initial beginning versus phi the phpzc of nano rgo tio2 cmc was detected 42 43 the following approach was used to examine the contribution of contact time 25 0 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was combined with 20 ml 5 15 and mg l 1 u vi solutions in a measuring flask with the appropriate ph condition and shaken for the nominated contact periods 1 0 30 0 min the mixture was then filtered and measured as mentioned above the influence of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite dosage mass was performed using u vi solution 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 varied masses 2 40 mg at the specified optimal ph and time parameters the procedure was then finished following the previous steps the initial u vi concentration factor was investigated by using the same volume of various u vi concentrations 5 80 mg l 1 and 25 0 mg as the optimum dosage mass of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the method was subsequently completed as described above using the optimal ph and time parameters langmuir freundlich temkin and d r expressions were testified in this study as the adsorption isotherm models following eq 5 8 as listed table 2 the impacts of competing ions such as potassium sodium calcium zinc and magnesium were also testified by dissolving 100 mg each of sodium chloride potassium chloride calcium chloride zinc sulphate and magnesium sulphate in 20 ml 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi solutions respectively as previously stated similar optimum ph time and nanocomposite mass dose parameters were used the effect of adsorptive capture temperature factor is typically used to monitor and observe how the sorption process varies when the reaction temperature rises or decreases this was performed by 25 0 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite dosage using u vi solution 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 and varied masses 2 40 mg at the specified optimum ph time and the applied temperatures were 298 308 and 328 k the procedure was then finished following the previous steps and the thermodynamic parameters were estimated at these temperatures to evaluate the regeneration of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite and desorption of the captured u vi from surface 0 5 g of the nano rgo tio2 cmc was mingled with 200 ml of u vi 30 mg l 1 and shaking for 30 min the desorption liquid 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl was combined nano rgo tio2 cmc u vi and shaken for 1 h then this mixture was filtrated desiccated and reused in successive capture processes of u vi for repetitive five times 2 4 adsorptive capture of u vi using multistage micro column water samples from diverse sources were collected and used to assess the ability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite for adsorptive capture and uptake of u vi each sample was anatomized for the u vi identification before being spiked or sent directly onto the packed multistage micro column comprised of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the treatment and removal of u vi from diverse water samples such as drinking water sea water and industrial effluent were examined and carried out as follows a 1 0 l water was run on a packed micro column using 100 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite under a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 by air pressure the outflowing was compiled to investigate and determine u vi concentration the average capture values of u vi from various water samples by nano rgo tio2 cmc were measured and calculated using eq 1 where co mg l 1 is the metal concentration before the removal process and c is the metal concentration after recovery by the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the structural conformation and characterization of the assembled nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were carried out utilizing several instrumentations as tga xrd ft ir sem and surface area analysis sem was implemented to investigate the morphology of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite this revealed a homogeneous particles distribution in aggregate structures fig 1a depicts the shape and particle size of nano rgo tio2 cmc representing homogenous and uniformly distributed particles the particle size range of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was determined and found as 15 41 26 42 nm moreover fig 1b demonstrates the hr tem image of nano rgo tio2 cmc with magnification order x50 000 to clearly refer to 15 67 nm as the average particle size the ft ir investigation of go rgo nano tio2 cmc and the newly fabricated nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is presented in fig 2 the ft ir spectrum of go refers to a large number of various oxygen containing functional groups due to the oxidation process the weak peak at 2972 8 cm 1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of ch group while the peak at 1706 cm 1 corresponds to co the other peaks at 1571 5 and 1475 1 cm 1 are related to cc and coh bond vibrations respectively another peak appears at 1042 4 cm 1 is due to co vibrational of epoxy peroxide or ether groups all the above peaks are distinguishing the go structure however in the case of rgo the accredited bands at 1706 1475 1 and 1042 4 cm 1 of cooh coh and co groups respectively were declined in their intensity due to the partial reduction of these groups furthermore all other related peaks were found less intense due to the reduction process 39 the ft ir of nano tio2 denotes to the existence of multiple characteristic peaks at 3461 3 and 1649 5 cm 1 of oh and tioh respectively strong bands at 482 3 and 603 1 cm 1 are related to tio bond and stretching mode of tioti respectively 40 the ft ir spectrum of cmc is distinguished by the presence of five firm peaks at 1738 9 1586 1 1370 1 1219 8 and 1047 3 cm 1 which are directly ascribed to co co ch cc and coh of primarily alcohol bonds receptively moreover two other bands at 3251 6 and 2922 cm 1 are referring to the oh and ch stretching respectively the ft ir spectrum of the nano rgo tio2 cmc exhibited a new peak at 540 1 cm 1 to prove the coupling between ti and o of rgo and cmc generally the bands at 1300 1600 cm 1 were produced due to the formation of ti o c vibration which confirm the effective interaction between titanium and carbon and thus the impregnation of tio2 on rgo besides the absorption band below 1000 cm 1 in nano rgo tio2 cmc composite indicates a combination of tioti and tioc vibrations due to the chemical interaction of tio2 with rgo furthermore the peak intensities at 1737 cm 1 co and 1219 cm 1 coh were significantly weakened in the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite finally the ft ir studies affirm that titanium oxide and cmc have been grafted onto the surface of rgo during the preparation process the x ray diffraction pattern of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was also studied the predicted positions of distinct nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite characteristic peaks are shown in fig 3a this revealed multiple strong reflections unique peaks at 2θ 36 42 54 57 63 and 69 based on the xrd pattern presented in fig 3a these peaks are characteristic of tio2 and rgo in composite crystallite nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 44 in addition several other peaks at 2θ 19 28 32 46 and 57 are evident for the existence of cmc in the assembled nanocomposite 45 moreover the computed particle size of nano rgo tio2 cmc 16 88 nm as determined by bragg s equation is close to the identified value from the sem no noticeable xrd peaks from impurities indicated that the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was purely synthesized tga was also monitored to provide data on the heat degradation of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the tga thermogram of the novel nano rgo tio2 cmc is shown in fig 3b it is evident that the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite exhibit three successive degradation steps the first thermal decomposition process was attributed to water molecule volatilization attached to the surface of the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite at a temperature ranging from 33 5 to 180 2 c in a 1 73 mg loss 10 67 loss the weight loss in the second decomposition stage of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was 25 5 at a temperature ranging from 180 2 to 310 5 c resulting from the degradation of functional groups containing oxygen into tio2 cmc and rgo 46 then the weight loss in the third decomposition step was 7 68 at 310 5 800 c and this result is because more stable functional groups have been eliminated besides these results are primarily related to the total loss of cmc and the partial breakdown of rgo according to fig 3c the sorption desorption isotherm is categorized as a type iii to indicate that the adsorbent adsorbate interaction is weaker than the adsorbate adsorbate interaction according to the bet method the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite exhibited a surface area 10 9 m2 g a pore volume 0 345 m3 g 1 and an average pore radius 16 6 ao 3 2 u vi adsorptive capture properties by nano rgo tio2 cmc the characteristics of u vi adsorptive capture are determined mainly by the collaboration between the u vi and surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 47 this procedure is of tremendous industrial and environmental significance due to its potential uses in removing u vi from the aquatic environment and industrial cleanup assessing u vi adsorptive capture r is an essential way to evaluate the adsorption performance of the newly nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite several major regulating parameters are relevant in assessing u vi capture from contaminated water in the case of batch adsorption the effects of contact solution ph contact time mass of employed nanocomposite initial u vi concentration and the influence of competing species are used in the micro column method flow rate influences the removal of u vi with varied concentrations 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 from water by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 3 2 1 the ph contribution in u vi capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc the role of ph on the recovery of u vi by the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was investigated as one of the most critical predominate factors in the adsorptive capture process 12 48 this experiment was carried out at a range of ph 1 0 10 0 using various concentrations of u vi such as 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the values of u vi adsorptive capture were then computed as illustrated in fig 4a the extraction efficiency of different concentrations of u vi was inhibited at low ph 1 3 owing to high solubility of u vi ions at low ph values furthermore u vi exist in the most mobile ions uo2 2 at low ph while the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is positively charged under this condition the active binding surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were occupied by hydrogen ions to favor strong electrostatic repulsion and to lower the adsorptive capture of u vi however as the ph of the contact solution increased to 4 and 5 the surface of nano rgo tio2 cmc became less positively charged and the electrostatic repulsion with the positively charged u vi decreased leading to an improvement in the adsorptive capture process the identified maximum adsorptive capture values of u vi ph 5 and 6 was corresponding to 91 9 and 93 2 30 mg l 1 u vi concentration 93 2 and 94 1 15 mg l 1 u vi concentration as well as 84 6 and 97 6 5 mg l 1 u vi concentration respectively thus one can conclude that with increasing the ph of contact solution the electrostatic dissonance between the two interrelating species was dropped the surface charge of the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is nearly constant across the ph range 1 4 as detected in fig 4b as an illustration of the point of zero charge as a result increasing the ph to 5 6 may enhance the adsorptive capture percentage values because the change of uo2 2 into other species such as positively charged hydroxyl u vi variants rather than functional groups on the nanocomposite surface as previously reported 12 48 these forms of conversion which are primarily dependent on the value of ph resulted in the existence of uo2 4 oh 2 6 uo2 3 oh 5 uo2 4 oh 6 2 and uo2 2 oh 2 2 at ph 4 0 4 5 5 0 and 6 0 respectively because these hydroxyl u vi species are positively charged and larger than uo2 2 ions they have a high propensity to bind with the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite as illustrated in fig 4a however the decrease in u vi adsorptive capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was shown as the ph increased 6 0 this behavior is due to the generation of some negatively charged hydroxy u vi species such as uo2 oh 5 3 uo3 oh 3 uo2 oh 4 2 and uo2 3 oh 8 2 that have a lower propensity to bind with the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite as the positively charged ions are only able to extract under such high ph conditions 49 50 3 2 2 effect of contact time on adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc and kinetic study batch adsorption approach was implemented to assess the influence of time on the adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the importance of the time effect was mainly aimed at monitoring the rapidness of binding and adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc 51 the investigation of time effect was applied at 1 30 min using optimum ph 6 mass dosage 25 mg of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite with three different concentrations of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the adsorptive capture values for u vi vs time are revealed in fig 4c the findings of this research factor indicate that the maximum adsorptive capture values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were reached to 93 2 and 94 1 at 10 min of contact time upon using 30 mg l 1 and 5 min upon using 15 mg l 1 initial u vi concentrations respectively to confirm rapid extraction and recovery of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc when the initial u vi concentration was 5 mg l 1 the adsorptive capture values remained consistent versus the increase in contact duration from 1 to 30 min after one minute of shaking the maximum adsorptive capture percentage values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were obtained yielding 97 6 these results confirm that the adsorptive capture of u vi ions by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was highly fast and independent on the contact time at low initial u vi with the maximum interaction between nanocomposite and u vi reaching at 1 min kinetic models and their evaluations are critical because they help in understanding the adsorption design and mechanism in this study nano rgo tio2 cmc was found to remove nearly all u vi in one minute and then stabilized to reach equilibrium fig 4c this is owing to the accumulation of u vi with increasing contact time making it nearly impossible to diffuse further into the adsorbent structure at higher energy sites this result demonstrates that the kinetics system was speedy which is advantageous because fast kinetics are highly desired in some applications so the kinetic models cannot be utilized to designate the adsorption performance of u vi at low concentrations 5 and 10 mg l 1 in contrast 30 mg l 1 data were used to fit with four models and the kinetic results are provided table 3 and fig 1s the pseudo first order was not applicable due to the concluded r2 value 0 5693 the pseudo second order appears to be more appropriate for representing the data of adsorptive capture of u vi r2 0 9999 to indicate that it is the most acceptable kinetic expression to describe the u vi adsorption for pseudo second order the qe cal 22 5 mg g 1 was found close to the qe exp 22 3 mg g 1 to refer that the presence of a majority of functionalities for interactions between u vi and nano rgo tio2 cmc the characterized r2 values were 0 8708 and 0 7722 by elovich and intraparticle diffusion models respectively it can be illustrious that the linear fit curves of these two models did not exhibit better adaptableness so this finding indicates that there was no chemical adsorption between the activation sites on the nano rgo tio2 cmc surface and u vi the outcomes of this study refer that the dominant factor influencing u vi adsorptive capture is the electrostatic interaction between ionic groups onto the nano rgo tio2 cmc with u vi 3 2 3 effect of nanocomposite dosage on adsorptive capture of u vi the influence of nanocomposite dosage is usually a significant contribution to the nanocomposite sorbate combination process and the capture removal values of u vi ions this factor depends on comparing u vi and accessible surface functionalities from the amount used of nanocomposite as a result adsorptive capture of u vi ions was monitored and assessed under optimal buffering conditions and varied dosages ranging from 2 to 40 mg the starting u vi concentrations were 5 15 or 30 mg l 1 and the outlined results are graphed in fig 4d it is evident that as the dose of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was increased the adsorptive capture of u vi increased at low nanocomposite dosages as 2 5 mg the percentage values were found 77 2 78 4 and 71 8 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively accordingly the u vi concentration is deficient when compared versus the nanocomposite mass dose at low nanocomposite mass dosages the number of surface active functionalities were smaller than the number of u vi in the solution these data also explain the competition for binding with surface functional groups that are readily and easily accessible 49 furthermore the highest recovery values of u vi were determined to be 93 2 30 mg l 1 94 1 15 mg l 1 and 97 6 5 mg l 1 by using 25 30 and 40 mg respectively increasing the dosage of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was identified to enhance the availability of increased i active functionalities ii surface area and iii applicable sites for sorption this situation is expected to achieve sufficient interaction between the positive charge u vi and the functional groups onto nano rgo tio2 cmc 3 2 4 initial u vi concentration on adsorptive capture by nano rgo tio2 cmc and isotherm models the initial u vi concentration governs the sorption process this factor was carried out under ph 6 0 10 min contact time and 25 mg nanocomposite mass as illustrated in fig 4e the u vi adsorptive capture using nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were detected as 97 2 94 1 and 93 1 respectively when the starting concentration of uo2 2 in solution was chosen as 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 furthermore upon using 50 60 70 and 80 mg l 1 concentrations the percentage adsorptive capture of u vi were detected as 93 6 92 9 91 3 and 89 3 respectively this behavior is related to the presence of excess of u vi compared to the number of surface functionalities on nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 52 to understand the adsorption mechanism the isotherms for the adsorption process must be evaluated the experimental data are suggested to be meticulously modeled using applicable linear see fig 2s and nonlinear models via langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r these models were utilized to assess the fitting process of u vi capture onto nano rgo tio2 cmc and the computed parameters from these models are compiled in table 4 and presented in fig 5 it is evident that the characterized r2 values by langmuir are close to 1 0 for the linear 0 9976 and nonlinear 0 9815 to refer to monolayer capture interaction of u vi capture onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the most critical adsorptive parameter is the qmax values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc which were found 39 27 mg g 1 for linear and 99 35 mg g 1 nonlinear according to the langmuir results furthermore freundlich isotherm relays on multilayer adsorption on nano rgo tio2 cmc surface with no interaction between adsorbed species 43 the n values were identified as 1 53 and 1 64 for linear and nonlinear expressions respectively these values show that nano rgo tio2 cmc has a good affinity for efficient capture of u vi the temkin adsorption energy values bt were identified as 195 05 j mol 1 for both linear and nonlinear expressions these results refer to a chemical adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the fitting of data of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc confirmed that the d r model results were significantly closer to freundlich and langmuir as seen by the r2 values the e value indicates whether the adsorption mechanism as either chemical or physical adsorption it is generally known that the magnitude of e values between 8 and 16 kj mol 1 refer to a chemical adsorption interaction and the e values 8 kj mol 1indicate aphysical adsorption mechanism the computed e values for adsorptive capture of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc were characterized as 8 28 and 14 61 kj mol 1 by linear and nonlinear expressions respectively to indicate and reveal that the binding of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was mainly based on a chemisorption process via an ion pair interaction and complex formation 53 54 3 2 5 effect of competing ions on adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc other coexisting and competitive ions in water may influence the capture and uptake of u vi by the constructed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite this experiment was studied at the optimal ph shaking time and nanocomposite mass as 6 0 15 min and 20 mg respectively fig 6 shows u vi recovery values compared to the removal values in the absence of competing species it shows that for various concentrations of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 the adsorption capture and uptake of u vi was declined from 97 6 to 95 8 94 1 to 93 0 and 93 2 to 88 9 in presence of zinc sulphate respectively according to the previous results this behavior is related to the ability of zinc ions and u vi to compete for attachment to the same surface functionalities on the surface of nano rgo tio2 cmc the adsorption percentages for another set of competing ions were found to change from 97 0 to 97 6 93 0 to 94 1 and 92 3 to 93 1 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively based on the outlined results in fig 6 the adsorptive capture of u vi was found less significant in presence of nacl kcl and nh4no3 by providing u vi percentage removal as 97 0 93 0 97 6 93 1 and 97 2 93 0 respectively to account for the less interfering behavior of these salts as well as their contributions with respect to ionic strength factor similarly cacl2 and mgso4 were found to also exhibit less impact on the adsorptive capture of u vi by providing 97 0 92 3 and 97 1 92 3 respectively therefore it is concluded that k i na i nh4 mg ii and ca ii were not competing to bind with the active surface sites on nano rgo tio2 cmc to favor less interfering contribution on the adsorptive capture of u vi 55 3 2 6 temperature contribution on adsorptive capture of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc and thermodynamic study this factor is typically used to monitor and observe how the sorption process varies under different reaction temperatures the temperature influence on the tendency of u vi 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 removal by nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite was investigated at ph 6 0 10 min and 20 mg dosage using three different temperatures 25 35 and 55 c 56 and table 5 compiles the results of this study the lowest detected adsorptive capture values of u vi by nano rgo tio2 cmc were determined at 55 c as 75 0 89 8 and 92 1 by 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi concentrations respectively under the sorption operation at 25 c the highest percentage values were yielded as 83 1 94 1 and 94 3 by using 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 u vi concentrations respectively these data denote that the newly constructed nanocomposite could capture and recover u vi from water over a varied temperature the δg δh and δs thermodynamic parameters were also computed and evaluated in this study eqs 9 11 are generally employed to calculate δg δh and δs as provided in table 2 the intercept and slope from the generated straight line between ln k vs 1000 t were used to obtain the values of δh and δs table 6 the computed δh were found 13 02 15 03 and 9 85 kj mol 1 for 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively these results indicate that the process of adsorption is exothermic for 5 mg l 1 the δg values were 3 39 2 88 and 2 39 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively for 15 mg l 1 the δg values were 6 32 5 43 and 5 32 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively for 30 mg l 1 the δg values were 6 40 6 48 and 6 09 kj mol 1 at 293 308 and 328 k respectively these findings demonstrate that when the temperature increased the δg values increased furthermore the negative δg values confirm that the adsorptive capture values of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was spontaneous by facilitating the adsorption operation 12 so the u vi adsorption at low temperatures is desirable moreover the computed enthalpy values were 31 84 29 35 and 11 09 j mol 1 k 1 besides the negative values of δs indicate a decrease in randomness u vi species at the solid liquid boundary in the adsorption process 12 43 3 3 adsorptive capture of u vi from water samples by nano rgo tio2 cmc the potential applicability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite in adsorptive capture values of u vi from diverse water samples was evaluated using a micro column method 17 water samples were sampled from tap seawater and industrial utility and spiked with u vi at 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 table 7 summarizes the recovery data of u vi from the numerous water samples for 5 mg l 1 u vi the removal percentage from tap water sea water and wastewater using nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite were determined to be 99 5 1st 95 3 3rd and 94 8 3rd respectively the percentage recovery of u vi from tap water sea water and wastewater utilizing nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite 15 mg l 1 u vi reached 97 6 93 3 and 93 5 after the third fourth and third trial respectively in the case of 30 mg l 1 u vi 96 9 3rd 92 5 4th and 94 1 4th were recovered from tap water sea water and wastewater utilizing nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite the outlined results refer to the maximal potential adsorptive capture of u vi from various water matrices after the first or third run for 5 mg l 1 u vi whereas 15 and 30 mg l 1 were established after the third or fourth runs 3 4 desorption regeneration and reusability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite many attempts have been made to recycle the utilized nanocomposite regenerate and reuse the regenerated form 43 following repeated processing cycles the competency of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is of a significant economic aspect in this hcl was employed as a recycling agent to regenerate the nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite according to the inquiry the adsorptive capture values of u vi were 95 8 94 38 93 18 and 85 58 for the first second third and fourth cycles respectively after the 5th cycle the effectiveness of u vi capture and uptake was 83 3 according to the listed findings the reusability of nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite is superior with respect to recovery of u vi from various real water matrices as a result the evaluated nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite demonstrated reasonable reuse potential indicating that water contaminants can be recovered frequently 4 conclusion this study was established to assess the adsorption proficiency via adsorptive capture of u vi by the assembled nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite from aqueous solutions sem assessment determined that the newly designed nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite achieved a nanosized range 15 41 26 42 nm it was found that nano rgo tio2 cmc nanocomposite resulted in 97 7 94 1 and 93 3 in u vi adsorptive capture at ph 6 0 for 5 15 and 30 mg l 1 respectively langmuir expression was utilized to assess the fitting process of u vi adsorption onto nano rgo tio2 cmc the nano rgo tio2 cmc also exhibited rapid adsorptive capture by reaching up to 97 7 94 1 and 93 2 within 1 5 and 10 min respectively for 30 mg l 1 u vi the pseudo second order seemed appropriate for representing the u vi adsorption data the computed e values were characterized as 8 28 and 14 61 kj mol 1 by linear and nonlinear expressions respectively to indicate and reveal that the binding mechanism of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc is mainly based on a chemisorption type of interaction via ion pair and or complex formation according to thermodynamic parameters the negative δg values displayed that the adsorption capture and uptake of u vi onto nano rgo tio2 cmc was spontaneous which facilitated the adsorption operation the δh values indicated that the process of adsorption was exothermic the current nano rgo tio2 cmc revealed a tolerable adsorption removal after the 5th cycle of adsorption desorption process of u vi by using hcl as desorption agent besides the investigated nano rgo tio2 cmc retained good reutilizing stability with 83 3 u vi removal efficiency after the 5th

12482,the existence of soils contaminated with organochlorine pesticides represents a serious environmental problem in this work a real soil contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexanes σhch 373 mg kg 1 persistent organic pollutants included in the stockholm convention was remediated surfactants were used to enhance the pollutants solubilization and activated persulfate ps oxidation to degrade the pollutants solubilization experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds emulse 3 e3 and tween 80 t80 ph reagents addition order and concentration csurfactant 0 10 g l 1 cnaoh 0 13 5 g l 1 surfactants selection was performed attending to their ability to solubilize chlorinated organic compounds cocs the use of surfactants improved cocs solubilization especially at ph 12 conditions at which hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes tcbs with higher solubility the higher the surfactant concentration the higher the cocs concentration in the emulsion cocs solubilization of 83 and 89 were achieved in three surfactant consecutive cycles at highly alkaline conditions using sds and e3 respectively t80 was unstable the resulting emulsions were treated by ps activated by alkali and intensified by temperature cocs conversion of 30 and 96 were achieved when treating e3 and sds emulsions 72 h respectively highlighting the suitability of sds for the integrated process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords remediation hchs surfactants partition coefficient activated persulfate data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the last decades industrial activities have generated vast quantities of soil polluted with hydrophobic organic compounds hocs becoming a major environmental problem 1 one of the most serious cases is the pollution caused by lindane wastes the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch a polychlorinated pesticide globally used in the second half of the 20th 2 the lindane manufacture generated large quantities of other hch isomers namely α β ε and δ hch without insecticidal properties leading to large deposits of hch wastes worldwide 3 three hchs α β and γ hch have been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention 4 because of their high refractoriness and adverse effects on the ecosystem and human beings thus owing to its toxicity and health implications the production and use of lindane have been banned in most european countries the usa and canada in this sense feasible degradation technologies are required to remediate the sites polluted with these wastes and implement the abovementioned convention advanced oxidation processes aops can be a feasible option for the remediation of hchs polluted soils among the aops tested using h2o2 and persulfate ps as oxidants ps based treatments led to better results 5 6 due to the high stability aqueous solubility and low cost of this oxidant 7 8 the degradation power of ps is usually increased activating this oxidant by metal cations alkali naoh heat or other energy sources such as ultrasound ultraviolet etc generating different radicals species 9 15 among these systems ps activated by temperature 5 16 naoh 10 17 the combination of naoh and temperature 10 17 and the intensification of naoh with us 9 have recently been studied for the remediation of hch polluted soils the main limitations found are the high hchs adsorption onto the soil particles and their low solubility thus their transfer into the aqueous phase where the degradation process takes mainly place 17 19 is restricted this limitation can be overcome by the use of surfactants amphiphilic nature substances able to reduce the surface tension of water 20 enhancing hocs solubilization 21 in this context the use of surfactants 1 22 and the treatment of the resulting emulsions 23 24 for the remediation of soils contaminated with hocs has received increasing attention in the last decade the successful application of surfactants combined with oxidation treatments largely depends on the pollutant surfactant oxidant system thus several factors should be considered in the surfactant enhanced pollutants solubilization step such as the type and surfactant concentration soil and pollutants characteristics ph conditions and soil water ratio among others concerning the oxidation step the surfactant should be relatively stable in the presence of the oxidant due to the organic nature of surfactants they can compete with the pollutants for the radical species facilitating the selective oxidation of pollutants 24 an excess of surfactant hinders the pollutants oxidation and increases the unproductive consumption of the oxidant 25 27 thus the global treatment efficiency will be determined by the surfactant ability to solubilize the hocs from the polluted soil and the oxidant ability to selectively degrade the emulsions contaminants the remediation of soils contaminated with lindane wastes by surfactant enhanced solubilization has been recently reviewed 28 most of the papers focus on washing lindane spiked soils 29 32 instead of real polluted soils and the treatment of the emulsions has been rarely studied in this sense deepening the application of the combined process surfactant enhanced pollutants solubilization pollutants oxidation for the remediation of real hchs polluted soils needs further investigation in this work real soil mainly contaminated with α hch and β hch collected from the old bailin landfill close to sabiñánigo in the aragonian pyrenees spain where the company inquinosa dumped lindane wastes from 1984 to 1992 has been remediated three commercial surfactants an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and two non ionic surfactants tween 80 t80 and emulse 3 e3 widely used in remediation treatments 1 21 24 33 34 have been evaluated for the first time for this purpose firstly the main variables of the pollutants solubilization step surfactant ph reagents addition order reagents concentration liquid soil ratio number of solubilization cycles etc were studied providing valuable information before implementing the process on a full scale secondly the resulting emulsions have been treated by ps activated with alkali and intensified with temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 polluted soil the real polluted soil was collected by sarga sociedad aragonesa de gestión agroambiental from the bailín landfill sabiñanigo spain at a depth of 0 0 3 m the soil sample was crushed in the landfill facilities the fraction with a particle diameter between 0 02 and 0 25 mm was selected to carry out the experiments 9 17 hchs in soil are present as white grains and adsorbed into the soil 2 2 chemicals three commercial surfactants were used two nonionic e mulse 3 e3 and tween 80 t80 c64h124o26 and one anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds c12h25nao4s t80 and sds were purchased from sigma aldrich and e3 from ethicalchem n hexane c6h14 and methanol ch3oh used for the extraction of pollutants from the aqueous and solid phases were provided by honeywell and fisher respectively sodium chloride nacl used to break the sds emulsion for the chromatographic analysis was supplied by sigma aldrich bicyclohexyl c12h22 and tetrachloroethane c2h2cl4 used as standard internal compounds istd for pollutant quantification were provided by sigma aldrich the oxidant sodium persulfate ps na2s2o8 was purchased by sigma aldrich sodium hydroxide naoh used to achieve alkaline conditions in solubilization and oxidation experiments was supplied by riedel de haën potassium iodide ki and sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 for ps quantification were provided by fisher chemical and panreac respectively glucose c6h12o6 used for total organic carbon toc calibration was supplied by riedel de haën all the reagents used were of analytical grade solutions were prepared with ultra pure water produced by a deionizing system millipore direct q 2 3 pollutants solubilization by surfactant addition solubilization experiments se were performed in 40 ml ptfe batch reactors with ptfe screw caps the reactors were filled with 15 g of polluted soil and 30 ml of the aqueous solution containing the desired concentration of reagents surfactant and or alkali the reactors were shaken in an lbx rr80 rotatory agitator 80 rpm at ambient temperature for 24 h time enough to reach the pollutants equilibrium between the aqueous and solid phases 9 35 at equilibrium conditions the slurry systems were centrifuged 10 min at 9000 rpm medtronic bl s jp selecta to separate both phases soil and polluted emulsion the operational conditions of se are listed in table 1 this table contains the objective for each set of experiments the run number se1 se24 the surfactant used sds e3 or t80 and its concentration csurfactant the alkali concentration cnaoh the liquid soil ratio vl ws the number of solubilization cycles and its duration the variable studied in each series of experiments has been highlighted in bold type se runs have been duplicated with the standard deviation always below 10 error bars have been included in de figures firstly two experiments in the absence of surfactant at neutral se1 and alkaline conditions se2 were performed to evaluate the effect of ph on chlorinated organic compounds cocs solubilization these results were compared to those carried out with 10 g l 1 of surfactant sds e3 and t80 at neutral se3 se5 and alkaline conditions se6 se8 cnaoh 13 5 g l 1 respectively moreover the reagents naoh and surfactant addition order effect has been evaluated by adding them simultaneously a and sequentially b in the second case naoh was added cnaoh 27 g l 1 15 ml and the reactor stirred for 4 h time enough to achieve the complete dehydrochlorination of α hch the main soil pollutant 17 afterwards 15 ml of surfactant csurfactant 20 g l 1 was added and shaken for 20 h the effect of alkali cnaoh from 2 5 to 13 5 g l 1 se6 se14 and surfactant concentration csurfactant from 2 to 10 g l 1 se10 se12 se15 se18 has also been evaluated simultaneous addition of alkali and surfactant the liquid soil ratio vl ws used in all these experiments was 2 finally three successive solubilization cycles using sds se16 se19 and se20 and e3 se18 se22 and se23 have been performed the first cycle was carried out at alkaline conditions to favour cocs dehydrochlorination in soil enhancing their solubility 9 the second and third cycles were carried out without alkali addition to solubilize the remaining hydrolyzed cocs in the soil lower surfactant concentration was used in cycles 2 and 3 than in the first as the cocs content in the soil also decreased with solubilization cycles the results after the third solubilization cycle were compared with those obtained in a single step using the highest surfactant concentration applied in the three consecutive cycles 5 g l 1 and an aqueous volume and time sum of that used in the three cycles vl ws 6 t 72 h these experiments are named se21 and se24 for sds and e3 respectively 2 4 oxidation of polluted emulsions polluted emulsions pes were treated by the alkaline activation of ps intensified by temperature 17 oxidation runs were carried out in thermostatted closed cylindrical glass vials 10 ml without head space to minimize cocs volatilization the solution was magnetically stirred 80 rpm and heated 40 c using a techradleys heating stirrer plate the oxidation experiments started once ps was added 40 g l 1 a naoh ps molar ratio of 2 was used in all runs 9 10 18 pes were obtained from se16 sds and se18 e3 experiments named pe sds 1 and pe e3 1 respectively moreover the emulsion resulting in the three successive solubilization cycles pe sds 1 2 3 sum of aqueous phases from se16 se19 and se20 runs and pe e3 1 2 3 sum of aqueous phases form coming from se18 se22 and se23 experiments have also been treated the characteristics of these emulsions including the pe name the se they come from and the surfactant csurfactant and pollutants concentration ccocs experimentally determined have been included in the supplementary material table sm 1 blank runs were also carried out to determine the cocs reduction by adsorption or volatilization in the absence of ps unproductive consumption of the oxidant was also studied in the absence of solubilized cocs the objective of the experimental set blank runs cocs oxidation and unproductive ps consumption and the corresponding experimental conditions ps concentration naoh ps molar ratio and reaction temperature are included in table sm 1 the ratio between the concentration of ps used and the stoichiometric amount required for cocs mineralization cps cps stq has also been included cps stq has been calculated considering the oh generated in the alkaline activation of ps and the oxidation of the cocs mainly tcbs present in the pes treated 17 the evolution of each reaction was followed by preparing several vials and sacrificing one at each selected reaction time the vials were refrigerated for 1 h using an ice bath and the reaction media was immediately analyzed pe oxidation experiments were carried out in triplicate and a standard deviation of 10 was found error bars have been included in de figures 2 5 analytical techniques the chemical characterization of the polluted soil including total organic and inorganic carbon content toc and ic respectively and metal concentration were determined in previous work 10 cocs extraction from soil was accomplished by mixing 15 g of soil with 30 ml of methanol in 40 ml ptfe vials at 45 c and placed in an ultrasound bath power sonic 505 for 180 min 9 36 after extraction the sample was cooled and centrifugated for 10 min at 9000 rpm medtronic bl s jp selecta the organic and soil phases were separated by decantation and the organic phase was analyzed by gas chromatography gc cocs concentration in the aqueous phases was also analyzed by gc sample preparation before gc analysis depends on the presence and type of surfactant used aqueous phases without surfactants those corresponding to experiments se1 and se2 were analyzed by liquid liquid extraction hexane water 1 1 mass ratio the biphasic mixture was vigorously agitated and cocs concentration in the organic extract was analyzed by gc in the case of emulsions direct liquid liquid extraction is not possible when sds was employed due to its ionic nature the surfactant was previously precipitated and the emulsion was broken adding salt nacl 35 after that cocs in the aqueous phase were extracted with hexane 1 1 mass ratio and subsequently analyzed in the case of the nonionic surfactants e3 and t80 the aqueous emulsion was diluted with methanol 1 10 volume ratio and analyzed by gc cocs identification in the organic phase was accomplished by gas chromatography agilent 6890 coupled with a mass spectrometry detector gc msd and their quantification was performed by gc coupled with flame ionization and electron capture detectors gc fid and gc ecd respectively the column exit hp 5 ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 5 phenol methyl siloxane was split to both detectors and simultaneously measured additional information on the chromatographic method can be found elsewhere 10 18 37 the initial and remanent surfactant concentration in the emulsions after se was determined by toc considering the carbon content in sds e3 and t80 was respectively 0 50 0 58 and 0 60 g c g surf 1 34 and subtracting the toc contribution of cocs in the aqueous phase previously quantified by gc fid ecd toc was measured by a shimadzu toc v csh analyzer coupled with an ssm 5000a using synthetic air as a carrier gas and a furnace temperature of 900 c toc calibration was performed with glucose solutions 0 1 500 mg l 1 ps concentration in the aqueous phase was determined by a colorimetric method using a water ki nahco3 solution 38 the yellow iodine colour formed proportional to ps concentration was measured using a boeco s 20 uv vis spectrophotometer at 352 nm the ph of the aqueous phases in the different experiments se and oxidation of pe was determined using a basic 20 crison ph electrode 3 results and discussion the molar concentration of each coc i in the soil qi soil μmol kg 1 and aqueous ci aq μmol l 1 phases were obtained from gc analysis the moles of each compound ni μmol and total moles of cocs ncocs μmol in the slurry sum of moles in soil and aqueous phases were obtained from the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 where w and v are the soil phase mass kg and aqueous phase volume l used respectively 1 n i w q i soil v c i aq 2 n cocs n i ncocs should be closed to those measured in the initial polluted soil the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 between both phases data not showed was accomplished in all se 5 3 1 soil characterization the polluted soil was characterized in a previous work 10 metals in a more significant proportion were calcium 168 8 g kgsoil 1 iron 21 1 g kgsoil 1 and aluminium 17 1 g kgsoil 1 lower sodium magnesium potassium and manganese concentrations were also detected labile iron in the solution was low 2 mg l 1 it presents a high carbonate content 40 which gives it a strong buffer character with a ph between 7 5 and 7 8 the hchs concentration in the polluted soil dp 0 02 0 25 mm was 373 mg kgsoil 1 qcocs soil 1282 μmol kgsoil 1 therefore 19 23 μmol of cocs are initially present in each reactor 15 g of soil with around 80 of α hch and 13 of β hch the remaining 7 corresponds to other hch isomers γ δ and ε hch identified cocs represent only a small percentage 1 of measured soil toc thus the rest of the soil organic matter can be associated with natural organic matter 10 fig sm 1 a and b show the molar distribution of pollutants in soil grey bar and aqueous blue bar phases at equilibrium conditions in the absence of surfactants at neutral and alkaline ph respectively a distinction has been made between the majority compounds α hch and β hch and the minority ones σγ δ ε hch in addition it should be considered that at alkaline conditions ph 12 hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes tcbs 10 17 according to eq 3 therefore the moles of tcbs and total cocs have been included in fig sm 1 3 hch 3 oh tcb 3 cl 3 h 2 o the partition coefficient kd cocs represents the ratio between the cocs concentration in the soil qcocs soil mmol kg 1 and aqueous ccocs aq mmol l 1 phases at equilibrium conditions eq 4 35 values of kd cocs l kg 1 have been calculated and included in fig sm 1 4 k d cocs q cocs soil c cocs aq as shown in fig sm 1 a hchs are the only pollutants at neutral ph almost total dehydrochlorination of α hch to tcb was found at alkaline ph fig sm 1 b as previously reported 17 the percentage of the different isomers of tcbs formed data not included in the figure agrees with that reported in previous works 1 2 4 tcb 85 1 2 3 tcb 12 1 3 5 tcb 3 10 17 39 however it should be highlighted that not all hch isomers hydrolyze at the same rate 9 17 α δ γ and ε hch were completely dehydrochlorinated to tcbs after 24 h considered equilibrium conditions whereas at the same reaction time the hydrolysis of β hch the most refractory hch isomer was below 40 as previously stated the remediation of hchs polluted soils is mainly limited by the low aqueous solubility of the pollutants 9 16 with values in the range α hch 4 1 6 9 μmol l 1 and β hch 0 5 2 4 μmol l 1 39 thus the moles of cocs in the aqueous phase in equilibrium with the soil at the conditions tested 15 g of soil and 30 ml of water are low 0 6 μmol fig sm 1 a the moles of cocs solubilized in the aqueous phase highly increased at alkaline conditions 4 8 μmol fig sm 1 b decreasing the partition coefficient kd cocs from 69 2 to 5 8 l kg 1 this fact is attributable to the higher aqueous solubility of tcbs 1 2 4 tcb 170 8 270 0 μmol l 1 1 2 3 tcb 89 8 99 2 μmol l 1 and 1 3 5 tcb 33 1 μmol l 1 than the parent pollutants 10 39 3 2 selection of solubilization conditions the selection of the surfactant enhanced solubilization step conditions surfactant ph reagents addition order reagents concentration and the number of solubilization cycles was performed by attending to the surfactant ability to solubilize the pollutants from the soil to the emulsion other important aspects such as the adsorption of the surfactant in the soil or the unproductive consumption of oxidant associated with the surfactant in the following oxidation stage will be later considered 3 2 1 effect of surfactant and ph to evaluate the surfactant capacity the moles of cocs in the aqueous phase blue bars and the remaining cocs in the soil grey bars after se were determined in the presence of surfactants at neutral fig 1 a and alkaline fig 1 b conditions the final ph of the aqueous phase has been depicted as points right axis the results obtained without surfactants have also been included to facilitate comparison the corresponding kd cocs values red bar eq 4 at neutral and alkaline ph have been represented in fig 1 c and fig 1 d respectively the lower the partition coefficient the greater the pollutants solubilization in the aqueous phase and therefore the greater the solubilization capacity of the evaluated surfactant as shown in fig 1 a and c adding surfactants sds e3 and t80 at neutral ph improved cocs solubilization from the soil significantly decreasing kd cocs values the order obtained was t80 sds e3 different order for these surfactants e3 t80 sds was reported in the literature when they were used for cocs solubilization from the dense non aqueous liquid phase dnapl composed by a mixture of 28 cocs 34 35 this can be attributable to the different phases involved and different compositions of dnapl and technical hch highlighting the importance of studying the behaviour of each surfactant in the presence of different real contamination matrices carboneras et al 30 reported a lindane recovery of about 40 from spiked soil 1000 mg kgsoil 1 when using 5 g l 1 of sds and a vl ws 5 30 this value corresponds to kd cocs 7 5 l kg 1 being similar to those obtained in this work at neutral ph but with higher surfactant concentration 10 g l 1 this fact could be explained by i pollutants of the soil treated in the current work are mostly α and β hch isomers with lower water solubility than γ hch and ii it is a real polluted soil with aged pollution instead of a spiked soil it is well known that the ageing process leads to contaminant sequestration by soil 40 41 hindering the subsequent solubilization this point underlines the importance of studying aged polluted soils real contamination instead of spiked soils a significantly higher cocs solubilization was obtained at alkaline conditions ph 12 with e3 and sds kd cocs 1 8 l kg 1 in comparison with the values obtained at neutral ph kd cocs 8 0 and 12 0 l kg 1 respectively fig 1 c and d on the contrary a lower kd cocs at neutral ph kd cocs 6 8 l kg 1 than at alkaline conditions kd cocs 19 8 l kg 1 was obtained with the nonionic surfactant t80 fig 1 c and d the different soil cocs composition with ph can explain differences in kd cocs values at neutral and alkaline conditions dehydrochlorination of hchs to tcbs at alkaline ph enhances the cocs solubilization moreover the effect of ph on the surfactant properties must be considered sds critical micellar concentration cmc decreases when the ph increases 34 42 contributing to the higher cocs solubilization the ph effect on e3 cmc at room temperature was negligible in previous works 34 the results obtained suggest that t80 stability decreased with the ph increase and surfactant precipitation was found using t80 at alkaline conditions see fig sm 2 at ph 12 explaining the decrease of cocs solubilization and the corresponding kd cocs increase fig 1 b and d respectively iglesias et al 43 tested the stability of this surfactant over the ph range 2 10 founding that a ph increase had a positive effect on the surface tension of t80 43 which could be related to the better stability of fatty acids surfactant micelles in the presence of a base 43 44 thus the poor results obtained for the t80 surfactant in the current work could be attributed to the extremely alkaline conditions here employed ph 12 cnaoh 13 5 g l 1 in order to increase t80 stability the effect of naoh concentration and contacting time maintaining ph 12 have been further analyzed subsections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 the distribution of the pollutants in μmol in the soil and aqueous phases after the surfactant enhanced solubilization step runs se3 se8 for each surfactant and ph condition are shown in fig sm 3 since there is no cocs transformation at neutral ph hchs isomers explain around 98 of cocs in both phases at alkaline ph the hchs hydrolysis eq 3 justifies that the predominant compounds are tcbs in both phases 10 17 39 regardless of the surfactant used β hch was not completely dehydrochlorinated fig sm 3 d e and f emphasizing that β hch hydrolysis to tcbs is the limiting step for the solubilization process as previously reported in bibliography 9 17 3 2 2 reagents addition order ph 12 the sequential reagent adding produces hchs dehydrochlorination to tcbs before the surfactant is added and further addition of the surfactant facilitates the tcbs solubilization in this way the time that surfactant is kept at alkaline conditions in the pollutants solubilization step decreases and its stability in the case of t80 is expected to increase the moles of cocs solubilized in the aqueous phase and those remaining in the soil are shown in fig 2 b moles of cocs in the aqueous phase before and after the surfactant is added are also indicated for the scope of comparison the moles of cocs in both phases corresponding to the simultaneous addition of naoh and surfactants have also been plotted fig 2 a corresponding kd cocs values l kg 1 are also shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 b the moles of cocs solubilized after naoh addition 1 2 μmol stage common for the three experiments se6 se7 and se8 are significantly lower than those shown in fig sm 1 after soil alkalinization 4 8 μmol se2 the alkalinization step in se6 se7 and se8 lasted 4 h instead of the 24 h required in se2 to reach equilibrium conditions the short time used in se6 se7 and se8 did not allow to reach the equilibrium achieved in se2 due to diffusional limitations in cocs solubilization mainly tcbs from the soil phase where they are generated to the aqueous phase 9 17 firstly the negative effect of naoh on t80 stability is confirmed with the lower values of kd cocs obtained in the sequential treatment than the simultaneous one kd cocs with t80 at alkaline conditions in both experiments are remarkably higher than those obtained with sds and e3 on the other hand the sequential addition of reagents produced slightly higher solubilization of contaminants compared with the simultaneous addition of naoh and surfactant for sds and e3 therefore further experiments will be carried out by adding the reagents simultaneously it should be noted that the reagents addition order did not influence the final ph of the pollutants solubilization step maintaining a final ph value higher than 12 in both cases data not shown 3 2 3 effect of alkali concentration as previously observed the solubilization efficiency increased at alkaline conditions regrettably the stability of one of the tested surfactants t80 is compromised in these conditions experiments at lower naoh concentrations 4 and 2 5 and g l 1 ph0 12 in all cases with the three surfactants tested have been performed to increase surfactant stability and reduce subsequent soil alkalinity and the reagents cost the distribution of cocs between the soil and the aqueous phase the corresponding kd cocs and final ph values have been plotted in fig 3 a f as shown as naoh concentration decreases the ph of the resulting emulsion 24 h decreases regardless of the surfactant used nevertheless it remains above 12 at all the naoh concentrations ensuring the hchs conversion to tcbs in all the scenarios tested the decrease of naoh increases the solubilized moles of cocs when t80 is used with the consequent decrease in the partition coefficient kd cocs was 19 8 7 0 and 2 4 l kg 1 for cnaoh 13 5 4 0 and 2 5 g l 1 respectively however this value is higher than those obtained with the other two surfactants at the three concentrations of naoh tested so the use of t80 in subsequent tests is discarded working with sds and e3 the partition coefficient decreases when naoh concentration decreases from 13 5 to 4 g l 1 but slightly increases at naoh concentrations below 4 g l 1 therefore a concentration of naoh equal to 4 g l 1 has been selected for the pollutants solubilization step with these surfactants sds and e3 3 2 4 effect of surfactant concentration the effect of surfactant concentration 2 10 g l 1 was studied using cnaoh of 4 g l 1 in the presence of sds and e3 the results obtained for cocs distribution final ph and kd cocs have been depicted in fig 4 a d the higher the surfactant concentration the higher the cocs concentration in the emulsion a conclusion previously reported in the literature 35 43 45 48 thus kd cocs decreased by increasing the surfactant concentration fig 4 b and fig 4 d for sds and e3 respectively being more significant from 2 to 5 g l 1 than from 5 to 10 g l 1 this fact may be due to the solubility of contaminants is likely to increase up to a given value and no improvement is obtained by working with higher concentrations 49 50 highlighting the need to study each particular case on the other hand an excessive concentration of surfactant in the subsequent oxidation stage is undesirable because it decreases the efficiency of the process due to i surfactant micelles can act as a protective medium significantly reducing the cocs availability towards radicals oxidation 23 27 and ii the surfactant can compete with the contaminants for the radicals formed 25 27 thus a concentration of surfactant of 5 g l 1 has been selected for the solubilization stage 3 2 5 effect of successive solubilization cycles three successive solubilization cycles were performed with sds and e3 at the conditions previously selected cocs removal percentage from polluted soil in these cycles solubilization rate has been calculated following eq 5 in which c cocs aq is the cocs concentration in the aqueous phase q cocs soil is the initial cocs concentration in the polluted soil and vl ws is the liquid soil ratio used the results obtained are depicted in fig 5 additionally the kd cocs l kg 1 values eq 4 for each solubilization cycle have been included 5 solubilization rate c cocs aq v l w s q cocs soil 100 according to fig 5 58 4 21 1 and 3 0 of the initial cocs in soil were solubilized to the aqueous phase after the first second and third solubilization cycle with sds total removal 82 5 final cocs removal was slightly higher 88 8 with e3 kd cocs values in the successive solubilization cycles increase in the case of sds fig 5 a and slightly decrease in e3 fig 5 b in the first solubilization cycle with sds a higher amount of cocs in the soil is solubilized compared to using e3 the remaining cocs in the soil after the first solubilization cycle seem less accessible to the surfactant due to stronger adsorption to the soil or a hindering effect of the adsorbed sds on the contrary adding e3 allows desorbing cocs with the same effectiveness in successive solubilization cycles similar kd cocs values cocs solubilized in runs se21 sds and se24 e3 were lower 72 despite the higher mass of surfactant used in these runs compared with the total surfactant added in the corresponding three successive solubilization runs 3 3 oxidation of polluted emulsions the polluted emulsions pes obtained in runs se16 sds se18 e3 and the liquid phase sum of emulsion from runs se16 se19 and se20 sds and runs se18 se22 and se23 e3 have been used for the study of cocs oxidation these runs are named pe sds 1 pe e3 1 pe sds 1 2 3 and pe e3 1 2 3 respectively as a result of the solubilization step part of the surfactant was adsorbed into the soil 35 51 after the solubilization the surfactant concentration sds and e3 was calculated from toc measurements and the results obtained are included in table sm 1 the initial concentration of surfactants sds and e3 used in the se16 and se18 experiments was 5 g l 1 table 1 the equivalent initial surfactant concentration in runs se16 se19 and se20 sds and runs se18 se22 and se23 e3 was 2 9 g l 1 average of three values employed of 5 2 5 and 1 25 g l 1 the measured concentration of sds after soil washing was 4 1 and 2 6 g l 1 for pe sds 1 and pe sds 1 2 3 respectively the measured concentration of e3 in the resulting pes was 3 1 and 2 3 g l 1 for pe e3 1 and pe e3 1 2 3 respectively from these results it can be inferred that higher adsorption of e3 3 8 g kgsoil 1 than sds 1 8 g kgsoil 1 on the polluted soil was found at the conditions tested conversely garcia cervilla et al 35 reported a slightly higher sds adsorption than e3 into a highly polluted soil cocs 10 000 mg kgsoil 1 at alkaline conditions ph 12 cnaoh 7 g l 1 35 these authors also reported that a higher cocs concentration in soil resulted in higher surfactant adsorption 35 thus the differences obtained with respect to the current work can be related to i the significant difference in cocs concentration 10 000 mg kg 1 vs 373 mg kg 1 and ii the different nature of cocs 28 cocs vs only hchs isomers all this points to the need to study the behaviour of each surfactant in soils with different types of real pollution additionally it should be higlighted that the remanent surfactant concentration adsorbed to soil 1 8 sds 3 8 e3 g kgsoil 1 both in the case of a single and 3 successive solubilization cycles would not represent a problem since the application of this technology is intended to treat a very delimited area of the landfill and the treated soil would not be used in any case for agricultural or livestock purposes but rather could be used as a building material considering the alkaline ph obtained in the polluted emulsions the oxidation system selected for the subsequent cocs abatement in the emulsion is ps activated by alkali on the other hand considering the promising results recently obtained when this process was intensified by temperature 5 10 17 52 a temperature of 40 c was selected the oxidizable organic matter in the reaction medium is comprised of solubilized cocs in this case mainly tcbs and the surfactant a relatively high oxidant dose was used to avoid the oxidant depletion by an unproductive reaction with the surfactant 1 23 53 54 57 therefore a ps concentration of 40 g l 1 has been selected 10 17 52 finally the molar naoh ps ratio was fixed at 2 a value commonly found in the literature which ensures a ph 12 necessary for alkaline activation of ps during the reaction 9 10 18 the time evolution of cocs xcocs and oxidant xps conversion under the selected operating conditions is shown in fig 6 a and b respectively blank experiments in the absence of ps were undertaken to discard volatilization or adsorption of cocs mainly tcbs during pes treatment at 40 c experimental conditions summarized in table sm 1 the decrease of cocs concentration in blank runs was below 20 in all cases 72 h data not shown fig sm 4 shows the colour evolution of the emulsions in the oxidation ox and blank blank experiments as can be seen the colour remains unchanged in the blank experiments during the experimental time indicating that no reaction took place however the colour becomes yellowish with time in the case of oxidation experiments suggesting that cocs and surfactant oxidation occurred 23 ps conversion was considerably higher when treating e3 pe e3 1 xps 50 6 h than sds pe sds 1 xps 20 6 h emulsions furthermore the oxidant consumption was higher in the experiment carried out with a higher initial concentration of e3 pe e3 1 2 3 which can be associated with the unproductive consumption of ps with this surfactant fig 6 b in the case of sds emulsions the differences in ps conversion in the tests with different concentrations of surfactant pe sds 1 and pe sds 1 2 3 respectively are less significant fig 6 b the rapid decomposition of ps in the experiments with e3 emulsions generated a high concentration of hydrogen cations 17 which is associated with a considerable decrease in the ph of the reaction medium fig 6 c in these experiments the ph decreased below the required value for the alkaline activation of ps ph 12 and thus hydroxyl radicals are no longer produced 17 all this led to low contaminant conversion xcocs 30 72 h fig 6 a it should be noted that cocs conversion was slightly higher when treating pe e3 1 2 3 than pe e3 1 with lower surfactant concentration table sm 1 which can be attributed to a protecting effect of surfactant micelles against pollutants oxidation this behaviour was previously observed in the oxidation of a complex liquid mixture of cocs by using ps activated by alkali as an oxidant and e3 as a surfactant 57 in that work it was found that concentrations of e3 above 2 5 g l 1 caused only unproductive reactions without cocs removal this hindering effect was also noticed in the presence of other surfactants and ps activation methods 24 25 46 thus considering this aspect to improve the oxidation treatment lower concentrations of e3 should have been used in the precedent solubilization process which would limit the efficiency of this first stage when treating the sds emulsions higher cocs conversions were achieved removing 96 of the contaminants in 72 h of treatment fig 6 a at these conditions no chlorinated intermediate compounds were detected as previously observed in the treatment of this soil by ps naoh t 17 comparing with the results obtained in that work it should be underlined the higher cocs conversion 96 vs 80 achieved in the presence of surfactant at the same operating conditions cps 40 g l 1 40 c 72 h 17 highlighting the beneficial role of the surfactant additionally due to the low solubility of β hch the most recalcitrant hch isomer and low hydrolysis rate to tcbs the conversion of this compound when no surfactant was used was below 70 17 in the current work the solubilization of β hch in the emulsion was almost 80 fig sm 3 confirming that the synergetic effect of naoh and surfactant enhanced the dehydrochlorination of this refractory compound and subsequent solubilization of tcbs which were further removed in the oxidation treatment additional experiments in the absence of cocs and using the same concentration of ps 40 g l 1 and surfactants sds and e3 were performed to know more about the unproductive consumption of the oxidant due to the presence of surfactant experimental conditions in table sm 1 the oxidant consumption was almost independent of the cocs presence data not shown for each surfactant therefore ps was mostly consumed in an unproductive reaction with the surfactant at the temperature tested the unproductive consumption of ps 40 g l 1 at different temperatures in the absence of surfactant was studied in a previous work obtaining significantly lower oxidant consumption 7 5 and 20 at 35 c and 45 c respectively 72 h 5 these results demonstrate that the presence of surfactant both sds and e3 significantly increases the unproductive oxidant consumption xps 70 in both cases additionally as previously mentioned in the case of cocs presence fig 6 b the unproductive ps consumption in the presence of the non ionic surfactant e3 was considerably higher than using sds data not shown in accordance with that previously reported in the literature 19 24 55 56 wang et al 56 reported that the higher stability of sds against ps was associated to the existence of repulsion forces between so4 radicals generated in the ps t system and the sulfonate anions located at the exterior of the sds micelle 56 in conclusion the lower unproductive consumption of ps with sds and the higher cocs removal from the emulsion make sds preferable for this treatment at the experimental conditions used 4 conclusions the results obtained in the present work reveal that the combination of surfactant aided solubilization and selective oxidation of pollutants by ps activated by alkali and intensified by temperature is a promising alternative for the remediation of real hchs polluted soils the ph plays a fundamental role in the remediation process at neutral ph surfactant addition slightly increased the solubilized mass of cocs decreasing the partition coefficients at ph 12 higher cocs solubility was achieved since hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes with significantly higher water solubility than the parent compounds one of the surfactants tested t80 was not stable at ph 12 and the concentration of cocs solubilized decreased naoh and surfactant concentration remarkably affected the pollutants solubilization efficiency the highest cocs solubilization was obtained at moderate naoh concentration 4 g l 1 finding the surfactant solubilization order sds kd cocs 1 0 l kg 1 e3 kd cocs 1 3 l kg 1 t80 kd cocs 7 0 l kg 1 the higher the surfactant concentration the lower the kd cocs value being this improvement lower as the surfactant concentration increases more than 80 of cocs were extracted from the soil using optimal solubilization conditions sds or e3 5 g l 1 ph 12 simultaneous addition of reagents vl ws 2 and 3 successive solubilization cycles of 24 h the resulting emulsions σcocs 34 70 mg l 1 mainly as tcbs were subsequently treated by ps naoh t cps 40 g l 1 naoh ps 2 and t 40 c cocs conversions of 30 and 96 were achieved in 72 h when treating e3 and sds emulsions respectively highlighting the suitability of sds for the integrated surfactant enhanced solubilization and emulsion treatment process this

12482,the existence of soils contaminated with organochlorine pesticides represents a serious environmental problem in this work a real soil contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexanes σhch 373 mg kg 1 persistent organic pollutants included in the stockholm convention was remediated surfactants were used to enhance the pollutants solubilization and activated persulfate ps oxidation to degrade the pollutants solubilization experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds emulse 3 e3 and tween 80 t80 ph reagents addition order and concentration csurfactant 0 10 g l 1 cnaoh 0 13 5 g l 1 surfactants selection was performed attending to their ability to solubilize chlorinated organic compounds cocs the use of surfactants improved cocs solubilization especially at ph 12 conditions at which hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes tcbs with higher solubility the higher the surfactant concentration the higher the cocs concentration in the emulsion cocs solubilization of 83 and 89 were achieved in three surfactant consecutive cycles at highly alkaline conditions using sds and e3 respectively t80 was unstable the resulting emulsions were treated by ps activated by alkali and intensified by temperature cocs conversion of 30 and 96 were achieved when treating e3 and sds emulsions 72 h respectively highlighting the suitability of sds for the integrated process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords remediation hchs surfactants partition coefficient activated persulfate data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the last decades industrial activities have generated vast quantities of soil polluted with hydrophobic organic compounds hocs becoming a major environmental problem 1 one of the most serious cases is the pollution caused by lindane wastes the gamma isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane γ hch a polychlorinated pesticide globally used in the second half of the 20th 2 the lindane manufacture generated large quantities of other hch isomers namely α β ε and δ hch without insecticidal properties leading to large deposits of hch wastes worldwide 3 three hchs α β and γ hch have been included in the list of persistent organic pollutants pops in the stockholm convention 4 because of their high refractoriness and adverse effects on the ecosystem and human beings thus owing to its toxicity and health implications the production and use of lindane have been banned in most european countries the usa and canada in this sense feasible degradation technologies are required to remediate the sites polluted with these wastes and implement the abovementioned convention advanced oxidation processes aops can be a feasible option for the remediation of hchs polluted soils among the aops tested using h2o2 and persulfate ps as oxidants ps based treatments led to better results 5 6 due to the high stability aqueous solubility and low cost of this oxidant 7 8 the degradation power of ps is usually increased activating this oxidant by metal cations alkali naoh heat or other energy sources such as ultrasound ultraviolet etc generating different radicals species 9 15 among these systems ps activated by temperature 5 16 naoh 10 17 the combination of naoh and temperature 10 17 and the intensification of naoh with us 9 have recently been studied for the remediation of hch polluted soils the main limitations found are the high hchs adsorption onto the soil particles and their low solubility thus their transfer into the aqueous phase where the degradation process takes mainly place 17 19 is restricted this limitation can be overcome by the use of surfactants amphiphilic nature substances able to reduce the surface tension of water 20 enhancing hocs solubilization 21 in this context the use of surfactants 1 22 and the treatment of the resulting emulsions 23 24 for the remediation of soils contaminated with hocs has received increasing attention in the last decade the successful application of surfactants combined with oxidation treatments largely depends on the pollutant surfactant oxidant system thus several factors should be considered in the surfactant enhanced pollutants solubilization step such as the type and surfactant concentration soil and pollutants characteristics ph conditions and soil water ratio among others concerning the oxidation step the surfactant should be relatively stable in the presence of the oxidant due to the organic nature of surfactants they can compete with the pollutants for the radical species facilitating the selective oxidation of pollutants 24 an excess of surfactant hinders the pollutants oxidation and increases the unproductive consumption of the oxidant 25 27 thus the global treatment efficiency will be determined by the surfactant ability to solubilize the hocs from the polluted soil and the oxidant ability to selectively degrade the emulsions contaminants the remediation of soils contaminated with lindane wastes by surfactant enhanced solubilization has been recently reviewed 28 most of the papers focus on washing lindane spiked soils 29 32 instead of real polluted soils and the treatment of the emulsions has been rarely studied in this sense deepening the application of the combined process surfactant enhanced pollutants solubilization pollutants oxidation for the remediation of real hchs polluted soils needs further investigation in this work real soil mainly contaminated with α hch and β hch collected from the old bailin landfill close to sabiñánigo in the aragonian pyrenees spain where the company inquinosa dumped lindane wastes from 1984 to 1992 has been remediated three commercial surfactants an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate sds and two non ionic surfactants tween 80 t80 and emulse 3 e3 widely used in remediation treatments 1 21 24 33 34 have been evaluated for the first time for this purpose firstly the main variables of the pollutants solubilization step surfactant ph reagents addition order reagents concentration liquid soil ratio number of solubilization cycles etc were studied providing valuable information before implementing the process on a full scale secondly the resulting emulsions have been treated by ps activated with alkali and intensified with temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 polluted soil the real polluted soil was collected by sarga sociedad aragonesa de gestión agroambiental from the bailín landfill sabiñanigo spain at a depth of 0 0 3 m the soil sample was crushed in the landfill facilities the fraction with a particle diameter between 0 02 and 0 25 mm was selected to carry out the experiments 9 17 hchs in soil are present as white grains and adsorbed into the soil 2 2 chemicals three commercial surfactants were used two nonionic e mulse 3 e3 and tween 80 t80 c64h124o26 and one anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate sds c12h25nao4s t80 and sds were purchased from sigma aldrich and e3 from ethicalchem n hexane c6h14 and methanol ch3oh used for the extraction of pollutants from the aqueous and solid phases were provided by honeywell and fisher respectively sodium chloride nacl used to break the sds emulsion for the chromatographic analysis was supplied by sigma aldrich bicyclohexyl c12h22 and tetrachloroethane c2h2cl4 used as standard internal compounds istd for pollutant quantification were provided by sigma aldrich the oxidant sodium persulfate ps na2s2o8 was purchased by sigma aldrich sodium hydroxide naoh used to achieve alkaline conditions in solubilization and oxidation experiments was supplied by riedel de haën potassium iodide ki and sodium hydrogen carbonate nahco3 for ps quantification were provided by fisher chemical and panreac respectively glucose c6h12o6 used for total organic carbon toc calibration was supplied by riedel de haën all the reagents used were of analytical grade solutions were prepared with ultra pure water produced by a deionizing system millipore direct q 2 3 pollutants solubilization by surfactant addition solubilization experiments se were performed in 40 ml ptfe batch reactors with ptfe screw caps the reactors were filled with 15 g of polluted soil and 30 ml of the aqueous solution containing the desired concentration of reagents surfactant and or alkali the reactors were shaken in an lbx rr80 rotatory agitator 80 rpm at ambient temperature for 24 h time enough to reach the pollutants equilibrium between the aqueous and solid phases 9 35 at equilibrium conditions the slurry systems were centrifuged 10 min at 9000 rpm medtronic bl s jp selecta to separate both phases soil and polluted emulsion the operational conditions of se are listed in table 1 this table contains the objective for each set of experiments the run number se1 se24 the surfactant used sds e3 or t80 and its concentration csurfactant the alkali concentration cnaoh the liquid soil ratio vl ws the number of solubilization cycles and its duration the variable studied in each series of experiments has been highlighted in bold type se runs have been duplicated with the standard deviation always below 10 error bars have been included in de figures firstly two experiments in the absence of surfactant at neutral se1 and alkaline conditions se2 were performed to evaluate the effect of ph on chlorinated organic compounds cocs solubilization these results were compared to those carried out with 10 g l 1 of surfactant sds e3 and t80 at neutral se3 se5 and alkaline conditions se6 se8 cnaoh 13 5 g l 1 respectively moreover the reagents naoh and surfactant addition order effect has been evaluated by adding them simultaneously a and sequentially b in the second case naoh was added cnaoh 27 g l 1 15 ml and the reactor stirred for 4 h time enough to achieve the complete dehydrochlorination of α hch the main soil pollutant 17 afterwards 15 ml of surfactant csurfactant 20 g l 1 was added and shaken for 20 h the effect of alkali cnaoh from 2 5 to 13 5 g l 1 se6 se14 and surfactant concentration csurfactant from 2 to 10 g l 1 se10 se12 se15 se18 has also been evaluated simultaneous addition of alkali and surfactant the liquid soil ratio vl ws used in all these experiments was 2 finally three successive solubilization cycles using sds se16 se19 and se20 and e3 se18 se22 and se23 have been performed the first cycle was carried out at alkaline conditions to favour cocs dehydrochlorination in soil enhancing their solubility 9 the second and third cycles were carried out without alkali addition to solubilize the remaining hydrolyzed cocs in the soil lower surfactant concentration was used in cycles 2 and 3 than in the first as the cocs content in the soil also decreased with solubilization cycles the results after the third solubilization cycle were compared with those obtained in a single step using the highest surfactant concentration applied in the three consecutive cycles 5 g l 1 and an aqueous volume and time sum of that used in the three cycles vl ws 6 t 72 h these experiments are named se21 and se24 for sds and e3 respectively 2 4 oxidation of polluted emulsions polluted emulsions pes were treated by the alkaline activation of ps intensified by temperature 17 oxidation runs were carried out in thermostatted closed cylindrical glass vials 10 ml without head space to minimize cocs volatilization the solution was magnetically stirred 80 rpm and heated 40 c using a techradleys heating stirrer plate the oxidation experiments started once ps was added 40 g l 1 a naoh ps molar ratio of 2 was used in all runs 9 10 18 pes were obtained from se16 sds and se18 e3 experiments named pe sds 1 and pe e3 1 respectively moreover the emulsion resulting in the three successive solubilization cycles pe sds 1 2 3 sum of aqueous phases from se16 se19 and se20 runs and pe e3 1 2 3 sum of aqueous phases form coming from se18 se22 and se23 experiments have also been treated the characteristics of these emulsions including the pe name the se they come from and the surfactant csurfactant and pollutants concentration ccocs experimentally determined have been included in the supplementary material table sm 1 blank runs were also carried out to determine the cocs reduction by adsorption or volatilization in the absence of ps unproductive consumption of the oxidant was also studied in the absence of solubilized cocs the objective of the experimental set blank runs cocs oxidation and unproductive ps consumption and the corresponding experimental conditions ps concentration naoh ps molar ratio and reaction temperature are included in table sm 1 the ratio between the concentration of ps used and the stoichiometric amount required for cocs mineralization cps cps stq has also been included cps stq has been calculated considering the oh generated in the alkaline activation of ps and the oxidation of the cocs mainly tcbs present in the pes treated 17 the evolution of each reaction was followed by preparing several vials and sacrificing one at each selected reaction time the vials were refrigerated for 1 h using an ice bath and the reaction media was immediately analyzed pe oxidation experiments were carried out in triplicate and a standard deviation of 10 was found error bars have been included in de figures 2 5 analytical techniques the chemical characterization of the polluted soil including total organic and inorganic carbon content toc and ic respectively and metal concentration were determined in previous work 10 cocs extraction from soil was accomplished by mixing 15 g of soil with 30 ml of methanol in 40 ml ptfe vials at 45 c and placed in an ultrasound bath power sonic 505 for 180 min 9 36 after extraction the sample was cooled and centrifugated for 10 min at 9000 rpm medtronic bl s jp selecta the organic and soil phases were separated by decantation and the organic phase was analyzed by gas chromatography gc cocs concentration in the aqueous phases was also analyzed by gc sample preparation before gc analysis depends on the presence and type of surfactant used aqueous phases without surfactants those corresponding to experiments se1 and se2 were analyzed by liquid liquid extraction hexane water 1 1 mass ratio the biphasic mixture was vigorously agitated and cocs concentration in the organic extract was analyzed by gc in the case of emulsions direct liquid liquid extraction is not possible when sds was employed due to its ionic nature the surfactant was previously precipitated and the emulsion was broken adding salt nacl 35 after that cocs in the aqueous phase were extracted with hexane 1 1 mass ratio and subsequently analyzed in the case of the nonionic surfactants e3 and t80 the aqueous emulsion was diluted with methanol 1 10 volume ratio and analyzed by gc cocs identification in the organic phase was accomplished by gas chromatography agilent 6890 coupled with a mass spectrometry detector gc msd and their quantification was performed by gc coupled with flame ionization and electron capture detectors gc fid and gc ecd respectively the column exit hp 5 ms 30 m 0 25 mm i d 5 phenol methyl siloxane was split to both detectors and simultaneously measured additional information on the chromatographic method can be found elsewhere 10 18 37 the initial and remanent surfactant concentration in the emulsions after se was determined by toc considering the carbon content in sds e3 and t80 was respectively 0 50 0 58 and 0 60 g c g surf 1 34 and subtracting the toc contribution of cocs in the aqueous phase previously quantified by gc fid ecd toc was measured by a shimadzu toc v csh analyzer coupled with an ssm 5000a using synthetic air as a carrier gas and a furnace temperature of 900 c toc calibration was performed with glucose solutions 0 1 500 mg l 1 ps concentration in the aqueous phase was determined by a colorimetric method using a water ki nahco3 solution 38 the yellow iodine colour formed proportional to ps concentration was measured using a boeco s 20 uv vis spectrophotometer at 352 nm the ph of the aqueous phases in the different experiments se and oxidation of pe was determined using a basic 20 crison ph electrode 3 results and discussion the molar concentration of each coc i in the soil qi soil μmol kg 1 and aqueous ci aq μmol l 1 phases were obtained from gc analysis the moles of each compound ni μmol and total moles of cocs ncocs μmol in the slurry sum of moles in soil and aqueous phases were obtained from the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 where w and v are the soil phase mass kg and aqueous phase volume l used respectively 1 n i w q i soil v c i aq 2 n cocs n i ncocs should be closed to those measured in the initial polluted soil the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 between both phases data not showed was accomplished in all se 5 3 1 soil characterization the polluted soil was characterized in a previous work 10 metals in a more significant proportion were calcium 168 8 g kgsoil 1 iron 21 1 g kgsoil 1 and aluminium 17 1 g kgsoil 1 lower sodium magnesium potassium and manganese concentrations were also detected labile iron in the solution was low 2 mg l 1 it presents a high carbonate content 40 which gives it a strong buffer character with a ph between 7 5 and 7 8 the hchs concentration in the polluted soil dp 0 02 0 25 mm was 373 mg kgsoil 1 qcocs soil 1282 μmol kgsoil 1 therefore 19 23 μmol of cocs are initially present in each reactor 15 g of soil with around 80 of α hch and 13 of β hch the remaining 7 corresponds to other hch isomers γ δ and ε hch identified cocs represent only a small percentage 1 of measured soil toc thus the rest of the soil organic matter can be associated with natural organic matter 10 fig sm 1 a and b show the molar distribution of pollutants in soil grey bar and aqueous blue bar phases at equilibrium conditions in the absence of surfactants at neutral and alkaline ph respectively a distinction has been made between the majority compounds α hch and β hch and the minority ones σγ δ ε hch in addition it should be considered that at alkaline conditions ph 12 hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes tcbs 10 17 according to eq 3 therefore the moles of tcbs and total cocs have been included in fig sm 1 3 hch 3 oh tcb 3 cl 3 h 2 o the partition coefficient kd cocs represents the ratio between the cocs concentration in the soil qcocs soil mmol kg 1 and aqueous ccocs aq mmol l 1 phases at equilibrium conditions eq 4 35 values of kd cocs l kg 1 have been calculated and included in fig sm 1 4 k d cocs q cocs soil c cocs aq as shown in fig sm 1 a hchs are the only pollutants at neutral ph almost total dehydrochlorination of α hch to tcb was found at alkaline ph fig sm 1 b as previously reported 17 the percentage of the different isomers of tcbs formed data not included in the figure agrees with that reported in previous works 1 2 4 tcb 85 1 2 3 tcb 12 1 3 5 tcb 3 10 17 39 however it should be highlighted that not all hch isomers hydrolyze at the same rate 9 17 α δ γ and ε hch were completely dehydrochlorinated to tcbs after 24 h considered equilibrium conditions whereas at the same reaction time the hydrolysis of β hch the most refractory hch isomer was below 40 as previously stated the remediation of hchs polluted soils is mainly limited by the low aqueous solubility of the pollutants 9 16 with values in the range α hch 4 1 6 9 μmol l 1 and β hch 0 5 2 4 μmol l 1 39 thus the moles of cocs in the aqueous phase in equilibrium with the soil at the conditions tested 15 g of soil and 30 ml of water are low 0 6 μmol fig sm 1 a the moles of cocs solubilized in the aqueous phase highly increased at alkaline conditions 4 8 μmol fig sm 1 b decreasing the partition coefficient kd cocs from 69 2 to 5 8 l kg 1 this fact is attributable to the higher aqueous solubility of tcbs 1 2 4 tcb 170 8 270 0 μmol l 1 1 2 3 tcb 89 8 99 2 μmol l 1 and 1 3 5 tcb 33 1 μmol l 1 than the parent pollutants 10 39 3 2 selection of solubilization conditions the selection of the surfactant enhanced solubilization step conditions surfactant ph reagents addition order reagents concentration and the number of solubilization cycles was performed by attending to the surfactant ability to solubilize the pollutants from the soil to the emulsion other important aspects such as the adsorption of the surfactant in the soil or the unproductive consumption of oxidant associated with the surfactant in the following oxidation stage will be later considered 3 2 1 effect of surfactant and ph to evaluate the surfactant capacity the moles of cocs in the aqueous phase blue bars and the remaining cocs in the soil grey bars after se were determined in the presence of surfactants at neutral fig 1 a and alkaline fig 1 b conditions the final ph of the aqueous phase has been depicted as points right axis the results obtained without surfactants have also been included to facilitate comparison the corresponding kd cocs values red bar eq 4 at neutral and alkaline ph have been represented in fig 1 c and fig 1 d respectively the lower the partition coefficient the greater the pollutants solubilization in the aqueous phase and therefore the greater the solubilization capacity of the evaluated surfactant as shown in fig 1 a and c adding surfactants sds e3 and t80 at neutral ph improved cocs solubilization from the soil significantly decreasing kd cocs values the order obtained was t80 sds e3 different order for these surfactants e3 t80 sds was reported in the literature when they were used for cocs solubilization from the dense non aqueous liquid phase dnapl composed by a mixture of 28 cocs 34 35 this can be attributable to the different phases involved and different compositions of dnapl and technical hch highlighting the importance of studying the behaviour of each surfactant in the presence of different real contamination matrices carboneras et al 30 reported a lindane recovery of about 40 from spiked soil 1000 mg kgsoil 1 when using 5 g l 1 of sds and a vl ws 5 30 this value corresponds to kd cocs 7 5 l kg 1 being similar to those obtained in this work at neutral ph but with higher surfactant concentration 10 g l 1 this fact could be explained by i pollutants of the soil treated in the current work are mostly α and β hch isomers with lower water solubility than γ hch and ii it is a real polluted soil with aged pollution instead of a spiked soil it is well known that the ageing process leads to contaminant sequestration by soil 40 41 hindering the subsequent solubilization this point underlines the importance of studying aged polluted soils real contamination instead of spiked soils a significantly higher cocs solubilization was obtained at alkaline conditions ph 12 with e3 and sds kd cocs 1 8 l kg 1 in comparison with the values obtained at neutral ph kd cocs 8 0 and 12 0 l kg 1 respectively fig 1 c and d on the contrary a lower kd cocs at neutral ph kd cocs 6 8 l kg 1 than at alkaline conditions kd cocs 19 8 l kg 1 was obtained with the nonionic surfactant t80 fig 1 c and d the different soil cocs composition with ph can explain differences in kd cocs values at neutral and alkaline conditions dehydrochlorination of hchs to tcbs at alkaline ph enhances the cocs solubilization moreover the effect of ph on the surfactant properties must be considered sds critical micellar concentration cmc decreases when the ph increases 34 42 contributing to the higher cocs solubilization the ph effect on e3 cmc at room temperature was negligible in previous works 34 the results obtained suggest that t80 stability decreased with the ph increase and surfactant precipitation was found using t80 at alkaline conditions see fig sm 2 at ph 12 explaining the decrease of cocs solubilization and the corresponding kd cocs increase fig 1 b and d respectively iglesias et al 43 tested the stability of this surfactant over the ph range 2 10 founding that a ph increase had a positive effect on the surface tension of t80 43 which could be related to the better stability of fatty acids surfactant micelles in the presence of a base 43 44 thus the poor results obtained for the t80 surfactant in the current work could be attributed to the extremely alkaline conditions here employed ph 12 cnaoh 13 5 g l 1 in order to increase t80 stability the effect of naoh concentration and contacting time maintaining ph 12 have been further analyzed subsections 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 the distribution of the pollutants in μmol in the soil and aqueous phases after the surfactant enhanced solubilization step runs se3 se8 for each surfactant and ph condition are shown in fig sm 3 since there is no cocs transformation at neutral ph hchs isomers explain around 98 of cocs in both phases at alkaline ph the hchs hydrolysis eq 3 justifies that the predominant compounds are tcbs in both phases 10 17 39 regardless of the surfactant used β hch was not completely dehydrochlorinated fig sm 3 d e and f emphasizing that β hch hydrolysis to tcbs is the limiting step for the solubilization process as previously reported in bibliography 9 17 3 2 2 reagents addition order ph 12 the sequential reagent adding produces hchs dehydrochlorination to tcbs before the surfactant is added and further addition of the surfactant facilitates the tcbs solubilization in this way the time that surfactant is kept at alkaline conditions in the pollutants solubilization step decreases and its stability in the case of t80 is expected to increase the moles of cocs solubilized in the aqueous phase and those remaining in the soil are shown in fig 2 b moles of cocs in the aqueous phase before and after the surfactant is added are also indicated for the scope of comparison the moles of cocs in both phases corresponding to the simultaneous addition of naoh and surfactants have also been plotted fig 2 a corresponding kd cocs values l kg 1 are also shown in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 b the moles of cocs solubilized after naoh addition 1 2 μmol stage common for the three experiments se6 se7 and se8 are significantly lower than those shown in fig sm 1 after soil alkalinization 4 8 μmol se2 the alkalinization step in se6 se7 and se8 lasted 4 h instead of the 24 h required in se2 to reach equilibrium conditions the short time used in se6 se7 and se8 did not allow to reach the equilibrium achieved in se2 due to diffusional limitations in cocs solubilization mainly tcbs from the soil phase where they are generated to the aqueous phase 9 17 firstly the negative effect of naoh on t80 stability is confirmed with the lower values of kd cocs obtained in the sequential treatment than the simultaneous one kd cocs with t80 at alkaline conditions in both experiments are remarkably higher than those obtained with sds and e3 on the other hand the sequential addition of reagents produced slightly higher solubilization of contaminants compared with the simultaneous addition of naoh and surfactant for sds and e3 therefore further experiments will be carried out by adding the reagents simultaneously it should be noted that the reagents addition order did not influence the final ph of the pollutants solubilization step maintaining a final ph value higher than 12 in both cases data not shown 3 2 3 effect of alkali concentration as previously observed the solubilization efficiency increased at alkaline conditions regrettably the stability of one of the tested surfactants t80 is compromised in these conditions experiments at lower naoh concentrations 4 and 2 5 and g l 1 ph0 12 in all cases with the three surfactants tested have been performed to increase surfactant stability and reduce subsequent soil alkalinity and the reagents cost the distribution of cocs between the soil and the aqueous phase the corresponding kd cocs and final ph values have been plotted in fig 3 a f as shown as naoh concentration decreases the ph of the resulting emulsion 24 h decreases regardless of the surfactant used nevertheless it remains above 12 at all the naoh concentrations ensuring the hchs conversion to tcbs in all the scenarios tested the decrease of naoh increases the solubilized moles of cocs when t80 is used with the consequent decrease in the partition coefficient kd cocs was 19 8 7 0 and 2 4 l kg 1 for cnaoh 13 5 4 0 and 2 5 g l 1 respectively however this value is higher than those obtained with the other two surfactants at the three concentrations of naoh tested so the use of t80 in subsequent tests is discarded working with sds and e3 the partition coefficient decreases when naoh concentration decreases from 13 5 to 4 g l 1 but slightly increases at naoh concentrations below 4 g l 1 therefore a concentration of naoh equal to 4 g l 1 has been selected for the pollutants solubilization step with these surfactants sds and e3 3 2 4 effect of surfactant concentration the effect of surfactant concentration 2 10 g l 1 was studied using cnaoh of 4 g l 1 in the presence of sds and e3 the results obtained for cocs distribution final ph and kd cocs have been depicted in fig 4 a d the higher the surfactant concentration the higher the cocs concentration in the emulsion a conclusion previously reported in the literature 35 43 45 48 thus kd cocs decreased by increasing the surfactant concentration fig 4 b and fig 4 d for sds and e3 respectively being more significant from 2 to 5 g l 1 than from 5 to 10 g l 1 this fact may be due to the solubility of contaminants is likely to increase up to a given value and no improvement is obtained by working with higher concentrations 49 50 highlighting the need to study each particular case on the other hand an excessive concentration of surfactant in the subsequent oxidation stage is undesirable because it decreases the efficiency of the process due to i surfactant micelles can act as a protective medium significantly reducing the cocs availability towards radicals oxidation 23 27 and ii the surfactant can compete with the contaminants for the radicals formed 25 27 thus a concentration of surfactant of 5 g l 1 has been selected for the solubilization stage 3 2 5 effect of successive solubilization cycles three successive solubilization cycles were performed with sds and e3 at the conditions previously selected cocs removal percentage from polluted soil in these cycles solubilization rate has been calculated following eq 5 in which c cocs aq is the cocs concentration in the aqueous phase q cocs soil is the initial cocs concentration in the polluted soil and vl ws is the liquid soil ratio used the results obtained are depicted in fig 5 additionally the kd cocs l kg 1 values eq 4 for each solubilization cycle have been included 5 solubilization rate c cocs aq v l w s q cocs soil 100 according to fig 5 58 4 21 1 and 3 0 of the initial cocs in soil were solubilized to the aqueous phase after the first second and third solubilization cycle with sds total removal 82 5 final cocs removal was slightly higher 88 8 with e3 kd cocs values in the successive solubilization cycles increase in the case of sds fig 5 a and slightly decrease in e3 fig 5 b in the first solubilization cycle with sds a higher amount of cocs in the soil is solubilized compared to using e3 the remaining cocs in the soil after the first solubilization cycle seem less accessible to the surfactant due to stronger adsorption to the soil or a hindering effect of the adsorbed sds on the contrary adding e3 allows desorbing cocs with the same effectiveness in successive solubilization cycles similar kd cocs values cocs solubilized in runs se21 sds and se24 e3 were lower 72 despite the higher mass of surfactant used in these runs compared with the total surfactant added in the corresponding three successive solubilization runs 3 3 oxidation of polluted emulsions the polluted emulsions pes obtained in runs se16 sds se18 e3 and the liquid phase sum of emulsion from runs se16 se19 and se20 sds and runs se18 se22 and se23 e3 have been used for the study of cocs oxidation these runs are named pe sds 1 pe e3 1 pe sds 1 2 3 and pe e3 1 2 3 respectively as a result of the solubilization step part of the surfactant was adsorbed into the soil 35 51 after the solubilization the surfactant concentration sds and e3 was calculated from toc measurements and the results obtained are included in table sm 1 the initial concentration of surfactants sds and e3 used in the se16 and se18 experiments was 5 g l 1 table 1 the equivalent initial surfactant concentration in runs se16 se19 and se20 sds and runs se18 se22 and se23 e3 was 2 9 g l 1 average of three values employed of 5 2 5 and 1 25 g l 1 the measured concentration of sds after soil washing was 4 1 and 2 6 g l 1 for pe sds 1 and pe sds 1 2 3 respectively the measured concentration of e3 in the resulting pes was 3 1 and 2 3 g l 1 for pe e3 1 and pe e3 1 2 3 respectively from these results it can be inferred that higher adsorption of e3 3 8 g kgsoil 1 than sds 1 8 g kgsoil 1 on the polluted soil was found at the conditions tested conversely garcia cervilla et al 35 reported a slightly higher sds adsorption than e3 into a highly polluted soil cocs 10 000 mg kgsoil 1 at alkaline conditions ph 12 cnaoh 7 g l 1 35 these authors also reported that a higher cocs concentration in soil resulted in higher surfactant adsorption 35 thus the differences obtained with respect to the current work can be related to i the significant difference in cocs concentration 10 000 mg kg 1 vs 373 mg kg 1 and ii the different nature of cocs 28 cocs vs only hchs isomers all this points to the need to study the behaviour of each surfactant in soils with different types of real pollution additionally it should be higlighted that the remanent surfactant concentration adsorbed to soil 1 8 sds 3 8 e3 g kgsoil 1 both in the case of a single and 3 successive solubilization cycles would not represent a problem since the application of this technology is intended to treat a very delimited area of the landfill and the treated soil would not be used in any case for agricultural or livestock purposes but rather could be used as a building material considering the alkaline ph obtained in the polluted emulsions the oxidation system selected for the subsequent cocs abatement in the emulsion is ps activated by alkali on the other hand considering the promising results recently obtained when this process was intensified by temperature 5 10 17 52 a temperature of 40 c was selected the oxidizable organic matter in the reaction medium is comprised of solubilized cocs in this case mainly tcbs and the surfactant a relatively high oxidant dose was used to avoid the oxidant depletion by an unproductive reaction with the surfactant 1 23 53 54 57 therefore a ps concentration of 40 g l 1 has been selected 10 17 52 finally the molar naoh ps ratio was fixed at 2 a value commonly found in the literature which ensures a ph 12 necessary for alkaline activation of ps during the reaction 9 10 18 the time evolution of cocs xcocs and oxidant xps conversion under the selected operating conditions is shown in fig 6 a and b respectively blank experiments in the absence of ps were undertaken to discard volatilization or adsorption of cocs mainly tcbs during pes treatment at 40 c experimental conditions summarized in table sm 1 the decrease of cocs concentration in blank runs was below 20 in all cases 72 h data not shown fig sm 4 shows the colour evolution of the emulsions in the oxidation ox and blank blank experiments as can be seen the colour remains unchanged in the blank experiments during the experimental time indicating that no reaction took place however the colour becomes yellowish with time in the case of oxidation experiments suggesting that cocs and surfactant oxidation occurred 23 ps conversion was considerably higher when treating e3 pe e3 1 xps 50 6 h than sds pe sds 1 xps 20 6 h emulsions furthermore the oxidant consumption was higher in the experiment carried out with a higher initial concentration of e3 pe e3 1 2 3 which can be associated with the unproductive consumption of ps with this surfactant fig 6 b in the case of sds emulsions the differences in ps conversion in the tests with different concentrations of surfactant pe sds 1 and pe sds 1 2 3 respectively are less significant fig 6 b the rapid decomposition of ps in the experiments with e3 emulsions generated a high concentration of hydrogen cations 17 which is associated with a considerable decrease in the ph of the reaction medium fig 6 c in these experiments the ph decreased below the required value for the alkaline activation of ps ph 12 and thus hydroxyl radicals are no longer produced 17 all this led to low contaminant conversion xcocs 30 72 h fig 6 a it should be noted that cocs conversion was slightly higher when treating pe e3 1 2 3 than pe e3 1 with lower surfactant concentration table sm 1 which can be attributed to a protecting effect of surfactant micelles against pollutants oxidation this behaviour was previously observed in the oxidation of a complex liquid mixture of cocs by using ps activated by alkali as an oxidant and e3 as a surfactant 57 in that work it was found that concentrations of e3 above 2 5 g l 1 caused only unproductive reactions without cocs removal this hindering effect was also noticed in the presence of other surfactants and ps activation methods 24 25 46 thus considering this aspect to improve the oxidation treatment lower concentrations of e3 should have been used in the precedent solubilization process which would limit the efficiency of this first stage when treating the sds emulsions higher cocs conversions were achieved removing 96 of the contaminants in 72 h of treatment fig 6 a at these conditions no chlorinated intermediate compounds were detected as previously observed in the treatment of this soil by ps naoh t 17 comparing with the results obtained in that work it should be underlined the higher cocs conversion 96 vs 80 achieved in the presence of surfactant at the same operating conditions cps 40 g l 1 40 c 72 h 17 highlighting the beneficial role of the surfactant additionally due to the low solubility of β hch the most recalcitrant hch isomer and low hydrolysis rate to tcbs the conversion of this compound when no surfactant was used was below 70 17 in the current work the solubilization of β hch in the emulsion was almost 80 fig sm 3 confirming that the synergetic effect of naoh and surfactant enhanced the dehydrochlorination of this refractory compound and subsequent solubilization of tcbs which were further removed in the oxidation treatment additional experiments in the absence of cocs and using the same concentration of ps 40 g l 1 and surfactants sds and e3 were performed to know more about the unproductive consumption of the oxidant due to the presence of surfactant experimental conditions in table sm 1 the oxidant consumption was almost independent of the cocs presence data not shown for each surfactant therefore ps was mostly consumed in an unproductive reaction with the surfactant at the temperature tested the unproductive consumption of ps 40 g l 1 at different temperatures in the absence of surfactant was studied in a previous work obtaining significantly lower oxidant consumption 7 5 and 20 at 35 c and 45 c respectively 72 h 5 these results demonstrate that the presence of surfactant both sds and e3 significantly increases the unproductive oxidant consumption xps 70 in both cases additionally as previously mentioned in the case of cocs presence fig 6 b the unproductive ps consumption in the presence of the non ionic surfactant e3 was considerably higher than using sds data not shown in accordance with that previously reported in the literature 19 24 55 56 wang et al 56 reported that the higher stability of sds against ps was associated to the existence of repulsion forces between so4 radicals generated in the ps t system and the sulfonate anions located at the exterior of the sds micelle 56 in conclusion the lower unproductive consumption of ps with sds and the higher cocs removal from the emulsion make sds preferable for this treatment at the experimental conditions used 4 conclusions the results obtained in the present work reveal that the combination of surfactant aided solubilization and selective oxidation of pollutants by ps activated by alkali and intensified by temperature is a promising alternative for the remediation of real hchs polluted soils the ph plays a fundamental role in the remediation process at neutral ph surfactant addition slightly increased the solubilized mass of cocs decreasing the partition coefficients at ph 12 higher cocs solubility was achieved since hchs hydrolyze to trichlorobenzenes with significantly higher water solubility than the parent compounds one of the surfactants tested t80 was not stable at ph 12 and the concentration of cocs solubilized decreased naoh and surfactant concentration remarkably affected the pollutants solubilization efficiency the highest cocs solubilization was obtained at moderate naoh concentration 4 g l 1 finding the surfactant solubilization order sds kd cocs 1 0 l kg 1 e3 kd cocs 1 3 l kg 1 t80 kd cocs 7 0 l kg 1 the higher the surfactant concentration the lower the kd cocs value being this improvement lower as the surfactant concentration increases more than 80 of cocs were extracted from the soil using optimal solubilization conditions sds or e3 5 g l 1 ph 12 simultaneous addition of reagents vl ws 2 and 3 successive solubilization cycles of 24 h the resulting emulsions σcocs 34 70 mg l 1 mainly as tcbs were subsequently treated by ps naoh t cps 40 g l 1 naoh ps 2 and t 40 c cocs conversions of 30 and 96 were achieved in 72 h when treating e3 and sds emulsions respectively highlighting the suitability of sds for the integrated surfactant enhanced solubilization and emulsion treatment process this work provides practical information for the design of a future on site remediation treatment of superficial real hch polluted soils however pilot studies using large scale reactors need to be performed before field scale implementation considering the location and agitation type the geometry of the reactors the flow rates and the energy consumption among others declaration of competing

12483,hyper crosslinked polymers are frequently used to recover specific guest molecules due to their high porosities excellent chemical properties and structural stability however the recovery of powder adsorbents poses a significant challenge in the extraction of uranyl from aqueous solutions which limits their practical application a phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w p was successfully synthesized and utilized for the extraction of uranyl from radioactive wastewater and seawater compared to previously reported adsorbents c4 w p demonstrated rapid uranyl capture

and endothermic nature of the adsorption process furthermore c4 w p exhibited exceptional structural stability with only a 9 7 reduction in adsorption capacity after six adsorption desorption cycles additionally c4 w p demonstrated excellent selectivity in simulated wastewater containing 16 rare metal ions and simulated seawater containing an additional five metal ions the kd u values were recorded to be 1817 2 and 33 265 3 ml g 1 respectively for these conditions these results demonstrate the high efficiency uranium removal capabilities of c4 w p under realistic conditions the abundant phosphate groups 1 69 mmol g 1 on the material surface were identified as the primary adsorption contributors overall this study provides a promising strategy for uranyl extraction with high selectivity and ease of preparation contributing to environmental protection and economic development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calix 4 arene wood phosphorylation adsorption uranyl data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nuclear energy is considered an efficient and clean source of energy 1 2 which can meet energy demands while reducing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on global warming 3 4 uranium a key component of nuclear energy 5 is becoming scarce due to the rapid growth of the nuclear industry and the depletion of terrestrial uranium mines 6 7 additionally the discharge of uranium containing wastewater results in a significant degree of nuclear pollution 8 9 therefore the development of efficient uranium extraction and purification technologies has become a research priority 10 adsorption based technology offers cost effective 11 environmentally friendly and easy to operate 12 13 alternatives to traditional uranyl extraction methods phosphate groups have been found to exhibit a high affinity for u vi as demonstrated by experimental and theoretical studies in recent years various phosphate based materials such as phosphorylated graphene oxide chitosan composite 14 phosphorylated carbon aerogel 15 phosphorylated pan fiber 16 phosphorylated biomass derived porous carbon 17 and phosphorylated feather fiber 12 have been investigated as potential uranium extractants balsa wood being lightweight sturdy and cost effective 18 finds widespread usage in several areas such as aviation navigation sound insulation and heat insulation cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are the primary constituents of wood 18 owing to an abundance of surface hydroxyl groups cellulose based porous materials have been extensively studied to extract uranyl ions from aqueous solutions 19 21 however the usage of lignin as a potential material for uranyl extraction has not been explored lignin a biomacromolecule with a complex three dimensional structure formed by linking three types of phenylpropane units comprises of a high density of aromatic ring containing structures hydroxyl groups quinone groups and other active groups that facilitate various chemical reactions in a previous work we have synthesized hyper crosslinked calix 4 arene units through a friedel crafts alkylation reaction which was followed by the phosphorylation of the obtained product to yield a highly effective sorbent for uranium capture from seawater 22 however the material s powder form limits its practical application as it is challenging to separate the powdered compounds from aqueous solutions 15 additionally the previous study employed solely calix 4 arene for hyper crosslinking which results in a significantly high production cost for the material we developed a calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w exploiting the principles of green chemistry by hyper crosslinking calix 4 arene with the lignin of balsa wood this copolymer was synthesized to overcome the challenge associated with the difficult separation of powder adsorbents and reduce production costs we introduced phosphate groups to the copolymer through a phosphorylation reaction using phosphorus oxychloride as a modifier to further enhance uranium adsorption properties the resulting phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w p exhibited significantly improved uranium adsorption performance due to the introduction of the phosphate groups additionally the high temperature reaction resulted in the dissolution of the non crosslinked portion of the c4 w structure increasing the structural crosslinking degree of the material overall c4 w p demonstrated excellent selective uranium adsorption properties in acidic wastewater and seawater making it an exceptional adsorbent for large scale uranium it can be used to develop a cost effective method to recover uranium from aqueous solutions efficiently 2 materials

the experiments were all conducted in 50 ml 60 mg l 1 u solution at a temperature of 298 k to reduce the experimental and test error the equilibrated mixture was passed through a syringe filter 0 45 μm after a fix time of adsorption on a thermostatically controlled shaker 140 rpm and the residual u concentration was determined by icp aes a blank control group was set for each adsorption

mass of the adsorbent details of regeneration experiments and selectivity tests are described in texts s5 7 supporting information kinetic models thermodynamic models the calculation formulas of thermodynamic parameters elution efficiency and selectivity coefficient are also given texts s8 12 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of c4 w p the preparation process of c4 w p is depicted in scheme 1 briefly calix 4 arene and balsa wood were hyper crosslinked in 1 2 dichloroethane friedel crafts alkylation reaction was conducted to prepare the c4 w copolymer the c4 w sample with the maximum crosslinking degree was selected by adjusting the amount of calixarene hyper crosslinked calix 4 arene are not present in the reaction product phosphorylation reaction was conducted to introduce phosphate groups onto the material surface the resulting products were subjected to repeated washing and freeze drying to obtain the c4 w p samples anhydrous alcl3 served as the catalyst for both reactions and the al ion content in the obtained materials was analyzed using the icp ms technique post microwave digestion to ensure material purity microwave digestion conditions are presented in text s2 supporting information calculation results revealed that the al residues in c4 w and c4 w p were 0 039 and 0 021 respectively signifying their negligible presence in the material thus the synthesized material was highly pure furthermore the p content in c4 w p was quantified using the icp aes technique post microwave digestion indicating a p content of 104 8 mg l 1 1 69 mmol g 1 the results indicated successful phosphorylation analysis of the sem images in fig s1a supporting information revealed that the surface of the original wood was smooth and textured during the cross linking reaction the benzene ring in the calixarene structure cross links significantly with the aromatic ring in the lignin structure resulting in the generation of a rough wooden surface fig 1a the participation of the benzene ring in the cross linking process was verified by observing the change in its skeleton vibration peak 1650 1450 cm 1 fig 2a c 23 the significant increase in the intensity of the absorption peak confirmed the progress of the cross linking reaction as depicted in fig 2a b the broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration peak of oh 24 while the peak at 3000 2800 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration peak of ch 25 additionally the adsorption peak at 1300 1000 cm 1 represents the in plane bending vibration of oh and the stretching vibration of co 26 27 the adsorption peak at 900 690 cm 1 represents the out of plane bending vibration of the ch group on the benzene ring considering the pronounced overlap of absorption peaks of calix 4 arene and wood in ft ir spectra to ascertain the formation of the c4 w copolymer crosslinking products of wood hw the preparation method is shown in text s3 supporting information were prepared under identical conditions were prepared under the same conditions as shown in fig s1 supporting information the basic morphology of hw did not significantly change from the original balsa wood with the filaments on the wood surface appearing as torn fibers this further confirms the progress of the cross linking reaction during the phosphorylation reaction c4 w undergoes a reaction with pocl3 at 115 c causing the rapid dissolution of the non crosslinking structure of c4 w this results in the formation of c4 w p which has a porous structure and is suitable for applications involving the trapping of uranyl ions the changes in the structure can be verified through a comparison of the sem fig 1a b and tem images fig 1h i as well as the increase in the specific surface area of the material fig 3a 28 upon comparing the tem images it was observed that the content of fibers in the c4 w p structure was significantly reduced with the shaded areas predominantly consisting of fibers this indicated that the cellulose and hemicellulose structures that were not involved with the crosslinking process existed in a primarily dissolved state a comparison between the profiles recorded for the c4 w and the phosphorylated c4 w p system revealed the presence of a p 2p signal on the surface of the material fig 4a thereby confirming the presence of the p element 10 the electron distribution of p in the eds results fig 1d k also supports this finding 16 17 the xps spectra indicated that the p content on the surface of c4 w p was 1 73 mmol g 1 which was in line with the results obtained using the icp aes technique the existence of po was confirmed by the shift in the binding energies of coc p c poh and po co 0 34 0 55 and 0 2 ev respectively additionally a new signal at 530 68 ev confirmed the formation of po fig 4b 15 27 29 despite the overlap between the absorption peaks corresponding to oh and coc at 1300 1000 cm 1 with phosphate groups the shift in absorption peaks and formation of a new peak at 1012 cm 1 po po demonstrated phosphorylation fig 2d 15 17 the dissolution of non crosslinked structures during the phosphorylation reaction rapidly increases the structural crosslinking degree of the material as a result the obtained c4 w p possesses higher structural stability compared to c4 w as confirmed by the tga analysis data at higher temperatures 300 c as shown in fig 3b there is no significant difference between the two materials at lower temperatures 200 c and this can be attributed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water 27 30 however above 300 c c4 w experiences rapid weight loss primarily due to the rapid decomposition of un crosslinked structures in contrast the weight loss of c4 w p at high temperatures showed a linear trend indicating the material s homogeneity which was also confirmed by the p content calculated using the icp aes and xps techniques the acid alkali resistance of c4 w p was evaluated using a 0 5 m hno3 naoh solution details of the acid alkali treatment are provided in text s4 supporting information the ft ir spectral profiles recorded for c4 w p acid and c4 w p basic were comparable to those recorded for c4 w p fig s2 supporting information indicating that c4 w p exhibits good acid alkali resistance we conducted the low temperature nitrogen adsorption tests to assess the pore properties of the materials to further investigate the pore structure of the material fig 3a the specific surface area of c4 w p was found to be 11 34 m2 g 1 and the average pore size was measured to be 15 95 nm which appeared to deviate significantly from the results obtained using the sem technique fig 1b this observation could be attributed to the fact that the pores in the material primarily consisted of interlayer gaps the irregular structure and large size of the pores in the wood could not be detected by the bet method 31 which led to the detection of only micropores in the material structure interestingly the adsorption desorption isotherms presented an unclosed hysteresis loop under conditions of low relative pressure and this could be attributed to the presence of interlayer gaps in the wood 32 3 2 uranium adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the solution is a crucial factor that impacts the zeta potential of the material fig s3 supporting information and the speciation of uranyl ions 15 17 20 therefore the effect of ph on adsorption was initially investigated as shown in fig 5a the adsorption capacity of the material exhibited a substantial change before and after phosphorylation indicating that the phosphate groups improved the adsorption performance and chemical adsorption predominated the adsorption process when the ph value is low ph 3 7 the surface charge of c4 w p is positive and the positively charged uranyl species uo2 2 uo2 oh experience strong electrostatic repulsion with the material surface 16 23 additionally the competitive adsorption of h inhibits the complexation of uranyl ions on the material surface 1 23 29 these factors result in a decrease in the material s adsorption capacity as the ph value increases 3 7 ph 5 the competitive adsorption of h gradually decreases 2 4 reducing the protonation degree of the phosphate group on the material surface hence the lone pair of electrons on oxygen atoms in poh and po are more likely to occupy the empty orbitals of the u atoms promoting the formation of uranyl complexes 8 15 at ph 5 the adsorption capacity reaches its maximum of 292 5 mg g 1 however when 5 ph 7 the adsorption capacity decreases with increasing ph this decrease can be attributed to the formation of u vi hydroxyl complexes between oh and uranyl ions at high ph conditions resulting in a decrease in the diffusion of uranyl ions this eventually affects the efficiency of the adsorption process 8 17 20 when the ph of the system exceeds 7 uranyl ions begin to form negatively charged complex anions uo2 co3 2 2 uo2 co3 3 4 and the negatively charged ions exert a strong repulsive effect on the material surface leading to a decrease in the adsorption efficiency 9 10 19 based on this result ph 5 was chosen as the optimal condition in the following tests 3 2 2 effect of sorbent dose from an industrial application standpoint the adsorbent dose is a critical parameter for studying the adsorption phenomenon the effect of the adsorbent dosage on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of c4 w p is shown in fig 5b as the adsorbent dosage increases the amount of uranyl ion adsorbed per unit adsorbent decreases while the removal efficiency of uranyl ions in solution increases this can be attributed to the fact that the number of effective active sites on the surface of the adsorbent increases with an increase in adsorbent dosage resulting in a higher adsorption percentage 2 however a further increase in adsorbent dosage and the aggregation overlapping of adsorption sites results in an increase in the path length for uranyl ion diffusion ultimately decreasing the adsorption capacity 27 33 thus it can be concluded that using an excess of adsorbent at high dosage levels leads to surplus adsorption sites reducing the utilization ratio of adsorbent and resulting in resource waste consequently an optimal dosage of 0 10 g l 1 was used in subsequent experiments 3 2 3 kinetics study contact time is a critical factor in assessing the adsorption efficiency of materials as uranyl ions move in solution before diffusing into the material surface and eventually getting adsorbed 2 the adsorption kinetics studied for c4 w p in a solution of u 60 mg l 1 is shown in fig 6a it is evident that rapid adsorption occurs during the first 60 min and equilibrium is reached within 150 min the abundant active adsorption sites on the surface of c4 w p promote the rapid adsorption of u vi as the adsorption process proceeds the availability of effective adsorption sites decreases 2 6 8 and the uranyl ions adsorbed on the material surface exert a strong electrostatic repulsion on the free uranyl ions in the solution 16 as a result the adsorption curves gradually level off over time the experimental data were fitted using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models to investigate the mechanism controlling the adsorption process fig 6a c table 1 the results indicated that the adsorption process fits well with the pseudo second order model r2 0 98982 and the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity was 326 8 mg g 1 which was close to the experimental data of 295 1 mg g 1 this indicates that the adsorption rate primarily depends on the number of effective adsorption sites on the material surface 34 and the adsorption process is primarily dominated by chemical adsorption 4 7 35 consistent with the conclusion made previously the intraparticle diffusion model was also used to analyze the diffusion mechanism and the kinetic adsorption results as shown in fig 6d the multilinear plots suggests that u vi adsorption on the surface of c4 w p proceeds over two stages 2 27 the first stage involves surface adsorption where uranyl ions rapidly coordinate with the adsorption sites on the material surface 6 in the second stage u vi gradually diffuses into the pores of the absorbent 2 6 these two stages possibly occur simultaneously notably none of the three curves pass through the origin indicating that the step associated with intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step 6 3 2 4 thermodynamics study it is crucial to establish an appropriate isothermal adsorption model based on experimental data to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the adsorption mechanism and process fig 7a presents the adsorption isotherms recorded for c4 w p over a range of initial u concentrations 1 200 mg l 1 the results demonstrate that varying temperatures have no significant effect on the adsorption capacity of c4 w p at low concentrations however as the initial u concentration increases the equilibrium adsorption amount of uranium increases with temperature this indicates that the adsorption process of c4 w p is endothermic 35 and aligns with the uranium adsorption behavior of common phosphate based adsorbents 16 17 this can be attributed to the greater driving force of concentration difference at higher concentrations and the faster molecular motion at higher temperatures which promote the adsorption process 23 36 we used two isotherm models namely the langmuir and freundlich models to simulate the experimental data to further clarify the adsorption mechanism of u vi on the surface of c4 w p fig 7b c the corresponding parameters are shown in table 2 the results revealed that the langmuir model fitting had a good linear relationship r2 0 99 indicating that the active sites on the material surface are homogeneously distributed 37 furthermore the adsorption of uranyl by c4 w p is a monolayer chemisorption process 2 5 28 the gibbs free energy change δg entropy change δs and enthalpy change δh were calculated based on the intercept and slope of the linear fitting of ln kl 1 t fig 7d as shown in table 3 the values of δg were negative and decreased as the temperature increased indicating that the adsorption of uranyl by c4 w p is a spontaneous endothermic process it was also observed that adsorption was favored at high temperature conditions 9 16 17 this was also confirmed by the positive value of δh additionally the positive value of δs signified that c4 w p exhibits a high affinity for u vi and the disorder of the solid liquid system increased during the adsorption process 10 3 3 circulation and regeneration the reusability and recycling abilities of adsorbents have significant practical applications 9 28 as shown in fig 8 we studied the adsorption desorption performances of the systems using a solution of hcl 0 1 m as the eluent to release the adsorbed uranium before the next cycle the result showed that the elution efficiency reached a maximum of 92 4 after 30 min of elution the desorption mechanism can be deduced from the ph dependent experimental results a higher concentration of h in the solution strongly attacks the uranyl ions adsorbed on the material surface and this is contrary to the adsorption process 12 16 furthermore uranyl ions are only fixed on the material surface in the adsorption process since the pore structure of the material originates primarily from the interlayer gap avoiding retention in the pores this results in the progress of a rapid desorption process 38 c4 w p maintained 90 3 of its initial adsorption capacity after six cycles 267 5 mg g 1 with an average reduction of 1 9 after each regeneration cycle this indicates that c4 w p exhibits outstanding uranium adsorption reusability 39 40 3 4 selective experiments in acidic wastewater nuclear activities result in the production of large amounts of wastewater containing various ions these coexisting ions can cause interference in the extraction recovery process of uranium 41 therefore we attempted to selectively remove targeted uranyl ions from an aqueous solution containing different metal ions based on the physicochemical properties of uranium we selected competing elements from rare metals that may be present in radioactive wastewater solutions these included rare light metals li and rb scattered metals ga3 and in3 and rare earth metals y3 la3 ce3 pr3 sm3 eu3 gd3 dy3 ho3 er3 and yb3 the selectivity test in wastewater was performed in a fixed bed column scheme s1 supporting information and we evaluated the selectivity by studying different parameters it is worth noting that the solution contained 16 mixed metal cations and the metal ions in the aqueous solution tended to precipitate at higher ph values therefore the selectivity test was performed at ph 4 as shown in fig 9 c4 w p exhibited a much higher u vi adsorption capacity than other metal cations maximum adsorption capacity 185 3 mg g 1 this is attributed to the selective coordination of phosphate groups to u vi 10 the differential binding affinity between materials and metal ions is determined by the intrinsic properties of metal ions and functional groups 16 c4 w p has a higher kd value for u vi 1817 2 ml g 1 compared to other competing ions the calculated su m values ranged from 3 3 to 46 9 table 4 indicating a high selectivity of c4 w p for u vi in complex solutions 17 it is worth noting that the material is not highly selective for rb however considering that light metals are not usually present in radioactive wastewater we believe that this does not affect the further application of c4 w p in wastewater 3 5 selective experiments in simulated seawater the extraction of uranyl from seawater is a matter of great significance for ensuring resource sustainability and environmental security 42 however the process remains highly challenging due to the presence of a large amount of competing metal ions and various microorganisms 28 in this study we prepared simulated seawater solutions by dissolving sea salt collected from bohai bay except for the simulated seawater extra ions such as fe3 ni2 zn2 pb2 and co2 were added to the solution to simulate the seawater solution with coexisting ions the selectivity testing was performed using a fixed bed column to accommodate the fluidity of seawater the concentration of uranium added to the solutions was fixed at 33 3 μg l 1 to reduce experimental and testing errors in fig 10a it can be observed that c4 w p demonstrated a remarkable capacity for the adsorption of uranium in simulated seawater achieving a removal rate of 82 4 despite a slight reduction in uranium adsorption capacity after the addition of coexisting ions the removal rate was still relatively high at 76 9 fig 10b these results suggest that the material possesses a high adsorption capacity for uranyl ions and exhibits the potential to efficiently recover industrial uranium from natural seawater 6 19 a high removal rate of pb was recorded in the simulated seawater solution containing coexisting ions similar results were obtained with other phosphate based adsorbents 12 the removal mechanism remains unclear nevertheless c4 w p still exhibited good selectivity for pb with an su pb value of 14 0 table 6 moreover the material displayed significantly high selectivity for other ions with su m values ranging from 23 5 to 4921 6 it is important to note that c4 w p exhibited a low adsorption capacity for vanadium in both simulated seawater and simulated seawater solutions with coexisting ions which was far greater than amidoxime based adsorbents table 5 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity of c4 w p and reported adsorbents table s1 supporting information compares the uranium absorption properties of c4 w p with some reported phosphate based materials also some adsorbents used natural products as raw materials as a uranyl extractant c4 w p can selectively extract uranyl from acidic wastewater and weakly alkaline seawater which is not achieved by most reported adsorbents even with the addition of 15 competing ions in the samples used for wastewater testing c4 w p still exhibited a kd u of 1817 2 ml g 1 which is comparable to that of numerous wastewater uranyl extractants moreover except for rb the material showed relatively high selectivity for other metal ions the highest selectivity coefficient was recorded for eu3 46 9 more significantly the wastewater testing process was conducted at ph 4 and a strongly acidic environment can lead to reduced selectivity the selectivity tests conducted for c4 w p yield convincing results due to limited conditions the selectivity tests with c4 w p were carried out in simulated seawater which are not comparable to the ocean test of individual reported sorbents even so c4 w p exhibited higher selectivity in simulated seawater in the presence of five coexisting ions su m 23 5 4921 6 than ff pt among them the selectivity of v5 fe3 co2 ni2 and pb2 is significantly more advantageous it follows that c4 w p exhibits good uranium adsorption properties and is expected to be used for uranyl extraction from seawater and nuclear wastewater 3 7 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism was preliminarily discussed by analyzing ft ir spectral profiles recorded for c4 w p before and after u vi adsorption as illustrated in fig 2d e the three signals corresponding to po po appearing in the range of 1300 1000 cm 1 changed significantly after u vi adsorption the change in vibration intensity and frequency indicates the formation of a coordination bond between the phosphate group and u vi which results in a change in electron cloud density thus causing changes in the infrared spectrum 8 10 16 29 the antisymmetric stretching vibration peak of ouo appears at 925 cm 1 11 43 indicating that the interaction between u vi and the adsorbent surface is not solely governed by electrostatic forces 44 this is consistent with the results reported in the kinetics and thermodynamic sections to further verify the adsorption of u vi by the material sem and eds analyses were performed on the material after the adsorption of u vi c4 w p u as shown in fig 1e g the material surface became smoother after the adsorption of uranium possibly due to adsorbed uranium filling the pore structure 35 the eds analysis indicated that u was evenly distributed on the material surface indicating that u vi was successfully fixed and c4 w p possessed the ability to capture u vi 12 29 45 the tem images fig 1l n showed more shadow in the c4 w p u structure which should be the deposition of uranium on the material surface according to the u element electron mapping this further indicates that u vi is successfully adsorbed on the adsorbent surface xps analysis was conducted on c4 w p to study the variation in the chemical structure before and after adsorption fig 4 the main peaks in the survey spectra were attributed to c 1s o 1s and p 2p with the appearance of u 4f after adsorption fig 4a the u 4f signal could be fitted as u 4f5 2 394 19 ev 392 80 ev and u 4f7 2 384 65 ev 381 97 ev fig 4d both of which belong to the spectral signals of u vi this indicates that no other valence states appear during the adsorption process and that u vi is successfully adsorbed on the material surface 1 29 43 after adsorption significant shifts were observed in the binding energies of coc p c poh and po in the o 1s spectral profiles 0 44 0 60 and 0 23 ev respectively fig 4b indicating that phosphate groups participated in the adsorption process 10 17 29 this was further confirmed by the shift in the binding energies of po and po in the p 2p spectral profiles fig 4c 1 12 additionally co in the lignin structure did not participate in adsorption although the intensity of the peaks corresponding to po co in the o 1s spectral profiles changed slightly before and after adsorption fig 4b the vibration intensity and frequency of the peak in the ft ir profiles corresponding to the co group did not change significantly fig 2d e based on the comprehensive analysis described above we hypothesize that the main mechanism of uranium adsorption by the phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer is chelation by phosphate groups the icp aes test showed that the concentration of phosphate groups on the surface of c4 w p was 1 69 mmol g 1 comparing the test data of c4 w and c4 w p at ph 5 fig 5a it was found that the amount of u vi chelated by phosphate groups was 272 0 mg g 1 1 14 mmol g 1 during the adsorption process this suggests that uranyl ions may be complexed by one or two phosphate groups based on the previous work and our findings scheme 2 proposes a potential adsorption mechanism for uranyl on the surface of c4 w p 4 conclusions a novel and effective selective uranyl extraction agent c4 w p was successfully prepared by hyper crosslinking lignin and calix 4 arene with natural balsa wood as skeletons the material exhibits a high uranium adsorption capacity 473 9 mg g 1 at ph 5 and excellent selective adsorption properties in acid wastewater and simulated seawater and this could be attributed to the introduction of phosphate groups in the materials the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models can explain the adsorption mechanism indicating that the adsorption of u vi on the material surface presents monolayer adsorption characteristics controlled by chemisorption xps and ft ir analysis revealed that the complexation of phosphate groups with u vi dictates the adsorption process the successful preparation of the phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer will provide valuable guidance for further use of calixarene and develop methods for extracting uranyl from aqueous solutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12483,hyper crosslinked polymers are frequently used to recover specific guest molecules due to their high porosities excellent chemical properties and structural stability however the recovery of powder adsorbents poses a significant challenge in the extraction of uranyl from aqueous solutions which limits their practical application a phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w p was successfully synthesized and utilized for the extraction of uranyl from radioactive wastewater and seawater compared to previously reported adsorbents c4 w p demonstrated rapid uranyl capture kinetics with adsorption equilibrium achieved within 150 min the material exhibited a monolayer saturation adsorption capacity of 473 9 mg g 1 at ph 5 thermodynamic studies confirmed the spontaneous and endothermic nature of the adsorption process furthermore c4 w p exhibited exceptional structural stability with only a 9 7 reduction in adsorption capacity after six adsorption desorption cycles additionally c4 w p demonstrated excellent selectivity in simulated wastewater containing 16 rare metal ions and simulated seawater containing an additional five metal ions the kd u values were recorded to be 1817 2 and 33 265 3 ml g 1 respectively for these conditions these results demonstrate the high efficiency uranium removal capabilities of c4 w p under realistic conditions the abundant phosphate groups 1 69 mmol g 1 on the material surface were identified as the primary adsorption contributors overall this study provides a promising strategy for uranyl extraction with high selectivity and ease of preparation contributing to environmental protection and economic development graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords calix 4 arene wood phosphorylation adsorption uranyl data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nuclear energy is considered an efficient and clean source of energy 1 2 which can meet energy demands while reducing the negative impacts of fossil fuels on global warming 3 4 uranium a key component of nuclear energy 5 is becoming scarce due to the rapid growth of the nuclear industry and the depletion of terrestrial uranium mines 6 7 additionally the discharge of uranium containing wastewater results in a significant degree of nuclear pollution 8 9 therefore the development of efficient uranium extraction and purification technologies has become a research priority 10 adsorption based technology offers cost effective 11 environmentally friendly and easy to operate 12 13 alternatives to traditional uranyl extraction methods phosphate groups have been found to exhibit a high affinity for u vi as demonstrated by experimental and theoretical studies in recent years various phosphate based materials such as phosphorylated graphene oxide chitosan composite 14 phosphorylated carbon aerogel 15 phosphorylated pan fiber 16 phosphorylated biomass derived porous carbon 17 and phosphorylated feather fiber 12 have been investigated as potential uranium extractants balsa wood being lightweight sturdy and cost effective 18 finds widespread usage in several areas such as aviation navigation sound insulation and heat insulation cellulose hemicellulose and lignin are the primary constituents of wood 18 owing to an abundance of surface hydroxyl groups cellulose based porous materials have been extensively studied to extract uranyl ions from aqueous solutions 19 21 however the usage of lignin as a potential material for uranyl extraction has not been explored lignin a biomacromolecule with a complex three dimensional structure formed by linking three types of phenylpropane units comprises of a high density of aromatic ring containing structures hydroxyl groups quinone groups and other active groups that facilitate various chemical reactions in a previous work we have synthesized hyper crosslinked calix 4 arene units through a friedel crafts alkylation reaction which was followed by the phosphorylation of the obtained product to yield a highly effective sorbent for uranium capture from seawater 22 however the material s powder form limits its practical application as it is challenging to separate the powdered compounds from aqueous solutions 15 additionally the previous study employed solely calix 4 arene for hyper crosslinking which results in a significantly high production cost for the material we developed a calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w exploiting the principles of green chemistry by hyper crosslinking calix 4 arene with the lignin of balsa wood this copolymer was synthesized to overcome the challenge associated with the difficult separation of powder adsorbents and reduce production costs we introduced phosphate groups to the copolymer through a phosphorylation reaction using phosphorus oxychloride as a modifier to further enhance uranium adsorption properties the resulting phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer c4 w p exhibited significantly improved uranium adsorption performance due to the introduction of the phosphate groups additionally the high temperature reaction resulted in the dissolution of the non crosslinked portion of the c4 w structure increasing the structural crosslinking degree of the material overall c4 w p demonstrated excellent selective uranium adsorption properties in acidic wastewater and seawater making it an exceptional adsorbent for large scale uranium it can be used to develop a cost effective method to recover uranium from aqueous solutions efficiently 2 materials

the experiments were all conducted in 50 ml 60 mg l 1 u solution at a temperature of 298 k to reduce the experimental and test error the equilibrated mixture was passed through a syringe filter 0 45

mass of the adsorbent details of regeneration experiments and selectivity tests are described in texts s5 7 supporting information kinetic models thermodynamic models the calculation formulas of thermodynamic parameters elution efficiency and selectivity coefficient are also given texts s8 12 supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of c4 w p the preparation process of c4 w p is depicted in scheme 1 briefly calix 4 arene and balsa wood were hyper crosslinked in 1 2 dichloroethane friedel crafts alkylation reaction was conducted to prepare the c4 w copolymer the c4 w sample with the maximum crosslinking degree was selected by adjusting the amount of calixarene hyper crosslinked calix 4 arene are not present in the reaction product phosphorylation reaction was conducted to introduce phosphate groups onto the material surface the resulting products were subjected to repeated washing and freeze drying to obtain the c4 w p samples anhydrous alcl3 served as the catalyst for both reactions and the al ion content in the obtained materials was analyzed using the icp ms technique post microwave digestion to ensure material purity microwave digestion conditions are presented in text s2 supporting information calculation results revealed that the al residues in c4 w and c4 w p were 0 039 and 0 021 respectively signifying their negligible presence in the material thus the synthesized material was highly pure furthermore the p content in c4 w p was quantified using the icp aes technique post microwave digestion indicating a p content of 104 8 mg l 1 1 69 mmol g 1 the results indicated successful phosphorylation analysis of the sem images in fig s1a supporting information revealed that the surface of the original wood was smooth and textured during the cross linking reaction the benzene ring in the calixarene structure cross links significantly with the aromatic ring in the lignin structure resulting in the generation of a rough wooden surface fig 1a the participation of the benzene ring in the cross linking process was verified by observing the change in its skeleton vibration peak 1650 1450 cm 1 fig 2a c 23 the significant increase in the intensity of the absorption peak confirmed the progress of the cross linking reaction as depicted in fig 2a b the broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration peak of oh 24 while the peak at 3000 2800 cm 1 represents the stretching vibration peak of ch 25 additionally the adsorption peak at 1300 1000 cm 1 represents the in plane bending vibration of oh and the stretching vibration of co 26 27 the adsorption peak at 900 690 cm 1 represents the out of plane bending vibration of the ch group on the benzene ring considering the pronounced overlap of absorption peaks of calix 4 arene and wood in ft ir spectra to ascertain the formation of the c4 w copolymer crosslinking products of wood hw the preparation method is shown in text s3 supporting information were prepared under identical conditions were prepared under the same conditions as shown in fig s1 supporting information the basic morphology of hw did not significantly change from the original balsa wood with the filaments on the wood surface appearing as torn fibers this further confirms the progress of the cross linking reaction during the phosphorylation reaction c4 w undergoes a reaction with pocl3 at 115 c causing the rapid dissolution of the non crosslinking structure of c4 w this results in the formation of c4 w p which has a porous structure and is suitable for applications involving the trapping of uranyl ions the changes in the structure can be verified through a comparison of the sem fig 1a b and tem images fig 1h i as well as the increase in the specific surface area of the material fig 3a 28 upon comparing the tem images it was observed that the content of fibers in the c4 w p structure was significantly reduced with the shaded areas predominantly consisting of fibers this indicated that the cellulose and hemicellulose structures that were not involved with the crosslinking process existed in a primarily dissolved state a comparison between the profiles recorded for the c4 w and the phosphorylated c4 w p system revealed the presence of a p 2p signal on the surface of the material fig 4a thereby confirming the presence of the p element 10 the electron distribution of p in the eds results fig 1d k also supports this finding 16 17 the xps spectra indicated that the p content on the surface of c4 w p was 1 73 mmol g 1 which was in line with the results obtained using the icp aes technique the existence of po was confirmed by the shift in the binding energies of coc p c poh and po co 0 34 0 55 and 0 2 ev respectively additionally a new signal at 530 68 ev confirmed the formation of po fig 4b 15 27 29 despite the overlap between the absorption peaks corresponding to oh and coc at 1300 1000 cm 1 with phosphate groups the shift in absorption peaks and formation of a new peak at 1012 cm 1 po po demonstrated phosphorylation fig 2d 15 17 the dissolution of non crosslinked structures during the phosphorylation reaction rapidly increases the structural crosslinking degree of the material as a result the obtained c4 w p possesses higher structural stability compared to c4 w as confirmed by the tga analysis data at higher temperatures 300 c as shown in fig 3b there is no significant difference between the two materials at lower temperatures 200 c and this can be attributed to the evaporation of physically adsorbed water 27 30 however above 300 c c4 w experiences rapid weight loss primarily due to the rapid decomposition of un crosslinked structures in contrast the weight loss of c4 w p at high temperatures showed a linear trend indicating the material s homogeneity which was also confirmed by the p content calculated using the icp aes and xps techniques the acid alkali resistance of c4 w p was evaluated using a 0 5 m hno3 naoh solution details of the acid alkali treatment are provided in text s4 supporting information the ft ir spectral profiles recorded for c4 w p acid and c4 w p basic were comparable to those recorded for c4 w p fig s2 supporting information indicating that c4 w p exhibits good acid alkali resistance we conducted the low temperature nitrogen adsorption tests to assess the pore properties of the materials to further investigate the pore structure of the material fig 3a the specific surface area of c4 w p was found to be 11 34 m2 g 1 and the average pore size was measured to be 15 95 nm which appeared to deviate significantly from the results obtained using the sem technique fig 1b this observation could be attributed to the fact that the pores in the material primarily consisted of interlayer gaps the irregular structure and large size of the pores in the wood could not be detected by the bet method 31 which led to the detection of only micropores in the material structure interestingly the adsorption desorption isotherms presented an unclosed hysteresis loop under conditions of low relative pressure and this could be attributed to the presence of interlayer gaps in the wood 32 3 2 uranium adsorption 3 2 1 effect of ph the ph of the solution is a crucial factor that impacts the zeta potential of the material fig s3 supporting information and the speciation of uranyl ions 15 17 20 therefore the effect of ph on adsorption was initially investigated as shown in fig 5a the adsorption capacity of the material exhibited a substantial change before and after phosphorylation indicating that the phosphate groups improved the adsorption performance and chemical adsorption predominated the adsorption process when the ph value is low ph 3 7 the surface charge of c4 w p is positive and the positively charged uranyl species uo2 2 uo2 oh experience strong electrostatic repulsion with the material surface 16 23 additionally the competitive adsorption of h inhibits the complexation of uranyl ions on the material surface 1 23 29 these factors result in a decrease in the material s adsorption capacity as the ph value increases 3 7 ph 5 the competitive adsorption of h gradually decreases 2 4 reducing the protonation degree of the phosphate group on the material surface hence the lone pair of electrons on oxygen atoms in poh and po are more likely to occupy the empty orbitals of the u atoms promoting the formation of uranyl complexes 8 15 at ph 5 the adsorption capacity reaches its maximum of 292 5 mg g 1 however when 5 ph 7 the adsorption capacity decreases with increasing ph this decrease can be attributed to the formation of u vi hydroxyl complexes between oh and uranyl ions at high ph conditions resulting in a decrease in the diffusion of uranyl ions this eventually affects the efficiency of the adsorption process 8 17 20 when the ph of the system exceeds 7 uranyl ions begin to form negatively charged complex anions uo2 co3 2 2 uo2 co3 3 4 and the negatively charged ions exert a strong repulsive effect on the material surface leading to a decrease in the adsorption efficiency 9 10 19 based on this result ph 5 was chosen as the optimal condition in the following tests 3 2 2 effect of sorbent dose from an industrial application standpoint the adsorbent dose is a critical parameter for studying the adsorption phenomenon the effect of the adsorbent dosage on the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of c4 w p is shown in fig 5b as the adsorbent dosage increases the amount of uranyl ion adsorbed per unit adsorbent decreases while the removal efficiency of uranyl ions in solution increases this can be attributed to the fact that the number of effective active sites on the surface of the adsorbent increases with an increase in adsorbent dosage resulting in a higher adsorption percentage 2 however a further increase in adsorbent dosage and the aggregation overlapping of adsorption sites results in an increase in the path length for uranyl ion diffusion ultimately decreasing the adsorption capacity 27 33 thus it can be concluded that using an excess of adsorbent at high dosage levels leads to surplus adsorption sites reducing the utilization ratio of adsorbent and resulting in resource waste consequently an optimal dosage of 0 10 g l 1 was used in subsequent experiments 3 2 3 kinetics study contact time is a critical factor in assessing the adsorption efficiency of materials as uranyl ions move in solution before diffusing into the material surface and eventually getting adsorbed 2 the adsorption kinetics studied for c4 w p in a solution of u 60 mg l 1 is shown in fig 6a it is evident that rapid adsorption occurs during the first 60 min and equilibrium is reached within 150 min the abundant active adsorption sites on the surface of c4 w p promote the rapid adsorption of u vi as the adsorption process proceeds the availability of effective adsorption sites decreases 2 6 8 and the uranyl ions adsorbed on the material surface exert a strong electrostatic repulsion on the free uranyl ions in the solution 16 as a result the adsorption curves gradually level off over time the experimental data were fitted using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models to investigate the mechanism controlling the adsorption process fig 6a c table 1 the results indicated that the adsorption process fits well with the pseudo second order model r2 0 98982 and the calculated equilibrium adsorption capacity was 326 8 mg g 1 which was close to the experimental data of 295 1 mg g 1 this indicates that the adsorption rate primarily depends on the number of effective adsorption sites on the material surface 34 and the adsorption process is primarily dominated by chemical adsorption 4 7 35 consistent with the conclusion made previously the intraparticle diffusion model was also used to analyze the diffusion mechanism and the kinetic adsorption results as shown in fig 6d the multilinear plots suggests that u vi adsorption on the surface of c4 w p proceeds over two stages 2 27 the first stage involves surface adsorption where uranyl ions rapidly coordinate with the adsorption sites on the material surface 6 in the second stage u vi gradually diffuses into the pores of the absorbent 2 6 these two stages possibly occur simultaneously notably none of the three curves pass through the origin indicating that the step associated with intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate limiting step 6 3 2 4 thermodynamics study it is crucial to establish an appropriate isothermal adsorption model based on experimental data to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the adsorption mechanism and process fig 7a presents the adsorption isotherms recorded for c4 w p over a range of initial u concentrations 1 200 mg l 1 the results demonstrate that varying temperatures have no significant effect on the adsorption capacity of c4 w p at low concentrations however as the initial u concentration increases the equilibrium adsorption amount of uranium increases with temperature this indicates that the adsorption process of c4 w p is endothermic 35 and aligns with the uranium adsorption behavior of common phosphate based adsorbents 16 17 this can be attributed to the greater driving force of concentration difference at higher concentrations and the faster molecular motion at higher temperatures which promote the adsorption process 23 36 we used two isotherm models namely the langmuir and freundlich models to simulate the experimental data to further clarify the adsorption mechanism of u vi on the surface of c4 w p fig 7b c the corresponding parameters are shown in table 2 the results revealed that the langmuir model fitting had a good linear relationship r2 0 99 indicating that the active sites on the material surface are homogeneously distributed 37 furthermore the adsorption of uranyl by c4 w p is a monolayer chemisorption process 2 5 28 the gibbs free energy change δg entropy change δs and enthalpy change δh were calculated based on the intercept and slope of the linear fitting of ln kl 1 t fig 7d as shown in table 3 the values of δg were negative and decreased as the temperature increased indicating that the adsorption of uranyl by c4 w p is a spontaneous endothermic process it was also observed that adsorption was favored at high temperature conditions 9 16 17 this was also confirmed by the positive value of δh additionally the positive value of δs signified that c4 w p exhibits a high affinity for u vi and the disorder of the solid liquid system increased during the adsorption process 10 3 3 circulation and regeneration the reusability and recycling abilities of adsorbents have significant practical applications 9 28 as shown in fig 8 we studied the adsorption desorption performances of the systems using a solution of hcl 0 1 m as the eluent to release the adsorbed uranium before the next cycle the result showed that the elution efficiency reached a maximum of 92 4 after 30 min of elution the desorption mechanism can be deduced from the ph dependent experimental results a higher concentration of h in the solution strongly attacks the uranyl ions adsorbed on the material surface and this is contrary to the adsorption process 12 16 furthermore uranyl ions are only fixed on the material surface in the adsorption process since the pore structure of the material originates primarily from the interlayer gap avoiding retention in the pores this results in the progress of a rapid desorption process 38 c4 w p maintained 90 3 of its initial adsorption capacity after six cycles 267 5 mg g 1 with an average reduction of 1 9 after each regeneration cycle this indicates that c4 w p exhibits outstanding uranium adsorption reusability 39 40 3 4 selective experiments in acidic wastewater nuclear activities result in the production of large amounts of wastewater containing various ions these coexisting ions can cause interference in the extraction recovery process of uranium 41 therefore we attempted to selectively remove targeted uranyl ions from an aqueous solution containing different metal ions based on the physicochemical properties of uranium we selected competing elements from rare metals that may be present in radioactive wastewater solutions these included rare light metals li and rb scattered metals ga3 and in3 and rare earth metals y3 la3 ce3 pr3 sm3 eu3 gd3 dy3 ho3 er3 and yb3 the selectivity test in wastewater was performed in a fixed bed column scheme s1 supporting information and we evaluated the selectivity by studying different parameters it is worth noting that the solution contained 16 mixed metal cations and the metal ions in the aqueous solution tended to precipitate at higher ph values therefore the selectivity test was performed at ph 4 as shown in fig 9 c4 w p exhibited a much higher u vi adsorption capacity than other metal cations maximum adsorption capacity 185 3 mg g 1 this is attributed to the selective coordination of phosphate groups to u vi 10 the differential binding affinity between materials and metal ions is determined by the intrinsic properties of metal ions and functional groups 16 c4 w p has a higher kd value for u vi 1817 2 ml g 1 compared to other competing ions the calculated su m values ranged from 3 3 to 46 9 table 4 indicating a high selectivity of c4 w p for u vi in complex solutions 17 it is worth noting that the material is not highly selective for rb however considering that light metals are not usually present in radioactive wastewater we believe that this does not affect the further application of c4 w p in wastewater 3 5 selective experiments in simulated seawater the extraction of uranyl from seawater is a matter of great significance for ensuring resource sustainability and environmental security 42 however the process remains highly challenging due to the presence of a large amount of competing metal ions and various microorganisms 28 in this study we prepared simulated seawater solutions by dissolving sea salt collected from bohai bay except for the simulated seawater extra ions such as fe3 ni2 zn2 pb2 and co2 were added to the solution to simulate the seawater solution with coexisting ions the selectivity testing was performed using a fixed bed column to accommodate the fluidity of seawater the concentration of uranium added to the solutions was fixed at 33 3 μg l 1 to reduce experimental and testing errors in fig 10a it can be observed that c4 w p demonstrated a remarkable capacity for the adsorption of uranium in simulated seawater achieving a removal rate of 82 4 despite a slight reduction in uranium adsorption capacity after the addition of coexisting ions the removal rate was still relatively high at 76 9 fig 10b these results suggest that the material possesses a high adsorption capacity for uranyl ions and exhibits the potential to efficiently recover industrial uranium from natural seawater 6 19 a high removal rate of pb was recorded in the simulated seawater solution containing coexisting ions similar results were obtained with other phosphate based adsorbents 12 the removal mechanism remains unclear nevertheless c4 w p still exhibited good selectivity for pb with an su pb value of 14 0 table 6 moreover the material displayed significantly high selectivity for other ions with su m values ranging from 23 5 to 4921 6 it is important to note that c4 w p exhibited a low adsorption capacity for vanadium in both simulated seawater and simulated seawater solutions with coexisting ions which was far greater than amidoxime based adsorbents table 5 3 6 comparison of adsorption capacity of c4 w p and reported adsorbents table s1 supporting information compares the uranium absorption properties of c4 w p with some reported phosphate based materials also some adsorbents used natural products as raw materials as a uranyl extractant c4 w p can selectively extract uranyl from acidic wastewater and weakly alkaline seawater which is not achieved by most reported adsorbents even with the addition of 15 competing ions in the samples used for wastewater testing c4 w p still exhibited a kd u of 1817 2 ml g 1 which is comparable to that of numerous wastewater uranyl extractants moreover except for rb the material showed relatively high selectivity for other metal ions the highest selectivity coefficient was recorded for eu3 46 9 more significantly the wastewater testing process was conducted at ph 4 and a strongly acidic environment can lead to reduced selectivity the selectivity tests conducted for c4 w p yield convincing results due to limited conditions the selectivity tests with c4 w p were carried out in simulated seawater which are not comparable to the ocean test of individual reported sorbents even so c4 w p exhibited higher selectivity in simulated seawater in the presence of five coexisting ions su m 23 5 4921 6 than ff pt among them the selectivity of v5 fe3 co2 ni2 and pb2 is significantly more advantageous it follows that c4 w p exhibits good uranium adsorption properties and is expected to be used for uranyl extraction from seawater and nuclear wastewater 3 7 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism was preliminarily discussed by analyzing ft ir spectral profiles recorded for c4 w p before and after u vi adsorption as illustrated in fig 2d e the three signals corresponding to po po appearing in the range of 1300 1000 cm 1 changed significantly after u vi adsorption the change in vibration intensity and frequency indicates the formation of a coordination bond between the phosphate group and u vi which results in a change in electron cloud density thus causing changes in the infrared spectrum 8 10 16 29 the antisymmetric stretching vibration peak of ouo appears at 925 cm 1 11 43 indicating that the interaction between u vi and the adsorbent surface is not solely governed by electrostatic forces 44 this is consistent with the results reported in the kinetics and thermodynamic sections to further verify the adsorption of u vi by the material sem and eds analyses were performed on the material after the adsorption of u vi c4 w p u as shown in fig 1e g the material surface became smoother after the adsorption of uranium possibly due to adsorbed uranium filling the pore structure 35 the eds analysis indicated that u was evenly distributed on the material surface indicating that u vi was successfully fixed and c4 w p possessed the ability to capture u vi 12 29 45 the tem images fig 1l n showed more shadow in the c4 w p u structure which should be the deposition of uranium on the material surface according to the u element electron mapping this further indicates that u vi is successfully adsorbed on the adsorbent surface xps analysis was conducted on c4 w p to study the variation in the chemical structure before and after adsorption fig 4 the main peaks in the survey spectra were attributed to c 1s o 1s and p 2p with the appearance of u 4f after adsorption fig 4a the u 4f signal could be fitted as u 4f5 2 394 19 ev 392 80 ev and u 4f7 2 384 65 ev 381 97 ev fig 4d both of which belong to the spectral signals of u vi this indicates that no other valence states appear during the adsorption process and that u vi is successfully adsorbed on the material surface 1 29 43 after adsorption significant shifts were observed in the binding energies of coc p c poh and po in the o 1s spectral profiles 0 44 0 60 and 0 23 ev respectively fig 4b indicating that phosphate groups participated in the adsorption process 10 17 29 this was further confirmed by the shift in the binding energies of po and po in the p 2p spectral profiles fig 4c 1 12 additionally co in the lignin structure did not participate in adsorption although the intensity of the peaks corresponding to po co in the o 1s spectral profiles changed slightly before and after adsorption fig 4b the vibration intensity and frequency of the peak in the ft ir profiles corresponding to the co group did not change significantly fig 2d e based on the comprehensive analysis described above we hypothesize that the main mechanism of uranium adsorption by the phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer is chelation by phosphate groups the icp aes test showed that the concentration of phosphate groups on the surface of c4 w p was 1 69 mmol g 1 comparing the test data of c4 w and c4 w p at ph 5 fig 5a it was found that the amount of u vi chelated by phosphate groups was 272 0 mg g 1 1 14 mmol g 1 during the adsorption process this suggests that uranyl ions may be complexed by one or two phosphate groups based on the previous work and our findings scheme 2 proposes a potential adsorption mechanism for uranyl on the surface of c4 w p 4 conclusions a novel and effective selective uranyl extraction agent c4 w p was successfully prepared by hyper crosslinking lignin and calix 4 arene with natural balsa wood as skeletons the material exhibits a high uranium adsorption capacity 473 9 mg g 1 at ph 5 and excellent selective adsorption properties in acid wastewater and simulated seawater and this could be attributed to the introduction of phosphate groups in the materials the langmuir and pseudo second order kinetic models can explain the adsorption mechanism indicating that the adsorption of u vi on the material surface presents monolayer adsorption characteristics controlled by chemisorption xps and ft ir analysis revealed that the complexation of phosphate groups with u vi dictates the adsorption process the successful preparation of the phosphorylated calix 4 arene balsa wood copolymer will provide valuable guidance for further use of calixarene and develop methods for extracting uranyl from aqueous solutions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12484,a brewery wastewater was identified as phenolics rich stream representative of agro food wastewaters this latter can be used to develop a more sustainable brewery industry by recovering bioactive molecules and reusing water seven ceramic tio2 zro2 and organic pvdf and pes membranes with cut off ranging from 15 kda to 0 2 μm were assessed for their brewery wastewater clarification capacity which is a key step allowing high natural resource recovery with further downstream process six criteria were used to evaluate membrane productivity permeate volume selectivity turbidity and carbohydrates removal phenolic compounds preservation and robustness inclination to fouling ease of cleaning at ph 4 and 10 membranes with cut off equal or larger than 0 1 μm were identified as improper due to high and irreversible fouling with ultrafiltration membranes ph 4 showed higher fouling propensity due to reinforced fouling causing molecules electrostatic interactions than ph 10 turbidity causing compounds retention was higher than 83 phenolics were preserved with retention factors lower than 22 carbohydrates retention was between 2 and 23 therefore through a screening methodology developed to meet a set of industrial requirements the following classification of global performances is proposed 15 kda tio2 zro2 70 kda pvdf 150 kda tio2 zro2 50 kda pes graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations tpc total phenolic content tc total carbohydrates keywords brewery wastewater ultrafiltration membrane filtration ph phenolic compounds data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction brewing industry is an economically important hub with beer world production reaching 1 8 billion hectoliters in 2021 1 as others agro food areas brewery industry is affected by environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emission energy and raw material or production of solid waste and wastewater 2 to avoid food spoilage during storage through oxidation mechanism antioxidant additives are required in the food production process the most common synthetic additives used today such as butylated hydroxyanisole bha butylated hydroxytoluene bht or tert butylhydroquinone tbhq have raised consumer concern because these compounds are suspected of being carcinogenic and endocrine disruptors 3 since consumers have a preference for food products prepared with natural instead of chemical additives 4 antioxidants extracted from agro food matrix with equivalent preservation capacity are needed recent works have applied natural additives to meats fish beverage oil and other food products through nanoencapsulation functionalized edible films etc with antimicrobial activity and protection against oxidation 5 6 phenolic compounds are known to have great antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity along with other health benefits such as preventing age related chronic diseases 7 brewery industry solid wastes such as brewer spent grain spent yeast spent hops and trub are described in literature as promising resources in phenolic compounds including for the functionalization of food products 8 9 brewery waste streams have mainly been studied for energy recovery and water reuse 10 11 there are few publications describing phenolic compounds recovery from brewery waste streams though brewing wastewater contain phenolic compounds which may substitute synthetic antioxidant in food industry 12 phenolic compounds can be recovered from waste streams by various extraction and separation technologies such as liquid solvent extraction supercritical fluids extraction adsorption ultrasound assisted extraction etc 13 those methods may require solvent use long time extraction high temperature likely to destroy phenolics alternatively membrane filtration processes can separate phenolic compounds of agro food wastewaters from other compounds with mild operating conditions low energy requirements high separation efficiency easy scaling up and without added chemicals 14 recovery of value added compounds is generally carried out with a multi step process according to the following scheme pretreatment macro and micromolecules separation extraction clarification isolation purification concentration and product formation 15 regarding membrane technology integrated processes including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro were studied with phenolic compounds recovery of agro food waste streams 16 18 consequently pretreatment with mf or uf membrane is required to remove suspended solids and macromolecules 19 and not to retain phenolic compounds one of the major drawbacks of membrane filtration processes is the establishment of fouling which is an unavoidable phenomenon due to 1 the physico chemical characteristics of waste stream components i e suspended or soluble matter like carbohydrates proteins or phenolic compounds 2 the interactions between those compounds and 3 the interactions of these components with membrane material it occurs gradually during filtration reducing process productivity i e permeation flux strategies to limit fouling besides hydraulic improvement such as backwashing 20 are the selection of appropriate operating parameters to feed water filtration parameters such as membrane material molecular weight cut off mwco hydrodynamic conditions of filtration and ph highly affect physico chemical interactions between suspended and soluble matter among them and with the membrane 21 consequently these parameters influence productivity selectivity and cleaning performances and have to be optimized in view of wastewater clarification with mf or uf 19 membrane fouling is removed by water rinsing and chemical cleaning chemical cleaning operation leads to membrane aging especially with oxidative agents 22 duration as well as concentration and nature of cleaning products have to be carefully chosen by considering both permeability recovery and membrane aging studies were conducted on various phenolic rich industrial waste streams but there is a lack of data on brewery wastewater clarification with membrane technology in a strategy of phenolic compounds recovery furthermore and to the best of our knowledge very few studies have been published on the membrane performances assessment during agro food wastewater clarification with such a broad mwco and material range optimization of waste stream clarification conditions is a key step prior to extracts production with downstream processes towards a circular economy model based brewery therefore the main objective of the present study is to determine the type of membrane mwco and material as well as the relevant operating conditions i e ph for agro food wastewater clarification in view of further phenolic compounds concentration and purification the screening methodology was based on three various categories of criteria which were 1 the productivity 2 a degree of selectivity in compliance with the set requirement i e low phenolic compounds and high carbohydrates rejections and high suspended solids removal 3 the propensity to fouling and cleaning efficiency measured by permeability recovery with adapted nature and concentration of cleaning product 2 material and methods 2 1 process water feed water studied is a phenolic rich wastewater from brewery industry seven sampling events were done on site during one year stabilized at ph 4 0 1 0 with h3po4 85 and analyses were performed within 2 days the composition of wastewater collected varied according to brewery production for each sampling event physical and chemical characteristics mean values and associated standard deviations are shown in table 1 single

determining other parameters in table 1 are detailed in section 2 4 feed water was stocked at 20 c until further use within 2 next weeks 2 2 membranes and laboratory scale filtration system a large panel of commercial membranes were tested through this study as rich phenolic compound brewery waste stream clarification with membrane technology is little known in literature different mwco and hydrophilic or hydrophobic membrane materials were assessed for screening purpose according to the manufacturer s instructions conditioning at 2 bar 20 min 50 c and at 1 and 10 g l 1 naoh for organic and ceramic membranes respectively was performed water permeability l p was then determined with deionized water conductivity 2 μs cm 1 by plotting normalized permeation flux at 25 c against transmembrane pressure tmp intrinsic hydraulic resistance r m which is equal to the total hydraulic resistance r t after conditioning is calculated with water permeability 1 l p 1 μ r t where l p is the water permeability in m s 1 bar 1 expressed l h 1 m 2 bar 1 in present work μ the dynamic water viscosity in bar s r t the total hydraulic resistance in m 1 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes characteristics are shown in table 2 the experiments were conducted using a lab scale apparatus from firmus france showed in fig 1 cross flow velocity cfv and transmembrane pressure tmp were controlled manually tmp was measured as the difference between average pressure at the inlet and the outlet of the membrane module and permeate pressure 2 3 filtration procedures before clarification tests operating parameters i e tmp and cfv were optimized in total recycle mode regarding critical flux this latter is defined as permeate flux above which an irreversible fouling appears optimal tmp was studied for three cfv values 0 6 1 1 1 6 m s 1 and 3 4 5 m s 1 for organic and ceramic membranes respectively as studied wastewater was collected above 50 c temperature used was 50 c for all experiments to conserve the operating conditions in case of future industrial purpose permeate flux rate was determined by weighing permeate delivered for 1 min feed water was first pretreated with a 5 μm porosity filter at ph 4 0 the ph of feed water was adjusted at 10 0 with naoh 10 mol l 1 for experiment at alkaline ph for clarification assays 5 l was poured inside feed tank and heated at 50 2 c a total of 6 l of feed water was filtered with optimized operating conditions permeate flux was monitored continually filtration first took place in semi batch mode where feed water is added continuously so that the volume of the feed tank remains constant then filtration operated in batch mode reducing volume in feed tank once permeate flux decreased from 60 of its initial value experiment was stopped retentate and permeate streams were recovered and their volumes were determined after collecting and mixing the whole volume as in optimization step membrane is rinsed and cleaned as described in section 2 5 water permeability was determined before filtration l p0 after water rinsing l p1 and after alkaline cleaning l p2 the retention factor of targeted compounds expressed as a percentage was calculated with the following equation 2 retention factor 1 c p c f where c p and c f are the concentrations of specific compound in g l 1 or turbidity in ntu measured respectively in the permeate and feed 2 4 analytical methods the waste stream ph was adjusted with ph meter s220 sevencompact mettler toledo which was previously calibrated with ph 4 7 and 10 buffer solutions the conductivity was measured with conductivity meter lf 197inetzteil wtw a controlled volume was dried at 105 c and 550 c until constant weight to obtain dry matter and ash respectively phenolic compounds were extracted of 5 ml sample acidified at ph 2 0 by 10 ml ethyl acetate during 15 min 3 times organic phase was evaporated with a rotavapor at 35 c and residue was dissolved in 5 ml of meoh h2o 60 40 v v solution total phenolic compounds tpc was determined with folin ciocalteu colorimetric method at 760 nm 23 total carbohydrates tc was quantified by anthrone colorimetric method at 625 nm 24 tpc and tc were measured in triplicate and are expressed in ggae l 1 and gge l 1 respectively gae gallic acid equivalent ge glucose equivalent zeta potential of feed water was analyzed in duplicate by a zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments turbidity ntu was measured in triplicate with a turbidimeter tb300 ir lovibond the surface morphology of the new fouled and cleaned membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis using a geminisem 500 microscope zeiss error bars and confidence intervals presented in this work are standard deviation values 2 5 cleaning procedures after operation membranes were firstly rinsed with 5 l of deionized water in recirculation mode and then with 20 l with permeate flow at a tmp of 1 bar then different alkaline cleanings were applied which are presented in table 3 ultrasil products were from ecolab france these cleaning procedures were elaborated according to an optimization work and according to membranes and cleaning products manufacturer s recommendations deionized water was used to dilute cleaning products cleanings were performed until permeability remain unchanged compared to initial water permeability or when it achieved a permeability of at least 90 of initial virgin membrane value 2 6 fouling mechanisms evaluation fouling includes physical and chemical phenomena i e adsorption cake layer formation intermediate or complete pore blocking which occur during membrane filtration leading to both permeability loss and selectivity variations these mechanisms may occur simultaneously or predominate at different time scales of filtration propensity of these mechanisms can be determined by modeling with field s equation 25 3 dj dt k n j j ss j 2 n for n 0 1 1 5 and 2 for respectively cake layer formation standard intermediate and complete pore blocking mechanism k n the models constants in h m 2 m 1 h 0 5 m 0 5 and h 1 respectively and j ss the steady state permeate flux in l h 1 m 2 experimental data were fitted with eq 3 for each fouling mechanism to obtain k n and j ss root mean square errors between experimental and calculated permeate flux were calculated to determine predominant fouling phenomena for each assays furthermore fouling was characterized based on darcy s law and resistance in series model 4 r t filt r m r rev r irr 5 r irr r irr rem r irr res where r rev the reversible fouling resistance removed during water rinsing r irr the overall irreversible fouling resistance r irr rem the irreversible fouling resistance removed during chemical cleaning and r irr res the residual irreversible fouling resistance after cleaning procedure all in m 1 each of these values were obtained for each membrane with permeability monitoring through experimental scheme r m were obtained with virgin membrane permeability measurement which are shown in table 2 at the end of wastewater filtration total resistance developed r t filt was calculated with final permeate flux measured reversible and irreversible fouling resistance r rev and r irr can be deducted from total resistance r t filt r m membranes were rinsed as described in section 2 5 removing physical cleaning eliminated resistance r rev this resistance is mainly due to concentration polarization and loosely attached foulants which can form cake layer

recovered or steady removing r irr rem which represents tightly attached foulants on and or into the pores cleaned membrane resistance corresponded to residual irreversible fouling resistance r irr res due to unequal volume filtered during experiments resistances were divided by collected permeate volume and expressed in m 1 l 1 to assess the propensity of fouling by adsorption between the brewery effluent and the selected membrane material static adsorption tests were conducted with 0 5 and 1 l of waste stream for virgin organic and ceramic membrane respectively stabilized at ph 4 and 10 contact time was 24 h in darkness membrane were firstly rinsed with deionized water and washed with standardized procedure procedure b for organic and e for ceramic membranes see table 3 water permeability was measured before static test after rinsing and after cleaning procedure to ensure permeability recovery to assess the wastewater affinity for the membranes through adsorption phenomena the resistance due to adsorption r ads was evaluated with water permeability values before and after 24 h static test r ads was calculated with total resistance after adsorption experiments r t ads expressed as following 6 r t ads r m r ads 2 7 assessment of brewery effluent clarification performances to assess wastewater clarification performances membranes were selected among three main parameters productivity was evaluated by permeate final volume divided by filtration time selectivity by tpc preservation tc and turbidity causing compounds retention and robustness by fouling resistance divided by permeate final volume and by recovery of membrane permeability according to the nature and concentration of chemicals used and the number of cleaning steps each criteria was scored out of 10 the performance for productivity selectivity and fouling criteria was evaluated as the ratio between the value of selected criterion assessed in specific conditions ph and membrane and the highest performance value obtained multiplied by 10 these values are permeate volume produced for productivity of carbohydrates and turbidity causing compounds retention factors and preservation of phenolic compounds for selectivity and irreversible resistance developed during filtration ratio compared to total resistance for fouling cleaning performance was evaluated with the following marking membrane permeability recovered at a minimum of 100 of initial permeability in one cycle 10 90 in one cycle 8 9 90 in two or three cycles 5 7 not recovered at 90 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 operating parameters optimization optimal filtration parameters and cleaning procedures and performance following optimization step are shown in table 4 cfv was 1 6 and 5 0 m s 1 for most of organic and ceramic membrane respectively the higher the value the greater the permeation flux as a high velocity limits fouling phenomena as shown in table 4 lower cfv values interestingly provided greater critical flux for upvdf70 at ph 4 mc01 at ph 10 and uc150 at ph 10 for instance upvdf70 yielded a flux of 319 l h 1 m 2 at 1 2 m s 1 instead of 280 l h 1 m 2 at 1 7 m s 1 for the same tmp under high cfv conditions important shear induced force may remove more efficiently large aggregates this phenomenon may have induced a compacter cake layer by small colloids and therefore a greater resistance similar trend has been reported in literature with 150 kda tio2 zro2 membrane 26 cfv of 1 to 3 m s 1 were tested and 2 m s 1 yielded higher steady state flux than 3 m s 1 condition with dye concentration of 500 mg l 1 after optimization test water permeability was recovered for most membranes with one cleaning procedure except for membranes mpvdf02 mpvdf01 and mc01 with pore size equal or higher than 0 1 μm despite several cleaning cycles permeability remained low at 39 to 58 of initial value table 2 sem analysis was done to investigate fouling mechanisms in comparison to mf and uf membranes fig 2 presents pictures of mpvdf01 and upvdf70 membranes during optimization procedure in various situations virgin fouled after 5 min filtration followed by water rinse and cleaned with protocol described in table 4 the comparison of new and fouled mpvdf01 membrane shows that there were organic matter aggregates likely carbohydrates and other colloidal matter on the membrane surface covering most of pores furthermore most of the pores were still clogged despite the application of the optimized cleaning procedure for pvdf 70 kda fouled uf no aggregate was seen on membrane surface there was little change between virgin and cleaned 70 kda membrane proving that cleaning procedure for this membrane was efficient as permeability was not recovered after chemical cleaning for 0 1 μm pore size membranes or above it can be suggested that during 5 to 10 min of filtration a major fouling mechanism likely irreversible pore blocking was formed on and or into membranes on the other hand membranes with pores size inferior to 0 1 μm major fouling phenomenon might be a cake layer formation promoted by tighter pores which was easily removed during water rinsing and chemical cleaning mpvdf02 mpvdf01 and mc01 membranes were thus excluded from the selection protocol for clarification of brewery wastewater as significant irreversible fouling took place during optimization tests 3 2 clarification assays clarification assays were conducted with optimized parameters shown in table 4 relative permeation flux decline during ph 4 and ph 10 clarification assays is plotted against time in fig 3 at acid ph permeation flux is decreasing fairly quickly to 40 of initial value regardless of pore size and membrane material as j j 0 ratio reached 40 before the entire volume was filtered filtration was stopped permeate volumes are visible in table 5 40 threshold was reached at different times depending on the membrane used highest to lowest time upvdf70 uc150 uc15 upes50 with respectively 0 63 1 16 0 03 and 0 02 l of permeate collected at alkaline ph slower flux decreases can be observed comparing to those obtained in acid condition all membranes except upvdf70 filtered maximum volume of approximatively 4 9 l without reaching the critic set threshold final permeation flux was between 40 and 60 of its initial value on average and for both ph initial permeation flux ranks from highest to lowest were uc150 uc15 upvdf70 upes50 in present study it is interesting to observe that uc15 membrane flux at ph 10 was close to uc150 flux despite having smaller mwco and similar ceramic material as discussed in section 3 1 wider pore membranes may have higher propensity to fouling which may leads to flux value however j j 0 value decreased faster for uc15 than uc150 at both ph reflecting the influence of mwco on membrane hydraulic productivity and fouling see section 3 3 the initial permeation flux of uc15 at ph 4 which was 62 l h 1 m 2 was lower to than the value obtained by 27 for the clarification of phenolic compounds rich food industry acid streams they found an initial permeation flux of 82 kg h 1 m 2 for artichoke wastewater at 25 c with 15 kda tio2 membrane ceramic membranes showed higher flux than organic membranes these results may be attributed to higher cfv applied with ceramic membranes which limits fouling phenomena such as cake formation and polarization layer improving permeation flux tubular conformation may also allow better velocity repartition than flat sheet conformation values varied from 4 69 to 16 0 l h 1 m 2 in literature 28 29 for juices filtration with 30 kda pvdf membrane for upes50 membrane other works performed by 30 31 have reported permeation flux around 10 35 kg h 1 m 2 for acid stream which is consistent with 19 l h 1 m 2 value found in the present work when increasing ph of feed stream literature data show various results higher flux was observed at alkaline ph for hydrolysate from spent brewer s yeast 21 and table olive wastewater 32 whereas optimal flux was found at acid ph for winery wastewater 33 and olive mill wastewater 34 in this work hydraulic behavior differences between acid and alkaline ph may be explained by wastewater membrane affinity feed water and membranes zeta potential according to ph are presented in fig 4 the membranes zeta potential is in relation with membrane surface charge the values provided by previous works 35 37 were ranging from 8 to 17 mv and from 55 to 21 mv at ph 4 and 10 respectively the zeta potential of brewery wastewater was experimental and mainly related to colloids charge surface at ph 4 zeta potential of brewery wastewater was near isoelectric point 7 mv wastewater molecules could easily be aggregated to form bigger colloids moreover at ph 4 the repulsive forces between the colloids and membrane surfaces were low on the other side at ph 10 with a zeta potential of 20 mv for brewery wastewater electrostatic repulsion among colloids and with membrane were likely to occur resulting in smaller aggregates formation and lower affinity to membrane flux decline may subsequently be slower at ph 10 while at ph 4 bigger aggregates with higher affinity were greatly clogging membranes these findings were confirmed by 38 who proved that severe fouling occurred on a nf membrane filtrating a 50 mg l 1 bovine serum albumin solution when the zeta potential of the membrane and solution were near their isoelectric point at 3 0 and 1 3 mv respectively see section 3 4 fig 5 presents the selectivity performances of membranes tested for both ph all membranes showed satisfactory low phenolic compounds retention at acid and alkaline ph ranging from 12 to 21 and 5 to 22 respectively observed retention are mainly attributed to fouling occurring by phenolic compounds complexed with carbohydrates proteins retentate tpc concentration are lower than permeate value in the case of upes50 and uc150 membranes processing at alkaline ph at 50 c may have led to tpc loss as processing phenolic compounds in alkaline ph medium can provoke the auto oxidation of phenolic compounds to o quinones 39 compared to literature obtained retention factors were similar at both ph for ceramic membranes but a slightly lower for organic membranes 27 reported phenolics retention factors from 0 to 6 for artichoke wastewater clarification with 15 kda tio2 membrane at ph 4 2 and for 40 tpc rejection was 12 for olive mill wastewater clarification with 0 02 μm zro2 membrane at ph 1 5 while clarifying pomegranate juice with 30 kda pvdf membrane 29 observed a 25 loss in tpc for upes50 membrane retention of anthocyanins was 30 at 5 bar 31 in related works antioxidant capacity selectivity was measured with abts radical scavenging assays approximatively 23 of abts radical scavenging capacity was removed by uc15 membrane data not shown which is higher than tpc rejection because beer contain other antioxidant compounds as melanoidins 29 found an antioxidant capacity rejection of 16 during raw pomegranate juice clarification with 30 kda membrane carbohydrates rejection was similar about 12 26 for all membrane except for upes50 at ph 10 and uc150 at both ph where lower retention factors were observed 150 kda and 15 kda membranes yielded 2 5 and 12 26 carbohydrates retention respectively it is well known that lower mwco increases retention factor for same material membranes explaining this difference as beer contains mostly unfermentable sugars called dextrins from several kda to 22 3 kda 41 low removal of carbohydrates by tested membranes is observed 27 reported retention of glucose fructose and sucrose of 1 5 2 5 and 8 6 respectively with 15 kda tio2 membrane turbidity causing compounds were retained from 88 to 95 at ph 4 and from 83 to 94 at ph 10 these values were lower than turbidity removal of 98 7 achieved by 42 with 20 kda tio2 zro2 during red beet stalks waste stream clarification after prior microfiltration process the slightly higher turbidity causing compounds retention obtained at ph 4 except with upvdf70 membrane can be accounted to the turbidity level difference between ph 4 and 10 table 5 due to the zeta potential and the resulting bulk charge of the brewery wastewater larger colloids and thus higher feed stream turbidity were found at ph 4 than at ph 10 with average values of 646 and 21 ntu respectively turbidity causing compounds were thus better retained by the membranes due to the presence of larger aggregates under acid condition for alkaline ph turbidity increased in the retentate stream compared to the feed stream as shown in table 5 this increase reveals the colloidal matter retention capacity of membranes tested at ph 10 the result mentioning that feed stream turbidity was higher than the one measured in retentate stream at ph 4 is corroborated to hydraulic behavior presented in fig 3 in these acid conditions membranes showed faster flux decline suspended material related to turbidity measurement may have been entrapped in cake layer or into the pores explaining the decrease in turbidity in the retentate stream on the contrary at ph 10 suspended material and membranes had lower affinity due to electrostatic repulsions explaining turbidity increase in the retentate stream at both ph uc15 membrane yielded higher turbidity causing compounds retention than uc150 i e approximatively 93 and 85 with uc15 and uc150 respectively which is consistent with carbohydrates rejection retention of upvdf70 membrane was poorly influenced by ph upvdf70 phenolic compounds and carbohydrates retention remained the highest among other tested membranes this may be due to the hydrophobic characteristic of this material 15 kda had lower carbohydrate and phenolic compounds retention factors according to ph both ceramic membranes had the same pattern of retention performances namely respectively higher and lower retention of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates at ph 4 than at ph 10 reverse trend was observed for upes50 which also reported by 32 where phenolics compounds and cod retention factors were respectively lower and higher at acid ph compared to alkaline ph with 50 kda pes membrane during olive mill wastewater filtration in most of the experiments uf of brewery feed stream yielded high turbidity removal with low phenolic compounds retention carbohydrates were poorly separated from phenolic compounds permeate stream is containing antioxidant related phenolic compounds but also other beer compounds as carbohydrates and presumably also proteins etc as well as ionic species nf operation thus has to be optimized carefully e g by selecting low salt rejection membrane additional downstream process may thus be necessary according to the chosen valorization industry needs according to clarification set of requirement defined previously i e phenolic compounds preservation and carbohydrates and turbidity removal uc15 at ph 10 showed the best selectivity performances with preservation of 95 of phenolic compounds and retention of 23 and 93 of carbohydrates and turbidity causing compounds respectively 3 3 cleaning performance adapted procedures were used to clean membranes after filtration operation cleanings aim is to be as efficient as possible i e recovering initial permeability while preserving initial membrane characteristics with adapted cleaning product concentration as shown in table 6 various performances were observed with different cleaning procedures upvdf70 and upes50 membranes water permeability was recovered with a single cleaning cycle after filtration at ph 4 three cycles were necessary to recover fouled membrane after filtration at ph 10 upvdf70 membrane permeability was fully recovered at ph 4 and final permeability was 88 of the initial value at ph 10 for membrane upes50 at ph 10 final permeability was however lower as only 46 of initial permeability was recovered this could be explained by great fouling that occurred with this membrane with l p0 l p1 ratio lower than 20 at both ph upes50 is made of hydrophilic pes and upvdf70 of pvdf which are hydrophilic and hydrophobic respectively since membranes mwco are close results obtained showed that hydrophilic pes is more severely fouled than hydrophobic pvdf by brewery wastewater during filtration operation uc150 and uc15 ceramic membranes showed approximately the same behavior despite having l p0 l p1 ratio about 26 at ph 4 permeability was recovered to initial value with one cleaning step chemical resistance of ceramic membrane made alkaline h2o2 cleaning possible which is a strong oxidant resulting into efficient permeability recovery 3 4 fouling and resistance in series model model constants and root mean square errors of calculated flux with field s equation for each assay are given in table 7 experimental data fitted better cake layer formation intermediate pore blocking and to a lesser extent complete pore blocking models cake layer formation and intermediate pore blocking errors were close suggesting that both of these mechanisms are responsible to flux decay however it is interesting to notice that according to modeling results for uc150 flux decay at ph 4 is likely due to cake layer formation as ph 10 promoted intermediate pore blocking whereas for uc15 at ph 10 cake layer formation seemed major mechanism and at ph 4 a mix of intermediate pore blocking and cake layer formation this result confirms that fouling mechanism is dependent of mwco ph 4 promoted cake layer during uc150 filtration at ph 10 aggregates size may be closer to pore size and thus promoted intermediate pore blocking but promoted cake layer during uc15 filtration at ph 10 because pore was smaller hydraulic fouling resistances removed by water rinsing r rev and chemical cleaning r irr rem residual irreversible fouling r irr res resistance as well as resistance due to adsorption phenomena measured in static test r ads are shown in fig 6 total hydraulic resistances as well as reversible and irreversible fouling propensity is time dependent and is likely to change with filtration time to compare assays to each other these resistances were normalized in m 1 l 1 fouling mechanism presented in fig 6 is global and does not consider fouling mechanism predominance variation according to time except filtrations realized with upes50 at ph 10 and uc150 at ph 4 most of total fouling resistance was due to concentration polarization and cake layer formation indeed removed resistance values with water rinsing ranged from 70 to 97 of total resistance excluding intrinsic resistance residual resistance which accounts about 33 of the total resistance was removed by specific chemical cleaning developed for each uf irreversible fouling occurred for upes50 membrane at ph 10 in that case chemical cleaning was inefficient and residual irreversible resistance accounted for 14 of total resistance 34 found r t filt of 3 5 1013 and 9 6 1012 m 1 l 1 during olive mill wastewater filtration with 15 kda tio2 zro2 uf at ph 2 and 9 respectively which is respectively higher and lower than r t filt of 8 6 1014 and 2 7 1012 m 1 l 1 obtained with the same membrane in the present study at ph 4 and 10 respectively during filtration of raw pomegranate juice with 30 kda membrane 29 found r t filt r rev r irr rem r irr res values of respectively 1 6 1013 9 2 1012 4 8 1012 and 4 8 1011 versus 7 6 1013 6 3 1013 1 2 1013 and 0 m 1 in the present study for upvdf70 at ph 4 results r t filt of approximatively 9 1014 m 1 was reported by 31 during uf of ph 2 3 roselle extract at 5 bar with upes50 membrane while a value of 1 2 1014 m 1 was found with brewery waste stream filtration with the same membrane but at 1 2 bar upes50 and uc15 high values of total resistance obtained at ph 4 was caused by the very limited permeate volume 0 02 and 0 03 l collected total resistance was higher under acid condition for all membranes this latter result is consistent with the various hydraulic behavior of the different membranes with ph compared to ph 10 at acid ph larger colloids led to the formation of a more compact filtration cake layer increasing resistance and subsequently decreasing permeation flux as discussed in section 3 2 uc150 retention factors were respectively higher and lower for phenolic compounds and carbohydrates compared to uc15 irremovable resistance ratio was 2 to 3 times higher in the case of 150 kda than 15 kda this finding suggest 15 kda had higher propensity to develop cake layer than pore blocking as observed with fouling models discussed above this mechanism is likely implied in selectivity behavior of ceramic membrane favoring carbohydrates retention and phenolic compounds preservation resistances developed during membrane filtration were on average higher in the case of organic compared to ceramic membranes this results indicate that tio2 zro2 ceramic membranes have lower propensity to fouling than organic membrane during agro food wastewater clarification according to data obtained adsorption resistances accounted for 13 54 and between 16 and 28 of total resistances developed during static tests for pvdf pes and tio2 zro2 membranes respectively in the case of all membranes tested 100 of adsorption resistance was removed with alkaline cleaning this finding suggests that during dynamic filtration adsorption measured by static test accounts little for the fouling phenomena a global fouling mechanisms representation is suggested in fig 7 uc15 membrane was chosen as it yielded the best global performances for brewery waste stream clarification as detailed in section 3 5 3 5 selection of uf membrane for clarification of brewery effluent the productivity selectivity and robustness were evaluated from experimental results according to 6 criteria to select the most appropriate uf membrane for the studied brewery wastewater clarification fig 8 illustrates this assessment for the 4 membranes studied at acid ph selectivity performances were high for all tested membrane except lower carbohydrates retention for ceramic membranes upes50 and uc15 showed high propensity to cake layer development and thus too low productivity for industrial use at ph 4 upvdf70 and uc150 showed higher productivity but had large ratio of irreversible fouling cleaning was efficient however efficient as initial permeability was recovered within one cleaning cycle for phenolic preservation and turbidity causing compounds retention performances of uf membranes were relatively similar at alkaline ph upvdf70 and upes50 showed good selectivity and productivity performances excluding the poor carbohydrates retention of upes50 cleaning was poorly efficient for this membranes at ph 10 with final permeability lower than 90 of initial value among uc150 and uc15 some trends can be observed while productivity was similar to uc15 uc150 demonstrated higher propensity to fouling even if around 33 of total fouling resistance required chemical cleaning for both ceramic uf membranes at acid and alkaline ph around 18 for organic membranes cleaning was easier for ceramic membranes as strong alkaline oxidant h2o2 can be applied this latter protocol enables shorter cleaning cycle duration however as strong alkaline oxidant could prematurely promote membrane aging further membrane aging tests should be performed to assess h2o2 impact on membrane integrity in the present study and in contrast to uc150 membrane uc15 membrane is able to remove a part of carbohydrates this leads to a pre separation of carbohydrates from phenolic compounds prior to further process which aims to fractionate and pre concentrate targeted molecules since recovery of phenolic compounds is more likely to be successful with a membrane separation chain with limited number of steps the selection of a lower mwco uf membrane for wastewater clarification is advantageous upes50 membrane had too poor performances in both acid and alkaline conditions consequently it was considered as unsuitable for clarification process uc150 lacked of carbohydrates retention and showed high propensity of irreversible fouling considering the selected criteria of productivity selectivity and fouling establishment uc15 and upvdf70 were considered as the most appropriate membranes to clarify this brewery stream at ph 10 and 4 respectively on average alkaline ph showed better performances ceramic membranes are preferred in industrial application for its thermal mechanical and chemical resistance and long lifetime further tests can be done to evaluate process long term viability with 15 kda membrane these include aging tests to see the effect of washing and their frequency on membranes evolution of productivity and selectivity in larger volumes filtration alternatively as resistance developed during filtration are cake formation and polarization concentration removed by during membrane rinsing physical cleaning as backwashing or ultrasound may improve flux stability of acid or intermediate ph 4 conclusion prior to phenolic compounds extraction concentration with downstream processes clarification of a brewery phenolics rich waste stream was investigated seven membranes 3 mf and 4 uf were tested at acid and alkaline ph and their productivity selectivity and robustness in regard to feed water filtration operation were assessed performance criteria used in this study were chosen in view of industrial installation design uf technology was selected for adequate brewery wastewater clarification 0 1 μm or wider pore membranes showed to be inappropriate because of irreversible fouling during filtration likely due to fouling causing compounds size close to pore size of such membranes for both ph and for uf carbohydrates and turbidity removal were from 2 to 23 and from 83 to 94 respectively phenolic compounds were well preserved in permeates of the various uf membranes at ph 4 a greater fouling was observed at ph 4 than at ph 10 which led to a drastic decline of permeate flux this was explained by wastewater composition and membranes zeta potentials at ph 4 which promoted molecules aggregation and their interactions with membranes according to fouling model cake layer formation was predominant mechanism during assays followed by intermediate pore blocking most of fouling was removed by water cleaning except for uc150 membrane at ph 4 where chemical cleaning removed about two third of resistance created during filtration 90 of virgin membrane permeability was recovered with one cleaning cycle with most of the membranes pvdf uf showed better overall performances than hydrophilic pes uf at both ph among both ceramic membranes tested 150 and 15 kda 15 kda offered the advantage to pre fractionate the effluent as carbohydrates were partially retained at 26 at ph 10 according to experimental data 15 kda ceramic is the most relevant uf membrane for brewery waste stream clarification at ph 10 membrane technology showed relevant potential to clarify studied

12484,a brewery wastewater was identified as phenolics rich stream representative of agro food wastewaters this latter can be used to develop a more sustainable brewery industry by recovering bioactive molecules and reusing water seven ceramic tio2 zro2 and organic pvdf and pes membranes with cut off ranging from 15 kda to 0 2 μm were assessed for their brewery wastewater clarification capacity which is a key step allowing high natural resource recovery with further downstream process six criteria were used to evaluate membrane productivity permeate volume selectivity turbidity and carbohydrates removal phenolic compounds preservation and robustness inclination to fouling ease of cleaning at ph 4 and 10 membranes with cut off equal or larger than 0 1 μm were identified as improper due to high and irreversible fouling with ultrafiltration membranes ph 4 showed higher fouling propensity due to reinforced fouling causing molecules electrostatic interactions than ph 10 turbidity causing compounds retention was higher than 83 phenolics were preserved with retention factors lower than 22 carbohydrates retention was between 2 and 23 therefore through a screening methodology developed to meet a set of industrial requirements the following classification of global performances is proposed 15 kda tio2 zro2 70 kda pvdf 150 kda tio2 zro2 50 kda pes graphical abstract unlabelled image abbreviations tpc total phenolic content tc total carbohydrates keywords brewery wastewater ultrafiltration membrane filtration ph phenolic compounds data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction brewing industry is an economically important hub with beer world production reaching 1 8 billion hectoliters in 2021 1 as others agro food areas brewery industry is affected by environmental issues such as greenhouse gas emission energy and raw material or production of solid waste and wastewater 2 to avoid food spoilage during storage through oxidation mechanism antioxidant additives are required in the food production process the most common synthetic additives used today such as butylated hydroxyanisole bha butylated hydroxytoluene bht or tert butylhydroquinone tbhq have raised consumer concern because these compounds are suspected of being carcinogenic and endocrine disruptors 3 since consumers have a preference for food products prepared with natural instead of chemical additives 4 antioxidants extracted from agro food matrix with equivalent preservation capacity are needed recent works have applied natural additives to meats fish beverage oil and other food products through nanoencapsulation functionalized edible films etc with antimicrobial activity and protection against oxidation 5 6 phenolic compounds are known to have great antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity along with other health benefits such as preventing age related chronic diseases 7 brewery industry solid wastes such as brewer spent grain spent yeast spent hops and trub are described in literature as promising resources in phenolic compounds including for the functionalization of food products 8 9 brewery waste streams have mainly been studied for energy recovery and water reuse 10 11 there are few publications describing phenolic compounds recovery from brewery waste streams though brewing wastewater contain phenolic compounds which may substitute synthetic antioxidant in food industry 12 phenolic compounds can be recovered from waste streams by various extraction and separation technologies such as liquid solvent extraction supercritical fluids extraction adsorption ultrasound assisted extraction etc 13 those methods may require solvent use long time extraction high temperature likely to destroy phenolics alternatively membrane filtration processes can separate phenolic compounds of agro food wastewaters from other compounds with mild operating conditions low energy requirements high separation efficiency easy scaling up and without added chemicals 14 recovery of value added compounds is generally carried out with a multi step process according to the following scheme pretreatment macro and micromolecules separation extraction clarification isolation purification concentration and product formation 15 regarding membrane technology integrated processes including microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro were studied with phenolic compounds recovery of agro food waste streams 16 18 consequently pretreatment with mf or uf membrane is required to remove suspended solids and macromolecules 19 and not to retain phenolic compounds one of the major drawbacks of membrane filtration processes is the establishment of fouling which is an unavoidable phenomenon due to 1 the physico chemical characteristics of waste stream components i e suspended or soluble matter like carbohydrates proteins or phenolic compounds 2 the interactions between those compounds and 3 the interactions of these components with membrane material it occurs gradually during filtration reducing process productivity i e permeation flux strategies to limit fouling besides hydraulic improvement such as backwashing 20 are the selection of appropriate operating parameters to feed water filtration parameters such as membrane material molecular weight cut off mwco hydrodynamic conditions of filtration and ph highly affect physico chemical interactions between suspended and soluble matter among them and with the membrane 21 consequently these parameters influence productivity selectivity and cleaning performances and have to be optimized in view of wastewater clarification with mf or uf 19 membrane fouling is removed by water rinsing and chemical cleaning chemical cleaning operation leads to membrane aging especially with oxidative agents 22 duration as well as concentration and nature of cleaning products have to be carefully chosen by considering both permeability recovery and membrane aging studies were conducted on various phenolic rich industrial waste streams but there is a lack of data on brewery wastewater clarification with membrane technology in a strategy of phenolic compounds recovery furthermore and to the best of our knowledge very few studies have been published on the membrane performances assessment during agro food wastewater clarification with such a broad mwco and material range optimization of waste stream clarification conditions is a key step prior to extracts production with downstream processes towards a circular economy model based brewery therefore the main objective of the present study is to determine the type of membrane mwco and material as well as the relevant operating conditions i e ph for agro food wastewater clarification in view of further phenolic compounds concentration and purification the screening methodology was based on three various categories of criteria which were 1 the productivity 2 a degree of selectivity in compliance with the set requirement i e low phenolic compounds and high carbohydrates rejections and high suspended solids removal 3 the propensity to fouling and cleaning efficiency measured by permeability recovery with adapted nature and concentration of cleaning product 2 material and methods 2 1 process water feed water studied is a phenolic rich wastewater from brewery industry seven sampling events were done on site during one year stabilized at ph 4 0 1 0 with h3po4 85 and analyses were performed within 2 days the composition of wastewater collected varied according to brewery production for each sampling event physical and chemical characteristics mean values and associated standard deviations are shown in table 1 single

determining other parameters in table 1 are detailed in section 2 4 feed water was stocked at 20 c until further use within 2 next weeks 2 2 membranes and laboratory scale filtration system a large panel of commercial membranes were tested through this study as rich phenolic compound brewery waste stream clarification with membrane technology is little known in literature different mwco and hydrophilic or hydrophobic membrane materials were assessed for screening purpose according to the manufacturer s instructions conditioning at 2 bar 20 min 50 c and at 1 and 10 g l 1 naoh for organic and ceramic membranes respectively was performed water permeability l p was then determined with deionized water conductivity 2 μs cm 1 by plotting normalized permeation flux at 25 c against transmembrane pressure tmp intrinsic hydraulic resistance r m which is equal to the total hydraulic resistance r t after conditioning is calculated with water permeability 1 l p 1 μ r t where l p is the water permeability in m s 1 bar 1 expressed l h 1 m 2 bar 1 in present work μ the dynamic water viscosity in bar s r t the total hydraulic resistance in m 1 microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes characteristics are shown in table 2 the experiments were conducted using a lab scale apparatus from firmus france showed in fig 1 cross flow velocity cfv and transmembrane pressure tmp were controlled manually tmp was measured as the difference between average pressure at the inlet and the outlet of the membrane module and permeate pressure 2 3 filtration procedures before clarification tests operating parameters i e tmp and cfv were optimized in total recycle mode regarding critical flux this latter is defined as permeate flux above which an irreversible fouling appears optimal tmp was studied for three cfv values 0 6 1 1 1 6 m s 1 and 3 4 5 m s 1 for organic and ceramic membranes respectively as studied wastewater was collected above 50 c temperature used was 50 c for all experiments to conserve the operating conditions in case of future industrial purpose permeate flux rate was determined by weighing permeate delivered for 1 min feed water was first pretreated with a 5 μm porosity filter at ph 4 0 the ph of feed water was adjusted at 10 0 with naoh 10 mol l 1 for experiment at alkaline ph for clarification assays 5 l was poured inside feed tank and heated at 50 2 c a total of 6 l of feed water was filtered with optimized operating conditions permeate flux was monitored continually filtration first took place in semi batch mode where feed water is added continuously so that the volume of the feed tank remains constant then filtration operated in batch mode reducing volume in feed tank once permeate flux decreased from 60 of its initial value experiment was stopped retentate and permeate streams were recovered and their volumes were determined after collecting and mixing the whole volume as in optimization step membrane is rinsed and cleaned as described in section 2 5 water permeability was determined before filtration l p0 after water rinsing l p1 and after alkaline cleaning l p2 the retention factor of targeted compounds expressed as a percentage was calculated with the following equation 2 retention factor 1 c p c f where c p and c f are the concentrations of specific compound in g l 1 or turbidity in ntu measured respectively in the permeate and feed 2 4 analytical methods the waste stream ph was adjusted with ph meter s220 sevencompact mettler toledo which was previously calibrated with ph 4 7 and 10 buffer solutions the conductivity was measured with conductivity meter lf 197inetzteil wtw a controlled volume was dried at 105 c and 550 c until constant weight to obtain dry matter and ash respectively phenolic compounds were extracted of 5 ml sample acidified at ph 2 0 by 10 ml ethyl acetate during 15 min 3 times organic phase was evaporated with a rotavapor at 35 c and residue was dissolved in 5 ml of meoh h2o 60 40 v v solution total phenolic compounds tpc was determined with folin ciocalteu colorimetric method at 760 nm 23 total carbohydrates tc was quantified by anthrone colorimetric method at 625 nm 24 tpc and tc were measured in triplicate and are expressed in ggae l 1 and gge l 1 respectively gae gallic acid equivalent ge glucose equivalent zeta potential of feed water was analyzed in duplicate by a zeta potentiometer zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments turbidity ntu was measured in triplicate with a turbidimeter tb300 ir lovibond the surface morphology of the new fouled and cleaned membranes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem analysis using a geminisem 500 microscope zeiss error bars and confidence intervals presented in this work are standard deviation values 2 5 cleaning procedures after operation membranes were firstly rinsed with 5 l of deionized water in recirculation mode and then with 20 l with permeate flow at a tmp of 1 bar then different alkaline cleanings were applied which are presented in table 3 ultrasil products were from ecolab france these cleaning procedures were elaborated according to an optimization work and according to membranes and cleaning products manufacturer s recommendations deionized water was used to dilute cleaning products cleanings were performed until permeability remain unchanged compared to initial water permeability or when it achieved a permeability of at least 90 of initial virgin membrane value 2 6 fouling mechanisms evaluation fouling includes physical and chemical phenomena i e adsorption cake layer formation intermediate or complete pore blocking which occur during membrane filtration leading to both permeability loss and selectivity variations these mechanisms may occur simultaneously or predominate at different time scales of filtration propensity of these mechanisms can be determined by modeling with field s equation 25 3 dj dt k n j j ss j 2 n for n 0 1 1 5 and 2 for respectively cake layer formation standard intermediate and complete pore blocking mechanism k n the models constants in h m 2 m 1 h 0 5 m 0 5 and h 1 respectively and j ss the steady state permeate flux in l h 1 m 2 experimental data were fitted with eq 3 for each fouling mechanism to obtain k n and j ss root mean square errors between experimental and calculated permeate flux were calculated to determine predominant fouling phenomena for each assays furthermore fouling was characterized based on darcy s law and resistance in series model 4 r t filt r m r rev r irr 5 r

removed during chemical cleaning and r irr res the residual irreversible fouling resistance after cleaning procedure all in m 1 each of these values were obtained for each membrane with permeability monitoring through experimental scheme r m were obtained with virgin membrane permeability measurement which are shown in table 2 at the end of wastewater filtration total resistance developed r t filt was calculated with final permeate flux measured reversible and irreversible fouling resistance r rev and r irr can be deducted from total resistance r t filt r m membranes were rinsed as described in section 2 5 removing physical cleaning eliminated resistance r rev this resistance is mainly due to concentration polarization and loosely attached foulants which can form cake layer

recovered or steady removing r irr rem which represents tightly attached foulants on and or into the pores cleaned membrane resistance corresponded to residual irreversible fouling resistance r irr res due to unequal volume filtered during experiments resistances were divided by collected permeate volume and expressed in m 1 l 1 to assess the propensity of fouling by adsorption between the brewery effluent and the selected membrane material static adsorption tests were conducted with 0 5 and 1 l of waste stream for virgin organic and ceramic membrane respectively stabilized at ph 4 and 10 contact time was 24 h in darkness membrane were firstly rinsed with deionized water and washed with standardized procedure procedure b for organic and e for ceramic membranes see table 3 water permeability was measured before static test after rinsing and after cleaning procedure to ensure permeability recovery to assess the wastewater affinity for the membranes through adsorption phenomena the resistance due to adsorption r ads was evaluated with water permeability values before and after 24 h static test r ads was calculated with total resistance after adsorption experiments r t ads expressed as following 6 r t ads r m r ads 2 7 assessment of brewery effluent clarification performances to assess wastewater clarification performances membranes were selected among three main parameters productivity was evaluated by permeate final volume divided by filtration time selectivity by tpc preservation tc and turbidity causing compounds retention and robustness by fouling resistance divided by permeate final volume and by recovery of membrane permeability according to the nature and concentration of chemicals used and the number of cleaning steps each criteria was scored out of 10 the performance for productivity selectivity and fouling criteria was evaluated as the ratio between the value of selected criterion assessed in specific conditions ph and membrane and the highest performance value obtained multiplied by 10 these values are permeate volume produced for productivity of carbohydrates and turbidity causing compounds retention factors and preservation of phenolic compounds for selectivity and irreversible resistance developed during filtration ratio compared to total resistance for fouling cleaning performance was evaluated with the following marking membrane permeability recovered at a minimum of 100 of initial permeability in one cycle 10 90 in one cycle 8 9 90 in two or three cycles 5 7 not recovered at 90 1 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 operating parameters optimization optimal filtration parameters and cleaning procedures and performance following optimization step are shown in table 4 cfv was 1 6 and 5 0 m s 1 for most of organic and ceramic membrane respectively the higher the value the greater the permeation flux as a high velocity limits fouling phenomena as shown in table 4 lower cfv values interestingly provided greater critical flux for upvdf70 at ph 4 mc01 at ph 10 and uc150 at ph 10 for instance upvdf70 yielded a flux of 319 l h 1 m 2 at 1 2 m s 1 instead of 280 l h 1 m 2 at 1 7 m s 1 for the same tmp under high cfv conditions important shear induced force may remove more efficiently large aggregates this phenomenon may have induced a compacter cake layer by small colloids and therefore a greater resistance similar trend has been reported in literature with 150 kda tio2 zro2 membrane 26 cfv of 1 to 3 m s 1 were tested and 2 m s 1 yielded higher steady state flux than 3 m s 1 condition with dye concentration of 500 mg l 1 after optimization test water permeability was recovered for most membranes with one cleaning procedure except for membranes mpvdf02 mpvdf01 and mc01 with pore size equal or higher than 0 1 μm despite several cleaning cycles permeability remained low at 39 to 58 of initial value table 2 sem analysis was done to investigate fouling mechanisms in comparison to mf and uf membranes fig 2 presents pictures of mpvdf01 and upvdf70 membranes during optimization procedure in various situations virgin fouled after 5 min filtration followed by water rinse and cleaned with protocol described in table 4 the comparison of new and fouled mpvdf01 membrane shows that there were organic matter aggregates likely carbohydrates and other colloidal matter on the membrane surface covering most of pores furthermore most of the pores were still clogged despite the application of the optimized cleaning procedure for pvdf 70 kda fouled uf no aggregate was seen on membrane surface there was little change between virgin and cleaned 70 kda membrane proving that cleaning procedure for this membrane was efficient as permeability was not recovered after chemical cleaning for 0 1 μm pore size membranes or above it can be suggested that during 5 to 10 min of filtration a major fouling mechanism likely irreversible pore blocking was formed on and or into membranes on the other hand membranes with pores size inferior to 0 1 μm major fouling phenomenon might be a cake layer formation promoted by tighter pores which was easily removed during water rinsing and chemical cleaning mpvdf02 mpvdf01 and mc01 membranes were thus excluded from the selection protocol for clarification of brewery wastewater as significant irreversible fouling took place during optimization tests 3 2 clarification assays clarification assays were conducted with optimized parameters shown in table 4 relative permeation flux decline during ph 4 and ph 10 clarification assays is plotted against time in fig 3 at acid ph permeation flux is decreasing fairly quickly to 40 of initial value regardless of pore size and membrane material as j j 0 ratio reached 40 before the entire volume was filtered filtration was stopped permeate volumes are visible in table 5 40 threshold was reached at different times depending on the membrane used highest to lowest time upvdf70 uc150 uc15 upes50 with respectively 0 63 1 16 0 03 and 0 02 l of permeate collected at alkaline ph slower flux decreases can be observed comparing to those obtained in acid condition all membranes except upvdf70 filtered maximum volume of approximatively 4 9 l without reaching the critic set threshold final permeation flux was between 40 and 60 of its initial value on average and for both ph initial permeation flux ranks from highest to lowest were uc150 uc15 upvdf70 upes50 in present study it is interesting to observe that uc15 membrane flux at ph 10 was close to uc150 flux despite having smaller mwco and similar ceramic material as discussed in section 3 1 wider pore membranes may have higher propensity to fouling which may leads to flux value however j j 0 value decreased faster for uc15 than uc150 at both ph reflecting the influence of mwco on membrane hydraulic productivity and fouling see section 3 3 the initial permeation flux of uc15 at ph 4 which was 62 l h 1 m 2 was lower to than the value obtained by 27 for the clarification of phenolic compounds rich food industry acid streams they found an initial permeation flux of 82 kg h 1 m 2 for artichoke wastewater at 25 c with 15 kda tio2 membrane ceramic membranes showed higher flux than organic membranes these results may be attributed to higher cfv applied with ceramic membranes which limits fouling phenomena such as cake formation and polarization layer improving permeation flux tubular conformation may also allow better velocity repartition than flat sheet conformation values varied from 4 69 to 16 0 l h 1 m 2 in literature 28 29 for juices filtration with 30 kda pvdf membrane for upes50 membrane other works performed by 30 31 have reported permeation flux around 10 35 kg h 1 m 2 for acid stream which is consistent with 19 l h 1 m 2 value found in the present work when increasing ph of feed stream literature data show various results higher flux was observed at alkaline ph for hydrolysate from spent brewer s yeast 21 and table olive wastewater 32 whereas optimal flux was found at acid ph for winery wastewater 33 and olive mill wastewater 34 in this work hydraulic behavior differences between acid and alkaline ph may be explained by wastewater membrane affinity feed water and membranes zeta potential according to ph are presented in fig 4 the membranes zeta potential is in relation with membrane surface charge the values provided by previous works 35 37 were ranging from 8 to 17 mv and from 55 to 21 mv at ph 4 and 10 respectively the zeta potential of brewery wastewater was experimental and mainly related to colloids charge surface at ph 4 zeta potential of brewery wastewater was near isoelectric point 7 mv wastewater molecules could easily be aggregated to form bigger colloids moreover at ph 4 the repulsive forces between the colloids and membrane surfaces were low on the other side at ph 10 with a zeta potential of 20 mv for brewery wastewater electrostatic repulsion among colloids and with membrane were likely to occur resulting in smaller aggregates formation and lower affinity to membrane flux decline may subsequently be slower at ph 10 while at ph 4 bigger aggregates with higher affinity were greatly clogging membranes these findings were confirmed by 38 who proved that severe fouling occurred on a nf membrane filtrating a 50 mg l 1 bovine serum albumin solution when the zeta potential of the membrane and solution were near their isoelectric point at 3 0 and 1 3 mv respectively see section 3 4 fig 5 presents the selectivity performances of membranes tested for both ph all membranes showed satisfactory low phenolic compounds retention at acid and alkaline ph ranging from 12 to 21 and 5 to 22 respectively observed retention are mainly attributed to fouling occurring by phenolic compounds complexed with carbohydrates proteins retentate tpc concentration are lower than permeate value in the case of upes50 and uc150 membranes processing at alkaline ph at 50 c may have led to tpc loss as processing phenolic compounds in alkaline ph medium can provoke the auto oxidation of phenolic compounds to o quinones 39 compared to literature obtained retention factors were similar at both ph for ceramic membranes but a slightly lower for organic membranes 27 reported phenolics retention factors from 0 to 6 for artichoke wastewater clarification with 15 kda tio2 membrane at ph 4 2 and for 40 tpc rejection was 12 for olive mill wastewater clarification with 0 02 μm zro2 membrane at ph 1 5 while clarifying pomegranate juice with 30 kda pvdf membrane 29 observed a 25 loss in tpc for upes50 membrane retention of anthocyanins was 30 at 5 bar 31 in related works antioxidant capacity selectivity was measured with abts radical scavenging assays approximatively 23 of abts radical scavenging capacity was removed by uc15 membrane data not shown which is higher than tpc rejection because beer contain other antioxidant compounds as melanoidins 29 found an antioxidant capacity rejection of 16 during raw pomegranate juice clarification with 30 kda membrane carbohydrates rejection was similar about 12 26 for all membrane except for upes50 at ph 10 and uc150 at both ph where lower retention factors were observed 150 kda and 15 kda membranes yielded 2 5 and 12 26 carbohydrates retention respectively it is well known that lower mwco increases retention factor for same material membranes explaining this difference as beer contains mostly unfermentable sugars called dextrins from several kda to 22 3 kda 41 low removal of carbohydrates by tested membranes is observed 27 reported retention of glucose fructose and sucrose of 1 5 2 5 and 8 6 respectively with 15 kda tio2 membrane turbidity causing compounds were retained from 88 to 95 at ph 4 and from 83 to 94 at ph 10 these values were lower than turbidity removal of 98 7 achieved by 42 with 20 kda tio2 zro2 during red beet stalks waste stream clarification after prior microfiltration process the slightly higher turbidity causing compounds retention obtained at ph 4 except with upvdf70 membrane can be accounted to the turbidity level difference between ph 4 and 10 table 5 due to the zeta potential and the resulting bulk charge of the brewery wastewater larger colloids and thus higher feed stream turbidity were found at ph 4 than at ph 10 with average values of 646 and 21 ntu respectively turbidity causing compounds were thus better retained by the membranes due to the presence of larger aggregates under acid condition for alkaline ph turbidity increased in the retentate stream compared to the feed stream as shown in table 5 this increase reveals the colloidal matter retention capacity of membranes tested at ph 10 the result mentioning that feed stream turbidity was higher than the one measured in retentate stream at ph 4 is corroborated to hydraulic behavior presented in fig 3 in these acid conditions membranes showed faster flux decline suspended material related to turbidity measurement may have been entrapped in cake layer or into the pores explaining the decrease in turbidity in the retentate stream on the contrary at ph 10 suspended material and membranes had lower affinity due to electrostatic repulsions explaining turbidity increase in the retentate stream at both ph uc15 membrane yielded higher turbidity causing compounds retention than uc150 i e approximatively 93 and 85 with uc15 and uc150 respectively which is consistent with carbohydrates rejection retention of upvdf70 membrane was poorly influenced by ph upvdf70 phenolic compounds and carbohydrates retention remained the highest among other tested membranes this may be due to the hydrophobic characteristic of this material 15 kda had lower carbohydrate and phenolic compounds retention factors according to ph both ceramic membranes had the same pattern of retention performances namely respectively higher and lower retention of phenolic compounds and carbohydrates at ph 4 than at ph 10 reverse trend was observed for upes50 which also reported by 32 where phenolics compounds and cod retention factors were respectively lower and higher at acid ph compared to alkaline ph with 50 kda pes membrane during olive mill wastewater filtration in most of the experiments uf of brewery feed stream yielded high turbidity removal with low phenolic compounds retention carbohydrates were poorly separated from phenolic compounds permeate stream is containing antioxidant related phenolic compounds but also other beer compounds as carbohydrates and presumably also proteins etc as well as ionic species nf operation thus has to be optimized carefully e g by selecting low salt rejection membrane additional downstream process may thus be necessary according to the chosen valorization industry needs according to clarification set of requirement defined previously i e phenolic compounds preservation and carbohydrates and turbidity removal uc15 at ph 10 showed the best selectivity performances with preservation of 95 of phenolic compounds and retention of 23 and 93 of carbohydrates and turbidity causing compounds respectively 3 3 cleaning performance adapted procedures were used to clean membranes after filtration operation cleanings aim is to be as efficient as possible i e recovering initial permeability while preserving initial membrane characteristics with adapted cleaning product concentration as shown in table 6 various performances were observed with different cleaning procedures upvdf70 and upes50 membranes water permeability was recovered with a single cleaning cycle after filtration at ph 4 three cycles were necessary to recover fouled membrane after filtration at ph 10 upvdf70 membrane permeability was fully recovered at ph 4 and final permeability was 88 of the initial value at ph 10 for membrane upes50 at ph 10 final permeability was however lower as only 46 of initial permeability was recovered this could be explained by great fouling that occurred with this membrane with l p0 l p1 ratio lower than 20 at both ph upes50 is made of hydrophilic pes and upvdf70 of pvdf which are hydrophilic and hydrophobic respectively since membranes mwco are close results obtained showed that hydrophilic pes is more severely fouled than hydrophobic pvdf by brewery wastewater during filtration operation uc150 and uc15 ceramic membranes showed approximately the same behavior despite having l p0 l p1 ratio about 26 at ph 4 permeability was recovered to initial value with one cleaning step chemical resistance of ceramic membrane made alkaline h2o2 cleaning possible which is a strong oxidant resulting into efficient permeability recovery 3 4 fouling and resistance in series model model constants and root mean square errors of calculated flux with field s equation for each assay are given in table 7 experimental data fitted better cake layer formation intermediate pore blocking and to a lesser extent complete pore blocking models cake layer formation and intermediate pore blocking errors were close suggesting that both of these mechanisms are responsible to flux decay however it is interesting to notice that according to modeling results for uc150 flux decay at ph 4 is likely due to cake layer formation as ph 10 promoted intermediate pore blocking whereas for uc15 at ph 10 cake layer formation seemed major mechanism and at ph 4 a mix of intermediate pore blocking and cake layer formation this result confirms that fouling mechanism is dependent of mwco ph 4 promoted cake layer during uc150 filtration at ph 10 aggregates size may be closer to pore size and thus promoted intermediate pore blocking but promoted cake layer during uc15 filtration at ph 10 because pore was smaller hydraulic fouling resistances removed by water rinsing r rev and chemical cleaning r irr rem residual irreversible fouling r irr res resistance as well as resistance due to adsorption phenomena measured in static test r ads are shown in fig 6 total hydraulic resistances as well as reversible and irreversible fouling propensity is time dependent and is likely to change with filtration time to compare assays to each other these resistances were normalized in m 1 l 1 fouling mechanism presented in fig 6 is global and does not consider fouling mechanism predominance variation according to time except filtrations realized with upes50 at ph 10 and uc150 at ph 4 most of total fouling resistance was due to concentration polarization and cake layer formation indeed removed resistance values with water rinsing ranged from 70 to 97 of total resistance excluding intrinsic resistance residual resistance which accounts about 33 of the total resistance was removed by specific chemical cleaning developed for each uf irreversible fouling occurred for upes50 membrane at ph 10 in that case chemical cleaning was inefficient and residual irreversible resistance accounted for 14 of total resistance 34 found r t filt of 3 5 1013 and 9 6 1012 m 1 l 1 during olive mill wastewater filtration with 15 kda tio2 zro2 uf at ph 2 and 9 respectively which is respectively higher and lower than r t filt of 8 6 1014 and 2 7 1012 m 1 l 1 obtained with the same membrane in the present study at ph 4 and 10 respectively during filtration of raw pomegranate juice with 30 kda membrane 29 found r t filt r rev r irr rem r irr res values of respectively 1 6 1013 9 2 1012 4 8 1012 and 4 8 1011 versus 7 6 1013 6 3 1013 1 2 1013 and 0 m 1 in the present study for upvdf70 at ph 4 results r t filt of approximatively 9 1014 m 1 was reported by 31 during uf of ph 2 3 roselle extract at 5 bar with upes50 membrane while a value of 1 2 1014 m 1 was found with brewery waste stream filtration with the same membrane but at 1 2 bar upes50 and uc15 high values of total resistance obtained at ph 4 was caused by the very limited permeate volume 0 02 and 0 03 l collected total resistance was higher under acid condition for all membranes this latter result is consistent with the various hydraulic behavior of the different membranes with ph compared to ph 10 at acid ph larger colloids led to the formation of a more compact filtration cake layer increasing resistance and subsequently decreasing permeation flux as discussed in section 3 2 uc150 retention factors were respectively higher and lower for phenolic compounds and carbohydrates compared to uc15 irremovable resistance ratio was 2 to 3 times higher in the case of 150 kda than 15 kda this finding suggest 15 kda had higher propensity to develop cake layer than pore blocking as observed with fouling models discussed above this mechanism is likely implied in selectivity behavior of ceramic membrane favoring carbohydrates retention and phenolic compounds preservation resistances developed during membrane filtration were on average higher in the case of organic compared to ceramic membranes this results indicate that tio2 zro2 ceramic membranes have lower propensity to fouling than organic membrane during agro food wastewater clarification according to data obtained adsorption resistances accounted for 13 54 and between 16 and 28 of total resistances developed during static tests for pvdf pes and tio2 zro2 membranes respectively in the case of all membranes tested 100 of adsorption resistance was removed with alkaline cleaning this finding suggests that during dynamic filtration adsorption measured by static test accounts little for the fouling phenomena a global fouling mechanisms representation is suggested in fig 7 uc15 membrane was chosen as it yielded the best global performances for brewery waste stream clarification as detailed in section 3 5 3 5 selection of uf membrane for clarification of brewery effluent the productivity selectivity and robustness were evaluated from experimental results according to 6 criteria to select the most appropriate uf membrane for the studied brewery wastewater clarification fig 8 illustrates this assessment for the 4 membranes studied at acid ph selectivity performances were high for all tested membrane except lower carbohydrates retention for ceramic membranes upes50 and uc15 showed high propensity to cake layer development and thus too low productivity for industrial use at ph 4 upvdf70 and uc150 showed higher productivity but had large ratio of irreversible fouling cleaning was efficient however efficient as initial permeability was recovered within one cleaning cycle for phenolic preservation and turbidity causing compounds retention performances of uf membranes were relatively similar at alkaline ph upvdf70 and upes50 showed good selectivity and productivity performances excluding the poor carbohydrates retention of upes50 cleaning was poorly efficient for this membranes at ph 10 with final permeability lower than 90 of initial value among uc150 and uc15 some trends can be observed while productivity was similar to uc15 uc150 demonstrated higher propensity to fouling even if around 33 of total fouling resistance required chemical cleaning for both ceramic uf membranes at acid and alkaline ph around 18 for organic membranes cleaning was easier for ceramic membranes as strong alkaline oxidant h2o2 can be applied this latter protocol enables shorter cleaning cycle duration however as strong alkaline oxidant could prematurely promote membrane aging further membrane aging tests should be performed to assess h2o2 impact on membrane integrity in the present study and in contrast to uc150 membrane uc15 membrane is able to remove a part of carbohydrates this leads to a pre separation of carbohydrates from phenolic compounds prior to further process which aims to fractionate and pre concentrate targeted molecules since recovery of phenolic compounds is more likely to be successful with a membrane separation chain with limited number of steps the selection of a lower mwco uf membrane for wastewater clarification is advantageous upes50 membrane had too poor performances in both acid and alkaline conditions consequently it was considered as unsuitable for clarification process uc150 lacked of carbohydrates retention and showed high propensity of irreversible fouling considering the selected criteria of productivity selectivity and fouling establishment uc15 and upvdf70 were considered as the most appropriate membranes to clarify this brewery stream at ph 10 and 4 respectively on average alkaline ph showed better performances ceramic membranes are preferred in industrial application for its thermal mechanical and chemical resistance and long lifetime further tests can be done to evaluate process long term viability with 15 kda membrane these include aging tests to see the effect of washing and their frequency on membranes evolution of productivity and selectivity in larger volumes filtration alternatively as resistance developed during filtration are cake formation and polarization concentration removed by during membrane rinsing physical cleaning as backwashing or ultrasound may improve flux stability of acid or intermediate ph 4 conclusion prior to phenolic compounds extraction concentration with downstream processes clarification of a brewery phenolics rich waste stream was investigated seven membranes 3 mf and 4 uf were tested at acid and alkaline ph and their productivity selectivity and robustness in regard to feed water filtration operation were assessed performance criteria used in this study were chosen in view of industrial installation design uf technology was selected for adequate brewery wastewater clarification 0 1 μm or wider pore membranes showed to be inappropriate because of irreversible fouling during filtration likely due to fouling causing compounds size close to pore size of such membranes for both ph and for uf carbohydrates and turbidity removal were from 2 to 23 and from 83 to 94 respectively phenolic compounds were well preserved in permeates of the various uf membranes at ph 4 a greater fouling was observed at ph 4 than at ph 10 which led to a drastic decline of permeate flux this was explained by wastewater composition and membranes zeta potentials at ph 4 which promoted molecules aggregation and their interactions with membranes according to fouling model cake layer formation was predominant mechanism during assays followed by intermediate pore blocking most of fouling was removed by water cleaning except for uc150 membrane at ph 4 where chemical cleaning removed about two third of resistance created during filtration 90 of virgin membrane permeability was recovered with one cleaning cycle with most of the membranes pvdf uf showed better overall performances than hydrophilic pes uf at both ph among both ceramic membranes tested 150 and 15 kda 15 kda offered the advantage to pre fractionate the effluent as carbohydrates were partially retained at 26 at ph 10 according to experimental data 15 kda ceramic is the most relevant uf membrane for brewery waste stream clarification at ph 10 membrane technology showed relevant potential to clarify studied
