12700,to enhance nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment a novel method of wrapping waste iron shavings fe c in polyurethane sponge cubes tied in anoxic zones of a continuous reactor was proposed three types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in biofilms and activated sludge including iron autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 7 83 8 71 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 10 60 11 95 and heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria 23 47 40 06 iron autotrophic denitrifying bacteria dechloromonas and sphaerotilus can remove no3 n using fe2 as electron donor produced by micro electrolysis of iron shavings without organic carbon demand and heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria ferribacterium and zoogloea can simultaneously accomplish nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions the enrichment of these two functional bacteria strengthened the nitrogen removal performance compared to conventional heterotrophic denitrifying process which could achieve efficient and stable total nitrogen removal 87 4 even with low organic carbon in addition the synergy of biological and chemical processes through fe c micro electrolysis also enhanced total phosphorus removal 86 0 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords multiple denitrifying bacteria biofilms nitrogen removal fe c data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most common water pollutants causing serious environmental problems worldwide 1 nitrogen contamination of aquatic environments is mainly due to the extensive use of nitrogen fertilizers and indiscriminate discharge of municipal and industrial effluents often resulting in frequent eutrophication of surface water posing a threat to ecological balance and human health 2 therefore a simple and effective method must be developed for the advanced removal of nitrogen biological technology is the mainstream method used in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove nitrogen from wastewater 3 4 however the widely used heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb are limited in nitrogen removal if low organic carbon c n 4 is available in the wastewater because sufficient organic compounds need to be provided as electron donors 5 6 in this context autotrophic denitrifying bacteria adb have received increasing attention using inorganic compounds as electron donors to convert no3 n to n2 studies have shown that adb can be enriched by adding s fe and h2 etc and a denitrification system dominated by adb can be formed 7 9 among them fe c can produce fe2 and h2 through micro electrolysis 10 with characteristics of safe storage and high availability which is a good alternative method to promote no3 n bioconversion under anaerobic conditions deng et al demonstrated that autotrophic denitrification ad is supported by iron fe 0 oxidising enriched iron autotrophic denitrifying bacteria fe adb and hydrogen autotrophic denitrifying bacteria h2 adb 11 in addition pan et al added waste iron shavings to achieve deep nitrogen removal in the sequencing batch reactor and speculated that fe adb sphaerotilus played an important role 12 however adb still have some disadvantages such as long sludge age and slow reaction rate the nitrogen removal paths of iron autotrophic denitrification fe ad and heterotrophic denitrification hd are shown in fig s1 11 13 recently heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hnad has attracted attention for wastewater treatment because of its ability to enhance nitrogen removal under aerobic conditions heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria hnadb can rapidly convert nh4 n no3 n and no2 n into nitrogen containing gases in addition hnadb has the advantages of a fast denitrification rate strong adaptability and short sludge age simplifying the technological process shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt and reducing the operational energy consumption in actual wastewater treatment 14 however presently most of the studies on hnadb are about isolation of strains and the enrichment methods of hnadb remain unclear 15 the nitrogen removal path of hnad is shown in fig s1 14 16 17 in conclusion adb does not require organic carbon and hnadb has higher environmental adaptability and faster nitrogen removal rate therefore we speculate that nitrogen removal efficiency can be improved and organic carbon can be reduced by enriching hdb adb and hnadb simultaneously interestingly the diversity of denitrifying bacteria in soil environments is commonly higher than that in wastewater treatment processes 18 and many functional genera different from wastewater treatment have been found in soil denitrification processes 19 25 we seem to be able to find conditions for the simultaneous enrichment of multiple denitrifying bacteria in these studies fan et al enriched hnadb and hdb in soil media and achieved a high nitrogen removal rate 26 in addition several studies have shown that the abundance and species of denitrifying bacteria were higher in iron containing soils for instance li et al achieved the enrichment of adb dechloromonas in paddy soil under anoxic conditions by adding fe2 which can use fe2 as electron donor for denitrification 17 tan et al enriched hnadb ferribacterium zoogloea adb hydrogenophaga and hdb gemmobacter pseudoxanthomonas simultaneously in constructed wetland packing with shale ceramsite and activated alumina the two were rich in al fe and ca and demonstrated that dissolved oxygen and reducing elements were the main environmental factors affecting hnadb composition 27 the enrichment of these function bacteria may be related to the formation of biofilms in anoxic environments oxygen released by plant roots and the addition of fe to the soil based on this we aimed to achieve the enrichment of multiple types of denitrifying bacteria to enhance wastewater nitrogen removal waste iron shavings are a kind of waste iron carbon filler and easy to available polyurethane sponge can form rich biofilms in wastewater treatment with the properties of large specific surface area and high utilization rate of space volume therefore we propose a novel filler in which waste iron shavings are wrapped in a polyurethane sponge cube and then tied to agitators in the anoxic zone of the continuous reactor it could be speculated that the enrichment of multiple types of denitrifying bacteria can be achieved as well as the removal of phosphorus that is synchronous deep nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be achieved compared with the traditional wastewater treatment process it is no need to add additional carbon source alkalinity and advanced treatment unit 28 29 the major objective of the present study was to investigate 1 the abundance and distribution of hdb adb and hnadb in activated sludge and biofilms 2 the performance of nitrogen removal and the variation of sludge composition 3 the mechanism of pollutants removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a schematic flow chart of the reactor hangzhou jude environmental technology co ltd china is shown in fig 1a the effective working volume of the reactor was 26 5 l exclude sedimentation tank which included three anoxic zones 6 5 cm in width 10 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height an oxic zone 6 5 cm in width 43 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height a sludge return area 6 5 cm in width 3 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height and a two zones sedimentation tank 8 5 l fig 1c the fabrication and properties of the fillers are presented in fig 1b the novel filler was composed of waste iron shavings 0 2 g 98 2 fe contents and polyurethane sponge cube 0 4 g side length 2 cm and iron shavings were wrapped in polyurethane sponge cube then the fillers were tied to the agitators in three anoxic zones and each agitator had ten fillers the spiral shaped iron shavings are waste products recycled from a steel processing plant in hangzhou and carbon in iron shavings is in the form of inorganic carbon with high stability insoluble in water the polyurethane sponge cubes were provided by xuzhou yunqitian trading co ltd polyurethane filler is a common biological filler used in water treatment process it has the advantages of large specific surface area and high utilization rate of space volume the main physical characteristics are as follows according to the manufacturer description the porosity of polyurethane sponge cubes is 96 99 the specific surface area is 10 104 m2 m3 and the wire diameter is 0 6 1 5 mm the polyurethane sponge cubes were chosen for its three dimensional structure which allows iron shavings to be wrapped inside the influent entered the first anoxic zone at a flow rate of 3 31 l h and subsequently flowed sequentially through the second and third anoxic zones oxic zone first sedimentation and second sedimentation tanks the sludge was returned to the first anoxic zone through an air lift system from the first sedimentation tank fig 1d the return flow rate was calculated by measuring the diameter and flow rate of the reflux pipe the reflux ratio was 3 0 5 the remaining sludge flowed to the second sedimentation tank where it was separated from the treated wastewater by the baffle and settled and discharged through the sludge discharge port the hrt exclude sedimentation tanks was 8 h and the retention time of the activated sludge was approximately 12 days the airflow rates in the oxic and air lift zones were 2 and 1 5 l min respectively dissolved oxygen in the first anoxic zone was controlled at 0 7 0 2 mg l 0 3 0 1 mg l in the second and third anoxic zones and 3 5 1 5 mg l mg l in the oxic zone and this is because influent cod fluctuates leading to different oxygen consumption during the experiment the ph values fluctuated between 7 5 and 8 0 the operating temperature was maintained at 20 5 c and half of the combined fillers on each agitator were replaced every 20 days for sludge discharge to prevent phosphorus accumulation 2 2 inoculated sludge and sewage composition we used ch3coona nh4cl and k2hpo4 shanghai aladdin biochemical technology co ltd china to prepare synthetic wastewater specific water quality indicators are the chemical oxygen demand cod 246 4 83 8 mg l total nitrogen tn 30 0 3 9 mg

and 20 g edta in 4 l water the inoculated sludge obtained from an aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant located in huzhou china before being inoculated into the reactor large particles were removed through a 200 μm mesh sieve the initial sludge concentration of mixed liquid suspension mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspension mlvss were 2977 and 1600 mg l respectively which is consistent with sludge concentrations in wastewater treatment plants the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 was approximately 164 6 ml g 2 3 analysis method water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the reactor and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper before analysis the parameters cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n tp tn mlss mlvss svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods 30 total iron tfe concentration was determined using o phenanthroline spectrophotometry dissolved oxygen ph and temperature were measured using a german wtw multi 3420 photographs of the sludge were taken using a microscope olympus sz61 japan x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded on a panalytical x pert pro powder diffractometer using cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm the working voltage and

sludge the sludge and iron shavings morphologies in the system after 30 days of operation are shown in fig 2 fig 2a illustrates the overall structure of the fillers and it can be observed that the fillers enriched microorganisms and formed biofilms the sludge mass enriched per filler was 225 1 24 6 mg implying that the filler could enrich a large number of microorganisms as shown in fig 2b the surface of the iron shavings was still shiny after 30 days of operation with only a small amount of iron precipitates and there may be no iron shaving passivation phenomenon but still needs to be further verified in the xrf analysis of the sludge iron content in the biofilms has increased in addition xrd analysis showed that fe3 po4 2 was formed in the inorganic substance of the biofilms which was not present in the inoculated sludge therefore it could be speculated that the by products produced by micro electrolysis are adsorbed by microorganisms on the filler thereby extending the service life of iron shavings interestingly filamentous bacteria were enriched on the surface of the fillers fig 2c which may be related to the circulation of the activated sludge allowing filamentous bacteria continuously filtered and enriched on the fillers fig 2d shows the morphology of activated sludge in the reactor it can be observed that the activated sludge has a prominent outline and the interior contains inorganic materials according to the xrd analysis below the main component of the inorganic materials was fe3 po4 2 which caused the activated sludge to maintain satisfactory settling performance in order to verify whether there is multiple denitrifying bacteria enrichment the inoculated sludge is biofilms and the surface of biofilms in the first a 1 and sa 1 second a 2 and sa 2 and third a 3 and sa 3 anoxic zones and activated sludge o in oxic zone after 30 days of operation in the system were analyzed through high throughput sequencing the higher the coverage the higher the probability that the species in the sample will be detected and the lower the probability that they will not be detected in this study the coverage rate of all eight samples was greater than 99 9 indicating that the obtained sequence library covered the microbial diversity microbial diversity can be expressed using the chao 1 shannon and simpson indices table s1 the chao1 and ace indices measure species abundance as the number of species while the shannon and simpson indices were used to measure species diversity the greater the shannon and simpson indices the higher the species diversity of the sample as shown in table s1 compared with is the species diversity decreased with the operation of the system possibly owing to the simple composition of the synthetic wastewater which also indicates that microorganisms have adapted to the system species diversity was the lowest on the surface of biofilms especially in sa 1 indicating that specific bacterial species were enriched operational taxonomic units out refer to the grouping of effective sequences with high similarity levels where a group is an otu in this study a similarity of 97 or above was considered the classification standard of out the common and unique otus existing only in each sample were determined a flower diagram based on the characteristics of each sample is shown in fig 3a the common otus existing in each sample were 122 and the unique otu numbers existing only in each sample of is a 1 a 2 a 3 o sa 1 sa 2 and sa 3 were 356 388 360 408 266 160 212 and 227 respectively biofilms contained more bacterial species especially in a 3 possibly related to their proximity to the anoxic environment resulting in multiple types of bacterial species in addition the surface of biofilms contained fewer bacterial species especially in sa 1 possibly because the first anoxic zone was the point of influent and the more competitiveness of filamentous bacteria on the surface of biofilms the distribution of microbial communities at the phylum level is shown in fig 3b the distribution structure of microorganisms in each zone was different proteobacteria was the largest group with an abundance of 54 3 in the is after 30 d the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased reaching 73 2 66 3 65 2 and 63 2 in o a 1 a 2 and a 3 respectively the relative abundance was higher on the surface of the biofilms reaching 91 9 81 4 and 83 1 in sa 1 sa 2 and sa 3 respectively the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased compared to that of the is however it remained the second most abundant phylum in contrary the relative abundance of nitrospirota and gemmatimonadota was higher than that of the is fig 3c shows species differences at the genus level according to the genus level analysis the dominant bacteria were hnadb zoogloea and ferribacterium 27 31 adb dechloromonas and sphaerotilus 11 17 32 33 hdb thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas 11 34 35 consequently hnadb were mainly distributed in activated sludge and zoogloea and ferribacterium were the most abundant denitrifying bacteria the abundance of these two bacteria in the oxic zone 25 03 and 15 03 was higher than that in anoxic zones 17 66 and 6 40 in a 1 16 23 and 7 24 in a 2 and 17 00 and 8 37 in a 3 which can simultaneously accomplish nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions previous studies have indicated that hnadb has the advantages of a fast denitrification rate strong adaptability and a short sludge age 25 27 therefore hnadb may play an important role for high efficiency and stable nitrogen removal performance under conditions of unstable influent cod in the system according to our knowledge the enrichment of ferribacterium was closely related to fe addition 25 27 36 therefore we speculated that the presence of fe may be an important condition for the enrichment of ferribacterium the enrichment of adb dechloromonas and sphaerotilus is mainly due to the addition of waste iron shavings which can produce fe2 as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification by fe c micro electrolysis 37 38 in this study dechloromonas rapidly dominated and increased throughout the operation and its relative abundance increased from 0 04 is to 7 45 o 6 03 a1 5 57 a2 and 5 21 a3 previous studies have indicated that adding fe2 to paddy soils could enrich dechloromona and enhance the removal of no3 n 17 in addition the surface of the fillers was covered with filamentous bacteria during operation identified as sphaerotilus by nessler s staining and 100 oil microscopy fig s2 39 as a result sphaerotilus was mainly distributed on the surface of the fillers and its relative abundance reached 63 35 in sa 1 26 57 in sa 2 and 30 83 in sa 3 enrichment of sphaerotilus on the surface of the fillers was related to the agitator setting in the anoxic zones which enabled the filamentous bacteria sphaerotilus to be continuously wound and enriched and to remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor in addition hdb were also enriched in the system such as thauera 3 25 in o 3 99 in a 1 3 73 in a 2 and 3 64 in a 3 uncultured denitratisoma sp 1 15 in o 0 82 in a 1 1 04 in a 2 and 1 00 in a 3 and pseudomonas 0 66 in o 0 43 in a 1 0 45 in a 2 and 0 67 in a 3 11 34 35 these bacteria were also enriched in the oxic zone possibly due to the circulation of activated sludge in the system and shedding biofilms the above results suggest that multiple denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in the system including hnadb ferribacterium and zoogloea adb sphaerotilus and dechloromonas and hdb thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas which were linked to the satisfactory nitrogen removal performance moreover ferruginibacter nitrospira flavobacterium and unclassified ns9 marine group which are typical nitrifying bacteria were also enriched in the system and their relative abundance was higher in activated sludge than biofilms 40 43 in addition unclassified rhodocyclaceae candidatus accumulibacter and unclassified gemmatimonadaceae play an important role in phosphorus removal in the system 43 45 3 2 x ray fluorescence and diffraction analysis of sludge the variations in the mlss mlvss and svi30 of the activated sludge are shown in fig s3 mlss and mlvss steadily increased and mlvss mlss remained at 0 8 possibly due to the use of synthetic wastewater and it is evident that svi30 remains at 70 140 ml g during system operation from day 0 to day 20 svi30 continued to rise to 140 ml g and filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge increased continuously as observed under a microscope however thereafter the svi30 began to decrease gradually and remained below 100 ml g interestingly many filamentous bacteria were enriched on the surface of the biofilms and no sludge bulking occurred in the reactor we speculate that this may be due to the addition of iron shavings structural characteristics of filamentous bacteria and continuous return of activated sludge in the system previous studies have shown that the addition of fe3 can improve the settling properties of sludge and inhibit sludge bulking 46 in addition the filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge intertwined with the fillers when the activated sludge passed through and the circulation of activated sludge in the system enabled the continuous removal of filamentous bacteria x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf were used to further analyze inoculated sludge is activated sludge o in the oxic zone and biofilms in the first a 1 second a 2 and third a 3 anoxic zones in the system fig 4 the xrf spectrometry of sludge is to determine the relative weight of various inorganic elements relative to the total inorganic elements as shown in fig 4a si p al fe and ca were the major elements in all samples the high relative weights of si and al may be due to the higher sediment content of the inoculated sludge and the addition of chemicals during the wastewater treatment process the increased relative weights of si in biofilms and activated sludge may be because the total inorganic substance content of the sludge was reduced for mlvss mlss increased from 0 53 is to above 0 8 and sio2 can neither be absorbed by microorganisms nor easily discharged with effluent the relative weights of p and fe were enriched compared with the is the relative weight of p was highest in o 16 4 which may be related to biological phosphorus removal followed by a 3 13 8 meanwhile the relative weight of fe in a 3 16 6 was the highest mainly because of the combination of fe2 produced by the iron shavings with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 and the proportion of fe in o not increase may be iron shavings were separated from activated sludge by biofilms and only a small fraction of micro electrolytic products was released into the activated sludge xrd analysis of fig 4b showed that the main substances in the is included sio2 and alpo4 consistent with the xrf results moreover fe3 po4 2 the main inorganic form of p and fe in the system accumulated indicating that chemical phosphorus removal played a key role 3 3 performance of the system variations of cod tp tn nh4 n and tfe in the system are shown in fig 5 during the operation the influent cod concentration was 246 4 83 8 mg l for simulating the fluctuation of actual wastewater quality the cod effluent concentration was 16 6 6 6 mg l which remained below 30 0 mg l fig 5a and the average removal rate reached 92 3 in the system the influent cod fluctuates but the effluent remained stable indicating that the effluent was less affected by the influent and that the system was highly stable fig 5b and d shows the variations of n the nitrogen source of the synthetic wastewater was prepared using nh4cl leaving little difference between the tn and nh4 n in the influent with the concentration of 30 0 3 9 mg l in this experiment efficient nitrogen removal was achieved and the average effluent concentration of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n was 3 7 1 3 0 2 0 2 0 01 0 03 and 3 6 1 6 mg l and the removal rates of tn and nh4 n reached 87 4 and 99 2 respectively organic carbon usually plays an important role in traditional tn removal using heterotrophic denitrification during the experiment the effluent tn remained stable when c n fluctuated the lowest value was 3 3 the high nitrogen removal efficiency may be related to multiple denitrification pathways in the system the removal effect of tp is shown in fig 5c the tp concentration of the influent was 3 0 0 5 mg l and the average effluent concentration was 0 4 0 3 mg l an average removal rate of 86 0 was achieved indicating that the system had a satisfactory tp removal performance the fluctuating of cod did not affect the removal of tp which is related to the chemical phosphorus removal in the system the xrd results above show that fe2 produced by iron shavings reacts with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 which enhances phosphate removal fe2 are produced by iron shaving via fe c micro electrolysis fig 5d shows the tfe concentration of the effluent 0 1 0 1 mg l during the operation which indicated that the addition of waste iron shavings did not affect the effluent quality in addition during the experiment the highest concentration of tfe was 0 2 mg l which was not toxic to microorganisms 3 4 proposed mechanism combined with the structure and function of the microbes the performance of contaminant removal reactor operation mode and relevant data from previous studies 13 47 a comprehensive pollutant degradation path for the system was proposed fig 6 in anoxic zones micro electrolysis of iron shavings inside the fillers can produce a series of byproducts such as fe2 fe3 its crystals and other active substances beneficial for the removal of nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter for nitrogen removal three types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched in the reactor fe adb dechloromonas sphaerotilus hnadb ferribacterium zoogloea and hdb thauera unclassified rhodocyclaceae and acinetobacter fe2 and a low organic carbon promoted the enrichment of fe adb which can remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor without organic carbon source hnadb simultaneously removed nh4 n and no3 n achieving rapid and complete nitrogen removal and fe ad and hnad enhanced hdb for nitrogen removal based on the above deep nitrogen removal was achieved by synergistic degradation of denitrification types and the average removal rate of nh4 n and tn were 86 and 78 g m3 d respectively phosphorus removal is primarily achieved through biological and chemical processes and the average removal rate of tp was 77 g m3 d in addition effective organic removal capacity is also achieved and the average removal rate of cod was 690 g m3 d mineral analysis showed that the fe2 produced by the iron shavings combined with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 precipitation and alternate anaerobic aerobic conditions can achieve the biological removal of phosphorus 4 conclusions in this study a simple and effective method of wrapping waste iron shavings in polyurethane sponge cubes tied in anoxic zones was proposed to enrich multiple types of denitrifying bacteria for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment the results suggested that multiple types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in the system and the relative abundance of hnadb ferribacterium and zoogloea adb sphaerotilus and dechloromonas and hdb e g thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas reached 23 47 40 06 7 83 8 71 and 10 60 11 95 respectively which is related to the addition of novel fillers the formation of sludge biofilm system and dissolved oxygen control fe adb can remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor produced by micro electrolysis of iron shavings without organic carbon demand hnadb achieved simultaneously nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions with higher efficiency and reaction rate the enrichment of these functional bacteria strengthened the nitrogen removal 87 4 even with low organic carbon in addition efficient phosphorus removal 86 0 was enhanced by the synergy of biological and chemical processes fe2 and po4 3 combine to form fe3 po4 2 precipitation moreover the formation of biofilms may slow passivation of iron shavings so that the micro electrolysis reaction can continue and the continuous rotation of the filler in anoxic zones caused filamentous bacteria constantly winding and enriching which controlled the sludge bulking even under low organic carbon in conclusion this study achieved the enrichment of multiple denitrifying bacteria with a simple and effective method which provides a new thought for advanced efficient and stable nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12700,to enhance nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment a novel method of wrapping waste iron shavings fe c in polyurethane sponge cubes tied in anoxic zones of a continuous reactor was proposed three types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in biofilms and activated sludge including iron autotrophic denitrifying bacteria 7 83 8 71 heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria 10 60

produced by micro electrolysis of iron shavings without organic carbon demand and heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria ferribacterium and zoogloea can simultaneously accomplish nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions the enrichment of these two functional bacteria strengthened the nitrogen removal performance compared to conventional heterotrophic denitrifying process which could achieve efficient and stable total nitrogen removal 87 4 even with low organic carbon in addition the synergy of biological and chemical processes through fe c micro electrolysis also enhanced total phosphorus removal 86 0 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords multiple denitrifying bacteria biofilms nitrogen removal fe c data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction nitrogen is one of the most common water pollutants causing serious environmental problems worldwide 1 nitrogen contamination of aquatic

posing a threat to ecological balance and human health 2 therefore a simple and effective method must be developed for the advanced removal of nitrogen biological technology is the mainstream method used in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove nitrogen from wastewater 3 4 however the widely used heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria hdb are limited in nitrogen removal if low organic carbon c n 4 is available in the wastewater because sufficient organic compounds need to be provided as electron donors 5 6 in this context autotrophic denitrifying bacteria adb have received increasing attention using inorganic compounds as electron donors to convert no3 n to n2 studies have shown that adb can be enriched by adding s fe and h2 etc and a denitrification system dominated by adb can be formed 7 9 among them fe c can produce fe2 and h2 through micro electrolysis 10 with characteristics of safe storage and high availability which is a good alternative method to promote no3 n bioconversion under anaerobic conditions deng et al demonstrated that autotrophic denitrification ad is supported by iron fe 0 oxidising enriched iron autotrophic denitrifying bacteria fe adb and hydrogen autotrophic denitrifying bacteria h2 adb 11 in addition pan et al added waste iron shavings to achieve deep nitrogen removal in the sequencing batch reactor and speculated that fe adb sphaerotilus played an important role 12 however adb still have some disadvantages such as long sludge age and slow reaction rate the nitrogen removal paths of iron autotrophic denitrification fe ad and heterotrophic denitrification hd are shown in fig s1 11 13 recently heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrification hnad has attracted attention for wastewater treatment because of its ability to enhance nitrogen removal under aerobic conditions heterotrophic nitrification aerobic denitrifying bacteria hnadb can rapidly convert nh4 n no3 n and no2 n into nitrogen containing gases in addition hnadb has the advantages of a fast denitrification rate strong adaptability and short sludge age simplifying the technological process shortening the hydraulic retention time hrt and reducing the operational energy consumption in actual wastewater treatment 14 however presently most of the studies on hnadb are about isolation of strains and the enrichment methods of hnadb remain unclear 15 the nitrogen removal path of hnad is shown in fig s1 14 16 17 in conclusion adb does not require organic carbon and hnadb has higher environmental adaptability and faster nitrogen removal rate therefore we speculate that nitrogen removal efficiency can be improved and organic carbon can be reduced by enriching hdb adb and hnadb simultaneously interestingly the diversity of denitrifying bacteria in soil environments is commonly higher than that in wastewater treatment processes 18 and many functional genera different from wastewater treatment have been found in soil denitrification processes 19 25 we seem to be able to find conditions for the simultaneous enrichment of multiple denitrifying bacteria in these studies fan et al enriched hnadb and hdb in soil media and achieved a high nitrogen removal rate 26 in addition several studies have shown that the abundance and species of denitrifying bacteria were higher in iron containing soils for instance li et al achieved the enrichment of adb dechloromonas in paddy soil under anoxic conditions by adding fe2 which can use fe2 as electron donor for denitrification 17 tan et al enriched hnadb ferribacterium zoogloea adb hydrogenophaga and hdb gemmobacter pseudoxanthomonas simultaneously in constructed wetland packing with shale ceramsite and activated alumina the two were rich in al fe and ca and demonstrated that dissolved oxygen and reducing elements were the main environmental factors affecting hnadb composition 27 the enrichment of these function bacteria may be related to the formation of biofilms in anoxic environments oxygen released by plant roots and the addition of fe to the soil based on this we aimed to achieve the enrichment of multiple types of denitrifying bacteria to enhance wastewater nitrogen removal waste iron shavings are a kind of waste iron carbon filler and easy to available polyurethane sponge can form rich biofilms in wastewater treatment with the properties of large specific surface area and high utilization rate of space volume therefore we propose a novel filler in which waste iron shavings are wrapped in a polyurethane sponge cube and then tied to agitators in the anoxic zone of the continuous reactor it could be speculated that the enrichment of multiple types of denitrifying bacteria can be achieved as well as the removal of phosphorus that is synchronous deep nitrogen and phosphorus removal can be achieved compared with the traditional wastewater treatment process it is no need to add additional carbon source alkalinity and advanced treatment unit 28 29 the major objective of the present study was to investigate 1 the abundance and distribution of hdb adb and hnadb in activated sludge and biofilms 2 the performance of nitrogen removal and the variation of sludge composition 3 the mechanism of pollutants removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor setup and operation a schematic flow chart of the reactor hangzhou jude environmental technology co ltd china is shown in fig 1a the effective working volume of the reactor was 26 5 l exclude sedimentation tank which included three anoxic zones 6 5 cm in width 10 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height an oxic zone 6 5 cm in width 43 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height a sludge return area 6 5 cm in width 3 0 cm in length and 53 5 cm in height and a two zones sedimentation tank 8 5 l fig 1c the fabrication and properties of the fillers are presented in fig 1b the novel filler was composed of waste iron shavings 0 2 g 98 2 fe contents and polyurethane sponge cube 0 4 g side length 2 cm and iron shavings were wrapped in polyurethane sponge cube then the fillers were tied to the agitators in three anoxic zones and each agitator had ten fillers the spiral shaped iron shavings are waste products recycled from a steel processing plant in hangzhou and carbon in iron shavings is in the form of inorganic carbon with high stability insoluble in water the polyurethane sponge cubes were provided by xuzhou yunqitian trading co ltd polyurethane filler is a common biological filler used in water treatment process it has the advantages of large specific surface area and high utilization rate of space volume the main physical characteristics are as follows according to the manufacturer description the porosity of polyurethane sponge cubes is 96 99 the specific surface area is 10 104 m2 m3 and the wire diameter is 0 6 1 5 mm the polyurethane sponge cubes were chosen for its three dimensional structure which allows iron shavings to be wrapped inside the influent entered the first anoxic zone at a flow rate of 3 31 l h and subsequently flowed sequentially through the second and third anoxic zones oxic zone first sedimentation and second sedimentation tanks the sludge was returned to the first anoxic zone through an air lift system from the first sedimentation tank fig 1d the return flow rate was calculated by measuring the diameter and flow rate of the reflux pipe the reflux ratio was 3 0 5 the remaining sludge flowed to the second sedimentation tank where it was separated from the treated wastewater by the baffle and settled and discharged through the sludge discharge port the hrt exclude sedimentation tanks was 8 h and the retention time of the activated sludge was approximately 12 days the airflow rates in the oxic and air lift zones were 2 and 1 5 l min respectively dissolved oxygen in the first anoxic zone was controlled at 0 7 0 2 mg l 0 3 0 1 mg l in the second and third anoxic zones and 3 5 1 5 mg l mg l in the oxic zone and this is because influent cod fluctuates leading to different oxygen consumption during the experiment the ph values fluctuated between 7 5 and 8 0 the operating temperature was maintained at 20 5 c and half of the combined fillers on each agitator were replaced every 20 days for sludge discharge to prevent phosphorus accumulation 2 2 inoculated sludge and sewage composition we used ch3coona nh4cl and k2hpo4

and 20 g edta in 4 l water the inoculated sludge obtained from an aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant located in huzhou china before being inoculated into the reactor large particles were removed through a 200 μm mesh sieve the initial sludge concentration of mixed liquid suspension mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspension mlvss were 2977 and 1600 mg l respectively which is consistent with sludge concentrations in wastewater treatment plants the sludge volume index after 30 min svi30 was approximately 164 6 ml g 2 3 analysis method water samples were collected from the influent and effluent of the reactor and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper before analysis the parameters cod nh4 n no3 n no2 n tp tn mlss mlvss svi5 and svi30 were measured according to standard methods 30 total iron tfe concentration was determined using o phenanthroline spectrophotometry dissolved oxygen ph and temperature were measured using a german wtw multi 3420 photographs of the sludge were

sludge the sludge and iron shavings morphologies in the system after 30 days of operation are shown in fig 2 fig 2a illustrates the overall structure of the fillers and it can be observed that the fillers enriched microorganisms and formed biofilms the sludge mass enriched per filler was 225 1 24 6 mg implying that the filler could enrich a large number of microorganisms as shown in fig 2b the surface of the iron shavings was still shiny after 30 days of operation with only a small amount of iron precipitates and there may be no iron shaving passivation phenomenon but still needs to be further verified in the xrf analysis of the sludge iron content in the biofilms has increased in addition xrd analysis showed that fe3 po4 2 was formed in the inorganic substance of the biofilms which was not present in the inoculated sludge therefore it could be speculated that the by products produced by micro electrolysis are adsorbed by microorganisms on the filler thereby extending the service life of iron shavings interestingly filamentous bacteria were enriched on the surface of the fillers fig 2c which may be related to the circulation of the activated sludge allowing filamentous bacteria continuously filtered and enriched on the fillers fig 2d shows the morphology of activated sludge in the reactor it can be observed that the activated sludge has a prominent outline and the interior contains inorganic materials according to the xrd analysis below the main component of the inorganic materials was fe3 po4 2 which caused the activated sludge to maintain satisfactory settling performance in order to verify whether there is multiple denitrifying bacteria enrichment the inoculated sludge is biofilms and the surface of biofilms in the first a 1 and sa 1 second a 2 and sa 2 and third a 3 and sa 3 anoxic zones and activated sludge o in oxic zone after 30 days of operation in the system were analyzed through high throughput sequencing the higher the coverage the higher the probability that the species in the sample will be detected and the lower the probability that they will not be detected in this study the coverage rate of all eight samples was greater than 99 9 indicating that the obtained sequence library covered the microbial diversity microbial diversity can be expressed using the chao 1 shannon and simpson indices table s1 the chao1 and ace indices measure species abundance as the number of species while the shannon and simpson indices were used to measure species diversity the greater the shannon and simpson indices the higher the species diversity of the sample as shown in table s1 compared with is the species diversity decreased with the operation of the system possibly owing to the simple composition of the synthetic wastewater which also indicates that microorganisms have adapted to the system species diversity was the lowest on the surface of biofilms especially in sa 1 indicating that specific bacterial species were enriched operational taxonomic units out refer to the grouping of effective sequences with high similarity levels where a group is an otu in this study a similarity of 97 or above was considered the classification standard of out the common and unique otus existing only in each sample were determined a flower diagram based on the characteristics of each sample is shown in fig 3a the common otus existing in each sample were 122 and the unique otu numbers existing only in each sample of is a 1 a 2 a 3 o sa 1 sa 2 and sa 3 were 356 388 360 408 266 160 212 and 227 respectively biofilms contained more bacterial species especially in a 3 possibly related to their proximity to the anoxic environment resulting in multiple types of bacterial species in addition the surface of biofilms contained fewer bacterial species especially in sa 1 possibly because the first anoxic zone was the point of influent and the more competitiveness of filamentous bacteria on the surface of biofilms the distribution of microbial communities at the phylum level is shown in fig 3b the distribution structure of microorganisms in each zone was different proteobacteria was the largest group with an abundance of 54 3 in the is after 30 d the relative abundance of proteobacteria increased reaching 73 2 66 3 65 2 and 63 2 in o a 1 a 2 and a 3 respectively the relative abundance was higher on the surface of the biofilms reaching 91 9 81 4 and 83 1 in sa 1 sa 2 and sa 3 respectively the relative abundance of bacteroidetes decreased compared to that of the is however it remained the second most abundant phylum in contrary the relative abundance of nitrospirota and gemmatimonadota was higher than that of the is fig 3c shows species differences at the genus level according to the genus level analysis the dominant bacteria were hnadb zoogloea and ferribacterium 27 31 adb dechloromonas and sphaerotilus 11 17 32 33 hdb thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas 11 34 35 consequently hnadb were mainly distributed in activated sludge and zoogloea and ferribacterium were the most abundant denitrifying bacteria the abundance of these two bacteria in the oxic zone 25 03 and 15 03 was higher than that in anoxic zones 17 66 and 6 40 in a 1 16 23 and 7 24 in a 2 and 17 00 and 8 37 in a 3 which can simultaneously accomplish nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions previous studies have indicated that hnadb has the advantages of a fast denitrification rate strong adaptability and a short sludge age 25 27 therefore hnadb may play an important role for high efficiency and stable nitrogen removal performance under conditions of unstable influent cod in the system according to our knowledge the enrichment of ferribacterium was closely related to fe addition 25 27 36 therefore we speculated that the presence of fe may be an important condition for the enrichment of ferribacterium the enrichment of adb dechloromonas and sphaerotilus is mainly due to the addition of waste iron shavings which can produce fe2 as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification by fe c micro electrolysis 37 38 in this study dechloromonas rapidly dominated and increased throughout the operation and its relative abundance increased from 0 04 is to 7 45 o 6 03 a1 5 57 a2 and 5 21 a3 previous studies have indicated that adding fe2 to paddy soils could enrich dechloromona and enhance the removal of no3 n 17 in addition the surface of the fillers was covered with filamentous bacteria during operation identified as sphaerotilus by nessler s staining and 100 oil microscopy fig s2 39 as a result sphaerotilus was mainly distributed on the surface of the fillers and its relative abundance reached 63 35 in sa 1 26 57 in sa 2 and 30 83 in sa 3 enrichment of sphaerotilus on the surface of the fillers was related to the agitator setting in the anoxic zones which enabled the filamentous bacteria sphaerotilus to be continuously wound and enriched and to remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor in addition hdb were also enriched in the system such as thauera 3 25 in o 3 99 in a 1 3 73 in a 2 and 3 64 in a 3 uncultured denitratisoma sp 1 15 in o 0 82 in a 1 1 04 in a 2 and 1 00 in a 3 and pseudomonas 0 66 in o 0 43 in a 1 0 45 in a 2 and 0 67 in a 3 11 34 35 these bacteria were also enriched in the oxic zone possibly due to the circulation of activated sludge in the system and shedding biofilms the above results suggest that multiple denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in the system including hnadb ferribacterium and zoogloea adb sphaerotilus and dechloromonas and hdb thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas which were linked to the satisfactory nitrogen removal performance moreover ferruginibacter nitrospira flavobacterium and unclassified ns9 marine group which are typical nitrifying bacteria were also enriched in the system and their relative abundance was higher in activated sludge than biofilms 40 43 in addition unclassified rhodocyclaceae candidatus accumulibacter and unclassified gemmatimonadaceae play an important role in phosphorus removal in the system 43 45 3 2 x ray fluorescence and diffraction analysis of sludge the variations in the mlss mlvss and svi30 of the activated sludge are shown in fig s3 mlss and mlvss steadily increased and mlvss mlss remained at 0 8 possibly due to the use of synthetic wastewater and it is evident that svi30 remains at 70 140 ml g during system operation from day 0 to day 20 svi30 continued to rise to 140 ml g and filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge increased continuously as observed under a microscope however thereafter the svi30 began to decrease gradually and remained below 100 ml g interestingly many filamentous bacteria were enriched on the surface of the biofilms and no sludge bulking occurred in the reactor we speculate that this may be due to the addition of iron shavings structural characteristics of filamentous bacteria and continuous return of activated sludge in the system previous studies have shown that the addition of fe3 can improve the settling properties of sludge and inhibit sludge bulking 46 in addition the filamentous bacteria in the activated sludge intertwined with the fillers when the activated sludge passed through and the circulation of activated sludge in the system enabled the continuous removal of filamentous bacteria x ray diffraction xrd and x ray fluorescence xrf were used to further analyze inoculated sludge is activated sludge o in the oxic zone and biofilms in the first a 1 second a 2 and third a 3 anoxic zones in the system fig 4 the xrf spectrometry of sludge is to determine the relative weight of various inorganic elements relative to the total inorganic elements as shown in fig 4a si p al fe and ca were the major elements in all samples the high relative weights of si and al may be due to the higher sediment content of the inoculated sludge and the addition of chemicals during the wastewater treatment process the increased relative weights of si in biofilms and activated sludge may be because the total inorganic substance content of the sludge was reduced for mlvss mlss increased from 0 53 is to above 0 8 and sio2 can neither be absorbed by microorganisms nor easily discharged with effluent the relative weights of p and fe were enriched compared with the is the relative weight of p was highest in o 16 4 which may be related to biological phosphorus removal followed by a 3 13 8 meanwhile the relative weight of fe in a 3 16 6 was the highest mainly because of the combination of fe2 produced by the iron shavings with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 and the proportion of fe in o not increase may be iron shavings were separated from activated sludge by biofilms and only a small fraction of micro electrolytic products was released into the activated sludge xrd analysis of fig 4b showed that the main substances in the is included sio2 and alpo4 consistent with the xrf results moreover fe3 po4 2 the main inorganic form of p and fe in the system accumulated indicating that chemical phosphorus removal played a key role 3 3 performance of the system variations of cod tp tn nh4 n and tfe in the system are shown in fig 5 during the operation the influent cod concentration was 246 4 83 8 mg l for simulating the fluctuation of actual wastewater quality the cod effluent concentration was 16 6 6 6 mg l which remained below 30 0 mg l fig 5a and the average removal rate reached 92 3 in the system the influent cod fluctuates but the effluent remained stable indicating that the effluent was less affected by the influent and that the system was highly stable fig 5b and d shows the variations of n the nitrogen source of the synthetic wastewater was prepared using nh4cl leaving little difference between the tn and nh4 n in the influent with the concentration of 30 0 3 9 mg l in this experiment efficient nitrogen removal was achieved and the average effluent concentration of tn nh4 n no2 n and no3 n was 3 7 1 3 0 2 0 2 0 01 0 03 and 3 6 1 6 mg l and the removal rates of tn and nh4 n reached 87 4 and 99 2 respectively organic carbon usually plays an important role in traditional tn removal using heterotrophic denitrification during the experiment the effluent tn remained stable when c n fluctuated the lowest value was 3 3 the high nitrogen removal efficiency may be related to multiple denitrification pathways in the system the removal effect of tp is shown in fig 5c the tp concentration of the influent was 3 0 0 5 mg l and the average effluent concentration was 0 4 0 3 mg l an average removal rate of 86 0 was achieved indicating that the system had a satisfactory tp removal performance the fluctuating of cod did not affect the removal of tp which is related to the chemical phosphorus removal in the system the xrd results above show that fe2 produced by iron shavings reacts with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 which enhances phosphate removal fe2 are produced by iron shaving via fe c micro electrolysis fig 5d shows the tfe concentration of the effluent 0 1 0 1 mg l during the operation which indicated that the addition of waste iron shavings did not affect the effluent quality in addition during the experiment the highest concentration of tfe was 0 2 mg l which was not toxic to microorganisms 3 4 proposed mechanism combined with the structure and function of the microbes the performance of contaminant removal reactor operation mode and relevant data from previous studies 13 47 a comprehensive pollutant degradation path for the system was proposed fig 6 in anoxic zones micro electrolysis of iron shavings inside the fillers can produce a series of byproducts such as fe2 fe3 its crystals and other active substances beneficial for the removal of nitrogen phosphorus and organic matter for nitrogen removal three types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched in the reactor fe adb dechloromonas sphaerotilus hnadb ferribacterium zoogloea and hdb thauera unclassified rhodocyclaceae and acinetobacter fe2 and a low organic carbon promoted the enrichment of fe adb which can remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor without organic carbon source hnadb simultaneously removed nh4 n and no3 n achieving rapid and complete nitrogen removal and fe ad and hnad enhanced hdb for nitrogen removal based on the above deep nitrogen removal was achieved by synergistic degradation of denitrification types and the average removal rate of nh4 n and tn were 86 and 78 g m3 d respectively phosphorus removal is primarily achieved through biological and chemical processes and the average removal rate of tp was 77 g m3 d in addition effective organic removal capacity is also achieved and the average removal rate of cod was 690 g m3 d mineral analysis showed that the fe2 produced by the iron shavings combined with po4 3 to form fe3 po4 2 precipitation and alternate anaerobic aerobic conditions can achieve the biological removal of phosphorus 4 conclusions in this study a simple and effective method of wrapping waste iron shavings in polyurethane sponge cubes tied in anoxic zones was proposed to enrich multiple types of denitrifying bacteria for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment the results suggested that multiple types of denitrifying bacteria were enriched simultaneously in the system and the relative abundance of hnadb ferribacterium and zoogloea adb sphaerotilus and dechloromonas and hdb e g thauera uncultured denitratisoma sp and pseudomonas reached 23 47 40 06 7 83 8 71 and 10 60 11 95 respectively which is related to the addition of novel fillers the formation of sludge biofilm system and dissolved oxygen control fe adb can remove no3 n using fe2 as an electron donor produced by micro electrolysis of iron shavings without organic carbon demand hnadb achieved simultaneously nitrification and denitrification under aerobic conditions with higher efficiency and reaction rate the enrichment of these functional bacteria strengthened the nitrogen removal 87 4 even with low organic carbon in addition efficient phosphorus removal 86 0 was enhanced by the synergy of biological and chemical processes fe2 and po4 3 combine to form fe3 po4 2 precipitation moreover the formation of biofilms may slow passivation of iron shavings so that the micro electrolysis reaction can continue and the continuous rotation of the filler in anoxic zones caused filamentous bacteria constantly winding and enriching which controlled the sludge bulking even under low organic carbon in conclusion this study achieved the enrichment of multiple denitrifying bacteria with a simple and effective method which provides a new thought for advanced efficient and stable nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

12701,manganese mn ii is a common contaminant in groundwater resulting in substantial manganese oxides mnox in groundwater treatment sludge gts in this study gts was recycled to fabricate the alkali modified gts agts the kinetics and thermodynamics of mn ii removal and the efficiency of continuous mn ii removal by agts coated filter media were studied the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm models effectively described the removal behavior the maximum removal capacity obtained from the langmuir isotherm model was 26 39 mg g the column experiment results showed that the removal of mn ii 10 mg l by the agts coated filter media first goes through the initial adsorption and penetration process followed by the development of the catalytic oxidation ability finally realizing the continuous removal of 99 98 mn ii the column experiment achieved up to 120 51 mg g mn ii removal capacity by the thomas model and the catalytic oxidation rate constant is 0 0140 min 1 the characterization of the sludge particles revealed that agts had a rougher surface and massive oxygen containing functional groups through the electrical state x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses it was elucidated that the agts initially binds mn ii ions by adsorption and then oxidizes them into a new mnox layer to remove mn ii by long term catalytic oxidation the treated water was reliable and nearly no hazardous compounds were released this study provides a promising approach for recycling waste gts and fabricating mn ii removal filter media keywords manganese groundwater treatment sludge catalytic oxidation adsorption manganese active oxide film data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction manganese mn ii a crucial micronutrient and the twelfth most abundant element in the earth s crust is categorized as a secondary pollutant mn ii concentration in groundwater can be tens or hundreds of times that of surface water reaching the mg l unit and far exceeding the maximum allowable limit of mn content in drinking water recommended by the world health organization at 0 1 mg l 1 2 furthermore higher concentrations of mn ii can threaten human health by causing cell mutations and brain tissue damage and reducing fertility 3 4 hence mn ii must be effectively removed to ensure that groundwater is safe for drinking to date several methods including ion exchange adsorption biodegradation advanced oxidation and filtration have been studied to remove mn ii ions from water 5 7 filtration has been widely applied and studied for groundwater treatment owing to its simplicity and environmental friendliness 8 9 however conventional filtration technology has the disadvantages of a long start up time 3 6 months and low efficiency 7 in the conventional filtration process mn ii is co oxidized by microorganisms and auto catalytic mnox to gradually coat the filter media 9 10 therefore some studies have optimized the traditional filtering from these two aspects for biological processes recent studies have successfully combined membrane systems with other technologies e g biomimetic dynamic membrane bdm and aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor ags mbr 11 12 for catalytic oxidation processes studies have demonstrated that the addition of strong oxidants e g kmno4 o3 clo2 and naclo can produce mnox precoating on the surface of the filter medium thereby shortening the start up time and improving the catalytic oxidation efficiency 7 13 14 however using strong oxidants increases the treatment cost and the residual agents may pollute the environment therefore recent studies have proposed that coating mg oh 2 on granular materials is an alternative method 15 16 nonetheless this method is still not environmentally friendly owing to the consumption of additional chemicals therefore we attempted to find an easily accessible inexpensive mnox precoating according to previous research mn ii oxidation is mainly caused by mnox on the surface of the filter media 17 notably because of the high mn ii concentration in groundwater waste gts obtained by dewatering after groundwater treatment is rich in mnox 2 therefore waste gts may be a potential mnox precoating medium for mn removal currently most gts is landfilled as waste which pollutes the environment by increasing iron and manganese ion concentrations in water and soil surrounding the landfill and takes up valuable space 18 previous studies have established that gts possesses a high capacity for ion adsorption presents many surface pollutant adsorption sites and has a high adsorption rate owing to its complex material composition 19 considering these characteristics studies have investigated the removal of metals such as cadmium chromium and cobalt and non metals such as arsenic selenium and boron by gts 20 however to date there have been no studies on mn ii removal from gts therefore this study considered mnox rich gts as an alternative material for the filtration start up of mnox precoating for the first time gts in northwest china was used as the source material in the study first based on the analysis of the structural composition of gts gts was efficiently modified to remove mn ii from the water second the mechanism of and influencing factors of the modified gts for mn ii removal were investigated finally the modified gts was coated onto quartz sand filter media for column experiments to explore its potential for practical operation the objectives of this study are 1 to study the mn ii removal performance of waste gts and 2 prepare environmentally friendly mnox precoating with fewer chemicals 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagents were of analytical reagent grade and 18 2 mu pure water was used for the preparation of reagents manganese chloride tetrahydrate potassium pyrophosphate sodium acetate sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid hydrogen peroxide sodium chloride gts moisture content of 46 41 and actual water were sourced from a groundwater treatment plant in china the elemental composition is shown in table s1 2 2 preparation of modified sludge particles an alkali modification technique was used to create modified particles the modification method determined is shown in s1 2 gts was dried for 1 d in a vacuum drying oven at 298 15 k after 2 d of air drying using a grinder the cooled gts was ground into powder and gts of various sizes were separated using a sieve with a 150 μm mesh size gts were finally sealed after drying in a vacuum oven at 298 15 k for each experiment after screening the prepared gts 5 g were combined with 50 ml of 1 mol l naoh solution sonicated for 10 min at 298 15 k and shaken for 12 h at 298 15 k on a thermostatic oscillator 200 rpm to obtain alkali modified groundwater treatment sludge agts samples were washed with ultrapure water to near neutrality and conductivity of less than 20 μs cm and finally dried in a vacuum drying oven at 298 15 k for 12 h 2 3 batch adsorption experiments a certain amount of mncl2 solution was prepared then 50 ml of the solution was placed in a 150 ml conical flask and a specific mass concentration of agts was added and placed on a thermostatic shaker 160 rpm for a particular time the reaction solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and mn2 content was determined through a photometric method using potassium periodate to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results each experiment was repeated three times fig 1a the experimental conditions parameters and models are listed in s1 3 2 4 column experiments the modified particles were prepared by continuous stirring mud was prepared by adding 50 g of agts and 10 g of adhesive to 250 ml of pure water then 1 kg of quartz sand was combined with the mud and stirred for 24 h 25 c 100 rpm finally the filter media were air dried at 25 c for approximately 1 week agts coated quartz sand was prepared as a filter medium for column experiments the column experimental system used two plexiglas filter columns with an inner diameter of 52 mm filled with a filter media until a filling height of 15 cm and a filling volume of 318 6 ml at a flow rate of 33 ml min pure and actual water containing 10 mg l of mn ii were constantly delivered and the mn ii concentrations in the water entering and exiting were continually monitored fig 1b the formulas of kinetic column models are listed in s1 4 2 5 sample characterization the phase structure of sludge particles was determined using x ray diffraction xrd patterns the morphology and elemental distribution of the materials were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the functional groups of sludge particles were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir the elemental composition and atomic valence on the surface of sludge particles were observed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sludge before and after modification the sem images of sludge particles are shown in fig 2 after alkali modification the surface state and structural morphology of gts changed as shown in these images gts had a dense laminar structure with few pores fig 2a c agts surfaces and pores became looser and coarser fig 2d f furthermore compared to the smoother surface before modification agts had many microscopic particle bumps this phenomenon may be explained by the ion exchange between na in the alkali liquor and metal cations fe3 mg2 and ca2 in the sludge particles better treatment outcomes were obtained because rough surfaces increased the sludge particles specific surface area 21 nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms as well as the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distributions of sludge particles are depicted in fig 3 a and b the adsorption and desorption isotherms of the gts and agts in fig 3 a show a type iv isotherm with an h1 hysteresis loop these are the primary properties of mesoporous materials that aid contaminant adsorption 22 23 furthermore fig 3 b displays the bjh pore size distribution of the materials the pore size distribution of agts was broader 4 48 nm supporting mesoporous characteristics the surface area bet analysis of sludge particles is shown in table 1 the specific surface area of agts 23 33 m2 g was increased by 67 76 compared with that of gts 13 91 m2 g average pore size increased by 116 43 and pore volume increased by 113 33 this is mainly because na was exchanged into gts as an exchangeable cation during alkalization as a result because the ionic radius of na was less than that of fe3 mg2 and ca2 the aperture size expanded adequately and the pore volume improved further 24 25 the xrd patterns of the sludge particles are shown in fig 3 c sio2 jcpds 46 1045 is the most common crystalline structure in the sludge particles whereas the other metallic elements are mostly identified in the amorphous phases no additional diffraction peaks were observed for agts this result demonstrates that alkali modification did not affect the sludge particle structure the ftir spectra of the sludge particles are shown in fig 3 d the stretching vibration peak at 3423 cm 1 corresponds to the oh of the h2o molecule 26 27 whereas the asymmetric stretching vibration peak at 1637 cm 1 corresponds to the carboxyl co 28 the absorption peaks at 3423 and 1637 cm 1 are enhanced following alkali alteration suggesting the presence of oxygen containing functional groups the groups may be reactive groups for mn ii adsorption carbon hydrogen bonds are indicated by vibration peaks at 1440 cm 1 implying the presence of inorganic non metallic substances and organic matter the asymmetric stretching vibration peak at 1031 cm 1 was assigned to the bond between aluminum silicates and oxygen t o of the samples 29 30 the deformation of the t o bands can lead to various absorption peaks independent of the degree of crystallization of particles at wavenumbers ranging from 466 cm 1 to 791 cm 1 29 3 2 adsorption experiments in a batch system to understand the potential control steps of adsorption and adsorption mechanisms the adsorption kinetic model was used to study the movement process between agts and mn ii the kinetic models for mn ii adsorption on agts are shown in fig 4 and the parameters of the models are listed in table 2 comparing the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by the models in table 2 the r2 value of the pseudo second order pso model is 0 9994 greater than that for the other models and closer to 1 0 therefore mn ii adsorption by agts best matched the pso model based on the assumptions of the pso model the rate limiting factor for mn ii adsorption by agts is chemisorption to further evaluate the diffusion mechanism the intraparticle diffusion id kinetic model was fitted fig 4b the diagram shows that no linearly fitted straight line passes through the origin implying the functions of bulk and film diffusion must be considered 31 the plots of mn ii are multilinear with three linear zones that are classified as ki 1 ki 2 and ki 3 showing that three adsorption processes determine the removal of mn ii using agts 32 table 2 summarizes the rate constants for each region shown in fig 4 b bulk diffusion is the first region displayed on the left and this area has the most significant rate constant of 5 258 mg min1 2 g mn ii movement via the film around the components known as film diffusion takes longer in the second phase in the third region pore diffusion few adsorption sites remain on the adsorbent surface and the residual concentration of mn ii on the adsorbent surface in the solution reaches equilibrium resulting in a constant rate ki 3 that is almost zero 33 the adsorption equilibrium of mn ii on agts is achieved after approximately 50 min in summary pore diffusion is the dominant rate limiting step for removing mn ii on agts while bulk diffusion and film diffusion also affect the reaction rate 34 fig 5 a depicts how the initial mn ii concentration affected the agts adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of agts increases with the initial concentration and reaches a plateau at 60 mg l the above outcomes could be due to the increase in the mass transfer driving force caused by the rising initial mn ii content 35 the plateau behavior could be attributed to the saturation of all agts surface active sites which is consistent with prior studies 34 as seen in fig 5 a we calculated the experimental maximum adsorption capacities qe exp of agts to be 23 78 mg g 298 15 k 25 88 mg g 308 15 k and 27 62 mg g 318 15 k respectively the isotherms for mn ii adsorbed on agts are displayed in fig 5 b c d and e and the parameters of the models are listed in table 3 comparing the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by the models from the data listed in table 3 the r2 value of the langmuir model is 0 9948 which was higher than those of other models and closer to 1 0 indicating that the process of mn ii adsorption by agts fit well in the langmuir model based on the assumptions of the langmuir model it can be hypothesized that monolayer adsorption between mn ii and agts may exist 36 the theoretical values of the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity are 26 39 mg g 298 15 k 28 34 mg g 308 15 k and 29 94 mg g 318 15 k based on the langmuir model simulations which are not considerably different from the actual data of the experiments therefore this model can predict the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity as shown in fig 5 f all rl values are less than 1 indicating a strong affinity for mn ii the rl values decrease with increasing initial mn ii concentration at all temperatures indicating that higher pollutant concentrations favor adsorption the findings do not match the d r model well owing to the low correlation coefficient r2 values predicting adsorption mechanisms requires thermodynamic research the thermodynamic constants determined are listed in table 4 the δg values are negative at all temperatures indicating that the adsorption of mn ii by agts is spontaneous the δg values decrease as the temperature increase indicating that the adsorption capacity increase with temperature which is consistent with the rl results calculated using the langmuir isotherm model during the adsorption process positive δs values increase in randomness at the solid solution interface 37 a positive δh value indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic the above analysis indicates that the adsorption of mn ii by agts is a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process the regeneration studies are shown in fig s2 with successive increases in the intensity of hcl the regeneration and reusability further improved however following the addition of adsorption desorption cycles a substantial decrease in the regeneration rate of agts for mn ii is observed the reduction in regeneration and reusability are likely related to the agts protonation during desorption and the positive charge on the surface inhibits mn ii adsorption although the low hcl concentration exerts a more negligible effect on the structure the regeneration rate remains at 40 04 of the original adsorption capacity after five cycles as shown in fig s2 the adsorbent treated with the mixed solution of 0 01 mol l hcl and 0 001 mol l cacl2 during desorption has high regeneration and reusability and this high reusability could be maintained with a low concentration dosage this inconsistency may be due to ion exchange between a part of the adsorbed mn ii and ca ii during adsorption resulting in the desorption of a large amount of mn ii concurrently the low concentration of calcium ions does not occupy too many adsorption sites thus the regeneration rate of the adsorbent remains at 47 35 of the original adsorption after five adsorption desorption cycles of the agts the decrease in regeneration and reusability suggests that surface complexation or electrostatic interaction may be the agts adsorption mechanism for mn ii based on the above analysis the results suggest that agts can be regenerated and reused to treat mn ii ion contaminated aqueous solutions 3 3 performance of continuous manganese removal agts was coated on quartz sand filter media for the column experiments to explore its potential for practical operation fig 6 a illustrates the performance of the filter media in removing mn ii ions under varying water quality using agts coated filter media the concentration of the treated effluent when it reaches 90 and 10 of the starting concentration respectively is defined as the exhaustion and breakthrough time 27 the breakthrough times are 56 h pure water and 19 h actual water and the exhaustion times are 181 h pure water and 145 h actual water according to the findings breakthroughs and exhaustion occurred earlier when actual water was passed as metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe3 in actual water compete with mn ii for adsorption sites a longer mass transfer zone is needed to adsorb mn ii and the total amount of mn ii adsorbed by the filter media is reduced accordingly the most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison is that the concentration of the two columns started to decrease at 264 h pure water and 210 h actual water from 770 h pure water to 602 h actual water the incoming mn ii can be completely removed and the capability remain stable these results differ from previous findings in which the effluent concentration of the columns remained high after heavy metal adsorption was exhausted due to the high content of mnox in the agts mn ii in the water source undergoes catalytic oxidation on the filter media surface and is oxidized to mn iv by the dissolved oxygen in the water newly constituted mn iv forms an active filter membrane on the surface of the agts coated filter media which can adsorb and oxidize mn ii in aqueous solutions and form a new active filter membrane 9 multiple kinetic column models have been used to analyze the adsorption stage to build a column system especially one that could be implemented on an industrial scale fig 6b d and table 5 table 5 shows that the maximum mn ii removal capacity 120 51 mg g predicted by the thomas model is in good agreement with the experimental data 114 48 mg g from the parameters of the yoon nelson model it can be shown that the model predicts the time for half of the total adsorption to be 125 53 h pure water and 83 30 h actual water respectively the actual times to reach 50 breakthrough were 123 h pure water and 71 h actual water indicating that the yoon nelson model can better predict the filter media s adsorption time the thomas and yoon nelson models could be considerably useful for assessing mn ii transport and identifying the key parameters compared with the batch experiment the adsorption capacity of the column experiment is significantly improved which shows that the catalytic oxidation and adsorption synergistically remove mn ii during the filtration process in addition the catalytic oxidation rate constant is 0 0140 min 1 this data is similar to that of mnox formed by a strong oxidant 38 which further indicates that agts is a potential substitute material for mnox precoating the elements contained in the effluent of the pure water filter column at 1 h and 800 h were determined to verify the safety of the filter media table s3 except for a small amount of si and na contained in the quartz sand in the first hour no other ions are released verifying the safety and reliability of the filter media 3 4 exploration of the mechanism of mn ii removal from previous experiments the batch experiment verified that agts has superior adsorption capacity and the column experiment confirmed that agts has catalytic oxidation ability to further explore the mechanism of mn ii ion removal by agts we determined the adsorption mechanism based on the relationship between the surface electrical state and the influence of co existing ions furthermore the catalytic oxidation mechanism of the filter media was verified using sem eds and xps the impact of ph on mn ii ion adsorption was studied with agts in the ph range 2 7 fig 7a the results reveal that with a successive increase in the initial ph of the solution the amount of mn ii adsorption increased until ph 7 0 the point of zero charge phpzc or isoelectric point phiep is commonly used to describe the electrical status of a material s surface fig 7b and c phiep is the ph when the zeta potential at the shear plane is equal to zero fig 7b 39 phpzc is the ph at which the surface charge density equals zero fig 7c phpzc indicates the net total external and internal surface charge in contrast the phiep value indicates the external surface charge of the particles in the solution as shown in fig 7 b the phpzc of the produced agts adsorbent is 7 68 indicating that the surface of agts is negatively charged when the ph of the solution is more than 7 68 higher ph aids the electrostatic adsorption of mn ii 40 phpzc phiep indicates that the external agts surface has more negative charges than the internal agts surface at ph 7 0 the substantial removal of mn ii is due to the hydrolysis of mn ii ions resulting in a large amount of hydroxide precipitation thus we did not increase the ph of the adsorption medium beyond 7 0 according to the above findings the adsorption process occurs in a slightly acidic environment hence agts can be stable in an aqueous environment for an extended period coexisting ion experiments can verify the role of electrostatic interactions or ion exchange in the removal of mn ii fig s3 as depicted in fig s3 the adsorption is influenced to varying degrees by the different types of co existing cations and ionic strengths the adsorption capacities of na and k are almost unaffected at low ionic strengths and only slightly decrease at high ionic strengths however the adsorption capacities of divalent ions mg2 and ca2 decrease substantially at high ionic strengths the impact of ionic strength might explain the reduced mn ii adsorption the increased electrostatic interaction between the cation and agts surface decreases the adsorption effect 41 divalent cations competing with mn ii for the active sites in agts are the second most probable cause of mn ii removal reduction ca2 significantly reduces the effectiveness of mn ii removal than mg2 according to previous studies the impact of co existing ions is linearly proportional to the ionic radii 42 43 these findings further confirm that the mn ii adsorption mechanism by agts includes electrostatic interactions or ion exchange to verify the agts catalytic oxidation removal mechanism of mn ii sem images and eds spectra were used to analyze the changes in the surface structure composition of the agts coated filter media before and after the removal of mn ii ions fig 7d and g the surface of the filter media after long term filtration has a loose porous and fluffy texture in addition a spherical pleated superimposed filter layer owing to the accumulation of mnox is observed on the filter media fig 7d and g the manganese activated membrane is a porous mnox membrane that gradually covers the filter media s surface as filtration progresses the formation boosts the rate of mn ii mass transfer and oxidation and the spatial fold of the membrane which includes more active sites and promotes the reaction with mn ii fig 7 e and h show that once the filter media removed mn ii ions na and other ions decreased indicating ion exchange during the removal of mn ii ions furthermore the attachments evenly cover agts consistent with the langmuir model further demonstrating that mn ii ions on the agts surface exist in monolayers fig 7f and i according to previous studies mn oxidation state cycling among mn ii mn iii and mn iv is essential for catalytic oxidation 17 to explore the change of mn species during the column experiment we took 0 24 and 300 h of agts coated filter media for xps analysis as shown in fig 8 and table 6 these filter media correspond to two stages of the column experiment fig 6 the rapid increase stage 0 210 h for actual water and 0 264 h for pure water and steady decrease stage 210 800 h for actual water and 264 800 h for pure water it can be seen from fig 8 that mnox shows three peaks at 640 0 641 0 ev 642 1 642 5 ev and 644 9 645 2 ev attributed to mn ii mn iii and mn iv species respectively 44 in 0 24 h the total weight percentages of mn ii increased from 39 1 to 41 4 actual water and 43 2 pure water table 6 indicating that in the initial stage the filter media mainly removed mn ii through adsorption and interception fig 8 d and e show that the mn iii and mn iv species increases significantly while the percentages of mn ii decreased to 10 9 actual water and 6 4 pure water which proves that mnox is formed in situ on the surface of the filter media indicating that the removal of mn ii in the second stage is mainly through catalytic oxidation summarily agts first combines mn ii ions through adsorption in a short term and then forms a new mnox layer in situ which can continuously remove manganese ii through catalytic oxidation in a long term the ph and redox potential eh data for filter media were plotted in a ph eh map fig s4 the ph and eh data of the initial filter media 1 were in the region of mn oh 2 and the ph and eh data of the filter media after mn ii removal 2 and 3 were in the region of mn3o4 and mn2o3 thus this result was consistent with that of xps agts has a unique catalytic oxidation potential owing to the presence of various hydrated oxides exceptionally high in iron mnox meanwhile alkali modification increases the specific surface area of agts and introduces oxygen containing functional groups that negatively charge the agts surface allowing the presence of various adsorption exchange sites based on previous experimental data as outlined in fig 9 it is understood that the mechanism of mn removal includes adsorption and catalytic oxidation from the coexisting ion experiments mn ii removal can be carried out by ion exchange where each mn ii can exchange two na ions or other metal ions in agts fig s3 from kinetic analysis mn ii removal may also be through the rough pores of agts surface and complexation of mn ii with oxidized groups on the surface of agts fig 4 45 46 from the surface electrical state experiments a considerable increase in the adsorption capacity was recorded following ph addition therefore it can be assumed that the possible deprotonation of the adsorption sites of agts causes electrostatic interactions of mn ii with negatively charged groups ao and coo fig 7a b and c 47 notably the agts coated filter media first rapidly adsorbed mn ii through the three mechanisms described above followed by the contact catalysis of mno2 mh2o in agts to oxidize mn ii by dissolved oxygen in the water subsequently generating new mno2 mh2o and continuing the catalytic oxidation for mn ii removal fig 6 48 the sem and eds analyses also directly verify the formation of mnox fig 7d i furthermore xps analysis shows that mn species on the surface of agts have appeared two stages in which mn ii and mn iii are dominant respectively these two stages correspond to adsorption and catalytic oxidation respectively fig 8 agts first combines mn ii on the surface through adsorption surface complexation electrostatic interactions ion exchange at the initial stage and then forms a new mnox layer which further boosts mn ii removal through catalytic oxidation catalytic oxidation is the main mechanism of agts for long term mn ii removal 3 5 comparison of current and prospective technologies the maximum adsorption capacity qm of agts for the removal of mn ii ions was compared with previous studies tables 7 and 8 agts has relatively higher qm values than most listed adsorbents an important highlight in this study is that the removal capacity of agts coated filter media is no longer limited to adsorption saturation but continuous catalytic oxidation this indicates that the agts coated filter media is a promising and relevant candidate and is a sustainable material for removing mn ii from water the filter media may have the following applications 1 industrial waterworks such as metallurgy printing and mining and 2 small country sites waterworks in addition a previous study found that the simultaneous application of chlorine and powdered activated carbon pac to the inlet water of waterworks can provide long lasting removal of mn ii 63 therefore agts powder with better mn ii adsorption capacity can replace pac and improve the efficiency of mn ii removal in the pre oxidation process as waste from groundwater plants gts is available in large quantities and easily accessible therefore it is highly feasible and operable that agts coated filter media can be made after simple modification and mechanical mixing besides the recycling of gts contributes to the reduction of the environmental burden future research will evaluate the economic feasibility of agts and optimize the preparation method of agts coated filter media to obtain better economic and application prospects 4 conclusion in this study waste gts was recycled for alkali modification to fabricate the agts and adopted to remove mn ii from water the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm models effectively described the removal behavior the thomas and yoon nelson models could be essentially useful for identifying the key parameters of the column system the maximum removal capacity of agts batch experiments obtained from the langmuir isotherm model was 26 39 mg g and that obtained from the column experiments obtained using the thomas model was 120 51 mg g the column experiment of agts coated filter media can achieve 99 98 continuous removal of mn ii 10 mg l through sem xrd bet and ftir it was found that the greater specific surface area larger pore volume and oxygen containing functional groups after alkali alteration of agts were primarily responsible for its improved removal effectiveness as verified by the electrical state xps sem and eds analyses the agts can remove mn ii efficiently by integrating adsorption followed by catalytic oxidation therefore it can be concluded that agts is a promising mnox precoating medium for the removal of mn ii from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12701,manganese mn ii is a common contaminant in groundwater resulting in substantial manganese oxides mnox in groundwater treatment sludge gts in this study gts was recycled to fabricate the alkali modified gts agts the kinetics and thermodynamics of mn ii removal and the efficiency of continuous mn ii removal by agts coated filter media were studied the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm models effectively described the removal behavior the maximum removal capacity obtained from the langmuir isotherm model was 26 39 mg g the column experiment results showed that the removal of mn ii 10 mg l by the agts coated filter media first goes through the initial adsorption and penetration process followed by the development of the catalytic oxidation ability finally realizing the continuous removal of 99 98 mn ii the column experiment achieved up to 120 51 mg g mn ii removal capacity by the thomas model and the catalytic oxidation rate constant is 0 0140 min 1 the characterization of the sludge particles revealed that agts had a rougher surface and massive oxygen containing functional groups through the electrical state x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and scanning electron microscopy sem analyses it was elucidated that the agts initially binds mn ii ions by adsorption and then oxidizes them into a new mnox layer to remove mn ii by long term catalytic oxidation the treated water was reliable and nearly no hazardous compounds were released this study provides a promising approach for recycling waste gts and fabricating mn ii removal filter media keywords manganese groundwater treatment sludge catalytic oxidation adsorption manganese active oxide film data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction manganese mn ii a crucial micronutrient and the twelfth most abundant element in the earth s crust is categorized as a secondary pollutant mn ii concentration in groundwater can be tens or hundreds of times that of surface water reaching the mg l unit and far exceeding the maximum allowable limit of mn content in drinking water recommended by the world health organization at 0 1 mg l 1 2 furthermore higher concentrations of mn ii can threaten human health by causing cell mutations and brain tissue damage and reducing fertility 3 4 hence mn ii must be effectively removed to ensure that groundwater is safe for drinking to date several methods including ion exchange adsorption biodegradation advanced oxidation and filtration have been studied to remove mn ii ions from water 5 7 filtration has been widely applied and studied for groundwater treatment owing to its simplicity and environmental friendliness 8 9 however conventional filtration technology has the disadvantages of a long start up time 3 6 months and low efficiency 7 in the conventional filtration process mn ii is co oxidized by microorganisms and auto catalytic mnox to gradually coat the filter media 9 10 therefore some studies have optimized the traditional filtering from these two aspects for biological processes recent studies have successfully combined membrane systems with other technologies e g biomimetic dynamic membrane bdm and aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor ags mbr 11 12 for catalytic oxidation processes studies have demonstrated that the addition of strong oxidants e g kmno4 o3 clo2 and naclo can produce mnox precoating on the surface of the filter medium thereby shortening the start up time and improving the catalytic oxidation efficiency 7 13 14 however using strong oxidants increases the treatment cost and the residual agents may pollute the environment therefore recent studies have proposed that coating mg oh 2 on granular materials is an alternative method 15 16 nonetheless this method is still not environmentally friendly owing to the consumption of additional chemicals therefore we attempted to find an easily accessible inexpensive mnox precoating according to previous research mn ii oxidation is mainly caused by mnox on the surface of the filter media 17 notably because of the high mn ii concentration in groundwater waste gts obtained by dewatering after groundwater treatment is rich in mnox 2 therefore waste gts may be a potential mnox precoating medium for mn removal currently most gts is landfilled as waste which pollutes the environment by increasing iron and manganese ion concentrations in water and soil surrounding the landfill and takes up valuable space 18 previous studies have established that gts possesses a high capacity for ion adsorption presents many surface pollutant adsorption sites and has a high adsorption rate owing to its complex material composition 19 considering these characteristics studies have investigated the removal of metals such as cadmium chromium and cobalt and non metals such as arsenic selenium and boron by gts 20 however to date there have been no studies on mn ii removal from gts therefore this study considered mnox rich gts as an alternative material for the filtration start up of mnox precoating for the first time gts in northwest china was used as the source material in the study first based on the analysis of the structural composition of gts gts was efficiently modified to remove mn ii from the water second the mechanism of and influencing factors of the modified gts for mn ii removal were investigated finally the modified gts was coated onto quartz sand filter media for column experiments to explore its potential for practical operation the objectives of this study are 1 to study the mn ii removal performance of waste gts and 2 prepare environmentally friendly mnox precoating with fewer chemicals 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all reagents were of analytical reagent grade and 18 2 mu pure water was used for the preparation of reagents manganese chloride tetrahydrate potassium pyrophosphate sodium acetate sodium hydroxide hydrochloric acid hydrogen peroxide sodium chloride gts moisture content of 46 41 and actual water were sourced from a groundwater treatment plant in china the elemental composition is shown in table s1 2 2 preparation of modified sludge particles an alkali modification technique was used to create modified particles the modification method determined is shown in s1 2 gts was dried for 1 d in a vacuum drying oven at 298 15 k after 2 d of air drying using a grinder the cooled gts was ground into powder and gts of various sizes were separated using a sieve with a 150 μm mesh size gts were finally sealed after drying in a vacuum oven at 298 15 k for each experiment after screening the prepared gts 5 g were combined with 50 ml of 1 mol l naoh solution sonicated for 10 min at 298 15 k and shaken for 12 h at 298 15 k on a thermostatic oscillator 200 rpm to obtain alkali modified groundwater treatment sludge agts samples were washed with ultrapure water to near neutrality and conductivity of less than 20 μs cm and finally dried in a vacuum drying oven at 298 15 k for 12 h 2 3 batch adsorption experiments a certain amount of mncl2 solution was prepared then 50 ml of the solution was placed in a 150 ml conical flask and a specific mass concentration of agts was added and placed on a thermostatic shaker 160 rpm for a particular time the reaction solution was filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane and mn2 content was determined through a photometric method using potassium periodate to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results each experiment was repeated three times fig 1a the experimental conditions parameters and models are listed in s1 3 2 4 column experiments the modified particles were prepared by continuous stirring mud was prepared by adding 50 g of agts and 10 g of adhesive to 250 ml of pure water then 1 kg of quartz sand was combined with the mud and stirred for 24 h 25 c 100 rpm finally the filter media were air dried at 25 c for approximately 1 week agts coated quartz sand was prepared as a filter medium for column experiments the column experimental system used two plexiglas filter columns with an inner diameter of 52 mm filled with a filter media until a filling height of 15 cm and a filling volume of 318 6 ml at a flow rate of 33 ml min pure and actual water containing 10 mg l of mn ii were constantly delivered and the mn ii concentrations in the water entering and exiting were continually monitored fig 1b the formulas of kinetic column models are listed in s1 4 2 5 sample characterization the phase structure of sludge particles was determined using x ray diffraction xrd patterns the morphology and elemental distribution of the materials were observed using scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds the functional groups of sludge particles were analyzed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir the elemental composition and atomic valence on the surface of sludge particles were observed using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of sludge before and after modification the sem images of sludge particles are shown in fig 2 after alkali modification the surface state and structural morphology of gts changed as shown in these images gts had a dense laminar structure with few pores fig 2a c agts surfaces and pores became looser and coarser fig 2d f furthermore compared to the smoother surface before modification agts had many microscopic particle bumps this phenomenon may be explained by the ion exchange between na in the alkali liquor and metal cations fe3 mg2 and ca2 in the sludge particles better treatment outcomes were obtained because rough surfaces increased the sludge particles specific surface area 21 nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms as well as the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distributions of sludge particles are depicted in fig 3 a and b the adsorption and desorption isotherms of the gts and agts in fig 3 a show a type iv isotherm with an h1 hysteresis loop these are the primary properties of mesoporous materials that aid contaminant adsorption 22 23 furthermore fig 3 b displays the bjh pore size distribution of the materials the pore size distribution of agts was broader 4 48 nm supporting mesoporous characteristics the surface area bet analysis of sludge particles is shown in table 1 the specific surface area of agts 23 33 m2 g was increased by 67 76 compared with that of gts 13 91 m2 g average pore size increased by 116 43 and pore volume increased by 113 33 this is mainly because na was exchanged into gts as an exchangeable cation during alkalization as a result because the ionic radius of na was less than that of fe3 mg2 and ca2 the aperture size expanded adequately and the pore volume improved further 24 25 the xrd patterns of the sludge particles are shown in fig 3 c sio2 jcpds 46 1045 is the most common crystalline structure in the sludge particles whereas the other metallic elements are mostly identified in the amorphous phases no additional diffraction peaks were observed for agts this result demonstrates that alkali modification did not affect the sludge particle structure the ftir spectra of the sludge particles are shown in fig 3 d the stretching vibration peak at 3423 cm 1 corresponds to the oh of the h2o molecule 26 27 whereas the asymmetric stretching vibration peak at 1637 cm 1 corresponds to the carboxyl co 28 the absorption peaks at 3423 and 1637 cm 1 are enhanced following alkali alteration suggesting the presence of oxygen containing functional groups the groups may be reactive groups for mn ii adsorption carbon hydrogen bonds are indicated by vibration peaks at 1440 cm 1 implying the presence of inorganic non metallic substances and organic matter the asymmetric stretching vibration peak at 1031 cm 1 was assigned to the bond between aluminum silicates and oxygen t o of the samples 29 30 the deformation of the t o bands can lead to various absorption peaks independent of the degree of crystallization of particles at wavenumbers ranging from 466 cm 1 to 791 cm 1 29 3 2 adsorption experiments in a batch system to understand the potential control steps of adsorption and adsorption mechanisms the adsorption kinetic model was used to study the movement process between agts and mn ii the kinetic models for mn ii adsorption on agts are shown in fig 4 and the parameters of the models are listed in table 2 comparing the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by the models in table 2 the r2 value of the pseudo second order pso model is 0 9994 greater than that for the other models and closer to 1 0 therefore mn ii adsorption by agts best matched the pso model based on the assumptions of the pso model the rate limiting factor for mn ii adsorption by agts is chemisorption to further evaluate the diffusion mechanism the intraparticle diffusion id kinetic model was fitted fig 4b the diagram shows that no linearly fitted straight line passes through the origin implying the functions of bulk and film diffusion must be considered 31 the plots of mn ii are multilinear with three linear zones that are classified as ki 1 ki 2 and ki 3 showing that three adsorption processes determine the removal of mn ii using agts 32 table 2 summarizes the rate constants for each region shown in fig 4 b bulk diffusion is the first region displayed on the left and this area has the most significant rate constant of 5 258 mg min1 2 g mn ii movement via the film around the components known as film diffusion takes longer in the second phase in the third region pore diffusion few adsorption sites remain on the adsorbent surface and the residual concentration of mn ii on the adsorbent surface in the solution reaches equilibrium resulting in a constant rate ki 3 that is almost zero 33 the adsorption equilibrium of mn ii on agts is achieved after approximately 50 min in summary pore diffusion is the dominant rate limiting step for removing mn ii on agts while bulk diffusion and film diffusion also affect the reaction rate 34 fig 5 a depicts how the initial mn ii concentration affected the agts adsorption capacity the adsorption capacity of agts increases with the initial concentration and reaches a plateau at 60 mg l the above outcomes could be due to the increase in the mass transfer driving force caused by the rising initial mn ii content 35 the plateau behavior could be attributed to the saturation of all agts surface active sites which is consistent with prior studies 34 as seen in fig 5 a we calculated the experimental maximum adsorption capacities qe exp of agts to be 23 78 mg g 298 15 k 25 88 mg g 308 15 k and 27 62 mg g 318 15 k respectively the isotherms for mn ii adsorbed on agts are displayed in fig 5 b c d and e and the parameters of the models are listed in table 3 comparing the correlation coefficients r2 fitted by the models from the data listed in table 3 the r2 value of the langmuir model is 0 9948 which was higher than those of other models and closer to 1 0 indicating that the process of mn ii adsorption by agts fit well in the langmuir model based on the assumptions of the langmuir model it can be hypothesized that monolayer adsorption between mn ii and agts may exist 36 the theoretical values of the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity are 26 39 mg g 298 15 k 28 34 mg g 308 15 k and 29 94 mg g 318 15 k based on the langmuir model simulations which are not considerably different from the actual data of the experiments therefore this model can predict the maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity as shown in fig 5 f all rl values are less than 1 indicating a strong affinity for mn ii the rl values decrease with increasing initial mn ii concentration at all temperatures indicating that higher pollutant concentrations favor adsorption the findings do not match the d r model well owing to the low correlation coefficient r2 values predicting adsorption mechanisms requires thermodynamic research the thermodynamic constants determined are listed in table 4 the δg values are negative at all temperatures indicating that the adsorption of mn ii by agts is spontaneous the δg values decrease as the temperature increase indicating that the adsorption capacity increase with temperature which is consistent with the rl results calculated using the langmuir isotherm model during the adsorption process positive δs values increase in randomness at the solid solution interface 37 a positive δh value indicates that the adsorption process is endothermic the above analysis indicates that the adsorption of mn ii by agts is a spontaneous and endothermic adsorption process the regeneration studies are shown in fig s2 with successive increases in the intensity of hcl the regeneration and reusability further improved however following the addition of adsorption desorption cycles a substantial decrease in the regeneration rate of agts for mn ii is observed the reduction in regeneration and reusability are likely related to the agts protonation during desorption and the positive charge on the surface inhibits mn ii adsorption although the low hcl concentration exerts a more negligible effect on the structure the regeneration rate remains at 40 04 of the original adsorption capacity after five cycles as shown in fig s2 the adsorbent treated with the mixed solution of 0 01 mol l hcl and 0 001 mol l cacl2 during desorption has high regeneration and reusability and this high reusability could be maintained with a low concentration dosage this inconsistency may be due to ion exchange between a part of the adsorbed mn ii and ca ii during adsorption resulting in the desorption of a large amount of mn ii concurrently the low concentration of calcium ions does not occupy too many adsorption sites thus the regeneration rate of the adsorbent remains at 47 35 of the original adsorption after five adsorption desorption cycles of the agts the decrease in regeneration and reusability suggests that surface complexation or electrostatic interaction may be the agts adsorption mechanism for mn ii based on the above analysis the results suggest that agts can be regenerated and reused to treat mn ii ion contaminated aqueous solutions 3 3 performance of continuous manganese removal agts was coated on quartz sand filter media for the column experiments to explore its potential for practical operation fig 6 a illustrates the performance of the filter media in removing mn ii ions under varying water quality using agts coated filter media the concentration of the treated effluent when it reaches 90 and 10 of the starting concentration respectively is defined as the exhaustion and breakthrough time 27 the breakthrough times are 56 h pure water and 19 h actual water and the exhaustion times are 181 h pure water and 145 h actual water according to the findings breakthroughs and exhaustion occurred earlier when actual water was passed as metal ions such as ca2 mg2 and fe3 in actual water compete with mn ii for adsorption sites a longer mass transfer zone is needed to adsorb mn ii and the total amount of mn ii adsorbed by the filter media is reduced accordingly the most striking observation to emerge from the data comparison is that the concentration of the two columns started to decrease at 264 h pure water and 210 h actual water from 770 h pure water to 602 h actual water the incoming mn ii can be completely removed and the capability remain stable these results differ from previous findings in which the effluent concentration of the columns remained high after heavy metal adsorption was exhausted due to the high content of mnox in the agts mn ii in the water source undergoes catalytic oxidation on the filter media surface and is oxidized to mn iv by the dissolved oxygen in the water newly constituted mn iv forms an active filter membrane on the surface of the agts coated filter media which can adsorb and oxidize mn ii in aqueous solutions and form a new active filter membrane 9 multiple kinetic column models have been used to analyze the adsorption stage to build a column system especially one that could be implemented on an industrial scale fig 6b d and table 5 table 5 shows that the maximum mn ii removal capacity 120 51 mg g predicted by the thomas model is in good agreement with the experimental data 114 48 mg g from the parameters of the yoon nelson model it can be shown that the model predicts the time for half of the total adsorption to be 125 53 h pure water and 83 30 h actual water respectively the actual times to reach 50 breakthrough were 123 h pure water and 71 h actual water indicating that the yoon nelson model can better predict the filter media s adsorption time the thomas and yoon nelson models could be considerably useful for assessing mn ii transport and identifying the key parameters compared with the batch experiment the adsorption capacity of the column experiment is significantly improved which shows that the catalytic oxidation and adsorption synergistically remove mn ii during the filtration process in addition the catalytic oxidation rate constant is 0 0140 min 1 this data is similar to that of mnox formed by a strong oxidant 38 which further indicates that agts is a potential substitute material for mnox precoating the elements contained in the effluent of the pure water filter column at 1 h and 800 h were determined to verify the safety of the filter media table s3 except for a small amount of si and na contained in the quartz sand in the first hour no other ions are released verifying the safety and reliability of the filter media 3 4 exploration of the mechanism of mn ii removal from previous experiments the batch experiment verified that agts has superior adsorption capacity and the column experiment confirmed that agts has catalytic oxidation ability to further explore the mechanism of mn ii ion removal by agts we determined the adsorption mechanism based on the relationship between the surface electrical state and the influence of co existing ions furthermore the catalytic oxidation mechanism of the filter media was verified using sem eds and xps the impact of ph on mn ii ion adsorption was studied with agts in the ph range 2 7 fig 7a the results reveal that with a successive increase in the initial ph of the solution the amount of mn ii adsorption increased until ph 7 0 the point of zero charge phpzc or isoelectric point phiep is commonly used to describe the electrical status of a material s surface fig 7b and c phiep is the ph when the zeta potential at the shear plane is equal to zero fig 7b 39 phpzc is the ph at which the surface charge density equals zero fig 7c phpzc indicates the net total external and internal surface charge in contrast the phiep value indicates the external surface charge of the particles in the solution as shown in fig 7 b the phpzc of the produced agts adsorbent is 7 68 indicating that the surface of agts is negatively charged when the ph of the solution is more than 7 68 higher ph aids the electrostatic adsorption of mn ii 40 phpzc phiep indicates that the external agts surface has more negative charges than the internal agts surface at ph 7 0 the substantial removal of mn ii is due to the hydrolysis of mn ii ions resulting in a large amount of hydroxide precipitation thus we did not increase the ph of the adsorption medium beyond 7 0 according to the above findings the adsorption process occurs in a slightly acidic environment hence agts can be stable in an aqueous environment for an extended period coexisting ion experiments can verify the role of electrostatic interactions or ion exchange in the removal of mn ii fig s3 as depicted in fig s3 the adsorption is influenced to varying degrees by the different types of co existing cations and ionic strengths the adsorption capacities of na and k are almost unaffected at low ionic strengths and only slightly decrease at high ionic strengths however the adsorption capacities of divalent ions mg2 and ca2 decrease substantially at high ionic strengths the impact of ionic strength might explain the reduced mn ii adsorption the increased electrostatic interaction between the cation and agts surface decreases the adsorption effect 41 divalent cations competing with mn ii for the active sites in agts are the second most probable cause of mn ii removal reduction ca2 significantly reduces the effectiveness of mn ii removal than mg2 according to previous studies the impact of co existing ions is linearly proportional to the ionic radii 42 43 these findings further confirm that the mn ii adsorption mechanism by agts includes electrostatic interactions or ion exchange to verify the agts catalytic oxidation removal mechanism of mn ii sem images and eds spectra were used to analyze the changes in the surface structure composition of the agts coated filter media before and after the removal of mn ii ions fig 7d and g the surface of the filter media after long term filtration has a loose porous and fluffy texture in addition a spherical pleated superimposed filter layer owing to the accumulation of mnox is observed on the filter media fig 7d and g the manganese activated membrane is a porous mnox membrane that gradually covers the filter media s surface as filtration progresses the formation boosts the rate of mn ii mass transfer and oxidation and the spatial fold of the membrane which includes more active sites and promotes the reaction with mn ii fig 7 e and h show that once the filter media removed mn ii ions na and other ions decreased indicating ion exchange during the removal of mn ii ions furthermore the attachments evenly cover agts consistent with the langmuir model further demonstrating that mn ii ions on the agts surface exist in monolayers fig 7f and i according to previous studies mn oxidation state cycling among mn ii mn iii and mn iv is essential for catalytic oxidation 17 to explore the change of mn species during the column experiment we took 0 24 and 300 h of agts coated filter media for xps analysis as shown in fig 8 and table 6 these filter media correspond to two stages of the column experiment fig 6 the rapid increase stage 0 210 h for actual water and 0 264 h for pure water and steady decrease stage 210 800 h for actual water and 264 800 h for pure water it can be seen from fig 8 that mnox shows three peaks at 640 0 641 0 ev 642 1 642 5 ev and 644 9 645 2 ev attributed to mn ii mn iii and mn iv species respectively 44 in 0 24 h the total weight percentages of mn ii increased from 39 1 to 41 4 actual water and 43 2 pure water table 6 indicating that in the initial stage the filter media mainly removed mn ii through adsorption and interception fig 8 d and e show that the mn iii and mn iv species increases significantly while the percentages of mn ii decreased to 10 9 actual water and 6 4 pure water which proves that mnox is formed in situ on the surface of the filter media indicating that the removal of mn ii in the second stage is mainly through catalytic oxidation summarily agts first combines mn ii ions through adsorption in a short term and then forms a new mnox layer in situ which can continuously remove manganese ii through catalytic oxidation in a long term the ph and redox potential eh data for filter media were plotted in a ph eh map fig s4 the ph and eh data of the initial filter media 1 were in the region of mn oh 2 and the ph and eh data of the filter media after mn ii removal 2 and 3 were in the region of mn3o4 and mn2o3 thus this result was consistent with that of xps agts has a unique catalytic oxidation potential owing to the presence of various hydrated oxides exceptionally high in iron mnox meanwhile alkali modification increases the specific surface area of agts and introduces oxygen containing functional groups that negatively charge the agts surface allowing the presence of various adsorption exchange sites based on previous experimental data as outlined in fig 9 it is understood that the mechanism of mn removal includes adsorption and catalytic oxidation from the coexisting ion experiments mn ii removal can be carried out by ion exchange where each mn ii can exchange two na ions or other metal ions in agts fig s3 from kinetic analysis mn ii removal may also be through the rough pores of agts surface and complexation of mn ii with oxidized groups on the surface of agts fig 4 45 46 from the surface electrical state experiments a considerable increase in the adsorption capacity was recorded following ph addition therefore it can be assumed that the possible deprotonation of the adsorption sites of agts causes electrostatic interactions of mn ii with negatively charged groups ao and coo fig 7a b and c 47 notably the agts coated filter media first rapidly adsorbed mn ii through the three mechanisms described above followed by the contact catalysis of mno2 mh2o in agts to oxidize mn ii by dissolved oxygen in the water subsequently generating new mno2 mh2o and continuing the catalytic oxidation for mn ii removal fig 6 48 the sem and eds analyses also directly verify the formation of mnox fig 7d i furthermore xps analysis shows that mn species on the surface of agts have appeared two stages in which mn ii and mn iii are dominant respectively these two stages correspond to adsorption and catalytic oxidation respectively fig 8 agts first combines mn ii on the surface through adsorption surface complexation electrostatic interactions ion exchange at the initial stage and then forms a new mnox layer which further boosts mn ii removal through catalytic oxidation catalytic oxidation is the main mechanism of agts for long term mn ii removal 3 5 comparison of current and prospective technologies the maximum adsorption capacity qm of agts for the removal of mn ii ions was compared with previous studies tables 7 and 8 agts has relatively higher qm values than most listed adsorbents an important highlight in this study is that the removal capacity of agts coated filter media is no longer limited to adsorption saturation but continuous catalytic oxidation this indicates that the agts coated filter media is a promising and relevant candidate and is a sustainable material for removing mn ii from water the filter media may have the following applications 1 industrial waterworks such as metallurgy printing and mining and 2 small country sites waterworks in addition a previous study found that the simultaneous application of chlorine and powdered activated carbon pac to the inlet water of waterworks can provide long lasting removal of mn ii 63 therefore agts powder with better mn ii adsorption capacity can replace pac and improve the efficiency of mn ii removal in the pre oxidation process as waste from groundwater plants gts is available in large quantities and easily accessible therefore it is highly feasible and operable that agts coated filter media can be made after simple modification and mechanical mixing besides the recycling of gts contributes to the reduction of the environmental burden future research will evaluate the economic feasibility of agts and optimize the preparation method of agts coated filter media to obtain better economic and application prospects 4 conclusion in this study waste gts was recycled for alkali modification to fabricate the agts and adopted to remove mn ii from water the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir isotherm models effectively described the removal behavior the thomas and yoon nelson models could be essentially useful for identifying the key parameters of the column system the maximum removal capacity of agts batch experiments obtained from the langmuir isotherm model was 26 39 mg g and that obtained from the column experiments obtained using the thomas model was 120 51 mg g the column experiment of agts coated filter media can achieve 99 98 continuous removal of mn ii 10 mg l through sem xrd bet and ftir it was found that the greater specific surface area larger pore volume and oxygen containing functional groups after alkali alteration of agts were primarily responsible for its improved removal effectiveness as verified by the electrical state xps sem and eds analyses the agts can remove mn ii efficiently by integrating adsorption followed by catalytic oxidation therefore it can be concluded that agts is a promising mnox precoating medium for the removal of mn ii from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

12702,the effect of anaerobic sludge digestion on the isolation of dna and clean up efficiency of obtained dna isolates was studied influent and digestate of a continuous full scale reactor were sampled twice also batch digesters were operated at 35 45 and 55 c namely and 35 and 45 and and 55 the batch reactors were sampled at 3 to 4 day time intervals during the digestion a sharp decline in the extraction yield was observed over time for the batch reactors in and 55 the extraction yield declined by 96 in 12 days the purity of the dna isolates was assessed by purity ratios which included absorption at 260 nm to that at 280 nm abs260 280 and to that at 230 nm abs260 230 abs260 230 before clean up declined as a result of digestion in all reactors the most severe case being and 55 decreasing from 1 91 to 0 47 in nine days the efficiency of clean up was evaluated by analysing dna recovery and changes in the purity ratios and 35 and the full scale reactor had the highest recoveries 80 furthermore a 4 1 fold increase was observed in abs260 230 additionally non linear correlations were found between purity parameters and the dna concentration r2 0 7 the observations of the current investigation strongly indicate that the change in dna extraction yield was at least partly due to the change in dna extraction efficiency and not just the change in the actual dna content this is an important consideration for the quantification of biomass specific genes and microbial populations where dna isolation plays a key role graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge anaerobic digestion dna yield recovery purity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction suspended solids removed during wastewater treatment processes constitute sludge due to its high polluting potential sludge has to be treated in a suitable way a widely used process to treat sludge is anaerobic digestion which is employed under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions 1 dna isolation from sludge can be used for measuring sludge biomass 2 3 determination of the actual sludge biomass is important for estimating the actual biomass content of volatile suspended solids a parameter that is crucial for research design and operation of anaerobic digesters 4 5 in addition dna isolation is central to the enumeration of specific genes 6 7 a common technique used for the detection and quantification of genes is quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr 8 9 the quality of dna isolates should meet a certain level in order to be used for downstream qpcr assays the isolate quality can be explained by the mass of dna obtained per mass of the sample as well as two purity check ratios they include abs260 280 and abs260 230 absorbance value at 260 nm divided by that at 280 nm and 230 nm respectively when exposed to uv rays dna molecules show a characteristic absorbance peak at 260 nm the presence of proteins and phenolics is represented by absorptions at 280 and 230 nm respectively which are considered contaminants that decrease the purity of the dna isolate the purity ratios are recommended to be 1 8 8 yet dna isolates with purity ratios below this level often occur 10 11 dna exists as part of the suspended matter of sludge although some are also found as free floating dna 12 14 dna isolation consists of two major steps release of intracellular dna and purification the former which is also called extraction includes the destruction of the cell walls of the dna containing organisms and the disintegration of the matrix structure in which extracellular dna is embedded in the second step the released intracellular dna together with free floating dna is separated from unwanted compounds 12 14 numerous dna isolation procedures have been employed to find the one that would be most suitable for particular types of study 15 16 working on a wide variety of samples including wastewater sludge kuhn et al 11 used 10 different approaches with several physical and chemical methods to extract dna and then purified the extracted dna by applying isopropanol and ethanol containing solutions in the same line hashemi shahraki et al 15 used a series of lysis buffers and physical methods to determine the most efficient way of acquiring dna from water samples it is plausible that some impurities especially when their concentration is high evade dna purification steps and find their way into the final dna isolates the quality of such dna isolates can be further improved by removing the impurities through a clean up process which is conducted using commercial kits 16 17 the mass of dna after clean up is a fraction of that before clean up the efficiency of the aforementioned process might also be affected by the impurities that are likely to exist in dna isolates as summarized above dna isolation is a result of various chemical and physical processes in which the dna containing entities undergo intense alterations chemical and physical properties e g proteins and solids concentrations of sludge vary with the progression and temperature of anaerobic digestion 4 18 these variations caused by the activities of the bacteria involved might interfere with the dna isolation and clean up processes apart from that the composition of the microbial community changes during digestion 19 20 which might affect dna isolation efficiency although the contribution from microbial community changes is recognized it is not likely to play a significant role hence the effects of microbial community changes on dna isolation and clean up are not within the scope of the current investigation there has been informative research on the isolation of dna from wastewater sludge 21 22 and the clean up of the isolated dna 23 yet there is a gap in the literature as to whether the quality of dna isolation and clean up change during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge this issue is paramount to making reasonable comparisons between the extracted dna of different sludge samples from the same or different anaerobic digesters especially when the absolute quantity of particular genes 24 26 is of interest this study hypothesizes that the quality of dna isolation and clean up is negatively affected by the progression of sludge digestion and that the operating temperature of the digestion process plays an important role in order to reveal the effect s of digestion time and temperature on the efficiency of dna isolation and clean up a systematic experimental approach is required which necessitates comprehensive statistical analyses of the obtained data and mass balance on dna recovery by the clean up process thus experimental work and thorough data analyses are employed in the current investigation to ascertain the effects of time and operating temperatures on dna extraction yield purity of isolated dna and clean up efficiency during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions this knowledge is essential for the accurate interpretation of experimental results determination of biomass content and quantification of particular genes including those studied for microbial community analysis a realistic estimation of biomass and microbial community would help optimize the anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale digester the full scale anaerobic digester studied in the current investigation was part of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ottawa canada the incoming municipal wastewater was treated by a conventional activated sludge process that was equipped with a chemical process unit to remove phosphorus based on the information received from the operation team of the wwtp the full scale digester was a mesophilic completely mixed flow reactors cmfr system with a solids retention time srt of 30 d the reactor was fed primary sludge ps and thickened waste activated sludge t was ps t was and digested sludge ds were sampled from the full scale digester volatile solids vs removal was about 65 the reactor removed soluble chemical oxygen demand scod by up to 75 concentrations of soluble orthophosphate sop and ammonia of digestate leaving the system were up to 6 and 10 times more than those measured in the influent sludge respectively the continuous process reduced oxidation redution potential orp by 127 mv further details are available in previous publications 27 28 sludge sampling from the full scale reactor was carried out for three purposes 1 comparison between ps t was and ds 2 comparison between the influent and ds and 3 feeding the laboratory batch digesters for the first purpose sludges were sampled several times over two years for the second purpose the influent components i e ps and t was were mixed with the same ratios as applied in the full scale digester in this case sludge sampling was conducted twice in march and july in the first and second scenarios sample sizes were about 1 l for each sludge on each sludge sampling occasion those samples were cooled immediately and were transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 1 4 c until the time of analysis see section s 1 a of supplementary material for further details and explanations about the storage of sludge samples for the third purpose sludges were sampled in quantities of up to 30 l in less than three hours and they were transferred to the laboratory and refrigerated ps and t was were mixed with the same ratio as that applied in the full scale anaerobic digester of the wwtp this mixture was used as the feed of laboratory batch digesters see section 2 2 2 2 laboratory digesters nalgene containers cole parmer were used to make three batch anaerobic reactors to be operated at 35 45 and 55 c the working volume of each batch reactor was 10 l based on their operating temperatures the three anaerobic digesters were named and 35 and 45 and and 55 heating was provided by blanket heaters wrapped around the containers and connected to a temperature controller the batch sludge containers wrapped with the blankets were fastened to orbital shakers which provided mixing during the digestion process the reactors were fed with a mixture of ps and t was 4 5 1 to which seed sludge was added the mass fractions of the ps t was and seed sludge in the reactor content were 0 74 0 16 and 0 1 respectively and 35 45 and 55 achieved 28 5 49 9 and 41 3 vs reductions respectively biogas collection bags tedlar were connected to the exhaust of the reactors during the process biogas production from all batch reactors was confirmed visually by observing consecutive fillings of the biogas collection bags which were emptied when they became full the batch reactors were operated for 22 4 days during which soluble scod increased by 53 76 also sop increased by up to 23 8 times orp levels of all three reactors were negative between 89 and 223 mv as expected ammonia concentrations fluctuated between 0 5 and 2 g nh3 n kg sludge while scod concentrations increased from about 5 g scod kg sludge at the beginning of the operation to up to about 20 g scod kg sludge at the end sludge sampling from batch reactors was conducted on days 0 3 6 9 12 15 19 and 22 4 the samples were stored at 1 4 c until dna isolation see s1 a for further details and explanations about the storage of sludge samples 2 3 measurements dna isolation and dna clean up for dna isolation the power soil kit qiagen catalouge numbers 12888 50 and 12888 100 was used see s1 b for information about the dna isolation kit dna isolates were stored at 20 c until measurement of dna concentration the concentration of total solids ts and vs was determined thermally by heating a known mass of sludge at 104 c for 24 h and at 550 c for 2 h 29 scod and sop were measured using colorimetric methods methods 8000 and 8114 hach orp and ammonia levels were checked using probes intellical mtc101 and iseh3181 hach orp values were measured once and the rest of the measurements were triplicated dna extraction yields were calculated by dividing the mass of isolated dna by the corresponding mass of ts s1 c provides the equation used for the calculation of the extraction yield and justification of the way yield was calculated a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop usa was used to measure the dna concentration and to check the purity of the extracts see s1 d for further explanation about the use of the spectrophotometer to study the effect of dna clean up on the quality of the dna isolates dna clean up was performed using the nucleospin gdna clean up kit macherey nagel gmbh co kg following the manufacturer s instructions see s1 e for further explanation about the dna clean up kit 2 4 statistical analyses to determine the significance levels between each two groups of experimental observation two tailed t tests were conducted see s1 f for further explanation about t tests to determine the significance of the differences among the time series data two factor analysis of variance was conducted for all the statistical analyses of this study the α level was set at 0 05 2 5 evaluation of dna clean up efficiency to evaluate the dna clean up efficiency in a concise manner the following parameters are defined clean up recovery coefficient crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b these parameters are computed using eqs 1 2 and 3 1 crc m dna a m dna b dna a v dna a dna b v dna b 2 abs 260 280 a b a bs 260 280 a a 260 280 b 3 abs 260 230 a b abs 260 230 a a 260 230 b where mdna is dna mass dna is dna concentration in ng μl vdna is the volume of dna isolate in μl and the letters b and a refer to before and after the clean up respectively the recovery coefficient should lie between 0 and 1 i e mdna a is logically a fraction of mdna b as for abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b a value of 1 basically means an improvement of the respective purity ratio as a result of the clean up which is typically expected on the other hand a value smaller than 1 means deterioration of dna extract quality due to clean up to be very strict such interpretations for values other than 1 for the purity based parameters and below 1 for crc are valid only if the numerators and denominators in eqs 1 3 are significantly different however recovery coefficients slightly lower or higher than 1 without statistical significance may be taken as a dna recovery of 100 by the same token abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b values slightly lower or higher than 1 without statistical significance may be interpreted as no positive or negative effect of the clean up on the respective purity ratio this type of parametrization allows for understanding the significance of the difference between groups of observations further clarifications are provided in table 1 and s1 g 3 results and discussion 3 1 dna concentration and extraction yield dna concentrations of the dna isolates before clean up are shown in fig 1 a c respectively the highest dna concentrations of batch reactors 71 85 ng μl were observed at the beginning of the digestion process yang et al 30 measured dna concentration in batch anaerobic digesters fed with manure they used a dna extraction kit that was different from the one used in the current study from the values reported in their paper graphs were constructed to show the variations of dna concentration in dna isolates during anaerobic digestion fig s2 the values of the initial dna concentrations were close to the values found in the current study however the progression over time looked very different from the profiles obtained in the present research furthermore there was no statistically significant difference between mesophilic and thermophilic reactors p value 0 247 unlike the current investigation p values 0 05 the slight dissimilarities in the initial values could be because of the different kits used but the variations over time are more complex one could argue that the reactor content has a direct impact on the behaviour of active biomass resulting in different dna concentrations sludge dna concentrations in μg per gram of sludge in the current study can be calculated by multiplying the isolate concentrations by 0 4 see s1 b shimizu and coworkers 31 reported an average dna concentration of 1 78 g dna l sludge for an activated sludge that contained 1 83 g ts l sludge and 1 55 g vs l sludge the preliminary tests of this study showed sludge density was almost 1 mg ml by assuming this value for the cited study 31 the measured dna concentration was higher than the highest values observed in the current investigation weiss et al 32 used two methods in 9 different ways to extract dna from digestate sampled from a thermophilic anaerobic digester they reported an average concentration range of 1 58 63 9 μg dna g sludge bergmann et al 33 used 9 different procedures to extract dna from digested manure and maize silage sampled from a mesophilic anaerobic digester with an srt of 7 days they reported an average concentration range of 7 14 259 μg dna ml sludge which can also be expressed as μg dna g sludge the upper limit was achieved using an sds lysozyme lysis method similar to the one in the current study interestingly the lower limit concentration was relatively close to the initial concentration of the batch digesters of the current study solids concentrations of the sludge samples are shown in fig 2 a c as the digestion time was the same in all batch anaerobic digesters the differences in their solids concentrations had to be related to the effects of different temperatures with respect to the continuous reactor the process configuration srt and temperature would have to be important factors for the final solids content of the digested sludge the values displayed in figs 1 and 2 were used to compute the corresponding dna extraction yields dna extraction yields for sludge samples taken from the batch reactors are matched against digestion time in fig 3 a and 35 started with 0 88 mg dna g ts and sharply declined to 0 33 mg dna g ts in just three days after that the decline continued with a milder slope seeming to have stabilized at 0 07 mg dna g ts at the end of the run and 45 and 55 had an initial yield of 0 77 mg dna g ts although overall trends for and 45 and 55 were also downward they were clearly different from that for and 35 p value 0 05 there was also an initial drop in the first three days similar to that of and 35 and a pseudo stabilization state can be seen for the next 6 days in contrast to and 35 the extraction yields to some extent rose after 9 and 12 days for and 45 and 55 respectively the extraction yields of and 35 were considerably higher than those of and 45 and 55 until day 15 nonetheless the yields of the thermophilic batch reactors were noticeably higher than those of their mesophilic counterpart after day 15 the reduction in the extraction yields fig 3 a over time is in agreement with the observations of shimizu and coworkers 31 given the simultaneous reduction in the dna fig 1 a and ts fig 2 a concentrations in line with observations of other researchers 3 4 it can be postulated that the two are correlated and 35 was the only reactor that showed this relationship fig s3 notwithstanding the intercept of the linear correlation is 28 4 times larger than its slope this together with the coefficient of determination not being high enough denotes the slope cannot be used as a measure of a constant extraction yield this is reflected in fig 3 a where the extraction yields of and 35 changed drastically with digestion time such correlation did not exist for the other batch digesters of the current study this means that agreement between the profiles of dna and solids concentrations does not always hold and there are factors other than ts content that affect dna isolation from sludge during the course of anaerobic digestion one such factor is the biomass content which undergoes changes as the microbial community slowly changes and adapts to the anaerobic conditions 19 20 considering the biomass fraction can be represented by dna extraction yield 2 3 it is not plausible that the biomass content was reduced by 90 in just a few days fig 3 a as such reduction would almost bring the process to a halt something that was not observed in the present study in fact the digestion process proceeded from the beginning to the end fig 2 a therefore other aspects of dna extraction should be analyzed for a possible explanation organic compounds such as proteins are released due to hydrolysis during anaerobic digestion 34 these compounds may interfere with dna extraction 8 accordingly it can be hypothesized that the secretion of interfering organics is a reason for the initial sharp decline in the extraction yield as digestion proceeds in batch reactors food becomes scarce the bacteria consume interfering organics and hardier bacteria populate the reactor concurrently this would mean a more efficient dna extraction and a higher amount of dna containing biomass these explanations are supported by the upticks observed in the extraction yields of and 45 and 55 between days 10 and 20 fig 3 a the lack of those upticks in the profile of and 35 could be because of lower consumption of interfering substances this strongly suggests that the release of interfering substances was at least partly responsible for the observed variations in dna extraction yield during the batch anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge in the current study another possible reason for the variations could be the changes in microbial communities 19 20 nevertheless the effects of such changes might also affect dna isolation efficiency through the reasons discussed above further experimental work is required to prove these explanations the dna extraction yields of the influent and digestate of the full scale digester are shown in fig 3 b the yields for the influent sludge samples agreed with the initial sludge samples taken from the batch reactors although the difference between the extraction yields of the full scale influents sampled in march and july was significant p value 0 011 the difference between the digestates sampled on the same dates was not p value 0 154 moreover the differences between the influent and digested sludges were not significant p values 0 05 contrary to the full scale digester of the current study the extraction yields of influent partially digested and fully digested sludge were quite different with relatively low standard deviations when an anaerobic digester was fed with cow dung 35 the difference in feed type could be an explanation comparison of the extraction yield profiles of batch reactors fig 3 a with the extraction yields of the full scale continuous reactor fig 3 b reveals a discrepancy the significant drop during batch digestions was not consistent with the similarity of the extraction yields of the influent and digestate such inconsistencies can be related to the hydraulic regime reactor configuration and srt of the full scale digester the batch reactors sampled at different times would be able to simulate the condition of a plug flow reactor with the same srts as sludge sampling times nevertheless the hydraulic regime and reactor configuration of the full scale digester were two cmfr groups in series 28 additionally the two groups were operated at two different temperatures apart from that technical constraints would not allow running the batch reactors for the same duration as the overall srt of the full scale digester the mentioned reactor design factors could have helped with the reduction of organics that would block dna isolation materials the extraction yields ps t was and ds are compared in fig 3 c the extraction yield for t was was distinctly higher than that for primary and digested sludges which suggests that the t was contained a higher biomass content per solids mass this was expected as the ideal growth conditions for aerobic bacteria created in the aeration tanks of activated sludge systems assist the bacteria in utilizing food and turning it into dna containing biomass based on mass fraction calculations the contribution of digested sludge inoculum to the total solids of laboratory reactors was only 4 at the beginning of the batch digestion thus it can be concluded that almost the entirety of the initial dna quantity in and 35 45 and 55 was from primary sludge and t was while the difference between primary sludge and t was was significant p value 0 05 the difference between primary and digested sludges was not p value 0 242 the dna extraction yield is a fraction of the actual dna content of the sample from which dna is isolated arguably finding out how close the extraction yield is to the actual dna content is beyond the scope of the present work although in the current study the concentration and yield profiles were similar figs 1 a and 3 a normalization of dna concentration with respect to solids content i e calculation of extraction yield would still be necessary for reasonable comparisons with the findings of other researchers malin and illmer 36 studied a thermophilic anaerobic digester with various srts using the same dna isolation kit as the one used in the present research in that study concentrations of approximately 4 33 5 and 0 5 μg dna g dry mass were observed the highest value was close to the yield for and 55 between days 6 and 12 during digestion fig 3 a romanazzi et al 37 isolated dna from anaerobic sludge sampled from reactors fed with a mixture of primary and secondary sludges the extraction yields for the influent and digested sludges of the reactor were 103 2 44 6 μg g and 143 9 64 9 μg g respectively these values are high compared with the overall magnitude of the values obtained in the current work all in all dna extraction yield depends on the duration and temperature of the digestion sample storage pretreatment isolation method and measurement instrument in agreement with the observations of roopnarain et al 35 hence comparisons of dna extraction yield reported in different investigations should be made cautiously 3 2 purity of dna isolates purity of the dna isolates before clean up signified by abs260 280 b and abs260 230 b are presented in fig 4 a d the isolates from and 35 showed better than desired quality in terms of abs260 280 b while the isolates from the other two reactors were not as good in both of which the parameter registered below the desired level fig 4 a the quality of the dna isolates in terms of abs260 230 b is much worse than that in terms of abs260 280 b it can be seen that except for the isolates from the first sludge samples of and 35 and 45 the rest of the isolates have a lower than desired abs260 230 b for and 35 the ratio goes down from 2 06 to 0 74 with a relatively steady slope the profiles were very different for and 45 and 55 both of which share the following features a sharp initial decline a pseudo steady state an ascending trend with a tapering slope and a final decline the change of abs260 230 b over time for and 45 and 55 somehow resembles their trends of extraction yields fig 3 a as for the full scale reactor fig 4 c there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of abs260 280 b in terms of abs260 230 b nevertheless there were significant differences between influent and digested sludge samples taken in both mach and july for which p values were 0 031 and 0 020 respectively furthermore fig 4 d shows no statistically significant difference between the ps t was and ds in terms of the purity ratios p values 0 05 overall abs260 280 b values were more acceptable than abs260 230 b values weiss et al 32 and bergmann et al 33 reported abs260 280 and abs260 230 ratio ranges of 1 51 2 19 and 0 17 2 31 respectively prior to clean up and further purification of dna isolates kuhn et al 11 reported abs260 280 values whose average ranged from 1 27 to 1 78 a range of 1 66 to 1 95 was observed by li et al 38 when dna was isolated from activated sludge using the same dna isolation kit as the one used in the current study the lower bounds of the ranges taken from the previous publications were below 1 8 it can be argued that there might be compounds affecting the purity ratios sewage sludge contains humics 39 and proteins 40 these compounds are part of extracellular polymeric substances 41 which also contain dna 42 uv rays of various wavelengths can be absorbed by compounds containing conjugated pi bonds in general 43 and by humics 44 and proteins 45 in particular therefore the poor purity ratios suggest the presence of humic substances as was the case for dna extraction from soil 46 and proteins in dna isolates given the fact the mentioned compounds could affect dna isolation efficiency the deterioration abs260 230 b over time further suggests that the changes in the sludge chemistry caused the efficiency of dna isolation to decline resulting in the observed decreases of dna extraction yields during the batch digestion fig 3 a 3 3 dna clean up dna concentrations and purity ratios of the cleaned up isolates are displayed in fig 5 a and b and c e respectively the trends for the dna concentration after the clean up were similar to those of the isolates before the clean up fig 1 a and b except for and 55 such similarity did not exist between the purity ratios before and after the clean up fig 4 a c indeed there was a noticeable difference in the case of the full scale digester in terms of abs260 230 compare fig 5 e with fig 4 c values crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b are plotted versus time in fig 6 a e it is clear from fig 6 a that the best recoveries occurred in the dna isolates of sludge samples taken from and 35 where the recovery coefficients were closer to 1 or 100 of available dna mass in comparison with the corresponding values from and 45 and 55 the numbers of significant points for and 35 45 and 55 are 3 6 and 7 respectively this is because when the recovery coefficient is closer to 1 dna masses before and after the clean up are less likely to be significantly different the lowest recoveries about 35 occurred in and 55 samples taken on days 3 and 9 as depicted in fig 6 b it is evident that the overall abs260 280 of the batch digesters isolates improved significantly as a result of dna clean up for batch digesters the amplitude of the straight dashed line in fig 6 b is 1 signifying no difference between the abs260 280 values before and after clean up for and 35 the values of the sludge sample of the first 15 days are located close to that line with no statistically significant difference nevertheless there was a significant increase towards the end of the experiment the significance of the increase in abs260 280 levels was more profound for and 45 and 55 the best improvements belonged to the samples taken from and 55 on days 3 and 5 where abs260 280 a b was 2 09 abs260 230 a b values for the batch digesters are shown in fig 6 c the magnitude and significance of the increase in abs260 230 a b were even greater than those of abs260 280 a b note that in fig 6 c the digits of the vertical axis start from 1 there was an overall increase in abs260 230 a b over time for all three laboratory digesters the trend of and 45 stands out due to the highest observed abs260 230 a b value which is 4 06 and was determined for the dna isolate of the sludge sample taken from the reactor on day 6 the recovery of the dna and purity of the cleaned up isolates for the full scale reactor sludge samples are illustrated in fig 6 d and e respectively it is understood from fig 6 d that the dna recovery for the isolates of the influent sampled in march and both influent and digested sampled in july was 100 the recovery for the influent sampled in march was 83 from fig 6 e it is clear that the clean up neither improved nor worsened abs260 280 on the other hand abs260 230 was significantly improved by the clean up for all dna isolates obtained from the influent and digestate of the full scale reactor assuming a linear relationship between dna concentration and absorption at 260 nm a doubling in dna concentration would increase the absorption at the mentioned wavelength twice as much the experimental work of the current study showed that this can readily happen if the clean up work does not remove any of the contaminants absorbing uv rays at 230 and 280 nm it is expected to see an increase in the contaminant concentration with the same factor as dna concentration in other words the volume reduction during the clean up due to the eluent amount being lower than the initial dna isolate concentrates dna and contaminant to the same extent so if there were no removal of the contaminants during the clean up work there would not be any increase in the purity ratios after the clean up work the clean up efficiencies observed for the batch reactors of the current work fig 6 a c were higher than those reported by weiss et al 32 where such techniques as dialysis and electrophoresis were used the digestion time and temperature appeared to have varying effects on the trends of the dna isolation and clean up fig 6 a c to elucidate the underlying mechanisms further research is encouraged to scrutinize the evolution of detailed reactor chemistry at various temperatures over time and to explain how such an evolution could affect the performance of dna isolation and clean up steps to achieve such a goal the chemical composition of sludge and dna isolates before and after the clean up need to be examined over the course of anaerobic digestion at several temperatures there is something fundamental with respect to the purity ratios that should not be missed abs260 280 and abs260 230 represent the ratio of dna concentration to protein and phenolics concentrations respectively furthermore because of their aromatic structure the mentioned compounds can absorb uv at wavelengths other than 230 and 280 nm 43 therefore it is expected to see an association between dna concentration and purity ratios of dna isolates to examine this the data from the dna isolates of the laboratory as well as full scale anaerobic digesters were used abs260 280 values of the cleaned up dna isolates obtained from the batch digesters and influent and digestate of the full scale digester negatively correlated with their respective dna concentrations through an exponential function fig 7 a such a relationship did not exist for the isolates before clean up a stronger and far more comprehensive correlation was observed between abs260 230 and dna concentration values fig 7 b where the data points included those of the isolates obtained from both laboratory and full scale digester i e ps t was influent and digestate before and after the clean up in this case the correlation was positive and of logarithmic nature last but not least it can be seen that there was a negative linear correlation between the abs260 280 a b and dna a dna b for laboratory digesters fig 7 c results of the present investigation show that the dna isolation from wastewater sludge changes during anaerobic digestion this has important implications for studies that estimate biomass using dna isolation and quantification of specific genes the variability of the extraction yield and dna purity should be taken into account for representative dna measurements because it is important for monitoring the abundance of specific genes such as those involved in antibiotic resistance the volume of sludge digesters is calculated based on srt the amount of time biomass has to react vss has been conventionally considered as biomass which is not accurate because not all vss is bacteria however bacterial cells contain dna it is common to quantify 16s rrna gene to evaluate various types of biomasses and their activities like methane production 47 48 calculation of total copy numbers of the gene per solids content depends on the dna isolation efficiency with this perspective the findings of the current investigations are also important for designing sludge digesters 4 conclusions effects of time and temperature on dna isolation were studied during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge laboratory batch reactors and a full scale cmfr were employed the extraction yield of and 35 reduced by 75 in 9 days while that of and 45 and 55 declined by 92 within the same period abs260 280 b levels for the mesophilic batch and full scale digesters were higher than those for the thermophilic batch digesters abs260 230 b declined as a result of digestion in all reactors up to 75 for and 55 in 9 days observations of the present investigation strongly indicate that the efficiency of dna isolation declined during batch anaerobic digestion the efficiency of clean up was evaluated by analysing dna recovery and change in purity ratios there was an overall reduction in the recovery during batch digestion crc levels of and 35 were higher than those of and 45 and 55 depending on the digestion time the operating temperature of the batch reactors had positive and negative effects on crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b levels the clean up in this study clearly improved abs260 230 far more effectively than abs260 280 of batch and full scale dna isolates there was a negative correlation between abs260 280 and dna concentration of the cleaned up dna isolates which followed a power law function r2 0 71 on the other hand there was a positive logarithmic correlation between abs260 230 values and dna concentrations of isolates before and after the clean up r2 0 78 it is important to factor in these findings for measuring the absolute abundance of genes including those related to antibiotic resistance and the ones selected for analysis of microbial populations moreover these findings should be taken into account when using extraction yield values for determining the biomass content of sludge during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge thus the results of this study are expected to help with the design operation and

12702,the effect of anaerobic sludge digestion on the isolation of dna and clean up efficiency of obtained dna isolates was studied influent and digestate of a continuous full scale reactor were sampled twice also batch digesters were operated at 35 45 and 55 c namely and 35 and 45 and and 55 the batch reactors were sampled at 3 to 4 day time intervals during the digestion a sharp decline in the extraction yield was observed over time for the batch reactors in and 55 the extraction yield declined by 96 in 12 days the purity of the dna isolates was assessed by purity ratios which included absorption at 260 nm to that at 280 nm abs260 280 and to that at 230 nm abs260 230 abs260 230 before clean up declined as a result of digestion in all reactors the most severe case being and 55 decreasing from 1 91 to 0 47 in nine days the efficiency of clean up was evaluated by analysing dna recovery and changes in the purity ratios and 35 and the full scale reactor had the highest recoveries 80 furthermore a 4 1 fold increase was observed in abs260 230 additionally non linear correlations were found between purity parameters and the dna concentration r2 0 7 the observations of the current investigation strongly indicate that the change in dna extraction yield was at least partly due to the change in dna extraction efficiency and not just the change in the actual dna content this is an important consideration for the quantification of biomass specific genes and microbial populations where dna isolation plays a key role graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords sludge anaerobic digestion dna yield recovery purity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction suspended solids removed during wastewater treatment processes constitute sludge due to its high polluting potential sludge has to be treated in a suitable way a widely used process to treat sludge is anaerobic digestion which is employed under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions 1 dna isolation from sludge can be used for measuring sludge biomass 2 3 determination of the actual sludge biomass is important for estimating the actual biomass content of volatile suspended solids a parameter that is crucial for research design and operation of anaerobic digesters 4 5 in addition dna isolation is central to the enumeration of specific genes 6 7 a common technique used for the detection and quantification of genes is quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr 8 9 the quality of dna isolates should meet a certain level in order to be used for downstream qpcr assays the isolate quality can be explained by the mass of dna obtained per mass of the sample as well as two purity check ratios they include abs260 280 and abs260 230 absorbance value at 260 nm divided by that at 280 nm and 230 nm respectively when exposed to uv rays dna molecules show a characteristic absorbance peak at 260 nm the presence of proteins and phenolics is represented by absorptions at 280 and 230 nm respectively which are considered contaminants that decrease the purity of the dna isolate the purity ratios are recommended to be 1 8 8 yet dna isolates with purity ratios below this level often occur 10 11 dna exists as part of the suspended matter of sludge although some are also found as free floating dna 12 14 dna isolation consists of two major steps release of intracellular dna and purification the former which is also called extraction includes the destruction of the cell walls of the dna containing organisms and the disintegration of the matrix structure in which extracellular dna is embedded in the second step the released intracellular dna together with free floating dna is separated from unwanted compounds 12 14 numerous dna isolation procedures have been employed to find the one that would be most suitable for particular types of study 15 16 working on a wide variety of samples including wastewater sludge kuhn et al 11 used 10 different approaches with several physical and chemical methods to extract dna and then purified the extracted dna by applying isopropanol and ethanol containing solutions in the same line hashemi shahraki et al 15 used a series of lysis buffers and physical methods to determine the most efficient way of acquiring dna from water samples it is plausible that some impurities especially when their concentration is high evade dna purification steps and find their way into the final dna isolates the quality of such dna isolates can be further improved by removing the impurities through a clean up process which is conducted using commercial kits 16 17 the mass of dna after clean up is a fraction of that before clean up the efficiency of the aforementioned process might also be affected by the impurities that are likely to exist in dna isolates as summarized above dna isolation is a result of various chemical and physical processes in which the dna containing entities undergo intense alterations chemical and physical properties e g proteins and solids concentrations of sludge vary with the progression and temperature of anaerobic digestion 4 18 these variations caused by the activities of the bacteria involved might interfere with the dna isolation and clean up processes apart from that the composition of the microbial community changes during digestion 19 20 which might affect dna isolation efficiency although the contribution from microbial community changes is recognized it is not likely to play a significant role hence the effects of microbial community changes on dna isolation and clean up are not within the scope of the current investigation there has been informative research on the isolation of dna from wastewater sludge 21 22 and the clean up of the isolated dna 23 yet there is a gap in the literature as to whether the quality of dna isolation and clean up change during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge this issue is paramount to making reasonable comparisons between the extracted dna of different sludge samples from the same or different anaerobic digesters especially when the absolute quantity of particular genes 24 26 is of interest this study hypothesizes that the quality of dna isolation and clean up is negatively affected by the progression of sludge digestion and that the operating temperature of the digestion process plays an important role in order to reveal the effect s of digestion time and temperature on the efficiency of dna isolation and clean up a systematic experimental approach is required which necessitates comprehensive statistical analyses of the obtained data and mass balance on dna recovery by the clean up process thus experimental work and thorough data analyses are employed in the current investigation to ascertain the effects of time and operating temperatures on dna extraction yield purity of isolated dna and clean up efficiency during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions this knowledge is essential for the accurate interpretation of experimental results determination of biomass content and quantification of particular genes including those studied for microbial community analysis a realistic estimation of biomass and microbial community would help optimize the anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale digester the full scale anaerobic digester studied in the current investigation was part of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in ottawa canada the incoming municipal wastewater was treated by a conventional activated sludge process that was equipped with a chemical process unit to remove phosphorus based on the information received from the operation team of the wwtp the full scale digester was a mesophilic completely mixed flow reactors cmfr system with a solids retention time srt of 30 d the reactor was fed primary sludge ps and thickened waste activated sludge t was ps t was and digested sludge ds were sampled from the full scale digester volatile solids vs removal was about 65 the reactor removed soluble chemical oxygen demand scod by up to 75 concentrations of soluble orthophosphate sop and ammonia of digestate leaving the system were up to 6 and 10 times more than those measured in the influent sludge respectively the continuous process reduced oxidation redution potential orp by 127 mv further details are available in previous publications 27 28 sludge sampling from the full scale reactor was carried out for three purposes 1 comparison between ps t was and ds 2 comparison between the influent and ds and 3 feeding the laboratory batch digesters for the first purpose sludges were sampled several times over two years for the second purpose the influent components i e ps and t was were mixed with the same ratios as applied in the full scale digester in this case sludge sampling was conducted twice in march and july in the first and second scenarios sample sizes were about 1 l for each sludge on each sludge sampling occasion those samples were cooled immediately and were transported to the laboratory where they were stored at 1 4 c until the time of analysis see section s 1 a of supplementary material for further details and explanations about the storage of sludge samples for the third purpose sludges were sampled in quantities of up to 30 l in less than three hours and they were transferred to the laboratory and refrigerated ps and t was were mixed with the same ratio as that applied in the full scale anaerobic digester of the wwtp this mixture was used as the feed of laboratory batch digesters see section 2 2 2 2 laboratory digesters nalgene containers cole parmer were used to make three batch anaerobic reactors to be operated at 35 45 and 55 c the working volume of each batch reactor was 10 l based on their operating temperatures the three anaerobic digesters were named and 35 and 45 and and 55 heating was provided by blanket heaters wrapped around the containers and connected to a temperature controller the batch sludge containers wrapped with the blankets were fastened to orbital shakers which provided mixing during the digestion process the reactors were fed with a mixture of ps and t was 4 5 1 to which seed sludge was added the mass fractions of the ps t was and seed sludge in the reactor content were 0 74 0 16 and 0 1 respectively and 35 45 and 55 achieved 28 5 49 9 and 41 3 vs reductions respectively biogas collection bags tedlar were connected to the exhaust of the reactors during the process biogas production from all batch reactors was confirmed visually by observing consecutive fillings of the biogas collection bags which were emptied when they became full the batch reactors were operated for 22 4 days during which soluble scod increased by 53 76 also sop increased by up to 23 8 times orp levels of all three reactors were negative between 89 and 223 mv as expected ammonia concentrations fluctuated between 0 5 and 2 g nh3 n kg sludge while scod concentrations increased from about 5 g scod kg sludge at the beginning of the operation to up to about 20 g scod kg sludge at the end sludge sampling from batch reactors was conducted on days 0 3 6 9 12 15 19 and 22 4 the samples were stored at 1 4 c until dna isolation see s1 a for further details and explanations about the storage of sludge samples 2 3 measurements dna isolation and dna clean up for dna isolation the power soil kit qiagen catalouge numbers 12888 50 and 12888 100 was used see s1 b for information about the dna isolation kit dna isolates were stored at 20 c until measurement of dna concentration the concentration of total solids ts and vs was determined thermally by heating a known mass of sludge at 104 c for 24 h and at 550 c for 2 h 29 scod and sop were measured using colorimetric methods methods 8000 and 8114 hach orp and ammonia levels were checked using probes intellical mtc101 and iseh3181 hach orp values were measured once and the rest of the measurements were triplicated dna extraction yields were calculated by dividing the mass of isolated dna by the corresponding mass of ts s1 c provides the equation used for the calculation of the extraction yield and justification of the way yield was calculated a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop usa was used to measure the dna concentration and to check the purity of the extracts see s1 d for further explanation about the use of the spectrophotometer to study the effect of dna clean up on the quality of the dna isolates dna clean up was performed using the nucleospin gdna clean up kit macherey nagel gmbh co kg following the manufacturer s instructions see s1 e for further explanation about the dna clean up kit 2 4 statistical analyses to determine the significance levels between each two groups of experimental observation two tailed t tests were conducted see s1 f for further explanation about t tests to determine the significance of the differences among the time series data two factor analysis of variance was conducted for all the statistical analyses of this study the α level was set at 0 05 2 5 evaluation of dna clean up efficiency to evaluate the dna clean up efficiency in a concise manner the following parameters are defined clean up recovery coefficient crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b these parameters are computed using eqs 1 2 and 3 1 crc m dna a m dna b dna a v dna a dna b v dna b 2 abs 260 280 a b a bs 260 280 a a 260 280 b 3 abs 260 230 a b abs 260 230 a a 260 230 b where mdna is dna mass dna is dna concentration in ng μl vdna is the volume of dna isolate in μl and the letters b and a refer to before and after the clean up respectively the recovery coefficient should lie between 0 and 1 i e mdna a is logically a fraction of mdna b as for abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b a value of 1 basically means an improvement of the respective purity ratio as a result of the clean up which is typically expected on the other hand a value smaller than 1 means deterioration of dna extract quality due to clean up to be very strict such interpretations for values other than 1 for the purity based parameters and below 1 for crc are valid only if the numerators and denominators in eqs 1 3 are significantly different however recovery coefficients slightly lower or higher than 1 without statistical significance may be taken as a dna recovery of 100 by the same token abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b values slightly lower or higher than 1 without statistical significance may be interpreted as no positive or negative effect of the clean up on the respective purity ratio this type of parametrization allows for understanding the significance of the difference between groups of observations further clarifications are provided in table 1 and s1 g 3 results and discussion 3 1 dna concentration and extraction yield dna concentrations of the dna isolates before clean up are shown in fig 1 a c respectively the highest dna concentrations of batch reactors 71 85 ng μl were observed at the beginning of the digestion process yang et al 30 measured dna concentration in batch anaerobic digesters fed with manure they used a dna extraction kit that was different from the one used in the current study from the values reported in their paper graphs were constructed to show the variations of dna concentration in dna isolates during anaerobic digestion fig s2 the values of the initial dna concentrations were close to the values found in the current study however the progression over time looked very different from the profiles obtained in the present research furthermore there was no statistically significant difference between mesophilic and thermophilic reactors p value 0 247 unlike the current investigation p values 0 05 the slight dissimilarities in the initial values could be because of the different kits used but the variations over time are more complex one could argue that the reactor content has a direct impact on the behaviour of active biomass resulting in different dna concentrations sludge dna concentrations in μg per gram of sludge in the current study can be calculated by multiplying the isolate concentrations by 0 4 see s1 b shimizu and coworkers 31 reported an average dna concentration of 1 78 g dna l sludge for an activated sludge that contained 1 83 g ts l sludge and 1 55 g vs l sludge the preliminary tests of this study showed sludge density was almost 1 mg ml by assuming this value for the cited study 31 the measured dna concentration was higher than the highest values observed in the current investigation weiss et al 32 used two methods in 9 different ways to extract dna from digestate sampled from a thermophilic anaerobic digester they reported an average concentration range of 1 58 63 9 μg dna g sludge bergmann et al 33 used 9 different procedures to extract dna from digested manure and maize silage sampled from a mesophilic anaerobic digester with an srt of 7 days they reported an average concentration range of 7 14 259 μg dna ml sludge which can also be expressed as μg dna g sludge the upper limit was achieved using an sds lysozyme lysis method similar to the one in the current study interestingly the lower limit concentration was relatively close to the initial concentration of the batch digesters of the current study solids concentrations of the sludge samples are shown in fig 2 a c as the digestion time was the same in all batch anaerobic digesters the differences in their solids concentrations had to be related to the effects of different temperatures with respect to the continuous reactor the process configuration srt and temperature would have to be important factors for the final solids content of the digested sludge the values displayed in figs 1 and 2 were used to compute the corresponding dna extraction yields dna extraction yields for sludge samples taken from the batch reactors are matched against digestion time in fig 3 a and 35 started with 0 88 mg dna g ts and sharply declined to 0 33 mg dna g ts in just three days after that the decline continued with a milder slope seeming to have stabilized at 0 07 mg dna g ts at the end of the run and 45 and 55 had an initial yield of 0 77 mg dna g ts although overall trends for and 45 and 55 were also downward they were clearly different from that for and 35 p value 0 05 there was also an initial drop in the first three days similar to that of and 35 and a pseudo stabilization state can be seen for the next 6 days in contrast to and 35 the extraction yields to some extent rose after 9 and 12 days for and 45 and 55 respectively the extraction yields of and 35 were considerably higher than those of and 45 and 55 until day 15 nonetheless the yields of the thermophilic batch reactors were noticeably higher than those of their mesophilic counterpart after day 15 the reduction in the extraction yields fig 3 a over time is in agreement with the observations of shimizu and coworkers 31 given the simultaneous reduction in the dna fig 1 a and ts fig 2 a concentrations in line with observations of other researchers 3 4 it can be postulated that the two are correlated and 35 was the only reactor that showed this relationship fig s3 notwithstanding the intercept of the linear correlation is 28 4 times larger than its slope this together with the coefficient of determination not being high enough denotes the slope cannot be used as a measure of a constant extraction yield this is reflected in fig 3 a where the extraction yields of and 35 changed drastically with digestion time such correlation did not exist for the other batch digesters of the current study this means that agreement between the profiles of dna and solids concentrations does not always hold and there are factors other than ts content that affect dna isolation from sludge during the course of anaerobic digestion one such factor is the biomass content which undergoes changes as the microbial community slowly changes and adapts to the anaerobic conditions 19 20 considering the biomass fraction can be represented by dna extraction yield 2 3 it is not plausible that the biomass content was reduced by 90 in just a few days fig 3 a as such reduction would almost bring the process to a halt something that was not observed in the present study in fact the digestion process proceeded from the beginning to the end fig 2 a therefore other aspects of dna extraction should be analyzed for a possible explanation organic compounds such as proteins are released due to hydrolysis during anaerobic digestion 34 these compounds may interfere with dna extraction 8 accordingly it can be hypothesized that the secretion of interfering organics is a reason for the initial sharp decline in the extraction yield as digestion proceeds in batch reactors food becomes scarce the bacteria consume interfering organics and hardier bacteria populate the reactor concurrently this would mean a more efficient dna extraction and a higher amount of dna containing biomass these explanations are supported by the upticks observed in the extraction yields of and 45 and 55 between days 10 and 20 fig 3 a the lack of those upticks in the profile of and 35 could be because of lower consumption of interfering substances this strongly suggests that the release of interfering substances was at least partly responsible for the observed variations in dna extraction yield during the batch anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge in the current study another possible reason for the variations could be the changes in microbial communities 19 20 nevertheless the effects of such changes might also affect dna isolation efficiency through the reasons discussed above further experimental work is required to prove these explanations the dna extraction yields of the influent and digestate of the full scale digester are shown in fig 3 b the yields for the influent sludge samples agreed with the initial sludge samples taken from the batch reactors although the difference between the extraction yields of the full scale influents sampled in march and july was significant p value 0 011 the difference between the digestates sampled on the same dates was not p value 0 154 moreover the differences between the influent and digested sludges were not significant p values 0 05 contrary to the full scale digester of the current study the extraction yields of influent partially digested and fully digested sludge were quite different with relatively low standard deviations when an anaerobic digester was fed with cow dung 35 the difference in feed type could be an explanation comparison of the extraction yield profiles of batch reactors fig 3 a with the extraction yields of the full scale continuous reactor fig 3 b reveals a discrepancy the significant drop during batch digestions was not consistent with the similarity of the extraction yields of the influent and digestate such inconsistencies can be related to the hydraulic regime reactor configuration and srt of the full scale digester the batch reactors sampled at different times would be able to simulate the condition of a plug flow reactor with the same srts as sludge sampling times nevertheless the hydraulic regime and reactor configuration of the full scale digester were two cmfr groups in series 28 additionally the two groups were operated at two different temperatures apart from that technical constraints would not allow running the batch reactors for the same duration as the overall srt of the full scale digester the mentioned reactor design factors could have helped with the reduction of organics that would block dna isolation materials the extraction yields ps t was and ds are compared in fig 3 c the extraction yield for t was was distinctly higher than that for primary and digested sludges which suggests that the t was contained a higher biomass content per solids mass this was expected as the ideal growth conditions for aerobic bacteria created in the aeration tanks of activated sludge systems assist the bacteria in utilizing food and turning it into dna containing biomass based on mass fraction calculations the contribution of digested sludge inoculum to the total solids of laboratory reactors was only 4 at the beginning of the batch digestion thus it can be concluded that almost the entirety of the initial dna quantity in and 35 45 and 55 was from primary sludge and t was while the difference between primary sludge and t was was significant p value 0 05 the difference between primary and digested sludges was not p value 0 242 the dna extraction yield is a fraction of the actual dna content of the sample from which dna is isolated arguably finding out how close the extraction yield is to the actual dna content is beyond the scope of the present work although in the current study the concentration and yield profiles were similar figs 1 a and 3 a normalization of dna concentration with respect to solids content i e calculation of extraction yield would still be necessary for reasonable comparisons with the findings of other researchers malin and illmer 36 studied a thermophilic anaerobic digester with various srts using the same dna isolation kit as the one used in the present research in that study concentrations of approximately 4 33 5 and 0 5 μg dna g dry mass were observed the highest value was close to the yield for and 55 between days 6 and 12 during digestion fig 3 a romanazzi et al 37 isolated dna from anaerobic sludge sampled from reactors fed with a mixture of primary and secondary sludges the extraction yields for the influent and digested sludges of the reactor were 103 2 44 6 μg g and 143 9 64 9 μg g respectively these values are high compared with the overall magnitude of the values obtained in the current work all in all dna extraction yield depends on the duration and temperature of the digestion sample storage pretreatment isolation method and measurement instrument in agreement with the observations of roopnarain et al 35 hence comparisons of dna extraction yield reported in different investigations should be made cautiously 3 2 purity of dna isolates purity of the dna isolates before clean up signified by abs260 280 b and abs260 230 b are presented in fig 4 a d the isolates from and 35 showed better than desired quality in terms of abs260 280 b while the isolates from the other two reactors were not as good in both of which the parameter registered below the desired level fig 4 a the quality of the dna isolates in terms of abs260 230 b is much worse than that in terms of abs260 280 b it can be seen that except for the isolates from the first sludge samples of and 35 and 45 the rest of the isolates have a lower than desired abs260 230 b for and 35 the ratio goes down from 2 06 to 0 74 with a relatively steady slope the profiles were very different for and 45 and 55 both of which share the following features a sharp initial decline a pseudo steady state an ascending trend with a tapering slope and a final decline the change of abs260 230 b over time for and 45 and 55 somehow resembles their trends of extraction yields fig 3 a as for the full scale reactor fig 4 c there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of abs260 280 b in terms of abs260 230 b nevertheless there were significant differences between influent and digested sludge samples taken in both mach and july for which p values were 0 031 and 0 020 respectively furthermore fig 4 d shows no statistically significant difference between the ps t was and ds in terms of the purity ratios p values 0 05 overall abs260 280 b values were more acceptable than abs260 230 b values weiss et al 32 and bergmann et al 33 reported abs260 280 and abs260 230 ratio ranges of 1 51 2 19 and 0 17 2 31 respectively prior to clean up and further purification of dna isolates kuhn et al 11 reported abs260 280 values whose average ranged from 1 27 to 1 78 a range of 1 66 to 1 95 was observed by li et al 38 when dna was isolated from activated sludge using the same dna isolation kit as the one used in the current study the lower bounds of the ranges taken from the previous publications were below 1 8 it can be argued that there might be compounds affecting the purity ratios sewage sludge contains humics 39 and proteins 40 these compounds are part of extracellular polymeric substances 41 which also contain dna 42 uv rays of various wavelengths can be absorbed by compounds containing conjugated pi bonds in general 43 and by humics 44 and proteins 45 in particular therefore the poor purity ratios suggest the presence of humic substances as was the case for dna extraction from soil 46 and proteins in dna isolates given the fact the mentioned compounds could affect dna isolation efficiency the deterioration abs260 230 b over time further suggests that the changes in the sludge chemistry caused the efficiency of dna isolation to decline resulting in the observed decreases of dna extraction yields during the batch digestion fig 3 a 3 3 dna clean up dna concentrations and purity ratios of the cleaned up isolates are displayed in fig 5 a and b and c e respectively the trends for the dna concentration after the clean up were similar to those of the isolates before the clean up fig 1 a and b except for and 55 such similarity did not exist between the purity ratios before and after the clean up fig 4 a c indeed there was a noticeable difference in the case of the full scale digester in terms of abs260 230 compare fig 5 e with fig 4 c values crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b are plotted versus time in fig 6 a e it is clear from fig 6 a that the best recoveries occurred in the dna isolates of sludge samples taken from and 35 where the recovery coefficients were closer to 1 or 100 of available dna mass in comparison with the corresponding values from and 45 and 55 the numbers of significant points for and 35 45 and 55 are 3 6 and 7 respectively this is because when the recovery coefficient is closer to 1 dna masses before and after the clean up are less likely to be significantly different the lowest recoveries about 35 occurred in and 55 samples taken on days 3 and 9 as depicted in fig 6 b it is evident that the overall abs260 280 of the batch digesters isolates improved significantly as a result of dna clean up for batch digesters the amplitude of the straight dashed line in fig 6 b is 1 signifying no difference between the abs260 280 values before and after clean up for and 35 the values of the sludge sample of the first 15 days are located close to that line with no statistically significant difference nevertheless there was a significant increase towards the end of the experiment the significance of the increase in abs260 280 levels was more profound for and 45 and 55 the best improvements belonged to the samples taken from and 55 on days 3 and 5 where abs260 280 a b was 2 09 abs260 230 a b values for the batch digesters are shown in fig 6 c the magnitude and significance of the increase in abs260 230 a b were even greater than those of abs260 280 a b note that in fig 6 c the digits of the vertical axis start from 1 there was an overall increase in abs260 230 a b over time for all three laboratory digesters the trend of and 45 stands out due to the highest observed abs260 230 a b value which is 4 06 and was determined for the dna isolate of the sludge sample taken from the reactor on day 6 the recovery of the dna and purity of the cleaned up isolates for the full scale reactor sludge samples are illustrated in fig 6 d and e respectively it is understood from fig 6 d that the dna recovery for the isolates of the influent sampled in march and both influent and digested sampled in july was 100 the recovery for the influent sampled in march was 83 from fig 6 e it is clear that the clean up neither improved nor worsened abs260 280 on the other hand abs260 230 was significantly improved by the clean up for all dna isolates obtained from the influent and digestate of the full scale reactor assuming a linear relationship between dna concentration and absorption at 260 nm a doubling in dna concentration would increase the absorption at the mentioned wavelength twice as much the experimental work of the current study showed that this can readily happen if the clean up work does not remove any of the contaminants absorbing uv rays at 230 and 280 nm it is expected to see an increase in the contaminant concentration with the same factor as dna concentration in other words the volume reduction during the clean up due to the eluent amount being lower than the initial dna isolate concentrates dna and contaminant to the same extent so if there were no removal of the contaminants during the clean up work there would not be any increase in the purity ratios after the clean up work the clean up efficiencies observed for the batch reactors of the current work fig 6 a c were higher than those reported by weiss et al 32 where such techniques as dialysis and electrophoresis were used the digestion time and temperature appeared to have varying effects on the trends of the dna isolation and clean up fig 6 a c to elucidate the underlying mechanisms further research is encouraged to scrutinize the evolution of detailed reactor chemistry at various temperatures over time and to explain how such an evolution could affect the performance of dna isolation and clean up steps to achieve such a goal the chemical composition of sludge and dna isolates before and after the clean up need to be examined over the course of anaerobic digestion at several temperatures there is something fundamental with respect to the purity ratios that should not be missed abs260 280 and abs260 230 represent the ratio of dna concentration to protein and phenolics concentrations respectively furthermore because of their aromatic structure the mentioned compounds can absorb uv at wavelengths other than 230 and 280 nm 43 therefore it is expected to see an association between dna concentration and purity ratios of dna isolates to examine this the data from the dna isolates of the laboratory as well as full scale anaerobic digesters were used abs260 280 values of the cleaned up dna isolates obtained from the batch digesters and influent and digestate of the full scale digester negatively correlated with their respective dna concentrations through an exponential function fig 7 a such a relationship did not exist for the isolates before clean up a stronger and far more comprehensive correlation was observed between abs260 230 and dna concentration values fig 7 b where the data points included those of the isolates obtained from both laboratory and full scale digester i e ps t was influent and digestate before and after the clean up in this case the correlation was positive and of logarithmic nature last but not least it can be seen that there was a negative linear correlation between the abs260 280 a b and dna a dna b for laboratory digesters fig 7 c results of the present investigation show that the dna isolation from wastewater sludge changes during anaerobic digestion this has important implications for studies that estimate biomass using dna isolation and quantification of specific genes the variability of the extraction yield and dna purity should be taken into account for representative dna measurements because it is important for monitoring the abundance of specific genes such as those involved in antibiotic resistance the volume of sludge digesters is calculated based on srt the amount of time biomass has to react vss has been conventionally considered as biomass which is not accurate because not all vss is bacteria however bacterial cells contain dna it is common to quantify 16s rrna gene to evaluate various types of biomasses and their activities like methane production 47 48 calculation of total copy numbers of the gene per solids content depends on the dna isolation efficiency with this perspective the findings of the current investigations are also important for designing sludge digesters 4 conclusions effects of time and temperature on dna isolation were studied during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge laboratory batch reactors and a full scale cmfr were employed the extraction yield of and 35 reduced by 75 in 9 days while that of and 45 and 55 declined by 92 within the same period abs260 280 b levels for the mesophilic batch and full scale digesters were higher than those for the thermophilic batch digesters abs260 230 b declined as a result of digestion in all reactors up to 75 for and 55 in 9 days observations of the present investigation strongly indicate that the efficiency of dna isolation declined during batch anaerobic digestion the efficiency of clean up was evaluated by analysing dna recovery and change in purity ratios there was an overall reduction in the recovery during batch digestion crc levels of and 35 were higher than those of and 45 and 55 depending on the digestion time the operating temperature of the batch reactors had positive and negative effects on crc abs260 280 a b and abs260 230 a b levels the clean up in this study clearly improved abs260 230 far more effectively than abs260 280 of batch and full scale dna isolates there was a negative correlation between abs260 280 and dna concentration of the cleaned up dna isolates which followed a power law function r2 0 71 on the other hand there was a positive logarithmic correlation between abs260 230 values and dna concentrations of isolates before and after the clean up r2 0 78 it is important to factor in these findings for measuring the absolute abundance of genes including those related to antibiotic resistance and the ones selected for analysis of microbial populations moreover these findings should be taken into account when using extraction yield values for determining the biomass content of sludge during anaerobic digestion of wastewater sludge thus the results of this study are expected to help with the design operation and

a rate of 3 43 10 2 min 1 in simulated light pms which is 2 88 and 6 08 times faster than zro2 and moo3 respectively reactive species so4 oh h and o2 for ds degradation were explored the characterization results revealed that zro2 is coated on moo3 nanoplates which boosted surface adsorption sites and decreased the bandgap of the as prepared composites in the pms moo3 zro2 light system a mechanism for catalytic degradation of ds has been postulated and transformation intermediates generated in the process have been detected using the hplc tof spectrometry approach additionally moo3 zro2 exhibited high stability and recycling capabilities mo and zr ions leaching were found to be at considerably lower amounts after ds degradation the fabricated moo3 zro2 nanocomposite has significant promise in the further use of visible light to build novel water purification solutions due to its benefits of good catalytic activity and stability graphical abstract

population growth as well as growing water pollution the world s water resources situation has deteriorated in recent years the total volume of wastewater ww produced worldwide grew from 1500 km3 in 1995 to 2212 km3 in 2010 1 anti inflammatory drug ww made up a significant component of this effluent anti inflammatory medications are becoming more widely used in a variety of fields owing to their indispensability in the treatment of many diseases but they cannot be completely digested by organisms and cannot be adequately eradicated from municipal wastewater treatment using conventional methods as a result given antibiotics chemical and biological stability developing novel and cost effective methods to eliminate them is critical 2 4 due to its widespread use as a non steroidal anti inflammatory medicine for treating a variety of in inflammatory conditions ds has been commonly identified in surface water ground water and even drinking water 4 the detection accuracy level of ds is owing to its retention in the natural aqueous environment yet typical water treatment processes have little ability to effectively remove it to destroy ds a few biological methods and advanced oxidation processes aops have been used multiple technologies including filtration adsorption fenton photo fenton chemical oxidation semiconductors ultrasonic irradiation carbon based catalysts and electro chemistry and biological processes have been used in recent years to remove a wide range of contaminants 5 9 aops have drawn significant attention since 2003 with the ground breaking work of anipsitakis and dionysiou 10 as effective and promising approaches for degradation and mineralization of resistant contaminants to breakdown pollutants and then mineralize them into co2 h2o and other byproducts aops primarily rely on the generation of reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide anion o2 pms and peroxydisulfate ions are the two primary sources of sulphate radicals so4 these ions need to be triggered by uv heat microwaves photocatalysts ultrasound transition metal ions or carbon based composites in order to form the radical species 11 13 despite extensive recent research on visible light activation of pms which shown excellent outcomes its efficacy in both the mineralization and removal of contaminants can be increased following coupling with a heterogeneous catalyst aops have shown to be extremely effective at degrading pollutants that are resistant to biodegradation in a water environment when sustainable solar energy is used to illuminate semiconductors electrons are stimulated and subsequently shifted from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb follow on the segregation of

photocatalytic activation the incorporation of electron acceptors into photocatalytic systems is a highly effective method for preventing the recombination of electrons and holes created in the semiconductor which can increase the removal rate of recalcitrant environmental pollutants the incorporation of mo in a heterogeneous catalyst has subsequently been a proven catalyst and consistent in pms triggering in addition moo3 is frequently combined with other semiconductors in heterogeneous photocatalysis 17 27 zro2 a characteristic semiconductor photocatalyst is gaining popularity in treating ww due to its great qualities like non toxicity excellent durability and superb photochemical capabilities the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes however limits the catalytic effectiveness of this system 28 this flaw can be adequately addressed by combining additional semiconductors to make a robust heterojunction catalyst the photocatalyst with the z scheme has a superior photo generated carrier mobility and redox potential than the type ii photocatalyst 29 30 yang et al reported that the z scheme heterojunction significantly improved ds decomposition activity 31 based on the prior explanation it is necessary to develop a new and extremely capable photocatalyst with a heterojunction structure by combining moo3 and zro2 pms was activated to accomplish the goal of really efficient ds degradation by fully using the transfer of photo generated electrons and holes in the heterojunction as a heterogeneous catalyst moo3 zro2 composite has good catalytic activity for pms moreover the moo3 zro2 composite s stable crystalline structure porous morphology ease of synthesis reducing the leaching of metal ions and ease of separation from treatment fluid make it a promising material for use in the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation wastewater management sector in this work the novel moo3 zro2 photocatalysis coupled of pms oxidation processes moo3 zro2 pms visible light has been constructed for the first time ds elimination efficiency under visible light illumination was used to assess the performance of the photocatalyst furthermore using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry the decomposition pathway of the degradation process was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of moo3 zro2 diclofenac sodium ds provided by

characterization of photocatalysts the obtained xrd patterns of moo3 zro2 composite and their individual components namely zro2 and moo3 are shown in fig 1 in the xrd pattern of zro2 the evident major diffraction peaks were identified at 2θ of 24 04 28 17 31 46 34 15 35 30 40 72 50 11 and 55 39 which correspond to the respective 110 111 111 200 002 112 022 and 310 crystal planes of monoclinic structure p21 a 14 with pdf 37 1484 the major characteristic diffraction peaks of moo3 occurred at 2θ of 12 78 23 33 25 69 25 87 27 33 33 75 38 97 49 25 57 67 and 62 83 are indexed to the crystal planes of 020 110 040 120 021 111 060 002 171 and 251 correspondingly which are in well match with the orthorhombic pbnm 62 with pdf 35 0609 the peaks of moo3 and zro2 were clearly seen in sample moo3 zro2 no any other phases were observed which indicates the formation of moo3 zro2 composite this study validates the successful coordination of the moo3 zro2 composite which can elicit novel properties due to the synergistic coupling of both components the chemical bonding states between molybdenum and oxygen atoms in moo3 nps were investigated using ft ir fig 2 depicts the ft ir spectrum of moo3 nanobelts acquired in the 4000 400 cm 1 range moo3 predominantly exhibits three peaks at 881 995 1400 and 1630 cm 1 which are connected with the stretching mode of oxygen coupled with three metal atoms the stretching mode of oxygen in the moomo units and the moo stretching mode the definition of a layered two minor vibrations were also identified at 1400 and 1633 cm 1 which were related to the mooh bond vibrational modes and the bending vibrational mode of adsorbed h2o respectively 27 32 the ftir spectrum of zro2 displays the peaks at 1633 cm 1 oh bending vibration of water molecules and 740 cm 1 zro stretching vibrations respectively 33 as to the moo3 zro2 sample the main characteristic peaks were consistent with moo3 zro2 shown in the image respectively it proves that the moo3 zro2 sample is composed of moo3 zro2 with nanohybrid structure xps was conducted to explore the valence state of the elements in moo3 zro2 samples to clarify the interfacial interaction between zro2 and moo3 high resolution xps spectra of mo 3d zr 3d and o 1 s were examined as revealed in fig 3 b the high resolution mo 3d spectra of moo3 and moo3 zro2 show two narrow peaks at 236 01 235 98 and 232 88 232 85 ev which are allocated to the binding energies of mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 correspondingly 34 the zr 3d spectrum of zro2 and moo3 zro2 shows two main peaks located at 184 08 184 59 and 181 72 182 12 ev consistent to zr 3d3 2 and zr 3d5 2 respectively fig 3 c 35 the banding energy of oxygen o 1 s located at 530 71 529 59 and 530 62 ev for moo3 zro2 and moo3 zro2 composite respectively fig 3 d 36 while the peaks of all elements slight shifted suggesting the electron migration from moo3 to zro2 upon hybridization 37 these results indicate intimate contact and strong chemical interaction formed between moo3 to zro2 in heterostructure the xps valance band vb spectra of moo3 and zro2 were presented in fig 3 e f moo3 nanoplates can be seen in the tem picture of fig 4 a these bonded layers are presumably like sandwich panels that are suggested to be used as the matrix for cation insertion the nanoplates are clearly multilayer structures they are approximately 0 562 μm in width and no 1 545 μm long the lattice fringes of the moo3 nanoplates are 0 265 and 0 325 nm which match well with the 111 and 021 interplanar spacings respectively according to hrtem image fig 4 b zro2 particles have an approximately spherical shape and an average size of 190 nm fig 4 c fig 4 d shows a typical hrtem image of a pure zro2 particle which shows that there are two planes 111 and 200 with interplanar spacing of 0 316 nm and 0 262 nm respectively the findings also depicts that the surface of pure moo3 is reasonably clean before zro2 is coated on it fig 4 e shows that the morphology of moo3 zro2 is nanoplates as it is in pure moo3 form this consistency in shape indicates that when used as a backbone substance moo3 nanoplates keep their morphology moo3 zro2 nanoplates are rougher and less homogenous on the edges than pristine moo3 nanoplates furthermore the color contrast of moo3 zro2 under tem is more prominent these tem changes verify that zro2 has been effectively coated onto moo3 fig 4 f displays that the interlayer spacing of 0 221 nm and 0 270 nm can be clearly seen in the hrtem image this corresponds to the 112 lattice plane of zro2 and the 101 lattice plane of moo3 which is in good agreement with the xrd analysis this result demonstrates that the moo3 zro2 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized the surface morphology of moo3 zro2 was examined using techniques such as sem eds edx fig s1 a e the sample had elements mapping for mo zr and o as shown in fig s1 b d the fact that these elements were evenly distributed further indicates that zro2 and moo3 were successfully and consistently coupled the accumulated elemental weight atomic information is included in edx fig s1e the optical analysis of pristine and moo3 zro2 composite was executed by uv visible spectrophotometer fig 5 depicts the absorption spectra and optical bandgap eg of pure and moo3 zro2 composite the optical absorption spectrum found to be in the region of 300 400 nm indicating that all samples are highly effective in the visible range moreover the formula can be used to derive eg values 1 αh v a h v e g n 2 where a α h and v denote the proportionality constant absorption coefficient planck s constant and light frequency correspondingly where n symbolizes the electronic transition if n 3 2 3 2 1 2 depicts direct forbidden transition indirect forbidden direct allowed and indirect allowed respectively 38 eg values of virgin samples have been found to be 3 02 and 5 10 ev when they make their composite an intermediate energy level forms between the vb and cb because of these intermediate energy levels eg has shrunk to 2 92 ev as a result these materials can be employed as photocatalysts investigating the reaction process of photoinduced electron hole pairs in photocatalysts has regularly utilized photoluminescence pl the segregation and migration performance of the photogenerated carriers are faster when the pl intensity is increased so pl test was conducted using an excitation source with 400 nm wavelength the intensity of the emission peaks of moo3 zro2 composite was found to be smaller than those of pure samples as illustrated in fig s2 it demonstrates that the moo3 zro2 composite has improved electron transmission and that the ratio of photogenerated electrons to photogenerated holes has been significantly reduced enhancing the capacity of the photocatalytic reaction 39 40 nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption studies were used to explore the textural features of catalysts as shown in fig 6 table 1 lists the related metrics such as bet surface area pore volume and average pore size moo3 zro2 with a well developed porosity have higher catalytic efficiency because of its more porous morphological aspect moo3 zro2 may exhibit improved photocatalytic ability this is because increasing porosity likely corresponds to more active areas for the occurrence of reactional activity similarly cahino et al 41 proposed that their samples with higher porous morphology would be ideal for photocatalytic experiments 3 2 photocatalytic performance diclofenac sodium ds an anti inflammatory drug was selected as a model pollutant for testing the pms catalyst light system since it is one of the most extensively used nsaid analgesics medicine the degradation of ds under visible light is used to assess the performance of the produced photocatalyst ds was degraded by 21 under light irradiation 14 85 removal was obtained using a moo3 zro2 catalyst alone this result is in consistent with the surface area and pore volume values table 1 pms alone degraded 31 77 of ds and almost 38 41 elimination by moo3 zro2 under the presence of light was detected which was owing to the swift recombination of photogenerated e and h ds removal percent in pms moo3 zro2 in dark is about 54 71 pms light revealed a considerable active catalysis for ds elimination with a competence of 50 90 notably moo3 zro2 proved an extraordinarily boosted activity to activate pms for ds elimination in the presence of light having 90 94 removal within 100 min pseudo first order kinetics were used in the ds degrading protocols fig 7 b and for a variety of reaction systems rate constants k were derived fig 7 c as described in fig 7 c the pms moo3 zro2 light system revealed the maximum k 10 2 min 1 3 43 which was 10 18 14 93 6 28 4 95 and 3 37 times those of the only light moo3 zro2 pms moo3 zro2 light and pms light systems respectively these findings indicate that combining pms with light illumination can greatly improve ds elimination by the moo3 zro2 composite in order to better comprehend the synergy impact and catalytic activity factors 42 between moo3 zro2 light and pms in terms of the reaction rate constants of various processes as shown in table s1 the synergy can be attributed to values 1 in which the combined effect is significantly higher than the sum of all individual effects the computed synergy factor in this investigation was determined to be 3 662 when compared to pure moo3 and zro2 moo3 zro2 had the best pms activation efficiency with a photocatalytic activity factor 19 61 13 in contrast without modifying any other test parameters the effect of initial concentrations on ds degradation was examined the degradation rate of ds at various doses of pms moo3 zro2 light system is shown in fig 8 a the degradation performance of the system for ds begins to improve as the catalyst dosage is increased the removal rate of ds noticeably amplified from 62 1 to 90 94 while the k 10 2 min 1 rate increased from 0 008 to 0 035 this tendency is expected since a larger amount of catalyst would give more active positions resulting in more reactive species being generated for ds breakdown all of the degradation tests in this research used 0 25 g l of catalyst due to the cost and efficiency of the catalyst ds removal followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 8 b and the reaction rate constants k 10 2 min 1 were calculated fig 8 c the effect of pms concentration on ds degradation was also explored as shown in fig 9 a raising the pms content accelerated the degradation of ds at a given catalyst dosage of 0 25 g l as pms content grew from 0 10 to 0 3 g l the elimination effectiveness of ds improved from 50 to 90 94 fig 9 a maximum ds removal was achieved at 0 30 g l pms 90 94 that might be owing to the reasons that a larger pms content likely results in more oxidation products furthermore pms could trap electrons exiting vb of moo3 zro2 preventing electron hole recombination and improving the photocatalytic operation the type of reaction is shown to be a pseudo first order reaction with an r2 value fig 9 b as a result the k value increased dramatically from 2 67 to 4 71 10 2 min 1 fig 9 c fig 10 shows the photocatalytic performances of moo3 zro2 and moo3 zro2 composite for ds elimination in the vicinity of pms at neutral ph the pms moo3 zro2 composite light system significantly increased the ds removal rate to 90 94 whereas the pms moo3 and pms zro2 systems degraded ds by 36 41 and 61 41 under light illumination respectively fig 10 b furthermore the toc removal efficiency is as high as 72 91 demonstrating that pms moo3 zro2 composite light system can successfully breakdown ds molecules into co2 h2o and other small molecular organic compounds these findings suggest that constructing composite material can significantly increase pms activity for ds degradation the composite material table 1 had a clear outstanding impact on ds degradation within the tested range which may be attributed to a narrow eg ev porous nature and larger surface area fig 10 c shows the ds degradation kinetics rate constant k 10 2 min 1 and the rate of ds degradation by moo3 zro2 composite was substantially higher than all other samples thus the results show that the moo3 zro2 composite could be suitable for removing ds efficiently and effectively as summarized in table 2 comparing with the reported moo3 and zro2 based photocatalysts the moo3 zro2 composite prepared in this work possessed excellent photocatalytic activity for ds degradation therefore the results further demonstrated that the pms moo3 zro2 composite light can be a promising system for organic pollutants degradation regarding the environmental remediation fig s3 a shows an additional evaluation of the pms moo3 zro2 light system s effectiveness under optimal influencing conditions towards the decontamination of ds from tap water di water lake water and river water samples the water from the lake and river was filtered before utilization the pms moo3 zro2 light system has a strong potential as an effective purpose due to its superior and swift degradation of resistant contaminants contained in real sample matrixes after 100 min of reaction though 85 of ds was removed from all investigated samples fig s3 a the influence of inorganic anions and humic acid as conflicting agents which are primarily present on water surface has been thoroughly researched in aops studies in order to assess their effects on the operation of the pms moo3 zro2 light system during the degradation of ds certain humic acid and inorganic anions such as cl co3 2 and no3 were utilized as sodium salts at 5 mg l the inclusion of humic acid and inorganic anions caused a modest decrease in ds degradation as presented in fig s3 b in pms moo3 zro2 light system the ph of the solution is critical for the elimination of ds because it affects the heterogeneity of pms and the surface functional groups of metal catalysts 39 43 44 in fig s4 the removal efficiency seems to improve initially as the ph rose from 3 0 to 7 0 then the removal rate decreased noticeably at ph 11 at ph 7 0 the best photocatalytic outcome for ds degradation was achieved so the neutral and weakly acidic conditions were better for the photocatalytic reaction according to previous findings ds had pka value 4 35 0 2 and pms values between 0 and 9 4 45 46 when the solution was acidic the common feature of pms was hso5 and ds transformed to an anionic form causing electrostatic repulsion between pms and ds according to the zeta potential analysis the phzpc of moo3 zro2 was around 5 57 the moo3 zro2 surface interactions with pms would be adversely affected by the formation of the strong h bond at acidic medium which would result from the h joining with the oo bond of pms 47 however the formation of molybdenum and zirconium hydroxide complexes when the initial ph reached 9 0 would impair the effectiveness of the catalyst 48 the so4 might be captured by the oh in an alkaline environment 49 to evaluate the reaction mechanism of ds along the pathway to mineralization the primary degradation products and a number of intermediates generated during the pms based photocatalytic treatment were identified lc ms was used to monitor the degradation products by employing precise mass quantities that allowed empirical formulas to be derived using an elemental composition calculator tool resulting in a list of best match hits as shown in fig 11 prior information on the molecule pattern and the oxidative treatment is used to make the best chemical structure choice and suggestion 50 the ds molecule is predominantly attacked by sulfate radicals during pms based photocatalytic oxidation however no stable sulfate derivatives were found because they rapidly developed into carboxylate derivatives by substitution or hydrolysis the mass to charge ratio m z of 295 0 corresponds to the best fit formula ds 1 c14h11cl2no2 neutral molecule the carboxylic moiety of ds 1 reduced to an alcoholic derivative under hydroxyl attack to be predicted as ds 2 c14h13cl2no with m z of 282 2 another intermediate with an empirical formula of ds 3 c13h11cl2n with m z of 252 1 was produced by photocatalytic alcoholic elimination the ring opening reactions resulted in the formation of new organic fragments named 2 6 dicholoroacetanilide c8h7cl2no at m z 204 0 under pms oh so4 h2o2 attack further photocatalytic demethylation led to the formation of a new organic molecule at m z 190 0 called n 2 6 dichlorophenyl formamide c7h5cl2no the product was subsequently degraded further to produce organic compounds such as dichloroaniline m z 162 9 and dichlorophenyl hydroxylamine m z 177 9 these molecules went through a series of photocatalytic ring opening reactions subsequently mineralizing into carbon dioxide and water in most circumstances a catalytic redox system s understanding of which active species result in rapid pollution degradation is crucial as a result we chose methanol tert butanol tba edta 2na and bq as radical capture scavengers of so4 oh h and o2 to perform a series of radical capture studies the consequences shown in fig 12 a demonstrated that the introduction of every scavenger has a substantial inhibitory impact on ds elimination in comparison to a control group the inhibitory role of scavengers may be included in fig 12 a by contrasting the degradability of ds the existence of the aforesaid active species was also confirmed using electron spin resonance epr spectroscopy fig 12 b the traces of dmpo oh and mild dmpo so4 adducts were also identified when dmpo was added to the pms moo3 zro2 light systems and providing visible light increased the magnitude of the signals we presented a plausible mechanism to explain the improved ds degrading efficiency of pms activating moo3 zro2 light systems that rely on the above mentioned characterization and analysis results fig 13 first since more e h pairs can be formed due to moo3 zro2 composite which may increase light absorption capabilities and ds degradation performance second due to the well matched eg between moo3 and zro2 a heterojunction can develop between them preventing photoexcited e h recombination the moo3 and zro2 might hypothetically form a type ii or z scheme heterojunction fig 13 a b if a type ii heterojunction between moo3 and zro2 was seen fig 13 a photogenerated electrons should move to the cb of the zro2 while photogenerated holes move to the vb of the moo3 the redox ability was significantly reduced because the vb of zro2 with 2 44 ev was unable to produce oh for the increased redox potential for h2o oh 3 09 ev 55 57 thus it appears that the normal type ii heterojunction cannot account for the flow of electrons based on the band structures of moo3 zro2 and reactive oxygen species quenching and esr data the charge carrier transfer process in moo3 zro2 composite should follow a typical z scheme heterojunction seems more reasonable for the electronic migration behavior in the moo3 zro2 photocatalyst fig 13 b the vb xps edges of moo3 and zro2 were calculated to be 3 09 and 2 44 ev correspondingly fig 3 e f therefore the edge potential of cb for the catalysts stated above was calculated as 0 07 and 2 66 ev using the equation ecb evb eg 28 58 60 under light illumination electrons in the vbs of moo3 and zro2 became excited and hopped to the associated cbs of the catalysts the electrons in the cb of moo3 then transitioned to the interface and recombined with the h in the vb of zro2 the electrons in the cb of zro2 reacted with adsorbed o2 to form o2 species additionally the h in the vb of moo3 can directly oxidize ds or h2o oh to generate oh because of their significant oxidation potential simultaneously pms can trap e to form so4 before interacting with h2o to develop oh likewise some e being trapped by pms resulting in additional h remaining on the vb of moo3 then h on the vb of moo3 activates pms causing it to generate so4 and then oh finally more oh and o2 radicals are produced degrading and mineralizing the ds to tiny molecules which are then converted to h2o and co2 in conclusion the moo3 zro2 composite showed remarkable ds degrading capability due to the synergistic influence of photocatalysis and pms the possible reaction equations in the pms moo3 zro2 light system were seen below 2 moo 3 zro 2 h v h vb e cb 3 o 2 e cb o 2 4 o 2 h vb oh 5 hso 5 e cb so 4 oh 6 h vb h 2 o h oh 7 so 4 h 2 o h oh so 4 2 8 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 9 mo 4

and reuse ability of the moo3 zro2 composite under light illumination with the existence of pms ds degradation rate reduced little after five cycles as shown in fig 14 a implying that moo3 zro2 composite are quite stable the crystal phase of the catalyst employed was virtually identical to that of the fresh catalyst according to the xrd analysis fig 14 b it showed that moo3 zro2 composite have good stability and reusability implying that pms moo3 zro2 light system is viable for long reaction times the quantity of mo and zr that leached into the reaction solution from moo3 zro2 surface is determined in order to further elucidate the catalyst durability mo and zr concentrations were found about 1 5 and 1 8 mg l respectively consequently it can be seen that moo3 zro2 has a great potential for stability and recycling 4 conclusions in this investigation moo3 was partnered with zro2 to establish a significantly associated with a higher peroxymonosulfate oxidation mechanism that can provide greater pms activation sites compared with pristine moo3 and zro2 the moo3 zro2 confirmed significantly boosted photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of ds the charge carriers in the heterostructure moo3 zro2 followed the z scheme strategy according to radical trapping tests the analysis indicates that the synergistic effect of pms moo3 zro2 light system in combination

a rate of 3 43 10 2 min 1 in simulated light pms which is 2 88 and 6 08 times faster than zro2 and moo3 respectively reactive species so4 oh h and o2 for ds degradation were explored the characterization results revealed that zro2 is coated on moo3 nanoplates which boosted surface adsorption sites and decreased the bandgap of the as prepared composites in the pms moo3 zro2 light system a mechanism for catalytic degradation of ds has been postulated and transformation intermediates generated in the process have been detected using the hplc tof spectrometry approach additionally moo3 zro2 exhibited high stability and recycling capabilities mo and zr ions leaching were found to be at considerably lower amounts after ds degradation the fabricated moo3 zro2 nanocomposite has significant promise in the further use of visible light to build novel water purification solutions due to its benefits of good catalytic activity and stability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zro2 moo3 diclofenac sodium pms visible light data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with the massive development of heavy industry and population growth as well as growing water pollution the world s water resources situation has deteriorated in recent years the total volume of wastewater ww produced worldwide grew from 1500 km3 in 1995 to 2212 km3 in 2010 1 anti inflammatory drug ww made up a significant component of this effluent anti inflammatory medications are becoming more widely used in a variety of fields owing to their indispensability in the treatment of many diseases but they cannot be completely digested by organisms and cannot be adequately eradicated from municipal wastewater treatment using conventional methods as a result given antibiotics chemical and biological stability developing novel and cost effective methods to eliminate them is critical 2 4 due to its widespread use as a non steroidal anti inflammatory medicine for treating a variety of in inflammatory conditions ds has been commonly identified in surface water ground water and even drinking water 4 the detection accuracy level of ds is owing to its retention in the natural aqueous environment yet typical water treatment processes have little ability to effectively remove it to destroy ds a few biological methods and advanced oxidation processes aops have been used multiple technologies including filtration adsorption fenton photo fenton chemical oxidation semiconductors ultrasonic irradiation carbon based catalysts and electro chemistry and biological processes have been used in recent years to remove a wide range of contaminants 5 9 aops have drawn significant attention since 2003 with the ground breaking work of anipsitakis and dionysiou 10 as effective and promising approaches for degradation and mineralization of resistant contaminants to breakdown pollutants and then mineralize them into co2 h2o and other byproducts aops primarily rely on the generation of reactive species such as the hydroxyl radical ho sulfate radical so4 singlet oxygen 1o2 and superoxide anion o2 pms and peroxydisulfate ions are the two primary sources of sulphate radicals so4 these ions need to be triggered by uv heat microwaves photocatalysts ultrasound transition metal ions or carbon based composites in order to form the radical species 11 13 despite extensive recent research on visible light activation of pms which shown excellent outcomes its efficacy in both the mineralization and removal of contaminants can be increased following coupling with a heterogeneous catalyst aops have shown to be extremely effective at degrading pollutants that are resistant to biodegradation in a water environment when sustainable solar energy is used to illuminate semiconductors electrons are stimulated and subsequently shifted from the valence band vb to the conduction band cb follow on the segregation of electrons and holes cb s electrons and vb s holes might indeed react with o2 and h2o oh immobilized on the catalyst s surface to form o2 are and oh radicals respectively both radicals were powerful oxidants that aided in the breakdown of contaminants metal oxide composites such as nio zno 14 zno granular activated carbon 15 cuo bivo4 16 moo3 bi2o3 g c3n4 17 cuo zncds 18 ag0 cu2moo4 19 tisn doped

photocatalytic activation the incorporation of electron acceptors into photocatalytic systems is a highly effective method for preventing the recombination of electrons and holes created in the semiconductor which can increase the removal rate of recalcitrant environmental pollutants the incorporation of mo in a heterogeneous catalyst has subsequently been a proven catalyst and consistent in pms triggering in addition moo3 is frequently combined with other semiconductors in heterogeneous photocatalysis 17 27 zro2 a characteristic semiconductor photocatalyst is gaining popularity in treating ww due to its great qualities like non toxicity excellent durability and superb photochemical capabilities the rapid recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes however limits the catalytic effectiveness of this system 28 this flaw can be adequately addressed by combining additional semiconductors to make a robust heterojunction catalyst the photocatalyst with the z scheme has a superior photo generated carrier mobility and redox potential than the type ii photocatalyst 29 30 yang et al reported that the z scheme heterojunction significantly improved ds decomposition activity 31 based on the prior explanation it is necessary to develop a new and extremely capable photocatalyst with a heterojunction structure by combining moo3 and zro2 pms was activated to accomplish the goal of really efficient ds degradation by fully using the transfer of photo generated electrons and holes in the heterojunction as a heterogeneous catalyst moo3 zro2 composite has good catalytic activity for pms moreover the moo3 zro2 composite s stable crystalline structure porous morphology ease of synthesis reducing the leaching of metal ions and ease of separation from treatment fluid make it a promising material for use in the heterogeneous catalytic oxidation wastewater management sector in this work the novel moo3 zro2 photocatalysis coupled of pms oxidation processes moo3 zro2 pms visible light has been constructed for the first time ds elimination efficiency under visible light illumination was used to assess the performance of the photocatalyst furthermore using

characterization of photocatalysts the obtained xrd patterns of moo3 zro2 composite and their individual components namely zro2 and moo3 are shown in fig 1 in the xrd pattern of zro2 the evident major diffraction peaks were identified at 2θ of 24 04 28 17 31 46 34 15 35 30 40 72 50 11 and 55 39 which correspond to the respective 110 111 111 200 002 112 022 and 310 crystal planes of monoclinic structure p21 a 14 with pdf 37 1484 the major characteristic diffraction peaks of moo3 occurred at 2θ of 12 78 23 33 25 69 25 87 27 33 33 75 38 97 49 25 57 67 and 62 83 are indexed to the crystal planes of 020 110 040 120 021 111 060 002 171 and 251 correspondingly which are in well match with the orthorhombic pbnm 62 with pdf 35 0609 the peaks of moo3 and zro2 were clearly seen in sample moo3 zro2 no any other phases were observed which indicates the formation of moo3 zro2 composite this study validates the successful coordination of the moo3 zro2 composite which can elicit novel properties due to the synergistic coupling of both components the chemical bonding states between molybdenum and oxygen atoms in moo3 nps were investigated using ft ir fig 2 depicts the ft ir spectrum of moo3 nanobelts acquired in the 4000 400 cm 1 range moo3 predominantly exhibits three peaks at 881 995 1400 and 1630 cm 1 which are connected with the stretching mode of oxygen coupled with three metal atoms the stretching mode of oxygen in the moomo units and the moo stretching mode the definition of a layered two minor vibrations were also identified at 1400 and 1633 cm 1 which were related to the mooh bond vibrational modes and the bending vibrational mode of adsorbed h2o respectively 27 32 the ftir spectrum of zro2 displays the peaks at 1633 cm 1 oh bending vibration of water molecules and 740 cm 1 zro stretching vibrations respectively 33 as to the moo3 zro2 sample the main characteristic peaks were consistent with moo3 zro2 shown in the image respectively it proves that the moo3 zro2 sample is composed of moo3 zro2 with nanohybrid structure xps was conducted to explore the valence state of the elements in moo3 zro2 samples to clarify the interfacial interaction between zro2 and moo3 high resolution xps spectra of mo 3d zr 3d and o 1 s were examined as revealed in fig 3 b the high resolution mo 3d spectra of moo3 and moo3 zro2 show two narrow peaks at 236 01 235 98 and 232 88 232 85 ev which are allocated to the binding energies of mo 3d3 2 and mo 3d5 2 correspondingly 34 the zr 3d spectrum of zro2 and moo3 zro2 shows two main peaks located at 184 08 184 59 and 181 72 182 12 ev consistent to zr 3d3 2 and zr 3d5 2 respectively fig 3 c 35 the banding energy of oxygen o 1 s located at 530 71 529 59 and 530 62 ev for moo3 zro2 and moo3 zro2 composite respectively fig 3 d 36 while the peaks of all elements slight shifted suggesting the electron migration from moo3 to zro2 upon hybridization 37 these results indicate intimate contact and strong chemical interaction formed between moo3 to zro2 in heterostructure the xps valance band vb spectra of moo3 and zro2 were presented in fig 3 e f moo3 nanoplates can be seen in the tem picture of fig 4 a these bonded layers are presumably like sandwich panels that are suggested to be used as the matrix for cation insertion the nanoplates are clearly multilayer structures they are approximately 0 562 μm in width and no 1 545 μm long the lattice fringes of the moo3 nanoplates are 0 265 and 0 325 nm which match well with the 111 and 021 interplanar spacings respectively according to hrtem image fig 4 b zro2 particles have an approximately spherical shape and an average size of 190 nm fig 4 c fig 4 d shows a typical hrtem image of a pure zro2 particle which shows that there are two planes 111 and 200 with interplanar spacing of 0 316 nm and 0 262 nm respectively the findings also depicts that the surface of pure moo3 is reasonably clean before zro2 is coated on it fig 4 e shows that the morphology of moo3 zro2 is nanoplates as it is in pure moo3 form this consistency in shape indicates that when used as a backbone substance moo3 nanoplates keep their morphology moo3 zro2 nanoplates are rougher and less homogenous on the edges than pristine moo3 nanoplates furthermore the color contrast of moo3 zro2 under tem is more prominent these tem changes verify that zro2 has been effectively coated onto moo3 fig 4 f displays that the interlayer spacing of 0 221 nm and 0 270 nm can be clearly seen in the hrtem image this corresponds to the 112 lattice plane of zro2 and the 101 lattice plane of moo3 which is in good agreement with the xrd analysis this result demonstrates that the moo3 zro2 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized the surface morphology of moo3 zro2 was examined using techniques such as sem eds edx fig s1 a e the sample had elements mapping for mo zr and o as shown in fig s1 b d the fact that these elements were evenly distributed further indicates that zro2 and moo3 were successfully and consistently coupled the accumulated elemental weight atomic information is included in edx fig s1e the optical analysis of pristine and moo3 zro2 composite was executed by uv visible spectrophotometer fig 5 depicts the absorption spectra and optical bandgap eg of pure and moo3 zro2 composite the optical absorption spectrum found to be in the region of 300 400 nm indicating that all samples are highly effective in the visible range moreover the formula can be used to derive eg values 1 αh v a h v e g n 2 where a α h and v denote the proportionality constant absorption coefficient planck s constant and light frequency correspondingly where n symbolizes the electronic transition if n 3 2 3 2 1 2 depicts direct forbidden transition indirect forbidden direct allowed and indirect allowed respectively 38 eg values of virgin samples have been found to be 3 02 and 5 10 ev when they make their composite an intermediate energy level forms between the vb and cb because of these intermediate energy levels eg has shrunk to 2 92 ev as a result these materials can be employed as photocatalysts investigating the reaction process of photoinduced electron hole pairs in photocatalysts has regularly utilized photoluminescence pl the segregation and migration performance of the photogenerated carriers are faster when the pl intensity is increased so pl test was conducted using an excitation source with 400 nm wavelength the intensity of the emission peaks of moo3 zro2 composite was found to be smaller than those of pure samples as illustrated in fig s2 it demonstrates that the moo3 zro2 composite has improved electron transmission and that the ratio of photogenerated electrons to photogenerated holes has been significantly reduced enhancing the capacity of the photocatalytic reaction 39 40 nitrogen n2 adsorption desorption studies were used to explore the textural features of catalysts as shown in fig 6 table 1 lists the related metrics such as bet surface area pore volume and average pore size moo3 zro2 with a well developed porosity have higher catalytic efficiency because of its more porous morphological aspect moo3 zro2 may exhibit improved photocatalytic ability this is because increasing porosity likely corresponds to more active areas for the occurrence of reactional activity similarly cahino et al 41 proposed that their samples with higher porous morphology would be ideal for photocatalytic experiments 3 2 photocatalytic performance diclofenac sodium ds an anti inflammatory drug was selected as a model pollutant for testing the pms catalyst light system since it is one of the most extensively used nsaid analgesics medicine the degradation of ds under visible light is used to assess the performance of the produced photocatalyst ds was degraded by 21 under light irradiation 14 85 removal was obtained using a moo3 zro2 catalyst alone this result is in consistent with the surface area and pore volume values table 1 pms alone degraded 31 77 of ds and almost 38 41 elimination by moo3 zro2 under the presence of light was detected which was owing to the swift recombination of photogenerated e and h ds removal percent in pms moo3 zro2 in dark is about 54 71 pms light revealed a considerable active catalysis for ds elimination with a competence of 50 90 notably moo3 zro2 proved an extraordinarily boosted activity to activate pms for ds elimination in the presence of light having 90 94 removal within 100 min pseudo first order kinetics were used in the ds degrading protocols fig 7 b and for a variety of reaction systems rate constants k were derived fig 7 c as described in fig 7 c the pms moo3 zro2 light system revealed the maximum k 10 2 min 1 3 43 which was 10 18 14 93 6 28 4 95 and 3 37 times those of the only light moo3 zro2 pms moo3 zro2 light and pms light systems respectively these findings indicate that combining pms with light illumination can greatly improve ds elimination by the moo3 zro2 composite in order to better comprehend the synergy impact and catalytic activity factors 42 between moo3 zro2 light and pms in terms of the reaction rate constants of various processes as shown in table s1 the synergy can be attributed to values 1 in which the combined effect is significantly higher than the sum of all individual effects the computed synergy factor in this investigation was determined to be 3 662 when compared to pure moo3 and zro2 moo3 zro2 had the best pms activation efficiency with a photocatalytic activity factor 19 61 13 in contrast without modifying any other test parameters the effect of initial concentrations on ds degradation was examined the degradation rate of ds at various doses of pms moo3 zro2 light system is shown in fig 8 a the degradation performance of the system for ds begins to improve as the catalyst dosage is increased the removal rate of ds noticeably amplified from 62 1 to 90 94 while the k 10 2 min 1 rate increased from 0 008 to 0 035 this tendency is expected since a larger amount of catalyst would give more active positions resulting in more reactive species being generated for ds breakdown all of the degradation tests in this research used 0 25 g l of catalyst due to the cost and efficiency of the catalyst ds removal followed pseudo first order kinetics fig 8 b and the reaction rate constants k 10 2 min 1 were calculated fig 8 c the effect of pms concentration on ds degradation was also explored as shown in fig 9 a raising the pms content accelerated the degradation of ds at a given catalyst dosage of 0 25 g l as pms content grew from 0 10 to 0 3 g l the elimination effectiveness of ds improved from 50 to 90 94 fig 9 a maximum ds removal was achieved at 0 30 g l pms 90 94 that might be owing to the reasons that a larger pms content likely results in more oxidation products furthermore pms could trap electrons exiting vb of moo3 zro2 preventing electron hole recombination and improving the photocatalytic operation the type of reaction is shown to be a pseudo first order reaction with an r2 value fig 9 b as a result the k value increased dramatically from 2 67 to 4 71 10 2 min 1 fig 9 c fig 10 shows the photocatalytic performances of moo3 zro2 and moo3 zro2 composite for ds elimination in the vicinity of pms at neutral ph the pms moo3 zro2 composite light system significantly increased the ds removal rate to 90 94 whereas the pms moo3 and pms zro2 systems degraded ds by 36 41 and 61 41 under light illumination respectively fig 10 b furthermore the toc removal efficiency is as high as 72 91 demonstrating that pms moo3 zro2 composite light system can successfully breakdown ds molecules into co2 h2o and other small molecular organic compounds these findings suggest that constructing composite material can significantly increase pms activity for ds degradation the composite material table 1 had a clear outstanding impact on ds degradation within the tested range which may be attributed to a narrow eg ev porous nature and larger surface area fig 10 c shows the ds degradation kinetics rate constant k 10 2 min 1 and the rate of ds degradation by moo3 zro2 composite was substantially higher than all other samples thus the results show that the moo3 zro2 composite could be suitable for removing ds efficiently and effectively as summarized in table 2 comparing with the reported moo3 and zro2 based photocatalysts the moo3 zro2 composite prepared in this work possessed excellent photocatalytic activity for ds degradation therefore the results further demonstrated that the pms moo3 zro2 composite light can be a promising system for organic pollutants degradation regarding the environmental remediation fig s3 a shows an additional evaluation of the pms moo3 zro2 light system s effectiveness under optimal influencing conditions towards the decontamination of ds from tap water di water lake water and river water samples the water from the lake and river was filtered before utilization the pms moo3 zro2 light system has a strong potential as an effective purpose due to its superior and swift degradation of resistant contaminants contained in real sample matrixes after 100 min of reaction though 85 of ds was removed from all investigated samples fig s3 a the influence of inorganic anions and humic acid as conflicting agents which are primarily present on water surface has been thoroughly researched in aops studies in order to assess their effects on the operation of the pms moo3 zro2 light system during the degradation of ds certain humic acid and inorganic anions such as cl co3 2 and no3 were utilized as sodium salts at 5 mg l the inclusion of humic acid and inorganic anions caused a modest decrease in ds degradation as presented in fig s3 b in pms moo3 zro2 light system the ph of the solution is critical for the elimination of ds because it affects the heterogeneity of pms and the surface functional groups of metal catalysts 39 43 44 in fig s4 the removal efficiency seems to improve initially as the ph rose from 3 0 to 7 0 then the removal rate decreased noticeably at ph 11 at ph 7 0 the best photocatalytic outcome for ds degradation was achieved so the neutral and weakly acidic conditions were better for the photocatalytic reaction according to previous findings ds had pka value 4 35 0 2 and pms values between 0 and 9 4 45 46 when the solution was acidic the common feature of pms was hso5 and ds transformed to an anionic form causing electrostatic repulsion between pms and ds according to the zeta potential analysis the phzpc of moo3 zro2 was around 5 57 the moo3 zro2 surface interactions with pms would be adversely affected by the formation of the strong h bond at acidic medium which would result from the h joining with the oo bond of pms 47 however the formation of molybdenum and zirconium hydroxide complexes when the initial ph reached 9 0 would impair the effectiveness of the catalyst 48 the so4 might be captured by the oh in an alkaline environment 49 to evaluate the reaction mechanism of ds along the pathway to mineralization the primary degradation products and a number of intermediates generated during the pms based photocatalytic treatment were identified lc ms was used to monitor the degradation products by employing precise mass quantities that allowed empirical formulas to be derived using an elemental composition calculator tool resulting in a list of best match hits as shown in fig 11 prior information on the molecule pattern and the oxidative treatment is used to make the best chemical structure choice and suggestion 50 the ds molecule is predominantly attacked by sulfate radicals during pms based photocatalytic oxidation however no stable sulfate derivatives were found because they rapidly developed into carboxylate derivatives by substitution or hydrolysis the mass to charge ratio m z of 295 0 corresponds to the best fit formula ds 1 c14h11cl2no2 neutral molecule the carboxylic moiety of ds 1 reduced to an alcoholic derivative under hydroxyl attack to be predicted as ds 2 c14h13cl2no with m z of 282 2 another intermediate with an empirical formula of ds 3 c13h11cl2n with m z of 252 1 was produced by photocatalytic alcoholic elimination the ring opening reactions resulted in the formation of new organic fragments named 2 6 dicholoroacetanilide c8h7cl2no at m z 204 0 under pms oh so4 h2o2 attack further photocatalytic demethylation led to the formation of a new organic molecule at m z 190 0 called n 2 6 dichlorophenyl formamide c7h5cl2no the product was subsequently degraded further to produce organic compounds such as dichloroaniline m z 162 9 and dichlorophenyl hydroxylamine m z 177 9 these molecules went through a series of photocatalytic ring opening reactions subsequently mineralizing into carbon dioxide and water in most circumstances a catalytic redox system s understanding of which active species result in rapid pollution degradation is crucial as a result we chose methanol tert butanol tba edta 2na and bq as radical capture scavengers of so4 oh h and o2 to perform a series of radical capture studies the consequences shown in fig 12 a demonstrated that the introduction of every scavenger has a substantial inhibitory impact on ds elimination in comparison to a control group the inhibitory role of scavengers may be included in fig 12 a by contrasting the degradability of ds the existence of the aforesaid active species was also confirmed using electron spin resonance epr spectroscopy fig 12 b the traces of dmpo oh and mild dmpo so4 adducts were also identified when dmpo was added to the pms moo3 zro2 light systems and providing visible light increased the magnitude of the signals we presented a plausible mechanism to explain the improved ds degrading efficiency of pms activating moo3 zro2 light systems that rely on the above mentioned characterization and analysis results fig 13 first since more e h pairs can be formed due to moo3 zro2 composite which may increase light absorption capabilities and ds degradation performance second due to the well matched eg between moo3 and zro2 a heterojunction can develop between them preventing photoexcited e h recombination the moo3 and zro2 might hypothetically form a type ii or z scheme heterojunction fig 13 a b if a type ii heterojunction between moo3 and zro2 was seen fig 13 a photogenerated electrons should move to the cb of the zro2 while photogenerated holes move to the vb of the moo3 the redox ability was significantly reduced because the vb of zro2 with 2 44 ev was unable to produce oh for the increased redox potential for h2o oh 3 09 ev 55 57 thus it appears that the normal type ii heterojunction cannot account for the flow of electrons based on the band structures of moo3 zro2 and reactive oxygen species quenching and esr data the charge carrier transfer process in moo3 zro2 composite should follow a typical z scheme heterojunction seems more reasonable for the electronic migration behavior in the moo3 zro2 photocatalyst fig 13 b the vb xps edges of moo3 and zro2 were calculated to be 3 09 and 2 44 ev correspondingly fig 3 e f therefore the edge potential of cb for the catalysts stated above was calculated as 0 07 and 2 66 ev using the equation ecb evb eg 28 58 60 under light illumination electrons in the vbs of moo3 and zro2 became excited and hopped to the associated cbs of the catalysts the electrons in the cb of moo3 then transitioned to the interface and recombined with the h in the vb of zro2 the electrons in the cb of zro2 reacted with adsorbed o2 to form o2 species additionally the h in the vb of moo3 can directly oxidize ds or h2o oh to generate oh because of their significant oxidation potential simultaneously pms can trap e to form so4 before interacting with h2o to develop oh likewise some e being trapped by pms resulting in additional h remaining on the vb of moo3 then h on the vb of moo3 activates pms causing it to generate so4 and then oh finally more oh and o2 radicals are produced degrading and mineralizing the ds to tiny molecules which are then converted to h2o and co2 in conclusion the moo3 zro2 composite showed remarkable ds degrading capability due to the synergistic influence of photocatalysis and pms the possible reaction equations in the pms moo3 zro2 light system were seen below 2 moo 3 zro 2 h v h vb e cb 3 o 2 e cb o 2 4 o 2 h vb oh 5 hso 5 e cb so 4 oh 6 h vb h 2 o h oh 7 so 4 h 2 o h oh so 4 2 8 so 4 oh oh so 4 2 9 mo 4

and reuse ability of the moo3 zro2 composite under light illumination with the existence of pms ds degradation rate reduced little after five cycles as shown in fig 14 a implying that moo3 zro2 composite are quite stable the crystal phase of the catalyst employed was virtually identical to that of the fresh catalyst according to the xrd analysis fig 14 b it showed that moo3 zro2 composite have good stability and reusability implying that pms moo3 zro2 light system is viable for long reaction times the quantity of mo and zr that leached into the reaction solution from moo3 zro2 surface is determined in order to further elucidate the catalyst durability mo and zr concentrations were found about 1 5 and 1 8 mg l respectively consequently it can be seen that moo3 zro2 has a great potential for stability and recycling 4 conclusions in this investigation moo3 was partnered with zro2 to establish a significantly associated with a higher peroxymonosulfate oxidation mechanism that can provide greater pms activation sites compared with pristine moo3 and zro2 the moo3 zro2 confirmed significantly boosted photocatalytic performance towards the degradation of ds the charge carriers in the heterostructure moo3 zro2 followed the z scheme strategy according to radical trapping tests the analysis indicates that the synergistic effect of pms moo3 zro2 light system in combination

12704,magnesium doped spent coffee grounds mg scg biochar was fabricated in this research and its adsorption performance was investigated thoroughly in batch and column studies the effects of time ph organic matter co existing anions and water matrices on phosphate removal were explored the 500 c pyrolysis temperature mg scg 500 was proved to be the optimal condition for phosphate adsorption and achieved 111 20 mg g theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the adsorption site energy analysis revealed that 500 c pyrolysis temperature also provided more sites with suitable adsorption energy for phosphate adsorption the used mg scg 500 could be efficiently desorbed and regenerated using 1 m naoh and recalcination meanwhile mg scg showed great stability under realistic conditions in long term column experiments 20 cycles of adsorption were conducted with different contact times total treated volume and water matrices the results proved that the mg scg based column could efficiently remove the phosphate from aqueous solutions this work would extend the potential application of mg scg based column acting as a promising solution for phosphate removal and recycle from real wastewater keywords phosphate adsorptive removal and recycle mgo biochar site energy analysis column study data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uncontrolled discharge of phosphorus contaminated wastewater into water bodies would cause eutrophication inevitably which led directly to massive algal blooms and eventually deteriorated the aquatic ecosystems 1 recently many strict water standards have been formulated ranging from 0 02 mg l to 0 5 mg l of phosphate depending on the receiving water bodies 2 to meet the strict maximum concentration level mcl numerous technologies have been investigated and applied for phosphorus removal such as enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr 3 coagulation and flocculation 4 membrane technology 5 and adsorption technology 6 all technologies showed commendable phosphorus removal performance and long term stability however phosphorus in wastewater should be considered as a resource but not a pollutant phosphorus as a non renewable resource its total resources is likely to be depleted in one century while wastewater is the biggest phosphorus loss source 7 most centralized wastewater treatment plants in cities only focused on the successful removal of phosphate from wastewater while ignoring the potential recycle due to unacceptable cost and limited technology therefore phosphate recycle is as significant as phosphate removal from wastewater whereas it is only adoptable and applicable when the phosphate recycle progress is sustainable in the long term to tackle this dilemma more researchers have focused on the adsorption technology due to its dual benefits in removal and recycle of phosphate from wastewater simultaneously biochar among all adsorbents has been proven to be an eco friendly low cost and reliable adsorbent under oxygen free and high temperature conditions carbon rich biochar could be prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass 8 most biochar researches have focused on agricultural byproducts based biochar such as crop straw due to their huge production and extremely low cost mostly collection and transportation expenses 6 9 however spent coffee grounds scg as industrial biomass byproducts would be more appropriate for biochar fabrication due to their easily available access from the coffee industry more importantly the scg derived from different species and brewing methods shared similar composition mostly cellulose and hemicellulose which was suitable for its universal application in large scale production 10 normally due to the negatively charged surface most raw biochar showed unsatisfying adsorption capacities for anionic pollutants such as phosphate 1 in order to enhance phosphate adsorption performance of biochar many metals were mixed with biomass under pyrolysis to generate the crystal structure of metal oxides meanwhile the addition of metal would facilitate the pyrolysis of the biomass and help improve the inner structure 11 among all available metals magnesium and iron are environmentally friendly elements with a strong affinity for phosphate removal moreover due to the abundant sources of both metals the cost of corresponding biochar would be relatively acceptable in the real world specifically compared with fe doping mg doping would be more suitable for low mineral biomass as the bulk carbon source in the biomass would create a sufficient porous structure to support mgo crystals and therefore improve the phosphate adsorption performance 12 in this study the mg doped scg biochar was fabricated for phosphate removal from aqueous solutions previous study has proved the feasibility of mg scg biochar in phosphate removal 13 however to the best of our knowledge the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mg scg biochar fabrication and their relative adsorption performance mechanism have not been explored additionally the long term adsorption and desorption performance of the engineered mg biochar in column studies has never been reported elsewhere which is the most important influencing factor for the adsorbent application 14 therefore the main objectives of this work were to 1 fabricate the mg scg adsorbent and explore the effect of pyrolysis temperature on phosphate adsorption 2 investigate different factors influencing the adsorption performance of mg scg 3 examine the reusability and stability of mg scg and 4 verify the feasibility of mg scg based column in long term phosphate removal and recycle from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the scg was collected from a café in the campus lucky coffee all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the phosphate stock solution was prepared by the dissolution of kh2po4 with deionized water di water and stored in refrigerator the phosphate working solutions were freshly prepared by the dilution of stock solution before experiments 2 2 fabrication of adsorbent the schematic fabrication of mg scg was described in scheme 1 specifically the raw scg was dried at 105 c until constant weight afterward 30 g of dried scg were immersed in 400 ml 3 m koh and stirred for 4 h the mixed solution was kept for another 8 h the obtained scg was washed with di several times and dried next 10 g of the koh treated scg was mixed with 100 ml 0 5 m mgcl2 for 4 h and 50 ml 1 m naoh was added into the solution for the generation of mg oh 2 the obtained mixture was kept overnight finally the biomass was calcinated within a tube furnace under n2 circumstance 20 ml min with a heating rate of 10 c min the pyrolysis temperatures were set at 400 500 and 600 c and the pyrolysis progress lasted for 2 h the corresponding fabricated biochar were denoted as mg scg 400 500 600 2 3 characteristics of the adsorbent the morphology of the adsorbents was observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 ft ir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 using a ft ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 x ray diffraction spectrometer bruker d8 advance was used for the analysis of crystalline structures of the adsorbents and other materials the phpzc of adsorbents was measured using the zeta potential determining method recommended elsewhere 15 the specific surface area and porosity of the fabricated biochar were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm with micrometrics asap 2460 usa the specific surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the total pore volume was determined by the adsorbed nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0 99 16 the surface zeta potential was measured by a laser doppler electrophoretic analyzer nanobrook 90plus pals brookhaven usa 2 4 static experiments before static experiments the effect of adsorbent dosage was first explored and the results were summarized in fig s1 considering the adsorption performance and removal efficiency the adsorbent dosage was set at 0 5 g l unless otherwise stated for the kinetic studies 10 mg l of phosphate 100 ml was introduced to a 150 ml beaker which contained 0 05 g adsorbent the beakers were shaken at a speed of 180 rpm and under 25 c using a thermostatic shaker zqpz 170 tianjin leibo terry equipment co ltd china after different time intervals 2 ml aliquot of the supernatant was collected centrifuged and tested for phosphate concentration for isotherm studies 0 05 g of adsorbent was mixed with different concentrations of phosphate solutions 100 ml for 48 h the initial adsorbate concentration kept increasing until the equilibrium of the adsorbent capacity was reached for the effect of humic acid ha solutions of different ha concentrations with constant phosphate concentration 10 mg l and adsorbent dosage 1 g l were shaken until equilibrium for the effect of co existing anions solutions of different anions 3 mm with constant phosphate concentration 0 30 mm and adsorbent dosage 1 g l were shaken until equilibrium for the effect of real wastewater the wastewater effluent was spiked with phosphate stock solution to 5 mg l the phosphate concentration of the samples was determined by the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method with a uv vis spectrometer hach dr5000 usa operated at a wavelength of 700 nm all experiments were conducted with initial solution ph 7 and in triplicates unless otherwise stated the relative standard deviations of all experimental data were lower than 5 the isotherm and kinetic models were given in text s1 the adsorption site energy calculations were followed by previously published papers and given in text s2 8 17 2 5 column experiments the column experiments were conducted as shown in scheme 2 the continuous flow study was conducted in a plastic column with an inner diameter of 0 8 cm the column was filled with 1 g of the biochar and the silica wool was placed under and above the biochar for better water distribution and adsorbents maintenance the column experiments were divided into 5 phases and the details of each phase were given in table 1 for the generation of the adsorbent 10 bv of naoh solution was fed to the column in circulation for 1 h afterwards 10 bv of di water was pumped into the column for the removal of residual phosphate finally the adsorbents were collected from the column and reactivated by calcination the reactivation of the biochar followed a quick calcination 30 min and other parameters were the same as the pristine biochar fabrication during the regenerations between phases there could be a 0 5 1 loss of the adsorbents in order to maintain identical conditions the column was supplemented with pristine adsorbents according to the loss amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents characterization and performance 3 1 1 characterization the morphology of mg scg was identified and given in fig s2 in sem images all three samples showed no significant differences with clear crystal structures on the surface indicating a good deposition of magnesium oxide on the biochar moreover the ft ir xrd xps bet and zeta potential were further conducted for the adsorbent characterization as shown in fig 1a the peaks around 3500 and 1635 cm 1 were attributed to the water molecule on the adsorbent 19 the peaks at approximately 580 cm 1 were attributed to mgo bending vibrations and the peaks at 1100 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration band of mgo on the mg scg 20 21 in fig 1b the xrd results suggested that generated crystals on the biochar were mgo the peaks at 36 9 42 8 62 2 74 5 and 78 4 were assigned to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of crystalline mgo jcpds 75 0447 22 23 in addition the presence of mg element could be confirmed by using xps patterns hereto it could be confirmed that the mgo was successfully formed on the biochar the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mgo biochar was further investigated through the bet analysis fig s3 table s1 n2 adsorption desorption curves of all biochar exhibited typical type iv isotherms demonstrating that a mesoporous inner structure with interconnected pores was formed 2 the specific surface area of biochar was in order of mg scg 500 mg scg 400 mg scg 600 and the specific surface area of mg scg 500 reached 107 3 m2 g the zeta potential of the mg scg under different pyrolysis temperatures was shown in fig 1d the isoelectric points of all three biochar were around 5 7 implying the fabricated adsorbents would be negatively charged at neutral and alkaline conditions the phosphate under the same condition would exist as anions in the aqueous solutions 24 these results suggested that electrostatic attraction between phosphate and mg scg was negligible and the phosphate removal was dominated by chemisorption progress 3 1 2 adsorption kinetics among the three prepared biochar the best adsorption performance was observed with mg scg 500 fig 2a showed the time dependent adsorption progress of the three biochar as clearly illustrated the adsorption rate of phosphate onto mg scg 500 was significantly higher than others the phosphate concentration was lowered to 0 6 mg l within 10 h and the phosphate was eliminated within 48 h in comparison mg scg 600 exhibited identical equilibrium concentration but it took more time than mg scg 500 on the contrary mg scg 400 showed even faster kinetic than mg scg 500 which was probably due to the decomposition of mg scg 400 and a large amount of mg2 was dissolved in the solutions date not given for a better understanding of the adsorption kinetics of phosphate onto three biochar the detailed kinetic were evaluated by pseudo first order and pseudo second order and given in table s2 and fig 2 b c the calculated adsorption capacity from pseudo second order was consistent with the experimental values and the regression coefficients were higher therefore the adsorption kinetic could be better described by pseudo second order model indicating that the chemical adsorption was the main progress between phosphate and mg scg biochar 25 these results were in accordance with the zeta potential results of the mg scg biochar 3 1 3 adsorption isotherms in order to investigate the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the mg scg biochar was mixed with solutions of different initial phosphate concentrations and the data were fitted by langmuir freundlich and langmuir freundlich isotherms table s3 the regression coefficients proved that langmuir freundlich isotherm was more suitable for mg scg biochar and langmuir isotherm was also an acceptable model the fitting results suggested that the adsorption progress was physicochemical progress that happened on both inner micropores and outer surfaces simultaneously the n value from langmuir freundlich model was lower than 1 by mg scg 500 and mg scg 600 indicating the phosphate adsorption progress was favorable and a stronger heterogeneity of the adsorbents 26 the highest theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of 111 20 mg g was achieved by mg scg 500 which was nearly two times more than others the higher adsorption capacity of mg scg 500 could be attributed to its porous inner structure with the highest specific surface area among the three biochar the generated mgo would be more exposed due to the higher surface area more importantly as illustrated in fig 2c the data points of the mg scg 500 clustered in the lower equilibrium concentrations demonstrating its better performance in phosphate elimination from the solutions as hypothesized in isotherm models theoretical maximum adsorption capacity was achieved with increasing initial adsorbate concentrations 27 therefore many reported commendable adsorption capacities were in accompany by unacceptably high equilibrium concentrations under these scenarios the theoretical adsorption performance could not be realized in real applications in this study 38 80 and 91 14 mg g of adsorption capacity were achieved with equilibrium phosphate concentration as low as 0 60 and 4 43 mg l respectively meanwhile the comparison of adsorption capacities along with the equilibrium concentrations of different biochar was given in table 2 compared to other biochar the mg scg 500 showed higher adsorption capacity with lower equilibrium phosphate concentration this suggested the adsorption performance of mg scg 500 was capable of eliminating the low concentration phosphate in the solutions which could facilitate the application of mg scg 500 in real wastewater 28 3 1 4 effect of water chemistry the adsorption progress was inevitably affected by the water chemistry herein the effect of different initial ph on phosphate adsorption was investigated to explore the feasibility of mg scg biochar in real applications as given in fig 2e the mg scg 500 showed a stable adsorption performance under a wide ph range 3 11 specifically under circumneutral conditions 5 9 the adsorption performance of mg scg 500 was nearly unchanged likewise the removal efficiency of mg scg 400 and 600 maintained a stable trend however they were lower than 60 under all ph conditions after adsorption the equilibrium ph of the solutions turned alkaline fig 2f this might be due to the protonation of mgo on the biochar surface mgo h2o mgoh oh 29 the effect of co existing ha anions and real wastewater on phosphate adsorption was given in fig 2g h and i respectively ha as a widely existing organic matter in natural water would have an adverse impact on phosphate removal from the real water matrix 30 in this study the presence of ha did not have a significant influence on phosphate removal even at 20 mg l the removal efficiency dropped slightly from 99 to 91 for mg scg 500 for the co existing anions the presence of cl and so4 2 did not influence the phosphate removal while the presence of f significantly deteriorate the phosphate adsorption progress under the co existing anions experiments the f concentration was ten times than po4 3 3 mm and 0 3 mm for f and po4 3 respectively this would lead to preferable adsorption of f over po4 3 onto mgo 31 however according to the world health organization the maximum permitted f concentration in water is 1 5 mg l 0 08 mm which means that the effect of co existing f would not be significant under realistic conditions 32 as illustrated in fig 2i the removal of phosphate from real wastewater maintained stable and even increased which might be due to the co existing ammonia in the wastewater and other dissolved organic matter in conclusion these results proved that the mg scg 500 showed more stable adsorption performance regardless of the complex water quality demonstrating its better adsorption capacity under all conditions 3 2 adsorption mechanism 3 2 1 adsorption site energy in order to further reveal the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mg scg adsorption behavior the adsorption site energy analysis was performed as illustrated in fig 2a when the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents increased the difference in adsorption energy between adsorbent and adsorbate e decreased this confirmed the phosphate ions were preferentially adsorbed on the high energy sites of adsorbents 17 moreover the data from mg scg 600 showed different tracks from mg scg 400 and mg scg 500 significantly higher e was observed at lower equilibrium adsorption capacity while the e decreased dramatically below 20 kj mol this suggested that the high energy sites of mg scg 600 were taken by the phosphate easily but the phosphate had few contacts with lower energy sites in comparison mg scg 500 showed higher adsorption capacity as more binding sites were activated under this pyrolysis temperature and more low energy sites could be occupied less than 20 kj mol based on results from langmuir freundlich model the site energy distribution curves of phosphate onto mg scgs were given in fig 3b the weighted mean of site energy distribution μ e was calculated based on the equation given in supplementary materials and listed in fig 3b it was reported that the adsorption affinity was positively correlated with the value of μ e 37 the calculated values of μ e were 24 37 26 20 and 30 64 kj mol for mg scg 400 500 and 600 respectively which shared the same trend with e these results confirmed that the 500 c pyrolysis temperature would increase the adsorption site of the mg scg however 600 c would cause a significant inhibition effect on the low energy sites as a small proportion of sites were distributed below 25 kj mol a huge amount of chemical bonds existed between the adsorbent and adsorbate under e range from 20 to 24 kj mol 8 therefore mg scg 500 due to its larger specific surface area and distribution of energy sites between 20 and 24 kj mol showed better adsorption performance than mg scg 400 600 3 2 2 xps analysis according to previous researches phosphate could be combined with the mgo via electrostatic attraction and chemical bonding 38 39 to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of phosphate onto mg scg biochar the xps analysis was performed using pristine and used mg scg 500 and the results were shown in fig s4 the full scan spectrum of mg scg 500 after adsorption showed a new peak attributed to p 2p suggesting the phosphate was successfully loaded on the biochar after adsorption the absorbed phosphate could be divided into two types mghpo4 and mg h2po4 2 xps spectra of o 1 s showed the difference between pristine and used biochar before adsorption there were two chemical states of o in the mg scg 500 fig s4c which corresponded to the hydroxyl o oh and the lattice o ol 40 however after adsorption the ol peak disappeared fig s4d this phenomenon would be due to the hydrolysis of mgo lattice o to mg oh 2 during the phosphate adsorption progress 41 therefore it can be concluded that the ol is the main component of the active sites on mg scg 500 in addition the mg 1 s binding energy peak could be fitted with two peaks after phosphate adsorption which could be the formation of mgp components these results were in line with the p 2p peak to sum up the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was the chemical bonding into mgp compounds the replacement of hydroxyl groups from hydrolyzed mg by phosphate was the dominant progress for phosphate adsorption 3 3 reusability and stability of the adsorbent the reusability and stability of the adsorbent were vital in the adsorption progress especially in long term applications the investigation of adsorbent reusability included desorption regeneration and re adsorption progress as given in fig 4a different concentrations of naoh were applied as eluent and the desorption rates were tested under different desorption duration it was obvious that a higher concentration of naoh solution led to higher desorption rate however the desorption rate was lowered under prolonged desorption duration 2 h this phenomenon could be due to the re adsorption of mg scg 500 in p rich eluent therefore the desorption concentration and duration were chosen as 1 m and 1 h the re adsorption performance of mg scg 500 using different regeneration strategies was investigated and elucidated in fig 4b compared with re calcination regeneration the adsorption rate of air dried regenerated mg scg 500 showed completely compromised adsorption performance therefore the air drying would not be efficient enough for mg scg 500 regeneration as it failed in complete re activation of oh function groups on mg oh 2 of mg scg in the contrast the calcination could regenerate the mgo structure which would be hydrolyzed to pristine mg oh 2 these results were similar to previous work 39 as for the stability of mg scg 500 the leaching mg2 and cod concentrations under different initial ph conditions with an adsorbent dosage of 10 g l were given in fig 4 c d the acid condition ph 3 and 5 would cause decomposition of the mg scg and the supernatant cod concentration reached around 20 mg l while the cod concentrations were below the 10 mg l under neutral and alkaline conditions fig 4c considering the adsorbent dosage 10 g l it could be concluded that the dissolved organic leached from the mg scg 500 under neutral and alkaline condition was nearly negligible likewise the release mg2 concentration shared a similar trend with cod concentration a higher concentration of mg2 was detected under acid conditions due to the decomposition of mg scg while mg scg maintained the entire structure under neutral and alkaline conditions 3 4 effect of co existing ammonia many previous researches reported simultaneous adsorption of ammonia and phosphate by mg based adsorbents due to the combination of physical attraction and in situ struvite formation 42 43 however the single adsorption of ammonia in this work by mg scg was negligible data not given in order to investigate the binary adsorption of ammonia and phosphate onto mg scg simultaneously ammonia and phosphate with identical concentrations 10 200 mg l were mixed with mg scg 500 and the removal rates were given in fig 5a under all initial concentrations the phosphate removal rates could maintain higher than 90 as for ammonia removal performance under an initial concentration of 10 mg l mg scg showed no adsorption capacity of ammonia however with ammonia and phosphate concentrations increased the removal rate of ammonia raised promptly the ammonia adsorptive removal capacity of mg scg was stimulated with higher phosphate concentrations as illustrated in fig 5b the detailed amount of removed phosphate and ammonia was calculated and the slope of the blue line was 1 which could be the formation of mgnh4po4 clearly under high phosphate concentrations the removal of ammonia was not only feasible but also almost followed the 1 1 molar ratio of po4 3 removed nh4 removed this result suggested that the removal of ammonia was only due to the formation of mgnh4po4 on mg scg and could only happen under the abundant presence of ammonia and phosphate 3 5 column experiment due to the different states of the adsorbent in batch and dynamic experiments the adsorption behavior and performance would be significantly different in batch mode adsorbents would contact with adsorbate freely as the adsorbents were completely dispersed in the solution however in dynamic column experiments the adsorbents were packed in the columns the effective contact area was significantly lowered and thus deteriorated the adsorption performance 44 therefore it is considerably vital to examine the adsorption performance in columns with long term adsorption desorption cycles 45 in this work a lab scale column was set up and treated with continuous water for 20 cycles fig 6 in phase i the adsorption efficiency of the column decreased significantly from 99 2 cycle 1 to 62 9 cycle 3 fig 6a the column experienced 720 bv of phosphate water and its entire removal efficiency was 80 8 fig 6b this was due to no regeneration between these 3 cycles and therefore the entire 3 cycles could be considered as 1 cycle only di water was used between cycles fig 6c in the first 240 bv nearly all phosphate was adsorbed by the column indicating a good retainment performance of pristine mg scg column in p contaminated solutions however the discharged phosphate concentration reached 3 42 mg l at end of the 3rd cycle fig 6 d1 therefore it can be concluded that 720 bv would completely deteriorate the adsorption performance of mg scg based column in the next phase cycle 4 8 to maintain the phosphate removal performance naoh was used as regeneration eluent for the column as clearly illustrated the removal performance of the column was improved due to the successful column desorption in all 5 cycles however the removal efficiency decreased from nearly 100 4th cycle to 78 8 6th cycle and kept stable in the following cycles fig 6 d2 this phenomenon was due to the incomplete reactivation of some adsorption sites on the biochar surface which was discussed previously therefore the re calcination was applied in phase iii for the complete regeneration of the column as clearly illustrated in fig 6 d3 the effluent phosphate concentration was identical to 1st cycle and no obvious surge in phosphate concentration was observed in addition unlike phase i and ii the phosphate loss was only 0 074 mg p cycle in phase iii fig 6e therefore the combination of naoh desorption and re calcination can completely restore the phosphate removal performance of column in phase iv solution velocity was doubled in the column while the total treated volume was still the same 240 bv surprisingly no difference was detected between phase iii and iv the effluent phosphate concentrations were lower than 0 05 mg l and the average removal efficiency was maintained at 99 6 in cycle 12 14 moreover it should be noticed that under the same treated bv even better treatment performance was achieved with higher velocity 1 bv min fig 6 d4 this could be due to some dissolved phosphate from the mg scg after a prolonged duration therefore long empty bed contact time ebct did not guarantee higher removal performance achieving higher column performance encouraged increasing treated volume to 720 bv in phase v as the treated volume increased the average phosphate removal efficiency decreased to 95 67 and the effluent phosphate remained at around 0 before 480 and reached breakthrough point around 600 bv fig 6 d5 under high solution velocity and large treated volume the properly treated volume should be controlled under 600 bv for better effluent quality in the next phase the real wastewater was spiked with phosphate stock solution to 5 mg l and pumped into the column considering the complexity of the real wastewater and the previous results of the column the treated volume was set at 360 bv in phase vi although the real wastewater contains numerous co existing substances the column showed nearly 100 phosphate removal efficiency fig 6 d6 the phosphate concentration was only detectable after 300 bv this result proved that the removal of phosphate from real wastewater by the mg scg column was feasible and highly efficient interestingly the regenerated mg scg exhibited the same adsorption performance in phase vi whereas the desorption efficiency deteriorated and almost decreased to zero at cycle 19 and 20 as no phosphate was detected in the eluent meanwhile during the desorption progress of the column transparent crystal was formed in the eluent the transparent crystal could be the in situ generation of mgnh4po4 due to the presence of desorbed ammonia retained from the influent phosphate and dissolved mg2 ions in an alkaline eluent this phenomenon was also repeated by an additional cycle while synthetic wastewater 10 mg l of phosphate and 10 mg l of ammonia was used data not given this suggested the application of mg scg column in real wastewater treatment was more than feasible the partial retainment of influent ammonia would lead to the in situ generation of struvite like products in the eluent which would potentially save the subsequent cost for phosphate recovery from eluent after the long term column experiment the used mg scg was collected from the column and tested for its adsorption capacity compared with pristine mg scg as depicted in fig 6f the phosphate concentration declined rapidly in 10 h by both pristine and used mg scg a slight decrease in adsorption performance of used mg scg can be observed which could be due to the mg loss during the 20 cycles running however no significant difference occurred between pristine and used mg scg and the final phosphate concentration by used mg scg was only 0 3 mg l higher than pristine mg scg therefore the mg scg could maintain its effective adsorption performance after long term application based on these results the column showed commendable performance with different solution velocities total volumes and water matrices moreover the entire 20 cycles of the column did not have a significant impact on mg scg in conclusion the mg scg based column would be a practical choice for enhanced phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater 3 6 potential application in phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater the engineered biochar based adsorbents have been investigated in recent years different biowaste and doped metals were combined in biochar fabrication in order to improve phosphate adsorption performance as a result the obtained engineered biochar showed significantly higher adsorption performance than raw biochar however few studies have focused on the long term multiple reuses of the engineered biochar adsorbent in most published researches the saturated biochar was transferred to fertilizer in order to recycle the phosphate and dispose the used biochar properly under these scenarios the precisely fabricated biochar would turn into a one time product that would contradict the original objective remove and recycle phosphate in a sustainable way in this research the fabricated mg doped waste derived biochar was thoroughly tested for its phosphate adsorption performance essentially the adsorption performance of mg scg was remarkable as it could achieve 91 14 mg g of adsorption capacity with an equilibrium concentration of 4 43 mg l moreover the long term performance of mg scg in column was also stable and commendable the used mg scg after 20 cycles showed nearly same adsorption performance as pristine mg scg therefore the mg scg based column application in phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater was proved to be a sustainable strategy for future applications the results in this research need to be determined whether the proposed mg scg could be translated into implementable solutions to achieve sustainability therefore pilot scale studies are required in the future for operational cost and adsorption performance evaluation under scale up conditions 4 conclusion the mg doped biochar derived from spent coffee grounds mg scg was fabricated in this study with different pyrolysis temperatures and 500 c pyrolysis showed the highest adsorption capacity and fastest kinetic the performance of mg scg 500 remained stable regardless of different influencing factors in long term column experiments the effects of the regeneration method solution velocity total treated volume and real wastewater were thoroughly investigated and the mg scg 500 based column exhibited commendable phosphate removal performance besides the complete recycle of phosphate was achieved by the column regeneration long term column results demonstrated the technical viability of mg scg 500 in phosphate removal applications declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper acknowledgement this study was funded by the

12704,magnesium doped spent coffee grounds mg scg biochar was fabricated in this research and its adsorption performance was investigated thoroughly in batch and column studies the effects of time ph organic matter co existing anions and water matrices on phosphate removal were explored the 500 c pyrolysis temperature mg scg 500 was proved to be the optimal condition for phosphate adsorption and achieved 111 20 mg g theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the adsorption site energy analysis revealed that 500 c pyrolysis temperature also provided more sites with suitable adsorption energy for phosphate adsorption the used mg scg 500 could be efficiently desorbed and regenerated using 1 m naoh and recalcination meanwhile mg scg showed great stability under realistic conditions in long term column experiments 20 cycles of adsorption were conducted with different contact times total treated volume and water matrices the results proved that the mg scg based column could efficiently remove the phosphate from aqueous solutions this work would extend the potential application of mg scg based column acting as a promising solution for phosphate removal and recycle from real wastewater keywords phosphate adsorptive removal and recycle mgo biochar site energy analysis column study data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction uncontrolled discharge of phosphorus contaminated wastewater into water bodies would cause eutrophication inevitably which led directly to massive algal blooms and eventually deteriorated the aquatic ecosystems 1 recently many strict water standards have been formulated ranging from 0 02 mg l to 0 5 mg l of phosphate depending on the receiving water bodies 2 to meet the strict maximum concentration level mcl numerous technologies have been investigated and applied for phosphorus removal such as enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr 3 coagulation and flocculation 4 membrane technology 5 and adsorption technology 6 all technologies showed commendable phosphorus removal performance and long term stability however phosphorus in wastewater should be considered as a resource but not a pollutant phosphorus as a non renewable resource its total resources is likely to be depleted in one century while wastewater is the biggest phosphorus loss source 7 most centralized wastewater treatment plants in cities only focused on the successful removal of phosphate from wastewater while ignoring the potential recycle due to unacceptable cost and limited technology therefore phosphate recycle is as significant as phosphate removal from wastewater whereas it is only adoptable and applicable when the phosphate recycle progress is sustainable in the long term to tackle this dilemma more researchers have focused on the adsorption technology due to its dual benefits in removal and recycle of phosphate from wastewater simultaneously biochar among all adsorbents has been proven to be an eco friendly low cost and reliable adsorbent under oxygen free and high temperature conditions carbon rich biochar could be prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass 8 most biochar researches have focused on agricultural byproducts based biochar such as crop straw due to their huge production and extremely low cost mostly collection and transportation expenses 6 9 however spent coffee grounds scg as industrial biomass byproducts would be more appropriate for biochar fabrication due to their easily available access from the coffee industry more importantly the scg derived from different species and brewing methods shared similar composition mostly cellulose and hemicellulose which was suitable for its universal application in large scale production 10 normally due to the negatively charged surface most raw biochar showed unsatisfying adsorption capacities for anionic pollutants such as phosphate 1 in order to enhance phosphate adsorption performance of biochar many metals were mixed with biomass under pyrolysis to generate the crystal structure of metal oxides meanwhile the addition of metal would facilitate the pyrolysis of the biomass and help improve the inner structure 11 among all available metals magnesium and iron are environmentally friendly elements with a strong affinity for phosphate removal moreover due to the abundant sources of both metals the cost of corresponding biochar would be relatively acceptable in the real world specifically compared with fe doping mg doping would be more suitable for low mineral biomass as the bulk carbon source in the biomass would create a sufficient porous structure to support mgo crystals and therefore improve the phosphate adsorption performance 12 in this study the mg doped scg biochar was fabricated for phosphate removal from aqueous solutions previous study has proved the feasibility of mg scg biochar in phosphate removal 13 however to the best of our knowledge the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mg scg biochar fabrication and their relative adsorption performance mechanism have not been explored additionally the long term adsorption and desorption performance of the engineered mg biochar in column studies has never been reported elsewhere which is the most important influencing factor for the adsorbent application 14 therefore the main objectives of this work were to 1 fabricate the mg scg adsorbent and explore the effect of pyrolysis temperature on phosphate adsorption 2 investigate different factors influencing the adsorption performance of mg scg 3 examine the reusability and stability of mg scg and 4 verify the feasibility of mg scg based column in long term phosphate removal and recycle from aqueous solutions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the scg was collected from a café in the campus lucky coffee all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the phosphate stock solution was prepared by the dissolution of kh2po4 with deionized water di water and stored in refrigerator the phosphate working solutions were freshly prepared by the dilution of stock solution before experiments 2 2 fabrication of adsorbent the schematic fabrication of mg scg was described in scheme 1 specifically the raw scg was dried at 105 c until constant weight afterward 30 g of dried scg were immersed in 400 ml 3 m koh and stirred for 4 h the mixed solution was kept for another 8 h the obtained scg was washed with di several times and dried next 10 g of the koh treated scg was mixed with 100 ml 0 5 m mgcl2 for 4 h and 50 ml 1 m naoh was added into the solution for the generation of mg oh 2 the obtained mixture was kept overnight finally the biomass was calcinated within a tube furnace under n2 circumstance 20 ml min with a heating rate of 10 c min the pyrolysis temperatures were set at 400 500 and 600 c and the pyrolysis progress lasted for 2 h the corresponding fabricated biochar were denoted as mg scg 400 500 600 2 3 characteristics of the adsorbent the morphology of the adsorbents was observed by a scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi s 4800 ft ir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 500 cm 1 using a ft ir spectrometer nicolet 6700 x ray diffraction spectrometer bruker d8 advance was used for the analysis of crystalline structures of the adsorbents and other materials the phpzc of adsorbents was measured using the zeta potential determining method recommended elsewhere 15 the specific surface area and porosity of the fabricated biochar were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherm with micrometrics asap 2460 usa the specific surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet method and the total pore volume was determined by the adsorbed nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0 99 16 the surface zeta potential was measured by a laser doppler electrophoretic analyzer nanobrook 90plus pals brookhaven usa 2 4 static experiments before static experiments the effect of adsorbent dosage was first explored and the results were summarized in fig s1 considering the adsorption performance and removal efficiency the adsorbent dosage was set at 0 5 g l unless otherwise stated for the kinetic studies 10 mg l of phosphate 100 ml was introduced to a 150 ml beaker which contained 0 05 g adsorbent the beakers were shaken at a speed of 180 rpm and under 25 c using a thermostatic shaker zqpz 170 tianjin leibo terry equipment co ltd china after different time intervals 2 ml aliquot of the supernatant was collected centrifuged and tested for phosphate concentration for isotherm studies 0 05 g of adsorbent was mixed with different concentrations of phosphate solutions 100 ml for 48 h the initial adsorbate concentration kept increasing until the equilibrium of the adsorbent capacity was reached for the effect of humic acid ha solutions of different ha concentrations with constant phosphate concentration 10 mg l and adsorbent dosage 1 g l were shaken until equilibrium for the effect of co existing anions solutions of different anions 3 mm with constant phosphate concentration 0 30 mm and adsorbent dosage 1 g l were shaken until equilibrium for the effect of real wastewater the wastewater effluent was spiked with phosphate stock solution to 5 mg l the phosphate concentration of the samples was determined by the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method with a uv vis spectrometer hach dr5000 usa operated at a wavelength of 700 nm all experiments were conducted with initial solution ph 7 and in triplicates unless otherwise stated the relative standard deviations of all experimental data were lower than 5 the isotherm and kinetic models were given in text s1 the adsorption site energy calculations were followed by previously published papers and given in text s2 8 17 2 5 column experiments the column experiments were conducted as shown in scheme 2 the continuous flow study was conducted in a plastic column with an inner diameter of 0 8 cm the column was filled with 1 g of the biochar and the silica wool was placed under and above the biochar for better water distribution and adsorbents maintenance the column experiments were divided into 5 phases and the details of each phase were given in table 1 for the generation of the adsorbent 10 bv of naoh solution was fed to the column in circulation for 1 h afterwards 10 bv of di water was pumped into the column for the removal of residual phosphate finally the adsorbents were collected from the column and reactivated by calcination the reactivation of the biochar followed a quick calcination 30 min and other parameters were the same as the pristine biochar fabrication during the regenerations between phases there could be a 0 5 1 loss of the adsorbents in order to maintain identical conditions the column was supplemented with pristine adsorbents according to the loss amount 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbents characterization and performance 3 1 1 characterization the morphology of mg scg was identified and given in fig s2 in sem images all three samples showed no significant differences with clear crystal structures on the surface indicating a good deposition of magnesium oxide on the biochar moreover the ft ir xrd xps bet and zeta potential were further conducted for the adsorbent characterization as shown in fig 1a the peaks around 3500 and 1635 cm 1 were attributed to the water molecule on the adsorbent 19 the peaks at approximately 580 cm 1 were attributed to mgo bending vibrations and the peaks at 1100 cm 1 represented the stretching vibration band of mgo on the mg scg 20 21 in fig 1b the xrd results suggested that generated crystals on the biochar were mgo the peaks at 36 9 42 8 62 2 74 5 and 78 4 were assigned to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of crystalline mgo jcpds 75 0447 22 23 in addition the presence of mg element could be confirmed by using xps patterns hereto it could be confirmed that the mgo was successfully formed on the biochar the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mgo biochar was further investigated through the bet analysis fig s3 table s1 n2 adsorption desorption curves of all biochar exhibited typical type iv isotherms demonstrating that a mesoporous inner structure with interconnected pores was formed 2 the specific surface area of biochar was in order of mg scg 500 mg scg 400 mg scg 600 and the specific surface area of mg scg 500 reached 107 3 m2 g the zeta potential of the mg scg under different pyrolysis temperatures was shown in fig 1d the isoelectric points of all three biochar were around 5 7 implying the fabricated adsorbents would be negatively charged at neutral and alkaline conditions the phosphate under the same condition would exist as anions in the aqueous solutions 24 these results suggested that electrostatic attraction between phosphate and mg scg was negligible and the phosphate removal was dominated by chemisorption progress 3 1 2 adsorption kinetics among the three prepared biochar the best adsorption performance was observed with mg scg 500 fig 2a showed the time dependent adsorption progress of the three biochar as clearly illustrated the adsorption rate of phosphate onto mg scg 500 was significantly higher than others the phosphate concentration was lowered to 0 6 mg l within 10 h and the phosphate was eliminated within 48 h in comparison mg scg 600 exhibited identical equilibrium concentration but it took more time than mg scg 500 on the contrary mg scg 400 showed even faster kinetic than mg scg 500 which was probably due to the decomposition of mg scg 400 and a large amount of mg2 was dissolved in the solutions date not given for a better understanding of the adsorption kinetics of phosphate onto three biochar the detailed kinetic were evaluated by pseudo first order and pseudo second order and given in table s2 and fig 2 b c the calculated adsorption capacity from pseudo second order was consistent with the experimental values and the regression coefficients were higher therefore the adsorption kinetic could be better described by pseudo second order model indicating that the chemical adsorption was the main progress between phosphate and mg scg biochar 25 these results were in accordance with the zeta potential results of the mg scg biochar 3 1 3 adsorption isotherms in order to investigate the theoretical maximum adsorption capacity the mg scg biochar was mixed with solutions of different initial phosphate concentrations and the data were fitted by langmuir freundlich and langmuir freundlich isotherms table s3 the regression coefficients proved that langmuir freundlich isotherm was more suitable for mg scg biochar and langmuir isotherm was also an acceptable model the fitting results suggested that the adsorption progress was physicochemical progress that happened on both inner micropores and outer surfaces simultaneously the n value from langmuir freundlich model was lower than 1 by mg scg 500 and mg scg 600 indicating the phosphate adsorption progress was favorable and a stronger heterogeneity of the adsorbents 26 the highest theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of 111 20 mg g was achieved by mg scg 500 which was nearly two times more than others the higher adsorption capacity of mg scg 500 could be attributed to its porous inner structure with the highest specific surface area among the three biochar the generated mgo would be more exposed due to the higher surface area more importantly as illustrated in fig 2c the data points of the mg scg 500 clustered in the lower equilibrium concentrations demonstrating its better performance in phosphate elimination from the solutions as hypothesized in isotherm models theoretical maximum adsorption capacity was achieved with increasing initial adsorbate concentrations 27 therefore many reported commendable adsorption capacities were in accompany by unacceptably high equilibrium concentrations under these scenarios the theoretical adsorption performance could not be realized in real applications in this study 38 80 and 91 14 mg g of adsorption capacity were achieved with equilibrium phosphate concentration as low as 0 60 and 4 43 mg l respectively meanwhile the comparison of adsorption capacities along with the equilibrium concentrations of different biochar was given in table 2 compared to other biochar the mg scg 500 showed higher adsorption capacity with lower equilibrium phosphate concentration this suggested the adsorption performance of mg scg 500 was capable of eliminating the low concentration phosphate in the solutions which could facilitate the application of mg scg 500 in real wastewater 28 3 1 4 effect of water chemistry the adsorption progress was inevitably affected by the water chemistry herein the effect of different initial ph on phosphate adsorption was investigated to explore the feasibility of mg scg biochar in real applications as given in fig 2e the mg scg 500 showed a stable adsorption performance under a wide ph range 3 11 specifically under circumneutral conditions 5 9 the adsorption performance of mg scg 500 was nearly unchanged likewise the removal efficiency of mg scg 400 and 600 maintained a stable trend however they were lower than 60 under all ph conditions after adsorption the equilibrium ph of the solutions turned alkaline fig 2f this might be due to the protonation of mgo on the biochar surface mgo h2o mgoh oh 29 the effect of co existing ha anions and real wastewater on phosphate adsorption was given in fig 2g h and i respectively ha as a widely existing organic matter in natural water would have an adverse impact on phosphate removal from the real water matrix 30 in this study the presence of ha did not have a significant influence on phosphate removal even at 20 mg l the removal efficiency dropped slightly from 99 to 91 for mg scg 500 for the co existing anions the presence of cl and so4 2 did not influence the phosphate removal while the presence of f significantly deteriorate the phosphate adsorption progress under the co existing anions experiments the f concentration was ten times than po4 3 3 mm and 0 3 mm for f and po4 3 respectively this would lead to preferable adsorption of f over po4 3 onto mgo 31 however according to the world health organization the maximum permitted f concentration in water is 1 5 mg l 0 08 mm which means that the effect of co existing f would not be significant under realistic conditions 32 as illustrated in fig 2i the removal of phosphate from real wastewater maintained stable and even increased which might be due to the co existing ammonia in the wastewater and other dissolved organic matter in conclusion these results proved that the mg scg 500 showed more stable adsorption performance regardless of the complex water quality demonstrating its better adsorption capacity under all conditions 3 2 adsorption mechanism 3 2 1 adsorption site energy in order to further reveal the effect of pyrolysis temperature on mg scg adsorption behavior the adsorption site energy analysis was performed as illustrated in fig 2a when the adsorption capacity of different adsorbents increased the difference in adsorption energy between adsorbent and adsorbate e decreased this confirmed the phosphate ions were preferentially adsorbed on the high energy sites of adsorbents 17 moreover the data from mg scg 600 showed different tracks from mg scg 400 and mg scg 500 significantly higher e was observed at lower equilibrium adsorption capacity while the e decreased dramatically below 20 kj mol this suggested that the high energy sites of mg scg 600 were taken by the phosphate easily but the phosphate had few contacts with lower energy sites in comparison mg scg 500 showed higher adsorption capacity as more binding sites were activated under this pyrolysis temperature and more low energy sites could be occupied less than 20 kj mol based on results from langmuir freundlich model the site energy distribution curves of phosphate onto mg scgs were given in fig 3b the weighted mean of site energy distribution μ e was calculated based on the equation given in supplementary materials and listed in fig 3b it was reported that the adsorption affinity was positively correlated with the value of μ e 37 the calculated values of μ e were 24 37 26 20 and 30 64 kj mol for mg scg 400 500 and 600 respectively which shared the same trend with e these results confirmed that the 500 c pyrolysis temperature would increase the adsorption site of the mg scg however 600 c would cause a significant inhibition effect on the low energy sites as a small proportion of sites were distributed below 25 kj mol a huge amount of chemical bonds existed between the adsorbent and adsorbate under e range from 20 to 24 kj mol 8 therefore mg scg 500 due to its larger specific surface area and distribution of energy sites between 20 and 24 kj mol showed better adsorption performance than mg scg 400 600 3 2 2 xps analysis according to previous researches phosphate could be combined with the mgo via electrostatic attraction and chemical bonding 38 39 to further investigate the adsorption mechanism of phosphate onto mg scg biochar the xps analysis was performed using pristine and used mg scg 500 and the results were shown in fig s4 the full scan spectrum of mg scg 500 after adsorption showed a new peak attributed to p 2p suggesting the phosphate was successfully loaded on the biochar after adsorption the absorbed phosphate could be divided into two types mghpo4 and mg h2po4 2 xps spectra of o 1 s showed the difference between pristine and used biochar before adsorption there were two chemical states of o in the mg scg 500 fig s4c which corresponded to the hydroxyl o oh and the lattice o ol 40 however after adsorption the ol peak disappeared fig s4d this phenomenon would be due to the hydrolysis of mgo lattice o to mg oh 2 during the phosphate adsorption progress 41 therefore it can be concluded that the ol is the main component of the active sites on mg scg 500 in addition the mg 1 s binding energy peak could be fitted with two peaks after phosphate adsorption which could be the formation of mgp components these results were in line with the p 2p peak to sum up the mechanism of phosphate adsorption was the chemical bonding into mgp compounds the replacement of hydroxyl groups from hydrolyzed mg by phosphate was the dominant progress for phosphate adsorption 3 3 reusability and stability of the adsorbent the reusability and stability of the adsorbent were vital in the adsorption progress especially in long term applications the investigation of adsorbent reusability included desorption regeneration and re adsorption progress as given in fig 4a different concentrations of naoh were applied as eluent and the desorption rates were tested under different desorption duration it was obvious that a higher concentration of naoh solution led to higher desorption rate however the desorption rate was lowered under prolonged desorption duration 2 h this phenomenon could be due to the re adsorption of mg scg 500 in p rich eluent therefore the desorption concentration and duration were chosen as 1 m and 1 h the re adsorption performance of mg scg 500 using different regeneration strategies was investigated and elucidated in fig 4b compared with re calcination regeneration the adsorption rate of air dried regenerated mg scg 500 showed completely compromised adsorption performance therefore the air drying would not be efficient enough for mg scg 500 regeneration as it failed in complete re activation of oh function groups on mg oh 2 of mg scg in the contrast the calcination could regenerate the mgo structure which would be hydrolyzed to pristine mg oh 2 these results were similar to previous work 39 as for the stability of mg scg 500 the leaching mg2 and cod concentrations under different initial ph conditions with an adsorbent dosage of 10 g l were given in fig 4 c d the acid condition ph 3 and 5 would cause decomposition of the mg scg and the supernatant cod concentration reached around 20 mg l while the cod concentrations were below the 10 mg l under neutral and alkaline conditions fig 4c considering the adsorbent dosage 10 g l it could be concluded that the dissolved organic leached from the mg scg 500 under neutral and alkaline condition was nearly negligible likewise the release mg2 concentration shared a similar trend with cod concentration a higher concentration of mg2 was detected under acid conditions due to the decomposition of mg scg while mg scg maintained the entire structure under neutral and alkaline conditions 3 4 effect of co existing ammonia many previous researches reported simultaneous adsorption of ammonia and phosphate by mg based adsorbents due to the combination of physical attraction and in situ struvite formation 42 43 however the single adsorption of ammonia in this work by mg scg was negligible data not given in order to investigate the binary adsorption of ammonia and phosphate onto mg scg simultaneously ammonia and phosphate with identical concentrations 10 200 mg l were mixed with mg scg 500 and the removal rates were given in fig 5a under all initial concentrations the phosphate removal rates could maintain higher than 90 as for ammonia removal performance under an initial concentration of 10 mg l mg scg showed no adsorption capacity of ammonia however with ammonia and phosphate concentrations increased the removal rate of ammonia raised promptly the ammonia adsorptive removal capacity of mg scg was stimulated with higher phosphate concentrations as illustrated in fig 5b the detailed amount of removed phosphate and ammonia was calculated and the slope of the blue line was 1 which could be the formation of mgnh4po4 clearly under high phosphate concentrations the removal of ammonia was not only feasible but also almost followed the 1 1 molar ratio of po4 3 removed nh4 removed this result suggested that the removal of ammonia was only due to the formation of mgnh4po4 on mg scg and could only happen under the abundant presence of ammonia and phosphate 3 5 column experiment due to the different states of the adsorbent in batch and dynamic experiments the adsorption behavior and performance would be significantly different in batch mode adsorbents would contact with adsorbate freely as the adsorbents were completely dispersed in the solution however in dynamic column experiments the adsorbents were packed in the columns the effective contact area was significantly lowered and thus deteriorated the adsorption performance 44 therefore it is considerably vital to examine the adsorption performance in columns with long term adsorption desorption cycles 45 in this work a lab scale column was set up and treated with continuous water for 20 cycles fig 6 in phase i the adsorption efficiency of the column decreased significantly from 99 2 cycle 1 to 62 9 cycle 3 fig 6a the column experienced 720 bv of phosphate water and its entire removal efficiency was 80 8 fig 6b this was due to no regeneration between these 3 cycles and therefore the entire 3 cycles could be considered as 1 cycle only di water was used between cycles fig 6c in the first 240 bv nearly all phosphate was adsorbed by the column indicating a good retainment performance of pristine mg scg column in p contaminated solutions however the discharged phosphate concentration reached 3 42 mg l at end of the 3rd cycle fig 6 d1 therefore it can be concluded that 720 bv would completely deteriorate the adsorption performance of mg scg based column in the next phase cycle 4 8 to maintain the phosphate removal performance naoh was used as regeneration eluent for the column as clearly illustrated the removal performance of the column was improved due to the successful column desorption in all 5 cycles however the removal efficiency decreased from nearly 100 4th cycle to 78 8 6th cycle and kept stable in the following cycles fig 6 d2 this phenomenon was due to the incomplete reactivation of some adsorption sites on the biochar surface which was discussed previously therefore the re calcination was applied in phase iii for the complete regeneration of the column as clearly illustrated in fig 6 d3 the effluent phosphate concentration was identical to 1st cycle and no obvious surge in phosphate concentration was observed in addition unlike phase i and ii the phosphate loss was only 0 074 mg p cycle in phase iii fig 6e therefore the combination of naoh desorption and re calcination can completely restore the phosphate removal performance of column in phase iv solution velocity was doubled in the column while the total treated volume was still the same 240 bv surprisingly no difference was detected between phase iii and iv the effluent phosphate concentrations were lower than 0 05 mg l and the average removal efficiency was maintained at 99 6 in cycle 12 14 moreover it should be noticed that under the same treated bv even better treatment performance was achieved with higher velocity 1 bv min fig 6 d4 this could be due to some dissolved phosphate from the mg scg after a prolonged duration therefore long empty bed contact time ebct did not guarantee higher removal performance achieving higher column performance encouraged increasing treated volume to 720 bv in phase v as the treated volume increased the average phosphate removal efficiency decreased to 95 67 and the effluent phosphate remained at around 0 before 480 and reached breakthrough point around 600 bv fig 6 d5 under high solution velocity and large treated volume the properly treated volume should be controlled under 600 bv for better effluent quality in the next phase the real wastewater was spiked with phosphate stock solution to 5 mg l and pumped into the column considering the complexity of the real wastewater and the previous results of the column the treated volume was set at 360 bv in phase vi although the real wastewater contains numerous co existing substances the column showed nearly 100 phosphate removal efficiency fig 6 d6 the phosphate concentration was only detectable after 300 bv this result proved that the removal of phosphate from real wastewater by the mg scg column was feasible and highly efficient interestingly the regenerated mg scg exhibited the same adsorption performance in phase vi whereas the desorption efficiency deteriorated and almost decreased to zero at cycle 19 and 20 as no phosphate was detected in the eluent meanwhile during the desorption progress of the column transparent crystal was formed in the eluent the transparent crystal could be the in situ generation of mgnh4po4 due to the presence of desorbed ammonia retained from the influent phosphate and dissolved mg2 ions in an alkaline eluent this phenomenon was also repeated by an additional cycle while synthetic wastewater 10 mg l of phosphate and 10 mg l of ammonia was used data not given this suggested the application of mg scg column in real wastewater treatment was more than feasible the partial retainment of influent ammonia would lead to the in situ generation of struvite like products in the eluent which would potentially save the subsequent cost for phosphate recovery from eluent after the long term column experiment the used mg scg was collected from the column and tested for its adsorption capacity compared with pristine mg scg as depicted in fig 6f the phosphate concentration declined rapidly in 10 h by both pristine and used mg scg a slight decrease in adsorption performance of used mg scg can be observed which could be due to the mg loss during the 20 cycles running however no significant difference occurred between pristine and used mg scg and the final phosphate concentration by used mg scg was only 0 3 mg l higher than pristine mg scg therefore the mg scg could maintain its effective adsorption performance after long term application based on these results the column showed commendable performance with different solution velocities total volumes and water matrices moreover the entire 20 cycles of the column did not have a significant impact on mg scg in conclusion the mg scg based column would be a practical choice for enhanced phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater 3 6 potential application in phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater the engineered biochar based adsorbents have been investigated in recent years different biowaste and doped metals were combined in biochar fabrication in order to improve phosphate adsorption performance as a result the obtained engineered biochar showed significantly higher adsorption performance than raw biochar however few studies have focused on the long term multiple reuses of the engineered biochar adsorbent in most published researches the saturated biochar was transferred to fertilizer in order to recycle the phosphate and dispose the used biochar properly under these scenarios the precisely fabricated biochar would turn into a one time product that would contradict the original objective remove and recycle phosphate in a sustainable way in this research the fabricated mg doped waste derived biochar was thoroughly tested for its phosphate adsorption performance essentially the adsorption performance of mg scg was remarkable as it could achieve 91 14 mg g of adsorption capacity with an equilibrium concentration of 4 43 mg l moreover the long term performance of mg scg in column was also stable and commendable the used mg scg after 20 cycles showed nearly same adsorption performance as pristine mg scg therefore the mg scg based column application in phosphate removal and recycle from wastewater was proved to be a sustainable strategy for future applications the results in this research need to be determined whether the proposed mg scg could be translated into implementable solutions to achieve sustainability therefore pilot scale studies are required in the future for operational cost and adsorption performance evaluation under scale up conditions 4 conclusion the mg doped biochar derived from spent coffee grounds mg scg was fabricated in this study with different pyrolysis temperatures and 500 c pyrolysis showed the highest adsorption capacity and fastest kinetic the performance of mg scg 500 remained stable regardless of different influencing factors in long term column experiments the effects of the regeneration method solution velocity total treated volume and real wastewater were thoroughly investigated and the mg scg 500 based column exhibited commendable phosphate removal performance besides the complete recycle of phosphate was achieved by the column regeneration long term column results demonstrated the technical viability of mg scg 500 in phosphate
