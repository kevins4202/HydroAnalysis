10385,reference evapotranspiration et0 is usually calculated as a pre requisite to obtain the actual evapotranspiration et estimation of et0 using extreme learning machine elm is a new norm due to its excellent computation efficiency and its lower data dependency however the lack of stochastic tuning often results in the convergence to the local optima instead of the global optimum this study attempts to address this issue by hybridizing the elm with three swarm based optimization algorithms namely the particle swarm optimization pso the moth flame optimization mfo and the whale optimization algorithm woa with different fitness functions this study was conducted with three stations in sabah and sarawak states in east malaysia as this region is to a very large extent covered with oil palm plantation the water resources management is thus rather crucial for the area the results showed that the woa elm achieved a higher average rank score relative to the pso elm and mfo elm especially when the simple taylor skill score was used as the fitness function the application of different fitness functions did not show any significant effect the reported standard deviations of the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 for the three variations of the hybridized elm were close to 0 thus reflecting their similarity in accuracy however in terms of computational efficiency the simple taylor skill score exhibited better stability where it could effectively reduce the number of required hidden neurons when the input meteorological parameters were decreased the woa was suggested as the best optimization algorithm for this study for the three stations respectively it achieved an average mae rmse and r2 of 0 0007 to 0 1443 0 0011 to 0 1927 and 1 0000 to 0 9486 from cases c1 to c6 with minimum time cost keywords extreme learning machine reference evapotranspiration particle swarm optimization moth flame optimization whale optimization algorithm fitness function 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a term that refers to the total water that is naturally transferred from the earth surfaces to the atmosphere via the evaporation and transpiration processes pokorny 2019 it plays an essential role in maintaining the energy and moisture balances between the earth surface and the atmosphere there is a need for the accurate quantification of the et especially where agricultural activities contribute to the main economy of the region therefore et becomes an important consideration for regional water resources planning as well as allocation lysimetric measurement is the most direct way of retrieving et information but however apart from it being a laborious undertaking its high setup capital maintenance cost as well as low coverage hinders the use of lysimeters chia et al 2020a alternatively mathematical or empirical modelling are considered for estimating et based on the energy balance approach and related assumptions to date the penman monteith pm model has been and is still being regarded as the standard reference for et estimation through the computation of reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 the generalizability of et0 gained wider acceptance as it can be well fitted to different types of crops through the inclusion of a crop coefficient kc xiang et al 2020 however the popularization of the pm model has been limited by its high dependency on the accurate meteorological parameters almorox et al 2016 tikhamarine et al 2020 the latest approaches have in turn shifted the attention of the researchers to soft computing techniques for estimating et0 such as the machine learning methods granata 2019 granata et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2019 the pioneer of conducting such research was kumar et al 2002 where they studied the feasibility of estimating et0 in california using the multilayer perceptron mlp which is one of the variant of the artificial neural network ann it was found that by using lysimetric readings as the reference the mlp achieved estimations with lower errors as compared to the pm model since then the ann has attracted enormous interest in the engineering application for et0 estimation chia et al 2020b different variations of the ann had been deployed for such purposes ferreira et al 2019 reported that the performance of the mlp was better than that of the support vector machine svm in predicting the et0 in brazil when different scenarios of missing data were considered feng et al 2017a contrasted the performance between the generalized regression neural network grnn and the random forest rf when faced with limited meteorological parameters in china it was found that although the grnn and rf had similar performances however the grnn tended to underestimate et0 which was due to its slightly lower accuracy as compared to the rf model yassin et al 2016 on the other hand included a back propagation algorithm to the mlp to transform it into the back propagation neural network bpnn to estimate et0 in saudi arabia the authors concluded that such modification inclusion of back propagation algorithm was necessary in order to close the accuracy gap between the ann and pm models hybrid models that were off shoots from ann were also used for et0 estimation and these included the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and the wavelet neural network wnn mohammadrezapour et al 2019 patil and deka 2015 petković et al 2020 saggi and jain 2019 used an extreme version of the mlp where the hidden layers were increased drastically to form a deep learning network for et0 prediction in the northern state of india the reported results showed that by using a deep learning network accuracy of the prediction model could be increased while avoiding the risk of overfitting from the literatures it can be seen that the application of ann is widespread in terms of spatial variability besides the flexibility of the ann s structure allows different variations to be developed one variation of the ann that had captured much attention is the extreme learning machine elm developed in the 2000s huang et al 2006 the unique characteristic of the elm is that it only requires a single layer of hidden neurons this has been a main contributor to its high efficiency where computational time cost can be minimized kisi and alizamir 2018 suggested that the elm possessed several advantages over the conventional ann and these included the fast learning speed better generalization and requires less human intervention the elm had been successfully used to predict et0 in several cases abdullah et al 2015 compared the performance of the elm with bpnn and concluded the two machine learning tools could produce output with similar accuracy however the authors still favored the elm over bpnn due to its high computational efficiency numerous follow up studies have arrived at similar conclusions feng et al 2016 2017b patil and deka 2016 having said that the defects possessed by the elm are also prominent as the internal parameters of the elm is randomly initialized the absence of stochastic training has resulted in the high possibility of convergence to the local optima instead of the global optimum estimation of the kernel based elm can be improved by fine tuning the internal parameters especially the number of neurons in the hidden layer conventionally grid search and gradient descent methods are used for optimizing models however these algorithms can be ineffective when models have high complexity bio inspired optimization algorithms have aroused popularity recently as the meta heuristic optimization methods rely on simple concepts able to bypass local optima and the information regarding the gradient can be neglected mirjalili and lewis 2016 the swarm based optimization which works on the basis of exploring and exploiting within the search space has been widely applied in the hydrological processes modeling wu et al 2020 wu et al 2019 compared the hybridized elm using three swarm based optimizations flower pollination algorithm cuckoo search algorithm and ant colony optimization with the evolutionary algorithm for et0 estimation over the whole of china the authors concluded that flower pollination algorithm offered the best improvement on elm followed by the cuckoo search algorithm both categorized as swarm based optimization zhu et al 2020 applied particle swarm optimization pso to improve the performance of the elm in the case of limited meteorological data the hybridized elm has the potential as a better estimation tool for et0 estimation in the northwest of china hence this paper served to address the issue by performing a more in depth study on the hybridized elm for et0 estimation the stochastic training provided by the optimization algorithm indeed would improve the accuracy of et0 estimation by elm the subject matter that the authors are concerned with is the distinction between the mechanisms of different algorithms and their effects on the elm estimation to the best knowledge of the authors there has been a lack of the comparison amongst some of the most notable swarm based optimization algorithms in enhancing the performance of the elm for et0 estimation besides there had been no universal fitness function adopted to optimize the internal parameters of the elm the main contribution of this work is to determine an appropriate optimization algorithm with its attending objective function to be integrated with the elm successful hybridization can lead to high optimization efficiency as well as results with minimal computational cost however it is impossible for the authors to practically attempt with all the available optimization algorithms therefore the scope of interest has been focused on the swarm based optimizations due to the lack of comparison as mentioned earlier in the text therefore this work approach is set out to 1 hybridize and optimize the elm using different swarm based optimization algorithm 2 compare the efficiency of the hybridized elm using different fitness functions 3 understand the relationship between the input combinations with the number of neurons in the hidden layer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study was conducted in the two states namely sabah and sarawak located in east malaysia daily meteorological data which included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean temperature tmean relative humidity rh wind speed at altitude of 2 m u2 and solar radiation rs were collected from the malaysian meteorological department mmd for the three selected stations for the years 2014 2018 this amounted to 1826 data points at each of the station the three selected stations were station 96491 sandakan sabah station 96449 miri sarawak and station 96421 sibu sarawak a tropical climate exists in these areas where the weather is warm and humid all year long as of 2015 the land covered by oil palm plantations was 53 and 45 for sabah and sarawak respectively miettinen et al 2018 this had made the area an interesting study area as the crops which rely entirely on rain fed irrigation would consume a considerable amount of water resources subramaniam and hashim 2018 thus the efficient water resources management in this region is vital for the sustainability of the regional economy the locations of the selected stations are shown in fig 1 the details of the stations are presented in table 1 2 2 penman monteith model the elm requires supervised training in order for it to predict et0 in this study since lysimetric readings were absent the et0 calculated from the pm model were used as training targets for the elm as it was regarded as the standard for et0 estimation by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations allen et al 1998 the pm model is depicted as in eq 1 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is daily reference evapotranspiration mm day rn is net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is soil heat flux mjm 2day 1 t is daily mean temperature c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s es is mean saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is actual vapor pressure kpa δ is slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c and γ is psychrometric constant kpa c 2 3 extreme learning machine the elm works on the principle of single hidden layer feed forward neural network an activation function is required to perform feature mapping of the input parameters into a multidimensional elm random feature space the output of an elm can be computed using eq 2 2 f l x i 1 l h i β i where l is the number of hidden neurons hi is the output of ith hidden neuron and βi is the output weight between for the ith hidden neuron and output node in order to solve for the weight matrix the algorithm of the elm has to solve for eq 3 3 h βt where h is the vector of output of the hidden neurons β is their corresponding output weight and t is the target vector as for the activation function of the elm there is no standard methodology however by referring to a previous study kisi and alizamir 2018 had adopted the radial basis function rbf as the activation function for the elm hence drawing from this the rbf was used to integrate the output of individual hidden neurons as shown in eq 4 4 h x n x i e x p γ x n x i 2 2 σ 2 where xn and xi are the nth and ith term of the input vector σ2 is the variance and γ is parameters needed to be tuned 2 4 optimization algorithms in this study the estimations of the elm were optimized using the swarm based optimization algorithms by tuning the number of neurons in the hidden layer three well known optimization algorithms were selected for the purpose namely the pso the moth flame optimization mfo and the whale optimization algorithm woa to find out the better option 2 4 1 particle swarm optimization the pso was proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 where it mimics the collaborative behavior of biological populations each particle in the swarm in the feature space possesses a fitness value that indicates the current state the all particles communicate with one another to search for the best fitness by repetitive computation and communication the swarm will migrate towards the global optimum expressly the algorithm of the pso can be represented by eqs 5 and 6 to update the particles positions and velocities 5 xt 1 xt vt 1 6 vt 1 wvt c1r1 pt xt c2r2 pg t xt where x is the vector of particles positions v is the vector of the particles velocities p is the vector of particles personal best position pg is the global best position w is the inertial weight c1 and c2 are cognitive and social scaling parameters respectively and r1 and r2 and uniformly distributed random values 2 4 2 moth flame optimization the mfo exploits the sensitivity of the moth bug towards light this type of navigation is known as the transverse orientation navigation according to mirjalili 2015 the transverse orientation navigation allows the moth to fly at a constant angle towards the source of light for example the moon however when the source of light is near to the moth the moth will fly spirally around the flame and eventually hit the flame the mechanism of the moth s response towards light can be applied in the optimization problem where optimum can be approached very quickly when it is remote from the initial position as the solution moves closer to the optimum the frequency of updating the new position will increase to reach the optimum point initially a population of moths search agents and corresponding flames fitness value are randomly generated as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 m m 11 m 1 d m s 1 m s d 8 f f 11 f 1 d f s 1 f s d where m and f are the matrices of moths positions and flames respectively d is the dimension of the problem and s is the number of moths the position of the moths is updated during each iteration alongside with the reduction of the number of flames to reach the optimum solution as shown in eqs 9 and 10 9 mi 1 fj mi eblcos 2πl fj 10 n f r o u n d s t s 1 t where b is the spiral flight shape b 1 l is the spiral flight coefficient nf is the number of flames t is the current iteration and t is the maximum iteration 2 4 3 whale optimization algorithm the woa was proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 where it imitates the hunting behavior of humpback whales it was observed that the humpback whales would create bubble nets to encircle their prey during the hunting process during the searching phase the whales search agents are positioned far from each other to ensure higher search efficiency as shown in eqs 11 through 13 11 xt 1 xrand a cxrand xt 12 a 2ar a 13 c 2r where x is the position vector of the whale population xrand is generated according to current reference whale a and c are coefficient vectors determined by the value of a and r the vector a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 as the iteration proceeds while r is randomized between 0 and 1 initially due to the high value of a a will be forced to be higher than 1 to ensure good distribution of the search agents to look for the optimum solution when a is less than 1 the process of encircling the prey starts as shown in eq 14 14 x t 1 x t a c x t x t w h e n p 0 5 x t x t e b l cos 2 π l x t w h e n p 0 5 where x t is the current best position vector b determines the shape of bubble net l is the spiral coefficient and p is a random number between 0 and 1 the exploitation process is a piecewise function due to the fact that there is a 50 50 chance of the whale to opt for shrinking the encircling mechanism or spiral model to change its position in order to achieve fair comparison between these optimization algorithms certain parameters were fixed the initial search agents swarm size number of moths and number of whales were set at 25 so that efficient search within the number of neurons 1 100 can be achieved besides the maximum iteration was also set at 100 2 5 performance evaluation and fitness function the optimization algorithms were used to search for the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer of the elm in order to update the best solution a fitness function is required to compute the fitness value for this the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were applied to evaluate the performance of the hybrid elm as well as calculating the fitness values the equations to calculate the mae rmse and r2 are shown in eqs 15 16 and 17 legates and mccabe 1999 willmott and matsuura 2005 15 m a e 1 n i n y a c t u a l i y p r e d i c t e d i 16 r m s e 1 n i n y a c t u a l i y p r e d i c t e d i 2 17 r 2 i n y a c t u a l y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t e d y p r e d i c t e d i n y a c t u a l y a c t u a l 2 i n y p r e d i c t e d y p r e d i c t e d 2 2 where yactual and ypredicted represent the actual and predicted values of et0 while y a c t u a l and y p r e d i c t e d are the mean of actual and predicted values respectively three different fitness functions were compared in this study the first fitness function f1 took only the rmse of the hybrid models into consideration as shown in eq 16 the rationale of selecting f1 was due to the fact that mean squared error was widely used in most of the optimization processes gupta et al 2009 the second fitness function f2 combined the mae rmse and r2 to form a more comprehensive evaluation on the models the scientific purpose of using f2 is to include r2 and mae into the computation of the fitness values while the mae could help to determine the accuracy of the model high r2 which resulted in low 1 r2 indicated that the estimations of a model is consistent since the rmse and mae shall be considered to have the same importance and the r2 can be an indicator of another dimension the calculation of f2 can be presented as shown in eq 18 18 fitness value rmse mae 1 r2 lastly the third fitness function f3 was based on the simple taylor skill score which took into account the normalized rmse as well as the r2 taylor 2001 it is the contention that the simple taylor skill score is one of the most powerful tools to assess the performance of a model the equation for f3 is shown as in eq 19 19 f i t n e s s v a l u e 4 1 r 4 δ 1 δ 2 1 r m a x 4 where r is the correlation coefficient rmax is the maximum correlation coefficient rmax 1 and δ is the ratio of the standard deviation of predicted et0 to the standard deviation of the actual et0 the fitness values of different fitness functions at different stations were normalized locally in order to create a more meaningful comparison the time cost of each hybrid elm models was also recorded 2 6 combinations of input meteorological parameters it is well known that not all meteorological stations can provide a full set of meteorological parameters for the et0 estimation using the pm model the situation can be worse for remote areas where infrastructure for data collection is most likely lacking the authors attempted to overcome the data intensiveness of the pm model by providing several options which would make use of a lesser number of meteorological parameters many approaches had been taken as to eliminating redundant meteorological parameters such as in the gamma test done by kim et al 2019 in this study the input combinations were designed by eliminating meteorological parameters with the lowest average correlation with et0 for the three stations named in table 2 the input combinations used in this study are tabulated in table 3 prior to the training process the data were normalized in order to remove the scaling effect the normalization was done according to eq 20 20 x norm x x m i n x m a x x m i n where xnorm is the normalized data x is the raw data xmax is the maximum value of input vector and xmin is the minimum value of the input vector on top of that in order to prevent bias and overfitting k fold cross validation k 10 was applied on the data since data from year 2014 2018 were used there were a total of 1826 data points per station during each fold 90 of the data were used as training set while the other 10 were used as testing data the average performance of the 10 fold training were reported the overall workflow of this study is summarized as in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of different optimization algorithms reiterating here for clarity the pso mfo and woa were used as complementary algorithms to complete the missing stochastic tuning of elm in order to compare the different algorithms different fitness functions were used as indicators to assess the fitness of the trained elm models the normalized fitness values to remove the regional effect in different stations calculated using f1 f2 and f3 are tabulated in tables 4 5 and 6 respectively subsequently rank scores were given to each hybrid models where an 18 score indicated the best model while a score of 1 was awarded to the worst model elagib and mansell 2000 huang et al 2019 the scoring system took into consideration the effect of the applied optimization algorithm as well as the input combinations finally the average rank scores of pso elm mfo elm and woa elm were computed for each of the three fitness functions used to ease the comparison process the higher average rank score implied that the hybridized elm had the better performance and vice versa a brief summary can be drawn from the results shown in tables 4 5 and 6 by using f1 table 4 the mfo elm performed better than other models at station 96491 sandakan and station 96449 miri whereas at station 96421 sibu the pso elm had the better performance as for f2 the pso elm outperformed the other models at station 96491 sandakan and station 96421 sibu while the mfo elm excelled at station 96449 miri the woa elm on the other hand had the best performance at the stations when f3 was used as the fitness function there is a clear difference that at different stations a different hybridized elm model was needed to suit the need of estimating local et0 on top of that the utilization of different fitness functions also had its effect however it should be noted that one should always consider the most stable option when selecting the desired model this is because the varying fitness functions will have different surface curves that the optimization algorithms are to work on as shown in the results the woa elm seemed to be the better choice when using f3 simple taylor skill score as the fitness function in fact when using f1 rmse and f2 combination of mae rmse and r2 as fitness functions the woa elm produced comparable results with the other two types of hybrid elm this suggested that woa could be the most favorable optimization algorithm to enhance the performance of the elm this could be attributed to the unique characteristics of woa which comprises the random probability for shrinking the encircling mechanism or spiral model unlike the pso and the mfo the woa does not engage the search agents into exploitation immediately instead a big portion of the iterations allow search agent of the woa to explore the prey before entering the exploitation process this probably had resulted in the consistent performance of the woa when compared to the pso and mfo the good performance of woa was in agreement with the results of previous work mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 another obvious phenomenon that was observed from the results was the effect of input combinations the normalized fitness value decreased from c1 to c6 due to the fact that the number of meteorological parameters provided to the hybridized elm decreased with the same pattern this in turn had also resulted in the decreasing rank score awarded to the hybridized elm models the decreasing meteorological parameters reduced the available information for the elm to correctly estimate the et0 for illustration purposes the scatter plots of the pso elm mfo elm and woa elm using different fitness functions at station 96491 sandakan are presented in figs 3 4 and 5 respectively the other scatter plots of the optimized elm are provided as supplementary data 3 2 comparison between different fitness functions it is also important to note the role played by the fitness functions in the optimization process in order to compare their performances the mae rmse and r2 of pso elm mfo elm and woa elm at different stations are summarized in table 7 8 and 9 respectively the standard deviations of the et0 estimation using different hybridized elm fitness functions and input combinations are presented in tables 7 8 and 9 for station 96491 sandakan station 96449 miri and station 96421 sibu respectively the purpose of computing the standard deviation was to determine if there were significant differences attributed to the fitness functions however when observing tables 7 8 and 9 it can be seen that the reported standard deviations were very small and can be considered as negligible the maximum reported standard deviation occurred at station 96491 sandakan where the prediction of mfo elm using different fitness functions had standard deviation of 0 0004 0 0029 and 0 0011 for mae rmse and r2 respectively extremely low standard deviation indicated that the errors as well as the coefficient of determination were close together when different fitness functions were used in other words the choice of fitness functions does not have any major effect on the accuracy of the et0 estimation by the hybridized elm while fitness functions did not pose any influence on the accuracy the computational costs of different hybridized elm were assessed in order to select the desired model template 3 3 computational cost of hybridized elm it is well known that the computation time of the elm is closely associated with the number of neurons in the hidden layer frances villora et al 2016 in the context of this study the number of hidden neurons could be affected by the number of input parameters and it is the task of the optimization algorithms to search for the optimum hidden neurons for the elm hence the computational cost of the hybridized elm is contributed by two major factors namely the optimization efficiency as well as the effectiveness of the resultant hybridized elm in order to further assess the quality of the hybridized elm the computational time time cost in units of seconds as well as the final number of neurons in the hidden layer were recorded the results are illustrated in figs 6 7 and 8 for station 96491 sandakan station 96449 miri and station 96421 sibu respectively the number of hidden neurons decreased alongside with the number of input meteorological parameters the reduction of the number of optimum hidden neurons is governed by the ability of the optimization algorithms to locate the global optimum by using the fitness functions f1 and f2 had flaws as they would not reduce the number of hidden neurons fig 6 or conversely even increase the required amount fig 8 these are not desirable as it will cost the computational time of the hybridized elm in terms of ability to improve the computational efficiency f3 or the simple taylor skill score can be regarded as the best fitness function used during the iteration of the optimization algorithms therefore although the fitness functions did not exhibit any significant differences on the accuracy they can still be differentiated when looking into the computational efficiency although f1 had lower average time cost however this could be due to the simplicity of the fitness function only linear rmse as compared to f3 with higher complexity as for the optimization algorithms previous discussions have revealed that the woa is the most stable technique to equip the elm with stochastic training with figs 6 7 and 8 it can be witnessed once again that the woa elm had better performance when compared to the pso elm and mfo elm through comparisons the woa elm achieved steady reduction of hidden neurons and at most of the time the optimum hidden neurons located by the woa elm were lower than that of the pso elm and mfo elm consequently the time costs of the woa elm were also generally lower than the other two variations of hybridized elm furthermore the optimization mechanism of the woa was also able to overcome the instability of fitness functions f1 and f2 in fact the woa elm was the only model that can realize the continuous reduction of hidden neurons when the meteorological parameters were decreased this brought further impact to the computational time cost which also exhibited continuous decreasing trend such ability was not possessed by neither the pso elm nor the mfo elm the robustness as well as high stability of the woa elm was awarded high credit in this study the results of this study could be contrasted with the published works of wu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2020 although the test results of wu et al 2019 achieved high r2 with values above 0 99 however the normalized rmse of the predictions ranged from 3 97 to 9 11 at various stations when five meteorological parameters were used as inputs in this study the maximum normalized rmse of woa elm estimation occurred at station 96491 sandakan which was 1 29 with similar input combinations as for the work of zhu et al 2020 while the input combinations had lower similarity as compared to this study nonetheless the performance of their optimized model was not as good as compared to those achieved in this presented work 3 4 other determining factors for selection of elm optimization algorithm it is important to point out that although the three selected stations are located in the region where climate is virtually identical however each of them represents the unique geographical characteristics of their own station 96491 sandakan which faces the northeast direction is affected by the northeast monsoon periodically while station 96449 sibu and station 96421 miri are both sheltered from the northeast monsoon they are differentiated by their locations whereby station 96449 sibu is at the coastal region while station 96421 miri is closer to the inland the variation of geographical characteristics offers an assessment of the practicability of the optimized elm from another perspective based on tables 7 and 8 optimized elm estimation at station 96491 sandakan recorded the highest mae and rmse of 0 17 and 0 23 respectively when one meteorological parameter was used whereas for station 96449 sibu the highest mae and rmse were 0 11 and 0 15 regardless of the method used the optimized elm achieved mae and rmse of 0 15 and 0 20 at station 96421 miri despite having different errors of estimation where the optimized elm apparently performed better in coastal area followed by inland and region affected by monsoon the deviations can be considered as trivial this finding is important such that the developed optimized elm including pso elm mfo elm and woa elm were all robust to the geographical characteristics of the study area by referring to previous discussion the authors suggested for the region investigated by this study the woa elm with the f3 shall be considered as the most promising solution to replace the pm model while offering stochastic tuning mechanism to the elm model hence this could aid the decision makers with all or limited meteorological data to accurately estimate the et0 with minimal computational cost in order to achieve more efficient allocation of water resources 4 conclusion the swarm based optimization algorithms including the pso mfo and woa were used as hybridizing strategies to provide the elm with a stochastic tuning ability the effect of different fitness functions as well as input combinations were also considered rank score system was used to evaluate the performance of the hybridized elm on top of these further comparisons were done by contrasting the computational time cost and the optimum solution provided by each model the findings of this study can be summarized in essence as follows the woa elm outperformed both the pso elm and the mfo elm with higher average rank score as well as stability especially when f3 simple taylor skill score was used as the fitness function the deviations of the mae rmse and r2 of the pso elm mfo elm and woa elm using different fitness functions were insignificant this indicates that the accuracy of the hybridized elm was not governed by the applied fitness function in terms of computational efficiency f1 rmse had the lowest average time cost however f3 is recommended as it could steadily reduce the number of hidden neurons when the input meteorological parameters were decreased the woa was the best optimization algorithm due to the fact that it could overcome the instability of f1 and f2 good robustness for all stations and conditions resulting in better computational efficiency of the hybridized elm the hybridized elm especially the woa elm had the best performance amongst all the models and hence should be proposed as an aiding tool for the decision makers to plan the allocation of water resources in sabah and sarawak where the oil palm plantation economy is vital to the states declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10385,reference evapotranspiration et0 is usually calculated as a pre requisite to obtain the actual evapotranspiration et estimation of et0 using extreme learning machine elm is a new norm due to its excellent computation efficiency and its lower data dependency however the lack of stochastic tuning often results in the convergence to the local optima instead of the global optimum this study attempts to address this issue by hybridizing the elm with three swarm based optimization algorithms namely the particle swarm optimization pso the moth flame optimization mfo and the whale optimization algorithm woa with different fitness functions this study was conducted with three stations in sabah and sarawak states in east malaysia as this region is to a very large extent covered with oil palm plantation the water resources management is thus rather crucial for the area the results showed that the woa elm achieved a higher average rank score relative to the pso elm and mfo elm especially when the simple taylor skill score was used as the fitness function the application of different fitness functions did not show any significant effect the reported standard deviations of the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 for the three variations of the hybridized elm were close to 0 thus reflecting their similarity in accuracy however in terms of computational efficiency the simple taylor skill score exhibited better stability where it could effectively reduce the number of required hidden neurons when the input meteorological parameters were decreased the woa was suggested as the best optimization algorithm for this study for the three stations respectively it achieved an average mae rmse and r2 of 0 0007 to

atmosphere via the evaporation and transpiration processes pokorny 2019 it plays an essential role in maintaining the energy and moisture balances between the earth surface and the atmosphere there is a need for the accurate quantification of the et especially where agricultural activities contribute to the main economy of the region therefore et becomes an important consideration for regional water resources planning as well as allocation lysimetric measurement is the most direct way of retrieving et information but however apart from it being a laborious undertaking its high setup capital maintenance cost as well as low coverage hinders the use of lysimeters chia et al 2020a alternatively mathematical or empirical modelling are considered for estimating et based on the energy balance approach and related assumptions to date the penman monteith pm model has been and is still being regarded as the standard reference for et estimation through the computation of reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 the generalizability of et0 gained wider acceptance as it can be well fitted to different types of crops through the inclusion of a crop coefficient kc xiang et al 2020 however the popularization of the pm model has been limited by its high dependency on the accurate meteorological parameters almorox et al 2016 tikhamarine et al 2020 the latest approaches have in turn shifted the attention of the researchers to soft computing techniques for estimating et0 such as the machine learning methods granata 2019 granata et al 2020 tikhamarine et al 2019 the pioneer of conducting such research was kumar et al 2002 where they studied the feasibility of estimating et0 in california using the multilayer perceptron mlp which is one of the variant of the artificial neural network ann it was found that by using lysimetric readings as the reference the mlp achieved estimations with lower errors as compared to the pm model since then the ann has attracted enormous interest in the engineering application for et0 estimation chia et al 2020b different variations of the ann had been deployed for such purposes ferreira et al 2019 reported that the performance of the mlp was better than that of the support vector machine svm in predicting the et0 in brazil when different scenarios of missing data were considered feng et al 2017a contrasted the performance between the generalized regression neural network grnn and the random forest rf when faced with limited meteorological parameters in china it was found that although the grnn and rf had similar performances however the grnn tended to underestimate et0 which was due to its slightly lower accuracy as compared to the rf model yassin et al 2016 on the other hand included a back propagation algorithm to the mlp to transform it into the back propagation neural network bpnn to estimate et0 in saudi arabia the authors concluded that such modification inclusion of back propagation algorithm was necessary in order to close the accuracy gap between the ann and pm models hybrid models that were off shoots from ann were also used for et0 estimation and these included the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and the wavelet neural network wnn mohammadrezapour et al 2019 patil and deka 2015 petković et al 2020 saggi and jain 2019 used an extreme version of the mlp where the hidden layers were increased drastically to form a deep learning network for et0 prediction in the northern state of india the reported results showed that by using a deep learning network accuracy of the prediction model could be increased while avoiding the risk of overfitting from the literatures it can be seen that the application of ann is widespread in terms of spatial variability besides the flexibility of the ann s structure allows different variations to be developed one variation of the ann that had captured much attention is the extreme learning machine elm developed in the 2000s huang et al 2006 the unique characteristic of the elm is that it only requires a single layer of hidden neurons this has been a main contributor to its high efficiency where computational time cost can be minimized kisi and alizamir 2018 suggested that the elm possessed several advantages over the conventional ann and these included the fast learning speed better generalization and requires less human intervention the elm had been successfully used to predict et0 in several cases abdullah et al 2015 compared the performance of the elm with bpnn and concluded the two machine learning tools could produce output with similar accuracy however the authors still favored the elm over bpnn due to its high computational efficiency numerous follow up studies have arrived at similar conclusions feng et al 2016 2017b patil and deka 2016 having said that the defects possessed by the elm are also prominent as the internal parameters of the elm is randomly initialized the absence of stochastic training has resulted in the high possibility of convergence to the local optima instead of the global optimum estimation of the kernel based elm can be improved by fine tuning the internal parameters especially the number of neurons in the hidden layer conventionally grid search and gradient descent methods are used for optimizing models however these algorithms can be ineffective when models have high complexity bio inspired optimization algorithms have aroused popularity recently as the meta heuristic optimization methods rely on simple concepts able to bypass local optima and the information regarding the gradient can be neglected mirjalili and lewis 2016 the swarm based optimization which works on the basis of exploring and exploiting within the search space has been widely applied in the hydrological processes modeling wu et al 2020 wu et al 2019 compared the hybridized elm using three swarm based optimizations flower pollination algorithm cuckoo search algorithm and ant colony optimization with the evolutionary algorithm for et0 estimation over the whole of china the authors concluded that flower pollination algorithm offered the best improvement on elm followed by the cuckoo search algorithm both categorized as swarm based optimization zhu et al 2020 applied particle swarm optimization pso to improve the performance of the elm in the case of limited meteorological data the hybridized elm has the potential as a better estimation tool for et0 estimation in the northwest of china hence this paper served to address the issue by performing a more in depth study on the hybridized elm for et0 estimation the stochastic training provided by the optimization algorithm indeed would improve the accuracy of et0 estimation by elm the subject matter that the authors are concerned with is the distinction between the mechanisms of different algorithms and their effects on the elm estimation to the best knowledge of the authors there has been a lack of the comparison amongst some of the most notable swarm based optimization algorithms in enhancing the performance of the elm for et0 estimation besides there had been no universal fitness function adopted to optimize the internal parameters of the elm the main contribution of this work is to determine an appropriate optimization algorithm with its attending objective function to be integrated with the elm successful hybridization can lead to high optimization efficiency as well as results with minimal computational cost however it is impossible for the authors to practically attempt with all the available optimization algorithms therefore the scope of interest has been focused on the swarm based optimizations due to the lack of comparison as mentioned earlier in the text therefore this work approach is set out to 1 hybridize and optimize the elm using different swarm based optimization algorithm 2 compare the efficiency of the hybridized elm using different fitness functions 3 understand the relationship between the input combinations with the number of neurons in the hidden layer 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the study was conducted in the two states namely sabah and sarawak located in east malaysia daily meteorological data which included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin mean temperature tmean relative humidity rh wind speed at altitude of 2 m u2 and solar radiation rs were collected from the malaysian meteorological department mmd for the three selected stations for the years 2014 2018 this amounted to 1826 data points at each of the station the three selected stations were station 96491 sandakan sabah station 96449 miri sarawak and station 96421 sibu sarawak a tropical climate exists in these areas where the weather is warm and humid all year long as of 2015 the land covered by oil palm plantations was 53 and 45 for sabah and sarawak respectively miettinen et al 2018 this had made the area an interesting study area as the crops which rely entirely on rain fed irrigation would consume a considerable amount of water resources subramaniam and hashim 2018 thus the efficient water resources management in this region is vital for the sustainability of the regional economy the locations of the selected stations are shown in fig 1 the details of the stations are presented in table 1 2 2 penman monteith model the elm requires supervised training in order for it to predict et0 in this study since lysimetric readings were absent the et0 calculated from the pm model were used as training targets for the elm as it was regarded as the standard for et0 estimation by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations allen et al 1998 the pm model is depicted as in eq 1 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is daily reference evapotranspiration mm day rn is net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is soil heat flux mjm 2day 1 t is daily mean temperature c u2 is wind speed at 2 m height m s es is mean saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is actual vapor pressure kpa δ is slope of vapor pressure curve kpa c and γ is psychrometric constant kpa c 2 3 extreme learning machine the elm works on the principle of single hidden layer feed forward neural network an activation function is required to perform feature mapping of the input parameters into a multidimensional elm random feature space the output of an elm can be computed using eq 2 2 f l x i 1 l h i β i where l is the number of hidden neurons hi is the output of ith hidden neuron and βi is the output weight between for the ith hidden neuron and output node in order to solve for the weight matrix the algorithm of the elm has to solve for eq 3 3 h βt where h is the vector of output of the hidden neurons β is their corresponding output weight and t is the target vector as for the activation function of the elm there is no standard methodology however by referring to a previous study kisi and alizamir 2018 had adopted the radial basis function rbf as the activation function for the elm hence drawing from this the rbf was used to integrate the output of individual hidden neurons as shown in eq 4 4 h x n x i e x p γ x n x i 2 2 σ 2 where xn and xi are the nth and ith term of the input vector σ2 is the variance and γ is parameters needed to be tuned 2 4 optimization algorithms in this study the estimations of the elm were optimized using the swarm based optimization algorithms by tuning the number of neurons in the hidden layer three well known optimization algorithms were selected for the purpose namely the pso the moth flame optimization mfo and the whale optimization algorithm woa to find out the better option 2 4 1 particle swarm optimization the pso was proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 where it mimics the collaborative behavior of biological populations each particle in the swarm in the feature space possesses a fitness value that indicates the current state the all particles communicate with one another to search for the best fitness by repetitive computation and communication the swarm will migrate towards the global optimum expressly the algorithm of the pso can be represented by eqs 5 and 6 to update the particles positions and velocities 5 xt 1 xt vt 1 6 vt 1 wvt c1r1 pt xt c2r2 pg t xt where x is the vector of particles positions v is the vector of the particles velocities p is the vector of particles personal best position pg is the global best position w is the inertial weight c1 and c2 are cognitive and social scaling parameters respectively and r1 and r2 and uniformly distributed random values 2 4 2 moth flame optimization the mfo exploits the sensitivity of the moth bug towards light this type of navigation is known as the transverse orientation navigation according to mirjalili 2015 the transverse orientation navigation allows the moth to fly at a constant angle towards the source of light for example the moon however when the source of light is near to the moth the moth will fly spirally around the flame and eventually hit the flame the mechanism of the moth s response towards light can be applied in the optimization problem where optimum can be approached very quickly when it is remote from the initial position as the solution moves closer to the optimum the frequency of updating the new position will increase to reach the optimum point initially a population of moths search agents and corresponding flames fitness value are randomly generated as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 m m 11 m 1 d m s 1 m s d 8 f f 11 f 1 d f s 1 f s d where m and f are the matrices of moths positions and flames respectively d is the dimension of the problem and s is the number of moths the position of the moths is updated during each iteration alongside with the reduction of the number of flames to reach the optimum solution as shown in eqs 9 and 10 9 mi 1 fj mi eblcos 2πl fj 10 n f r o u n d s t s 1 t where b is the spiral flight shape b 1 l is the spiral flight coefficient nf is the number of flames t is the current iteration and t is the maximum iteration 2 4 3 whale optimization algorithm the woa was proposed by mirjalili and lewis 2016 where it imitates the hunting behavior of humpback whales it was observed that the humpback whales would create bubble nets to encircle their prey during the hunting process during the searching phase the whales search agents are positioned far from each other to ensure higher search efficiency as shown in eqs 11 through 13 11 xt 1 xrand a cxrand xt 12 a 2ar a 13 c 2r where x is the position vector of the whale population xrand is generated according to current reference whale a and c are coefficient vectors determined by the value of a and r the vector a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 as the iteration proceeds while r is randomized between 0 and 1 initially due to the high value of a a will be forced to be higher than 1 to ensure good distribution of the search agents to look for the optimum solution when a is less than 1 the process of encircling the prey starts as shown in eq 14 14 x t 1 x t a c x t x t w h e n p 0 5 x t x t e b l cos 2 π l x t w h e n p 0 5 where x t is the current best position vector b determines the shape of bubble net l is the spiral coefficient and p is a random number between 0 and 1 the exploitation process is a piecewise function due to the fact that there is a 50 50 chance of the whale to opt for shrinking the encircling mechanism or spiral model to change its position in order to achieve fair comparison between these optimization algorithms certain parameters were fixed the initial search agents swarm size number of moths and number of whales were set at 25 so that efficient search within the number of neurons 1 100 can be achieved besides the maximum iteration was also set at 100 2 5 performance evaluation and fitness function the optimization algorithms were used to search for the optimum number of neurons in the hidden layer of the elm in order to update the best solution a fitness function is required to compute the fitness value for this the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 were applied to evaluate the performance of the hybrid elm as well as calculating the fitness values the equations to calculate the mae rmse and r2 are shown in eqs 15 16 and 17 legates and mccabe 1999 willmott and matsuura 2005 15 m a e 1 n i n y a c t u a l i y p r e d i c t e d i 16 r m s e 1 n i n y a c t u a l i y p r e d i c t e d i 2 17 r 2 i n y a c t u a l y a c t u a l y p r e d i c t e d y p r e d i c t e d i n y a c t u a l y a c t u a l 2 i n y p r e d i c t e d y p r e d i c t e d 2 2 where yactual and ypredicted represent the actual and predicted values of et0 while y a c t u a l and y p r e d i c t e d are the mean of actual and predicted values respectively three different fitness functions were compared in this study the first fitness function f1 took only the rmse of the hybrid models into consideration as shown in eq 16 the rationale of selecting f1 was due to the fact that mean squared error was widely used in most of the optimization processes gupta et al 2009 the second fitness function f2 combined the mae rmse and r2 to form a more comprehensive evaluation on the models the scientific purpose of using f2 is to include r2 and mae into the computation of the fitness values while the mae could help to determine the accuracy of the model high r2 which resulted in low 1 r2 indicated that the estimations of a model is consistent since the rmse and mae shall be considered to have the same importance and the r2 can be an indicator of another dimension the calculation of f2 can be presented as shown in eq 18 18 fitness value rmse mae 1 r2 lastly the third fitness function f3 was based on the simple taylor skill score which took into account the normalized rmse as well as the r2 taylor 2001 it is the contention that the simple taylor skill score is one of the most powerful tools to assess the performance of a model the equation for f3 is shown as in eq 19 19 f i t n e s s v a l u e 4 1 r 4 δ 1 δ 2 1 r m a x 4 where r is the correlation coefficient rmax is the maximum correlation coefficient rmax 1 and δ is the ratio of the standard deviation of predicted et0 to the standard deviation of the actual et0 the fitness values of different fitness functions at different stations were normalized locally in order to create a more meaningful comparison the time cost of each hybrid elm models was also recorded 2 6 combinations of input meteorological parameters it is well known that not all meteorological stations can provide a full set of meteorological parameters for the et0 estimation using the pm model the situation can be worse for remote areas where infrastructure for data collection is most likely lacking the authors attempted to overcome the data intensiveness of the pm model by providing several options which would make use of a lesser number of meteorological parameters many approaches had been taken as to eliminating redundant meteorological parameters such as in the gamma test done by kim et al 2019 in this study the input combinations were designed by eliminating meteorological parameters with the lowest average correlation with et0 for the three stations named in table 2 the input combinations used in this study are tabulated in table 3 prior to the training process the data were normalized in order to remove the scaling effect the normalization was done according to eq 20 20 x norm x x m i n x m a x x m i n where xnorm is the normalized data x is the raw data xmax is the maximum value of input vector and xmin is the minimum value of the input vector on top of that in order to prevent bias and overfitting k fold cross validation k 10 was applied on the data since data from year 2014 2018 were used there were a total of 1826 data points per station during each fold 90 of the data were used as training set while the other 10 were used as testing data the average performance of the 10 fold training were reported the overall workflow of this study is summarized as in fig 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of different optimization algorithms reiterating here for clarity the pso mfo and woa were used as complementary algorithms to complete the missing stochastic tuning of elm in order to compare the different algorithms different fitness functions were used as indicators to assess the fitness of the trained elm models the normalized fitness values to remove the regional effect in different stations calculated using f1 f2 and f3 are tabulated in tables 4 5 and 6 respectively subsequently rank scores were given to each hybrid models where an 18 score indicated the best model while a score of 1 was awarded to the worst model elagib and mansell 2000 huang et al 2019 the scoring system took into consideration the effect of the applied optimization algorithm as well as the input combinations finally the average rank scores of pso elm mfo elm and woa elm were computed for each of the three fitness functions used to ease the comparison process the higher average rank score implied that the hybridized elm had the better performance and vice versa a brief summary can be drawn from the results shown in tables 4 5 and 6 by using f1 table 4 the mfo elm performed better than other models at station 96491 sandakan and station 96449 miri whereas at station 96421 sibu the pso elm had the better performance as for f2 the pso elm outperformed the other models at station 96491 sandakan and station 96421 sibu while the mfo elm excelled at station 96449 miri the woa elm on the other hand had the best performance at the stations when f3 was used as the fitness function there is a clear difference that at different stations a different hybridized elm model was needed to suit the need of estimating local et0 on top of that the utilization of different fitness functions also had its effect however it should be noted that one should always consider the most stable option when selecting the desired model this is because the varying fitness functions will have different surface curves that the optimization algorithms are to work on as shown in the results the woa elm seemed to be the better choice when using f3 simple taylor skill score as the fitness function in fact when using f1 rmse and f2 combination of mae rmse and r2 as fitness functions the woa elm produced comparable results with the other two types of hybrid elm this suggested that woa could be the most favorable optimization algorithm to enhance the performance of the elm this could be attributed to the unique characteristics of woa which comprises the random probability for shrinking the encircling mechanism or spiral model unlike the pso and the mfo the woa does not engage the search agents into exploitation immediately instead a big portion of the iterations allow search agent of the woa to explore the prey before entering the exploitation process this probably had resulted in the consistent performance of the woa when compared to the pso and mfo the good performance of woa was in agreement with the results of previous work mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 another obvious phenomenon that was observed from the results was the effect of input combinations the normalized fitness value decreased from c1 to c6 due to the fact that the number of meteorological parameters provided to the hybridized elm decreased with the same pattern this in turn had also resulted in the decreasing rank score awarded to the hybridized elm models the decreasing meteorological parameters reduced the available information for the elm to correctly estimate the et0 for illustration purposes the scatter plots of the pso elm mfo elm and woa elm using different fitness functions at station 96491 sandakan are presented in figs 3 4 and 5 respectively the other scatter plots of the optimized elm are provided as supplementary data 3 2 comparison between different fitness functions it is also important to note the role played by the fitness functions in the optimization process in order to compare their performances the mae rmse and r2 of pso elm mfo elm and woa elm at different stations are summarized in table 7 8 and 9 respectively the standard deviations of the et0 estimation using different hybridized elm fitness functions and input combinations are presented in tables 7 8 and 9 for station 96491 sandakan station 96449 miri and station 96421 sibu respectively the purpose of computing the standard deviation was to determine if there were significant differences attributed to the fitness functions however when observing tables 7 8 and 9 it can be seen that the reported standard deviations were very small and can be considered as negligible the maximum reported standard deviation occurred at station 96491 sandakan where the prediction of mfo elm using different fitness functions had standard deviation of 0 0004 0 0029 and 0 0011 for mae rmse and r2 respectively extremely low standard deviation indicated that the errors as well as the coefficient of determination were close together when different fitness functions were used in other words the choice of fitness functions does not have any major effect on the accuracy of the et0 estimation by the hybridized elm while fitness functions did not pose any influence on the accuracy the computational costs of different hybridized elm were assessed in order to select the desired model template 3 3 computational cost of hybridized elm it is well known that the computation time of the elm is closely associated with the number of neurons in the hidden layer frances villora et al 2016 in the context of this study the number of hidden neurons could be affected by the number of input parameters and it is the task of the optimization algorithms to search for the optimum hidden neurons for the elm hence the computational cost of the hybridized elm is contributed by two major factors namely the optimization efficiency as well as the effectiveness of the resultant hybridized elm in order to further assess the quality of the hybridized elm the computational time time cost in units of seconds as well as the final number of neurons in the hidden layer were recorded the results are illustrated in figs 6 7 and 8 for station 96491 sandakan station 96449 miri and station 96421 sibu respectively the number of hidden neurons decreased alongside with the number of input meteorological parameters the reduction of the number of optimum hidden neurons is governed by the ability of the optimization algorithms to locate the global optimum by using the fitness functions f1 and f2 had flaws as they would not reduce the number of hidden neurons fig 6 or conversely even increase the required amount fig 8 these are not desirable as it will cost the computational time of the hybridized elm in terms of ability to improve the computational efficiency f3 or the simple taylor skill score can be regarded as the best fitness function used during the iteration of the optimization algorithms therefore although the fitness functions did not exhibit any significant differences on the accuracy they can still be differentiated when looking into the computational efficiency although f1 had lower average time cost however this could be due to the simplicity of the fitness function only linear rmse as compared to f3 with higher complexity as for the optimization algorithms previous discussions have revealed that the woa is the most stable technique to equip the elm with stochastic training with figs 6 7 and 8 it can be witnessed once again that the woa elm had better performance when compared to the pso elm and mfo elm through comparisons the woa elm achieved steady reduction of hidden neurons and at most of the time the optimum hidden neurons located by the woa elm were lower than that of the pso elm and mfo elm consequently the time costs of the woa elm were also generally lower than the other two variations of hybridized elm furthermore the optimization mechanism of the woa was also able to overcome the instability of fitness functions f1 and f2 in fact the woa elm was the only model that can realize the continuous reduction of hidden neurons when the meteorological parameters were decreased this brought further impact to the computational time cost which also exhibited continuous decreasing trend such ability was not possessed by neither the pso elm nor the mfo elm the robustness as well as high stability of the woa elm was awarded high credit in this study the results of this study could be contrasted with the published works of wu et al 2019 and zhu et al 2020 although the test results of wu et al 2019 achieved high r2 with values above 0 99 however the normalized rmse of the predictions ranged from 3 97 to 9 11 at various stations when five meteorological parameters were used as inputs in this study the maximum normalized rmse of woa elm estimation occurred at station 96491 sandakan which was 1 29 with similar input combinations as for the work of zhu et al 2020 while the input combinations had lower similarity as compared to this study nonetheless the performance of their optimized model was not as good as compared to those achieved in this presented work 3 4 other determining factors for selection of elm optimization algorithm it is important to point out that although the three selected stations are located in the region where climate is virtually identical however each of them represents the unique geographical characteristics of their own station 96491 sandakan which faces the northeast direction is affected by the northeast monsoon periodically while station 96449 sibu and station 96421 miri are both sheltered from the northeast monsoon they are differentiated by their locations whereby station 96449 sibu is at the coastal region while station 96421 miri is closer to the inland the variation of geographical characteristics offers an assessment of the practicability of the optimized elm from another perspective based on tables 7 and 8 optimized elm estimation at station 96491 sandakan recorded the highest mae and rmse of 0 17 and 0 23 respectively when one meteorological parameter was used whereas for station 96449 sibu the highest mae and rmse were 0 11 and 0 15 regardless of the method used the optimized elm achieved mae and rmse of 0 15 and 0 20 at station 96421 miri despite having different errors of estimation where the optimized elm apparently performed better in coastal area followed by inland and region affected by monsoon the deviations can be considered as trivial this finding is important such that the developed optimized elm including pso elm mfo elm and woa elm were all robust to the geographical characteristics of the study area by referring to previous discussion the authors suggested for the region investigated by this study the woa elm with the f3 shall be considered as the most promising solution to replace the pm model while offering stochastic tuning mechanism to the elm model hence this could aid the decision makers with all or limited meteorological data to accurately estimate the et0 with minimal computational cost in order to achieve more efficient allocation of water resources 4 conclusion the swarm based optimization algorithms including the pso mfo and woa were used as hybridizing strategies to provide the elm with a stochastic tuning ability the effect of different fitness functions as well as input combinations were also considered rank score system was used to evaluate the performance of the hybridized elm on top of these further comparisons were done by contrasting the computational time cost and the optimum solution provided by each model the findings of this study can be summarized in essence as follows the woa elm outperformed both the pso elm and the mfo elm with higher average rank score as well as stability especially when f3 simple taylor skill score was used as the fitness function the deviations of the mae rmse and r2 of the pso elm mfo elm and woa elm using different fitness functions were insignificant this indicates that the accuracy of the hybridized elm was not governed by the applied fitness function in terms of computational efficiency f1 rmse had the lowest average time cost however f3 is recommended as it could steadily reduce the number of hidden neurons when the input meteorological parameters were decreased the woa was the best optimization algorithm due to the fact that it could overcome the instability of f1 and f2 good robustness for all stations and conditions resulting in better computational efficiency of the hybridized elm the hybridized elm especially the woa elm had the best performance amongst all the models and hence should be proposed as an aiding tool for the decision makers to plan the allocation of water resources in sabah and sarawak where the oil palm plantation economy is vital to the states declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

10386,subsurface drainage is effective for not only controlling groundwater table depth but also alleviating soil salinization especially in arid and semi arid agricultural areas while substantial research efforts have been spent to determine the parameters e g drain depth drain spacing and pipe diameter of subsurface drainage pipe layout for water drainage less attention has been paid to determine the parameters for salt discharge which is important in arid and semi arid regions this paper presents a comprehensive study that used experimental and numerical methods to determine the pipe layout parameters for both water and salt drainage a total of nine field experiments were conducted in yanqi county an arid area of xinjiang province china for a combination of different values of drain depth drain spacing and pipe diameter the experimental results indicate that drain depth and spacing are significantly more important than pipe diameter for soil desalinization soil water content and salinity measured during the experiments were used to calibrate and validate a numerical model developed for simulating soil water flow and salt transport under drainage conditions two proposed indices critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching combined with two existing indices salt discharge amount and soil desalinization rate were used to represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects under different subsurface pipe layout parameters the results suggest that drain depth has a significant influence on all indices while the drain spacing has a significant influence on salt discharge amount and ratio of salt discharge and leaching the relationships between layout parameters of subsurface pipes and proposed indices were quantified and used to determine appropriate layout parameters of subsurface pipes keywords subsurface drainage drain depth drain spacing salt discharge numerical modeling 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions soil salinization is a serious threat to crop yield and ecological environments dregne 2002 li et al 2016 to control soil salinization and preserve agricultural lands it has become popular to use subsurface drainage pipes for lowering groundwater level and discharging soil salt haj amor and bouri 2019 ritzema and schultz 2011 wang et al 2007 however there are a number of open questions for designing drainage pipe layout for salt drainage because subsurface drainage pipes were originally used in humid or coastal areas to remove excess precipitation surface ponding water or prevent seawater intrusion and to improve root zone soil conditions ritzema et al 2008 ritzema 2016 singh 2009 skaggs et al 1994 jafari talukolaee et al 2016 for the conventional soil drainage various experiments have been conducted to investigate impacts of drainage pipe layout parameters on amounts of water discharge decreases of groundwater table depth and drainage duration of surface ponding water jafari talukolaee et al 2016 2015 su et al 2005 ogino and ota 2007 many theoretical studies have also been conducted to guide the layout of subsurface drainage pipes in these regions when considering to remove the excess water tao et al 2019 yousfi et al 2014 liang et al 2015 youngs 1984 kirkham 1949 however these experimental and theoretical results obtained in humid areas for water drainage may be not suitable for salt drainage in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the agricultural area considered in this study is the southern xinjiang province of china where annual precipitation ranges between 20 mm 100 mm and annual evaporation from water surface is about 2000 mm liu et al 2009 wu et al 2010 because of the high evaporation and shallow water table depth due to the low lying terrain soil salt accumulates on ground surface and threats sustainability of local agricultural development one way to control soil salinization is to wash soil salt out by winter irrigation after harvest and using intensive open drains to drain soil water and salt out after the winter irrigation however the open drains are not cost effective because they not only occupy substantial cultivated lands but also require heavy desilting maintenance every year to ensure drainage flow fausey et al 1982 wang et al 2007 subsurface drainage pipes are planned to replace open drains for salt drainage and land saving by the local government since subsurface drainage systems do not occupy lands and cope well with existing farm management practices wang et al 2007 however among the limited number of researches on subsurface drainage in arid and semi arid regions few researches have been found to propose indices of estimating salt desalinization effects of subsurface drainage pipe and to consider these indices for designing the layout of subsurface drainage pipes in the study area it is thus necessary to figure out appropriate indices to reflect the effect of soil desalinization and salt discharge which can be used to determine suitable layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes recently experimental studies have been used to evaluate the role of subsurface drainage pipes on soil desalinization and the amount of salt discharge in arid and semi arid areas haj amor and bouri 2019 he et al 2016 hornbuckle et al 2007 nozari et al 2018 sharma et al 2000 investigated the long term impacts of subsurface drainage on improving soil properties and increasing crop yield by a field experiment and demonstrated that the larger drain spacing with deep drain depth was adequate in sandy loam soils he et al 2016 used field experiments to compare the effects of using subsurface drainage and open drainage on soil salt leaching and found that using subsurface drainage is more effective nozari et al 2018 estimated the effects of drain depth and spacing on soil salt removal by using lab experiments one limitation of laboratory and field experiments in current researches is that they can only consider a small number of subsurface layout parameters due to high experiment cost and intensive lab and field work thus cannot adequately characterize the effects of layout parameters of subsurface pipe on soil desalinization and salt discharge however the field investigation work is always needed to reflect local conditions as recommended by sreenivas and reddy 2008 one way to address this problem is to undertake more scenarios of field experiments for understanding the specific impact factors when designing layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe for washing salt out in arid areas there are many different design objectives used to guide the layout design of subsurface drainage pipes in humid regions crop yield drainage intensity and nitrogen loss were considered by singh et al 2006 for designing the subsurface drainage systems in iowa s tile landscapes wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 developed a semi analytical solution for calculating drain spacing by considering the possibly largest soil water retention during the periods of excessive rainfall or snow melt kannan 2008 calculated the required drain spacing by considering drawdown conditions under various rainfall distributions infiltration rates and allowable water logging tolerances for the swamps in rwanda when considering the objective to estimate the effect of layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes on salt discharge there are two quantitative indices commonly used including the soil desalinization rate and salt discharge amount soil desalinization rate was used to estimate the decreasing degree of soil salinity after leaching he et al 2016 and amount of salt discharge was used to estimate the amount of salt that discharged by subsurface pipes jafari talukolaee et al 2015 however these two indices cannot distinguish the effects of salt leaching and salt discharge thus they are not adequately used for determining the subsurface layout parameters effects on salt discharge using numerical models of soil water and solute migration is an effective way to determine the layout parameters because numerical models can simulate soil water flow and salt migration with various layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe under complex field conditions example numerical models include but not limited to macro larsbo and jarvis 2003 hydrus šimůnek et al 2006 and drainmod skaggs et al 2012 hydrus and drainmod are the two most popular models to simulate soil water flow and salt migration under subsurface drainage conditions in hydrus a subsurface drainage pipe is modeled as a seepage face with complicated shifting boundary between specified head boundary and non flux boundary in draimod the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 and kirkham kirkham 1958 equation are used to calculate lateral drainage flux and integrated with the richards equation for calculating the transient pressure head of soil the two models have been used in many applications with subsurface drainage pipes ebrahimian and noory 2015 karandish et al 2018 singh et al 2006 drainmod is more suitable for simulating water discharge in humid areas skaggs 1978 while hydrus is suitable for both humid and arid regions šimůnek et al 2016 in this study the public domain code swms 2d based on which hydrus was developed was used for the numerical simulation of water flow and salt transport under the subsurface drainage pipe conditions the ultimate goal of this study is to assess the influence of subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters on soil desalinization and salt discharge two indices named as the critical depth of soil desalinization and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching were proposed to represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge under various subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters the field experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to figure out the relationships between layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes and the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge in arid agricultural areas the field experiments were conducted for nine treatments with consideration of three drain depths three drain spacings and three pipe diameters which were used for winter irrigation to wash salt out in xinjiang province china soil water content and salinity were measured before and after irrigation and used to calibrate and validate swms 2d model the calibrated model was used to calculate soil desalinization effects under more scenarios with different subsurface drainage pipe layouts based on the numerical modeling results the relationships between the indices and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes were analyzed and quantified which can be used to provide guidance for subsurface pipes layout parameters in arid agricultural areas 2 materials and methods a technological roadmap including the design and data analysis of the field experiments the calibration and validation of the numerical model and the prediction results analysis is shown in fig 1 the details of which are elaborated in the following sections 2 1 field experiments the field experiments were conducted from october to november 2018 during winter irrigation on a farmland with the size of 6 5 ha the experimental site 41 51 n 86 27 e is located in the center of the yanqi basin of xinjiang province china as shown in fig 2 a the region has a typical temperate continental climate with an annual evaporation of 1890 1 mm and annual precipitation 73 1 mm the groundwater depth and salinity at the experiment site before winter irrigation were 2 26 m and 337 ms m large amount of winter irrigation happens in october after harvest and the purpose is to leach the soil salt out of root zone to control the soil salinization chang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 han 2017 cotton as the representative crop in the study area liu et al 2012 wang 2018 was chosen to access the appropriate range of the soil salinization indices for suitable crop growth in the next year the local irrigation quota was measured by observing the branch canal flow every four hours during the irrigation period which was 490 mm electrical conductivity of irrigation water was measured as 0 033 ms m the soil is sand mixed with clay within the depth of 1 8 m from land surface but more sandy below 1 8 m the bulk density percentages of sand silt and clay and soil texture within the depth of 2 m are listed in table 1 since the deep ploughing within the depth of 0 4 m was carried out before the experiment the 2 surface layers 0 0 2 m 0 2 0 4 m had the small bulk density a total of nine field experimental treatments denoted as a1 a9 were conducted to consider three drain depths 0 8 m 1 1 m and 1 4 m three drain spacings 20 m 10 m and 6 m and three pipe diameters 90 mm 110 mm and 160 mm as listed in table 2 the drain depth spacing and pipe diameter of each treatment are chosen according to the principle of orthogonal experimental design gao 1988 and each variable is combined only once among all the treatments the arrangement of the field experiments is shown in fig 2 b each experimental treatment used three drain pipes installed with a uniform slope of 2 the drainage pipes were wrapped with geotextile envelopes with 3 of pipe surface area left for open holes the total width of the field site is 86 m and a 2 m deep drainage ditch locates along the field soil water content and soil salinity were measured from soil samples taken on october 11 2018 before the winter irrigation and on november 16 2018 after the winter irrigation the sample locations relative to a pipe are shown in fig 2 d and the locations were determined by drain spacing if the drain spacing is 6 m there are three sample locations located in one side of the second pipe among the three pipes with the distances of 1 m 2 m and 3 m the distances become 1 m 2 5 m and 5 m when the drain spacing is 10 m and become 2 m 4 m 6 m 8 m and 10 m when the drain spacing is 20 m at each sample location multiple soil samples were taken every 0 2 m from land surface within the depth of 2 m for groundwater table depth shallower than 2 m soil samples were taken until the groundwater table depth the electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec 1 5 was measured by an electrical conductivity meter the relationship between the total dissolved salt tds and ec 1 5 was obtained by 15 soil samples selected randomly from all the samples and the relationship between tds and ec 1 5 is shown as 1 tds 0 059ec 1 5 0 264 r 2 0 96 where the unit of tds and ec 1 5 are g kg and ms m respectively 2 2 numerical model in swms 2d the unsaturated saturated water flow is governed by the two dimensional 2d richards equation 2 θ t x i k k i j a h x j k i z a where θ is the volumetric moisture content m3 m3 h is the soil water potential m subscripts i j 1 2 represent the x and z directions k i j a is the component for the anisotropic tensor ka and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil m d the improved van genuchten equations are used to describe the relation between θ k and h van genuchten 1980 the equations have five parameters and they are the residual water content θr saturated water content θs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and two parameters α and n the 2d convection dispersion equation is used to describe the solute transport as follows 3 θ c t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i where c is the solute concentration in soil water kg m3 and qi is the darcy velocity in the i th direction m d dij is the saturated unsaturated hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 d in swms 2d a subsurface drainage pipe is represented by a vertex and the hydraulic conductivity around the vertex is adjusted to consider the influence of the subsurface drainage pipe according to the following equation 4 k d r a i n k c d where kdrain is the adjusted hydraulic conductivity m d k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer where the subsurface drainage pipe located m d and cd is a correction factor the details of the subsurface drainage boundary and the calculation of cd can be found in vimoke et al 1962 and fipps et al 1986 2 3 swms 2d model setup a numerical model based on swms 2d was developed to simulate water flow and salt transport under the 9 experimental treatments with various layout parameters listed in table 2 as shown in fig 2 c the simulation domain was rectangular with the length of drain spacing l and the depth of 5 m the left and right boundaries were set as the no flux boundary the impervious layer was set at the depth of 5 m which has slight impact on the soil solute transport to the drainage pipes the upper boundary was set as the atmospheric boundary considering the daily irrigation precipitation and evaporation the finite element mesh of the simulation domain was generated by gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 the setup of the simulation domain and boundary conditions as well as the mesh is shown in fig 2 c the daily irrigation was estimated by dividing the total winter irrigation of 490 mm by 16 days the period from october 24 to november 10 according to the meteorological data of a local weather station installed near the experimental site the evaporation of the experiment month was 45 61 mm and the daily evaporation of 1 52 mm was estimated by dividing the evaporation by 30 days the salt concentration of the irrigation water originated from the snowmelt water of the tianshan mountains was set as 0 since the electrical conductivity was much smaller than the electrical conductivity of the groundwater and soil water ec 1 5 at the experimental site the initial conditions of soil water content and salinity were set to the value of the closest sampling points before winter irrigation 2 4 prediction scenarios under different layout parameters limited by the field experiment the drain depth ranging from 0 8 m to 1 4 m and the drain spacing ranging from 6 m to 20 m would not cover the appropriate layout parameters in this area what s more the soil desalinization and salt discharge efficiency would also be influenced by the variation of the initial soil water content and soil salinity thus the validated model swms 2d was used to simulate the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects under different layout parameters with the same initial soil water content and soil salinity conditions as shown in table 1 the drain depth was extended to the range from 0 6 m to 1 8 m and the drain spacing to the range from 5 m to 50 m there were a total of 24 prediction scenarios denoted as p1 p24 with 4 drain depths 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m and 6 drain spacings 5 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m shown in table 3 in addition to the 24 scenarios mentioned there was a scenario without subsurface pipe denoted as p25 the boundary conditions and soil characteristics of the 24 simulation scenarios were the same as those in the experiment site the boundary conditions and soil characteristics of p25 were consistent with the other 24 scenarios while there was no subsurface drainage pipe arranged in this scenario soil salinity above the given depth can only be reduced by leaching in this scenario by comparing with other scenarios with subsurface pipes it is possible to distinguish the amount of salt discharged from subsurface pipes and the amount of salt leached the prediction scenarios did not consider pipe diameter because the field experiments indicate that it owns slight impact on soil desalinization as discussed below in section 3 2 2 5 model evaluation indices and indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge 2 5 1 model evaluation indices to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values three statistical metrics including the mean absolute error mae the relative root mean square error rrmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are defined as follows 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n f i y i 6 r r m s e i 1 n f i y i 2 n 1 n i 1 n f i 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n f i y i 2 i 1 n f i y 2 where fi is the simulated value yi is the observed value y is the averaged observed value n is the sample size the mae value close to 0 the rrmse value close to 0 and the nse value close to 1 0 show the accuracy of the model the coefficient of determination r 2 is used in this paper to evaluate the performance of regression equation which is defined as follows 8 r 2 i 1 n y i y f i f 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n f i f 2 2 5 2 indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge there are four indices used to evaluate the effectiveness of saline alkali land managements including two existing indices soil desalinization rate and salt discharge amount and two proposed ones which are the critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching soil desalinization rate is an evaluation index used to characterize the degree of soil desalinization while eliminates the influence of initial value which is defined as the ratio of the change value of soil salt mass to the initial soil salt mass within a certain depth of soil profile the formula of soil desalinization rate is shown as 9 n s 1 s 2 s 1 100 where n is the desalinization rate s 1 and s 2 are the initial and final soil salt mass within a certain depth kg the root zone depth 0 8 m of cotton was chosen to calculate the desalinization rate in this study salt discharge amount denoted as s represents the mass of salt discharged from one subsurface pipe during the whole drainage process which is averaged to unit length in the direction perpendicular to the subsurface drain in this study to eliminate the influence of pipe spacing critical depth of soil desalinization proposed in this study is another index used to characterize the degree of soil desalinization and represent the ability of the subsurface pipe to control the groundwater table level and salt the critical depth of soil desalinization denoted as hc is defined as a certain depth in the soil profile above which the soil salinity decreases after leaching and drainage while the soil salinity below this depth may increase the ratio of salt discharge and leaching denoted as rd l proposed in this study is an index used to distinguish the contribution of salt discharged by subsurface pipes and leaching it is defined as the ratio of the amount of salt discharged from the subsurface pipe to amount of salt that would be leached below the given depth in the absence of drainage pipe the given depth is consistent with that of n it can be considered that contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization is greater than that of leaching when rd l is greater than 100 the formula of ratio of salt discharge and leaching is shown as follows 10 r d l s l m 1 m 2 100 where s is the salt discharge amount per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the subsurface drain kg m l is the subsurface pipe spacing m m 1 and m 2 are the initial and final soil salt mass within a certain depth of soil profile without subsurface pipe kg 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results of soil water content and salinity before irrigation and after drainage figs 3 and 4 respectively plot the measured soil water content and soil salinity profiles of the nine experiment treatments before and after the winter irrigation it can be found that the soil water content of each treatment is about 0 2 m3 m3 before irrigation with an increase trend from top soil to the bottom of the soil profile after leaching and drainage the soil water content of each treatment increases to 0 3 m3 m3 with a more uniform soil profile from the top to the bottom fig 4 shows that the initial soil salinity of each treatment before irrigation has high spatial variation from 5 to 17 g kg within the depth of 0 6 m the salinity below 0 6 m is relatively uniform ranging from 2 to 10 g kg after leaching and drainage a significant decrease of soil salinity is observed within the depth of 0 6 m for each soil profile with the soil salinity ranging from 2 to 8 g kg relative smaller change of soil salinity is found below 0 6 m while the spatial variations of salinity is still relatively high for the whole profile of each treatment the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipes were calculated in this section to provide data for model calibration and validation in subsequent sections the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipes were calculated according to the change of soil water content and salinity of the whole profile which are shown in table 4 significant variations of the water salt discharge amount among different treatments can be found the water discharge amount ranges from 11 95 117 82 m3 and salt discharge amount ranges from 461 kg to 2315 kg for different treatments no significant trend can be found in the water discharge and salt discharge amounts with the layout parameters 3 2 soil desalinization rate and its influence factors under the experiment conditions due to the high spatial variability of soil salinity under experimental conditions as shown in fig 4 only the significant influence factor of soil desalinization rate n can be analyzed herein since n can eliminate the influence of initial value the soil desalinization rate of each treatment was calculated by eq 9 according to the initial and final salt mass within 0 8 m of soil profile as listed in table 5 the soil desalinization rate ranges from 20 31 to 52 86 the soil desalinization rate increases with the deeper drain depth under the same drain spacing and it increases with the shorter drain spacing under the same drain depth the correlation coefficients of the three factors including the drain spacing drain depth and pipe diameter with the soil desalinization rate were calculated which are 0 53 0 79 and 0 16 respectively it can be found that the drain spacing and drain depth have significant influence on the soil desalinization rate under 0 05 and 0 01 significance level respectively while the pipe diameter has no significant impact on the soil desalinization rate the correlation coefficient 0 53 between the drain spacing and the soil desalinization rate demonstrates that the drain spacing is negatively correlated with the soil desalinization rate while correlation coefficient 0 79 between the drain depth and the soil desalinization rate shows the positive correlation in general the drain depth and drain spacing have more important impacts on the soil desalinization than the pipe diameter does the other three indices e g s hc rd l are not shown herein since they are not only impacted by the layout parameters but also influenced by the initial soil water and salt contents thus the numerical simulations should be carried out to investigate the relationships between these indices and the layout parameters by setting the same initial conditions 3 3 calibration and validation of model parameters the swms 2d model was calibrated according to the observed soil water content and soil salinity of a1 a5 and was validated according to the data of a6 a9 the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipe of all treatments were also compared as mentioned above the parameters involved in swms 2d model include 5 soil water flow parameters e g θr θs ks α and n 2 solute transport parameters e g dl and dt and 2 parameters for estimating the subsurface drainage discharge e g cd and d all these 9 parameters were obtained by manual model calibration the soil texture shown in table 1 was used as a reference for the appropriate range of values for the soil hydraulic parameters and the range of solute parameters were based on the research of yang 2016 cd and d were obtained according to the recommended values of fipps et al 1986 the simulated and observed soil water content and soil salt salinity averages of different soil profiles under each treatment are shown in figs 5 and 6 the 3 model evaluation indices including mae rrmse and nse for all the 9 treatments of all sampling profiles are listed in table 6 the mre of soil water content simulated by the swms 2d model ranges from 0 021 to 0 11 and the corresponding rrmse from 6 9 to 35 3 and nse from 4 1 to 0 81 the mre of soil salinity simulated by the swms 2d model ranges from 0 73 g kg to 3 24 g kg and the corresponding rrmse from 15 79 to 64 63 and nse from 5 02 to 0 53 for all samples the mre values of soil water content and soil salinity are 0 043 and 1 50 g kg rrmse values 15 40 and 36 09 and nse values 0 24 and 0 65 the measured and simulated results of accumulated water discharge and salt discharge amounts of subsurface drainage pipe under the 9 treatments are shown in fig 7 the rrmse values of accumulated water and salt discharge amounts simulated by the swms 2d model are 18 and 30 the deviation of accumulated water discharge amount is smaller than that of the accumulated salt discharge amount the deviations of numerical simulations in the study are caused by the strong spatial variability of soil water content and soil salinity however the increasing trend of soil water content profiles and discharging trend of soil salt content profiles are consistent with the observed values and the simulated values of the accumulated water discharge amount and salt discharge amount have satisfactory performance in comparison to measured values in general the simulation results are acceptable the calibrated parameters of soil water and salt transport are shown in table 7 which will be used for further prediction under the assumed scenarios listed in section 2 4 3 4 soil salt distribution under the 24 prediction scenarios with various drain depths and drain spacings the calibrated swms 2d model was used to estimate the 24 compositions of drain spacing and drain depth with the same initial conditions the relationship of the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg the value of which is considered as no harm to the production of the major crop cotton wang 2018 2014 with the drain spacing and drain depth after leaching are shown in fig 8 it should be noted the area percentage defined here is the area with salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg divided by the area of soil profile above 0 8 m it can be found that the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg decreases with the longer drain spacing while increases with the deeper drain depth the variation of the area percentage among scenarios with different depths becomes smaller with the increase of drain spacing the area percentage values are 42 38 104 55 298 36 and 355 63 when the depths are 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m with the drain spacing 10 m while the values are 27 41 39 38 128 89 and 155 70 when the depths are 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m with the drain spacing 50 m it can also be found that the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg becomes small smaller than 100 and constant when the drain spacing is longer than 20 m and the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to guarantee the salinity of plough layer smaller than a given critical value 3 5 four indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under prediction scenarios and their significant factors the four indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under prediction scenarios and their significant factors are calculated and analyzed in this section 3 5 1 soil desalinization rate the soil desalinization rate n of each prediction scenario was calculated by eq 9 according to the initial and final soil salinity within 0 8 m of soil profile and are shown in fig 9 the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on n are listed in table 8 fig 9 a and fig 9 b show that n ranges from 34 51 to 54 30 under different prediction scenarios and has positive linear correlation with the drain depth while has no significant trend with the drain spacing the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that the drain depth has significant influence on n p 0 01 while drain spacing has no significant influence on n p 0 05 in section 3 2 both drain spacing and drain depth under the nine experiment treatments have significant influence on n the different results are caused by the different range of layout parameters between the experiment treatments and prediction scenarios as shown in fig 9 a the negative correlation can be found between n and the drain spacing when the drain spacing is shorter than 20 m and drain depth shallower than 1 4 m which are close to those under experimental conditions for the same drain depth the n value tends to be constant when the drain spacing is long enough therefore the drain spacing is not significant impact factor to n in these prediction scenarios 3 5 2 salt discharge amount the salt discharge amount s of each prediction scenario is shown in fig 9 and the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on s are listed in table 8 fig 9 c and fig 9 d show that s ranges from 0 32 kg m2 to 12 38 kg m2 under different prediction scenarios and has negative linear correlation with the drain spacing while has positive linear correlation with the drain depth the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that both drain depth and drain spacing has significant influence on s p 0 01 it can also be found in fig 9 that s becomes very small and tends to 0 when the drain spacing is longer than 30 m and the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to discharge soil salt under these conditions 3 5 3 critical depth of soil desalinization soil salinity before and after leaching of soil profile in each prediction scenario is shown in fig 10 the soil profile mentioned above locates in one side of subsurface pipe with a distance of a quarter drain spacing the critical depth of soil desalinization hc of each prediction scenario is determined according to fig 10 the hc values of different drain spacing and depth are shown in fig 9 e and fig 9 f and the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on hc are listed in table 8 fig 9 shows that h c ranges from 0 68 m to 0 97 m under different prediction scenarios and has positive linear correlation with the drain depth while has no significant trend with drain spacing the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that the drain depth has significant influence on the critical depth of soil desalinization p 0 01 while the drain spacing has no significant influence on the critical depth of soil desalinization p 0 05 this is because the drain depth determines the groundwater level after drainage and thus determines the depth that the salt in leaching water can arrive it can also be found in fig 9 f that the h c increases with the drain depth only when the drain depth becomes deeper than 1 0 m the h c ranges 0 68 m to 0 77 m for those scenarios with the drain depth shallower than 1 0 m and the average hc is 0 73 m which is equal to the hc of p25 with 0 72 m the scenario without subsurface drainage pipe this phenomenon further demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to control the groundwater level with the drain depth shallower than 1 0 m 3 5 4 ratio of salt discharge and leaching the ratio of salt discharge and leaching rd l of each prediction scenario was calculated by eq 10 which is shown in fig 9 g and fig 9 h the results of significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on rd l are listed in table 8 fig 9 shows that the ratio of salt discharge and leaching has negative linear correlation with the drain spacing while has positive linear correlation with the drain depth the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that both drain depth and drain spacing has significant influence on the ratio of salt discharge and leaching p 0 01 the rd l is smaller than 100 when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the ignorable contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization 3 5 5 comparison of indices between the prediction scenarios and corresponding experiment treatments to analyze the reliability of simulated results the indices values of the prediction scenarios were compared with those of field experiments as shown in table 9 the n values of the three scenarios p7 p8 and p9 were chosen to compare with those of the experiment treatments a8 a5 and a2 since their pipe layout parameters are similar the s and hc values of one scenario p8 was compared with that of the experiment treatment a5 since their initial condition and pipe layout parameters are similar rd l was not compared with experiment results since the desalination rate without subsurface pipe is unavailable for field experiment it can be found that the n values calculated by field experiments and prediction scenarios are 27 39 and 39 43 respectively and h c values are 0 8 m and 0 72 m while s values are 2021 kg and 2415 kg respectively which demonstrate the reliability of prediction results in general all the four indices represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects of subsurface drainage pipes from different aspects the proposed indices rd l is the only one that can distinguish the contribution of salt discharge by subsurface drainage pipe and leaching hc is necessary to be considered when designing the layout parameters of subsurface pipes since it can guarantee to decrease the soil salinity after leaching and drainage within a certain depth in this study rd l and hc are considered as the effective indices to provide guidance for subsurface pipes layout parameters 3 6 analysis of suitable layout parameters when considering the soil desalinization and salt discharge the quantitative relationship between the two proposed indices including rd l and hc and layout parameters were established to provide guidance for the design of subsurface drainage system in this section as shown in fig 11 the r 2 of the fitted formula ranges from 0 93 to 0 96 and the corresponding rrmse ranges from 1 41 to 3 51 which indicates that the obtained fitted formulas can quantitatively describe the relationship between the two indices and the layout parameters of subsurface pipes considering the major purpose of subsurface drainage system to drain root zone salt out to ensure crop yield in south xinjiang province the quantitative relationships between the rd l and hc and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe were integrated with the economic conditions when figuring out the suitable layout parameters the installation cost of the subsurface pipes can be written as follows 11 c l 0 l a 0 4 b d d where c is the cost of installing subsurface pipes l 0 is the length of area m the value 0 4 means that the excavation section width is 0 4 m when installing subsurface pipes a is the pipe price of per unit length b is the excavation and backfilling earthwork fee of per unit area the constrained conditions are determined by practical situation and construction level and the targeted soil desalinization and salt discharge which are shown as follows 12 d d 1 d d d d 2 h c 0 3 d d 0 43 h c t a r r d l 1 57 l 256 60 d d 11 63 r d l t a r where dd 1 is the shallowest depth to prevent disturbing machine tillage dd 2 is the maximum depth under the condition of the existing pipe laying crane hc tar and rd l tar are the targeted critical depth of soil desalinization and targeted ratio of salt discharge and leaching the drain depth and spacing can then be determined by using eq 12 and different drain depths and spacings can be obtained when considering different targeted soil desalinization and salt discharge indices the empirical formula to calculate the drain depth and spacing recommended by the technical regulation on subsurface drainage and desalination soil part 2 planning design and construction ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2013 hereinafter referred to as the professional standard is as follows 13 l γ k s d d where ks is the saturation hydraulic conductivity m d γ is the empirical coefficient which is 40 30 20 for clay loam and sand when using eq 13 the drain depth is first determined by the critical depth of groundwater the determined drain depth and spacing in the experiment area by the proposed method considering the salt discharge amount and by the professional standard were compared when using eq 13 γ is set as 30 since the area owns sandy soil and the average hydraulic conductivity ks is used as 0 76 m d then l equals to 22 8dd in this area the recommended critical depth of groundwater in arid area is 1 8 2 8 m ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2013 then the drain spacing is 41 64 m when using the proposed method shown in eq 12 to determine the drain spacing and depth the dd 1 and dd 2 are set as 0 6 m and 1 8 m different rd l tar are considered while hc tar is set as 0 8 m which is the root zone depth of cotton since the initial salt mass of the soil profile within 80 cm is 10 060 g m2 according to table 5 different rd l tar values are set as 151 182 212 242 273 and 302 which are considered to remove 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 of soil salt in the profile within 80 cm respectively the obtained drain depth is the same as 1 8 m under the rd l tar values and the drain spacings are 122 m 103 m 84 m 65 m 46 m and 28 m respectively it can be found that much shorter drain spacing is needed when the rd l tar is set to remove 100 of the salt in the soil profile when the rd l tar is set to remove below 80 of the soil salt in the profile longer drain spacing can be used compared with results obtained by the professional standard more options of layout parameters can be provided by the proposed method to consider the requirement of washing salt out for arid and semi arid agricultural irrigation areas with shallow groundwater table depth and sandy soil types the subsurface drainage pipes for desalinization are recommended to be installed deeper than 1 m while the drain spacing could be sparse the specific layout parameters could be obtained by solving the eq 11 and eq 12 simultaneously 4 conclusions in this paper the effects of layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe on the soil desalinization were studied through experiments and numerical simulations in arid agricultural areas the swms 2d model was calibrated and validated by using the experimental data which was then used to calculate the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under different scenarios of drain depth and drain spacing the quantitative relationship between the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge and layout parameters was obtained to provide guidance for designing subsurface drainage systems in arid and semi arid regions the major conclusions are as follows 1 the drain spacing and drain depth show significant impact on soil desalinization rate while the impact of pipe diameter can be ignored under experimental conditions 2 the swms 2d model is proved to be able to simulate soil water and solute transport under condition of subsurface drainage in the experimental region which can capture the soil water and salt movement and the accumulated water and salt discharge amount well 3 the two proposed indices e g the critical depth of soil desalinization and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching are useful to represent the salt discharge effects of subsurface drainage pipes the critical depth of soil desalinization indicates the ability of the subsurface pipes to control the groundwater table level and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching can distinguish the contribution of subsurface pipes in soil desalinization with leaching 4 under the prediction scenarios all of the four indices have significant positive linear correlations with the drain depth while only the salt discharge amount and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching have significant negative linear correlation influence with the drain spacing 5 subsurface drainage pipe is invalid to discharge soil salt or to control the groundwater level when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m the contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization is ignorable when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m 6 integrating the quantitative relationship between the critical depth of soil desalinization the ratio of salt discharge and leaching and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe with the economic conditions provides more options to choose the layout parameters to consider the requirement of discharging salt out declaration of

10386,subsurface drainage is effective for not only controlling groundwater table depth but also alleviating soil salinization especially in arid and semi arid agricultural areas while substantial research efforts have been spent to determine the parameters e g drain depth drain spacing and pipe diameter of subsurface drainage pipe layout for water drainage less attention has been paid to determine the parameters for salt discharge which is important in arid and semi arid regions this paper presents a comprehensive study that used experimental and numerical methods to determine the pipe layout parameters for both water and salt drainage a total of nine field experiments were conducted in yanqi county an arid area of xinjiang province china for a combination of different values of drain depth drain spacing and pipe diameter the experimental results indicate that drain depth and spacing are significantly more important than pipe diameter for soil desalinization soil water content and salinity measured during the experiments were used to calibrate and validate a numerical model developed for simulating soil water flow and salt transport under drainage conditions two proposed indices critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching combined with two existing indices salt discharge amount and soil desalinization rate were used to represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects under different subsurface pipe layout parameters the results suggest that drain depth has a significant influence on all indices while the drain spacing has a significant influence on salt discharge amount and ratio of salt discharge and leaching the relationships between layout parameters of subsurface pipes and proposed indices were quantified and used to determine appropriate layout parameters of subsurface pipes keywords subsurface drainage drain depth drain spacing salt discharge numerical modeling 1 introduction in arid and semi arid regions soil salinization is a serious threat to crop yield and ecological environments dregne 2002 li et al 2016 to control soil salinization and preserve agricultural lands it has become popular to use subsurface drainage pipes for lowering groundwater level and discharging soil salt haj amor and bouri 2019 ritzema and schultz 2011 wang et al 2007 however there are a number of open questions for designing drainage pipe layout for salt drainage because subsurface drainage pipes were originally used in humid or coastal areas to remove excess precipitation surface ponding water or prevent seawater intrusion and to improve root zone soil conditions ritzema et al 2008 ritzema 2016 singh 2009 skaggs et al 1994 jafari talukolaee et al 2016 for the conventional soil drainage various experiments have been conducted to investigate impacts of drainage pipe layout parameters on amounts of water discharge decreases of groundwater table depth and drainage duration of surface ponding water jafari talukolaee et al 2016 2015 su et al 2005 ogino and ota 2007 many theoretical studies have also been conducted to guide the layout of subsurface drainage pipes in these regions when considering to remove the excess water tao et al 2019 yousfi et al 2014 liang et al 2015 youngs 1984 kirkham 1949 however these experimental and theoretical results obtained in humid areas for water drainage may be not suitable for salt drainage in arid and semi arid agricultural areas the agricultural area considered in this study is the southern xinjiang province of china where annual precipitation ranges between 20 mm 100 mm and annual evaporation from water surface is about 2000 mm liu et al 2009 wu et al 2010 because of the high evaporation and shallow water table depth due to the low lying terrain soil salt accumulates on ground surface and threats sustainability of local agricultural development one way to control soil salinization is to wash soil salt out by winter irrigation after harvest and using intensive open drains to drain soil water and salt out after the winter irrigation however the open drains are not cost effective because they not only occupy substantial cultivated lands but also require heavy desilting maintenance every year to ensure drainage flow fausey et al 1982 wang et al 2007 subsurface drainage pipes are planned to replace open drains for salt drainage and land saving by the local government since subsurface drainage systems do not occupy lands and cope well with existing farm management practices wang et al 2007 however among the limited number of researches on subsurface drainage in arid and semi arid regions few researches have been found to propose indices of estimating salt desalinization effects of subsurface drainage pipe and to consider these indices for designing the layout of subsurface drainage pipes in the study area it is thus necessary to figure out appropriate indices to reflect the effect of soil desalinization and salt discharge which can be used to determine suitable layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes recently experimental studies have been used to evaluate the role of subsurface drainage pipes on soil desalinization and the amount of salt discharge in arid and semi arid areas haj amor and bouri 2019 he et al 2016 hornbuckle et al 2007 nozari et al 2018 sharma et al 2000 investigated the long term impacts of subsurface drainage on improving soil properties and increasing crop yield by a field experiment and demonstrated that the larger drain spacing with deep drain depth was adequate in sandy loam soils he et al 2016 used field experiments to compare the effects of using subsurface drainage and open drainage on soil salt leaching and found that using subsurface drainage is more effective nozari et al 2018 estimated the effects of drain depth and spacing on soil salt removal by using lab experiments one limitation of laboratory and field experiments in current researches is that they can only consider a small number of subsurface layout parameters due to high experiment cost and intensive lab and field work thus cannot adequately characterize the effects of layout parameters of subsurface pipe on soil desalinization and salt discharge however the field investigation work is always needed to reflect local conditions as recommended by sreenivas and reddy 2008 one way to address this problem is to undertake more scenarios of field experiments for understanding the specific impact factors when designing layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe for washing salt out in arid areas there are many different design objectives used to guide the layout design of subsurface drainage pipes in humid regions crop yield drainage intensity and nitrogen loss were considered by singh et al 2006 for designing the subsurface drainage systems in iowa s tile landscapes wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 developed a semi analytical solution for calculating drain spacing by considering the possibly largest soil water retention during the periods of excessive rainfall or snow melt kannan 2008 calculated the required drain spacing by considering drawdown conditions under various rainfall distributions infiltration rates and allowable water logging tolerances for the swamps in rwanda when considering the objective to estimate the effect of layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes on salt discharge there are two quantitative indices commonly used including the soil desalinization rate and salt discharge amount soil desalinization rate was used to estimate the decreasing degree of soil salinity after leaching he et al 2016 and amount of salt discharge was used to estimate the amount of salt that discharged by subsurface pipes jafari talukolaee et al 2015 however these two indices cannot distinguish the effects of salt leaching and salt discharge thus they are not adequately used for determining the subsurface layout parameters effects on salt discharge using numerical models of soil water and solute migration is an effective way to determine the layout parameters because numerical models can simulate soil water flow and salt migration with various layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe under complex field conditions example numerical models include but not limited to macro larsbo and jarvis 2003 hydrus šimůnek et al 2006 and drainmod skaggs et al 2012 hydrus and drainmod are the two most popular models to simulate soil water flow and salt migration under subsurface drainage conditions in hydrus a subsurface drainage pipe is modeled as a seepage face with complicated shifting boundary between specified head boundary and non flux boundary in draimod the hooghoudt equation hooghoudt 1940 and kirkham kirkham 1958 equation are used to calculate lateral drainage flux and integrated with the richards equation for calculating the transient pressure head of soil the two models have been used in many applications with subsurface drainage pipes ebrahimian and noory 2015 karandish et al 2018 singh et al 2006 drainmod is more suitable for simulating water discharge in humid areas skaggs 1978 while hydrus is suitable for both humid and arid regions šimůnek et al 2016 in this study the public domain code swms 2d based on which hydrus was developed was used for the numerical simulation of water flow and salt transport under the subsurface drainage pipe conditions the ultimate goal of this study is to assess the influence of subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters on soil desalinization and salt discharge two indices named as the critical depth of soil desalinization and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching were proposed to represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge under various subsurface drainage pipe layout parameters the field experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to figure out the relationships between layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes and the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge in arid agricultural areas the field experiments were conducted for nine treatments with consideration of three drain depths three drain spacings and three pipe diameters which were used for winter irrigation to wash salt out in xinjiang province china soil water content and salinity were measured before and after irrigation and used to calibrate and validate swms 2d model the calibrated model was used to calculate soil desalinization effects under more scenarios with different subsurface drainage pipe layouts based on the numerical modeling results the relationships between the indices and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipes were analyzed and quantified which can be used to provide guidance for subsurface pipes layout parameters in arid agricultural areas 2 materials and methods a technological roadmap including the design and data analysis of the field experiments the calibration and validation of the numerical model and the prediction results analysis is shown in fig 1 the details of which are elaborated in the following sections 2 1 field experiments the field experiments were conducted from october to november 2018 during winter irrigation on a farmland with the size of 6 5 ha the experimental site 41 51 n 86 27 e is located in the center of the yanqi basin of xinjiang province china as shown in fig 2 a the region has a typical temperate continental climate with an annual evaporation of 1890 1 mm and annual precipitation 73 1 mm the groundwater depth and salinity at the experiment site before winter irrigation were 2 26 m and 337 ms m large amount of winter irrigation happens in october after harvest and the purpose is to leach the soil salt out of root zone to control the soil salinization chang et al 2019 lu et al 2019 han 2017 cotton as the representative crop in the study area liu et al 2012 wang 2018 was chosen to access the appropriate range of the soil salinization indices for suitable crop growth in the next year the local irrigation quota was measured by observing the branch canal flow every four hours during the irrigation period which was 490 mm electrical conductivity of irrigation water was measured as 0 033 ms m the soil is sand mixed with clay within the depth of 1 8 m from land surface but more sandy below 1 8 m the bulk density percentages of sand silt and clay and soil texture within the depth of 2 m are listed in table 1 since the deep ploughing within the depth of 0 4 m was carried out before the experiment the 2 surface layers 0 0 2 m 0 2 0 4 m had the small bulk density a total of nine field experimental treatments denoted as a1 a9 were conducted to consider three drain depths 0 8 m 1 1 m and 1 4 m three drain spacings 20 m 10 m and 6 m and three pipe diameters 90 mm 110 mm and 160 mm as listed in table 2 the drain depth spacing and pipe diameter of each treatment are chosen according to the principle of orthogonal experimental design gao 1988 and each variable is combined only once among all the treatments the arrangement of the field experiments is shown in fig 2 b each experimental treatment used three drain pipes installed with a uniform slope of 2 the drainage pipes were wrapped with geotextile envelopes with 3 of pipe surface area left for open holes the total width of the field site is 86 m and a 2 m deep drainage ditch locates along the field soil water content and soil salinity were measured from soil samples taken on october 11 2018 before the winter irrigation and on november 16 2018 after the winter irrigation the sample locations relative to a pipe are shown in fig 2 d and the locations were determined by drain spacing if the drain spacing is 6 m there are three sample locations located in one side of the second pipe among the three pipes with the distances of 1 m 2 m and 3 m the distances become 1 m 2 5 m and 5 m when the drain spacing is 10 m and become 2 m 4 m 6 m 8 m and 10 m when the drain spacing is 20 m at each sample location multiple soil samples were taken every 0 2 m from land surface within the depth of 2 m for groundwater table depth shallower than 2 m soil samples were taken until the groundwater table depth the electrical conductivity of 1 5 soil water extract ec 1 5 was measured by an electrical conductivity meter the relationship between the total dissolved salt tds and ec 1 5 was obtained by 15 soil samples selected randomly from all the samples and the relationship between tds and ec 1 5 is shown as 1 tds 0 059ec 1 5 0 264 r 2 0 96 where the unit of tds and ec 1 5 are g kg and ms m respectively 2 2 numerical model in swms 2d the unsaturated saturated water flow is governed by the two dimensional 2d richards equation 2 θ t x i k k i j a h x j k i z a where θ is the volumetric moisture content m3 m3 h is the soil water potential m subscripts i j 1 2 represent the x and z directions k i j a is the component for the anisotropic tensor ka and k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil m d the improved van genuchten equations are used to describe the relation between θ k and h van genuchten 1980 the equations have five parameters and they are the residual water content θr saturated water content θs saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and two parameters α and n the 2d convection dispersion equation is used to describe the solute transport as follows 3 θ c t x i θ d i j c x j q i c x i where c is the solute concentration in soil water kg m3 and qi is the darcy velocity in the i th direction m d dij is the saturated unsaturated hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient m2 d in swms 2d a subsurface drainage pipe is represented by a vertex and the hydraulic conductivity around the vertex is adjusted to consider the influence of the subsurface drainage pipe according to the following equation 4 k d r a i n k c d where kdrain is the adjusted hydraulic conductivity m d k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer where the subsurface drainage pipe located m d and cd is a correction factor the details of the subsurface drainage boundary and the calculation of cd can be found in vimoke et al 1962 and fipps et al 1986 2 3 swms 2d model setup a numerical model based on swms 2d was developed to simulate water flow and salt transport under the 9 experimental treatments with various layout parameters listed in table 2 as shown in fig 2 c the simulation domain was rectangular with the length of drain spacing l and the depth of 5 m the left and right boundaries were set as the no flux boundary the impervious layer was set at the depth of 5 m which has slight impact on the soil solute transport to the drainage pipes the upper boundary was set as the atmospheric boundary considering the daily irrigation precipitation and evaporation the finite element mesh of the simulation domain was generated by gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 the setup of the simulation domain and boundary conditions as well as the mesh is shown in fig 2 c the daily irrigation was estimated by dividing the total winter irrigation of 490 mm by 16 days the period from october 24 to november 10 according to the meteorological data of a local weather station installed near the experimental site the evaporation of the experiment month was 45 61 mm and the daily evaporation of 1 52 mm was estimated by dividing the evaporation by 30 days the salt concentration of the irrigation water originated from the snowmelt water of the tianshan mountains was set as 0 since the electrical conductivity was much smaller than the electrical conductivity of the groundwater and soil water ec 1 5 at the experimental site the initial conditions of soil water content and salinity were set to the value of the closest sampling points before winter irrigation 2 4 prediction scenarios under different layout parameters limited by the field experiment the drain depth ranging from 0 8 m to 1 4 m and the drain spacing ranging from 6 m to 20 m would not cover the appropriate layout parameters in this area what s more the soil desalinization and salt discharge efficiency would also be influenced by the variation of the initial soil water content and soil salinity thus the validated model swms 2d was used to simulate the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects under different layout parameters with the same initial soil water content and soil salinity conditions as shown in table 1 the drain depth was extended to the range from 0 6 m to 1 8 m and the drain spacing to the range from 5 m to 50 m there were a total of 24 prediction scenarios denoted as p1 p24 with 4 drain depths 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m and 6 drain spacings 5 m 10 m 20 m 30 m 40 m and 50 m shown in table 3 in addition to the 24 scenarios mentioned there was a scenario without subsurface pipe denoted as p25 the boundary conditions and soil characteristics of the 24 simulation scenarios were the same as those in the experiment site the boundary conditions and soil characteristics of p25 were consistent with the other 24 scenarios while there was no subsurface drainage pipe arranged in this scenario soil salinity above the given depth can only be reduced by leaching in this scenario by comparing with other scenarios with subsurface pipes it is possible to distinguish the amount of salt discharged from subsurface pipes and the amount of salt leached the prediction scenarios did not consider pipe diameter because the field experiments indicate that it owns slight impact on soil desalinization as discussed below in section 3 2 2 5 model evaluation indices and indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge 2 5 1 model evaluation indices to evaluate the goodness of fit between simulated and observed values three statistical metrics including the mean absolute error mae the relative root mean square error rrmse and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are defined as follows 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n f i y i 6 r r m s e i 1 n f i y i 2 n 1 n i 1 n f i 2 7 n s e 1 i 1 n f i y i 2 i 1 n f i y 2 where fi is the simulated value yi is the observed value y is the averaged observed value n is the sample size the mae value close to 0 the rrmse value close to 0 and the nse value close to 1 0 show the accuracy of the model the coefficient of determination r 2 is used in this paper to evaluate the performance of regression equation which is defined as follows 8 r 2 i 1 n y i y f i f 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n f i f 2 2 5 2 indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge there are four indices used to evaluate the effectiveness of saline alkali land managements including two existing indices soil desalinization rate and salt discharge amount and two proposed ones which are the critical depth of soil desalinization and ratio of salt discharge and leaching soil desalinization rate is an evaluation index used to characterize the degree of soil desalinization while eliminates the influence of initial value which is defined as the ratio of the change value of soil salt mass to the initial soil salt mass within a certain depth of soil profile the formula of soil desalinization rate is shown as 9 n s 1 s 2 s 1 100 where n is the desalinization rate s 1 and s 2 are the initial and final soil salt mass within a certain depth kg the root zone depth 0 8 m of cotton was chosen to calculate the desalinization rate in this study salt discharge amount denoted as s represents the mass of salt discharged from one subsurface pipe during the whole drainage process which is averaged to unit length in the direction perpendicular to the subsurface drain in this study to eliminate the influence of pipe spacing critical depth of soil desalinization proposed in this study is another index used to characterize the degree of soil desalinization and represent the ability of the subsurface pipe to control the groundwater table level and salt the critical depth of soil desalinization denoted as hc is defined as a certain depth in the soil profile above which the soil salinity decreases after leaching and drainage while the soil salinity below this depth may increase the ratio of salt discharge and leaching denoted as rd l proposed in this study is an index used to distinguish the contribution of salt discharged by subsurface pipes and leaching it is defined as the ratio of the amount of salt discharged from the subsurface pipe to amount of salt that would be leached below the given depth in the absence of drainage pipe the given depth is consistent with that of n it can be considered that contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization is greater than that of leaching when rd l is greater than 100 the formula of ratio of salt discharge and leaching is shown as follows 10 r d l s l m 1 m 2 100 where s is the salt discharge amount per unit length in the direction perpendicular to the subsurface drain kg m l is the subsurface pipe spacing m m 1 and m 2 are the initial and final soil salt mass within a certain depth of soil profile without subsurface pipe kg 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results of soil water content and salinity before irrigation and after drainage figs 3 and 4 respectively plot the measured soil water content and soil salinity profiles of the nine experiment treatments before and after the winter irrigation it can be found that the soil water content of each treatment is about 0 2 m3 m3 before irrigation with an increase trend from top soil to the bottom of the soil profile after leaching and drainage the soil water content of each treatment increases to 0 3 m3 m3 with a more uniform soil profile from the top to the bottom fig 4 shows that the initial soil salinity of each treatment before irrigation has high spatial variation from 5 to 17 g kg within the depth of 0 6 m the salinity below 0 6 m is relatively uniform ranging from 2 to 10 g kg after leaching and drainage a significant decrease of soil salinity is observed within the depth of 0 6 m for each soil profile with the soil salinity ranging from 2 to 8 g kg relative smaller change of soil salinity is found below 0 6 m while the spatial variations of salinity is still relatively high for the whole profile of each treatment the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipes were calculated in this section to provide data for model calibration and validation in subsequent sections the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipes were calculated according to the change of soil water content and salinity of the whole profile which are shown in table 4 significant variations of the water salt discharge amount among different treatments can be found the water discharge amount ranges from 11 95 117 82 m3 and salt discharge amount ranges from 461 kg to 2315 kg for different treatments no significant trend can be found in the water discharge and salt discharge amounts with the layout parameters 3 2 soil desalinization rate and its influence factors under the experiment conditions due to the high spatial variability of soil salinity under experimental conditions as shown in fig 4 only the significant influence factor of soil desalinization rate n can be analyzed herein since n can eliminate the influence of initial value the soil desalinization rate of each treatment was calculated by eq 9 according to the initial and final salt mass within 0 8 m of soil profile as listed in table 5 the soil desalinization rate ranges from 20 31 to 52 86 the soil desalinization rate increases with the deeper drain depth under the same drain spacing and it increases with the shorter drain spacing under the same drain depth the correlation coefficients of the three factors including the drain spacing drain depth and pipe diameter with the soil desalinization rate were calculated which are 0 53 0 79 and 0 16 respectively it can be found that the drain spacing and drain depth have significant influence on the soil desalinization rate under 0 05 and 0 01 significance level respectively while the pipe diameter has no significant impact on the soil desalinization rate the correlation coefficient 0 53 between the drain spacing and the soil desalinization rate demonstrates that the drain spacing is negatively correlated with the soil desalinization rate while correlation coefficient 0 79 between the drain depth and the soil desalinization rate shows the positive correlation in general the drain depth and drain spacing have more important impacts on the soil desalinization than the pipe diameter does the other three indices e g s hc rd l are not shown herein since they are not only impacted by the layout parameters but also influenced by the initial soil water and salt contents thus the numerical simulations should be carried out to investigate the relationships between these indices and the layout parameters by setting the same initial conditions 3 3 calibration and validation of model parameters the swms 2d model was calibrated according to the observed soil water content and soil salinity of a1 a5 and was validated according to the data of a6 a9 the amounts of water and salt discharged to the subsurface drainage pipe of all treatments were also compared as mentioned above the parameters involved in swms 2d model include 5 soil water flow parameters e g θr θs ks α and n 2 solute transport parameters e g dl and dt and 2 parameters for estimating the subsurface drainage discharge e g cd and d all these 9 parameters were obtained by manual model calibration the soil texture shown in table 1 was used as a reference for the appropriate range of values for the soil hydraulic parameters and the range of solute parameters were based on the research of yang 2016 cd and d were obtained according to the recommended values of fipps et al 1986 the simulated and observed soil water content and soil salt salinity averages of different soil profiles under each treatment are shown in figs 5 and 6 the 3 model evaluation indices including mae rrmse and nse for all the 9 treatments of all sampling profiles are listed in table 6 the mre of soil water content simulated by the swms 2d model ranges from 0 021 to 0 11 and the corresponding rrmse from 6 9 to 35 3 and nse from 4 1 to 0 81 the mre of soil salinity simulated by the swms 2d model ranges from 0 73 g kg to 3 24 g kg and the corresponding rrmse from 15 79 to 64 63 and nse from 5 02 to 0 53 for all samples the mre values of soil water content and soil salinity are 0 043 and 1 50 g kg rrmse values 15 40 and 36 09 and nse values 0 24 and 0 65 the measured and simulated results of accumulated water discharge and salt discharge amounts of subsurface drainage pipe under the 9 treatments are shown in fig 7 the rrmse values of accumulated water and salt discharge amounts simulated by the swms 2d model are 18 and 30 the deviation of accumulated water discharge amount is smaller than that of the accumulated salt discharge amount the deviations of numerical simulations in the study are caused by the strong spatial variability of soil water content and soil salinity however the increasing trend of soil water content profiles and discharging trend of soil salt content profiles are consistent with the observed values and the simulated values of the accumulated water discharge amount and salt discharge amount have satisfactory performance in comparison to measured values in general the simulation results are acceptable the calibrated parameters of soil water and salt transport are shown in table 7 which will be used for further prediction under the assumed scenarios listed in section 2 4 3 4 soil salt distribution under the 24 prediction scenarios with various drain depths and drain spacings the calibrated swms 2d model was used to estimate the 24 compositions of drain spacing and drain depth with the same initial conditions the relationship of the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg the value of which is considered as no harm to the production of the major crop cotton wang 2018 2014 with the drain spacing and drain depth after leaching are shown in fig 8 it should be noted the area percentage defined here is the area with salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg divided by the area of soil profile above 0 8 m it can be found that the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg decreases with the longer drain spacing while increases with the deeper drain depth the variation of the area percentage among scenarios with different depths becomes smaller with the increase of drain spacing the area percentage values are 42 38 104 55 298 36 and 355 63 when the depths are 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m with the drain spacing 10 m while the values are 27 41 39 38 128 89 and 155 70 when the depths are 0 6 m 1 0 m 1 4 m and 1 8 m with the drain spacing 50 m it can also be found that the area percentage with the soil salinity smaller than 5 5 g kg becomes small smaller than 100 and constant when the drain spacing is longer than 20 m and the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to guarantee the salinity of plough layer smaller than a given critical value 3 5 four indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under prediction scenarios and their significant factors the four indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under prediction scenarios and their significant factors are calculated and analyzed in this section 3 5 1 soil desalinization rate the soil desalinization rate n of each prediction scenario was calculated by eq 9 according to the initial and final soil salinity within 0 8 m of soil profile and are shown in fig 9 the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on n are listed in table 8 fig 9 a and fig 9 b show that n ranges from 34 51 to 54 30 under different prediction scenarios and has positive linear correlation with the drain depth while has no significant trend with the drain spacing the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that the drain depth has significant influence on n p 0 01 while drain spacing has no significant influence on n p 0 05 in section 3 2 both drain spacing and drain depth under the nine experiment treatments have significant influence on n the different results are caused by the different range of layout parameters between the experiment treatments and prediction scenarios as shown in fig 9 a the negative correlation can be found between n and the drain spacing when the drain spacing is shorter than 20 m and drain depth shallower than 1 4 m which are close to those under experimental conditions for the same drain depth the n value tends to be constant when the drain spacing is long enough therefore the drain spacing is not significant impact factor to n in these prediction scenarios 3 5 2 salt discharge amount the salt discharge amount s of each prediction scenario is shown in fig 9 and the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on s are listed in table 8 fig 9 c and fig 9 d show that s ranges from 0 32 kg m2 to 12 38 kg m2 under different prediction scenarios and has negative linear correlation with the drain spacing while has positive linear correlation with the drain depth the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that both drain depth and drain spacing has significant influence on s p 0 01 it can also be found in fig 9 that s becomes very small and tends to 0 when the drain spacing is longer than 30 m and the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to discharge soil salt under these conditions 3 5 3 critical depth of soil desalinization soil salinity before and after leaching of soil profile in each prediction scenario is shown in fig 10 the soil profile mentioned above locates in one side of subsurface pipe with a distance of a quarter drain spacing the critical depth of soil desalinization hc of each prediction scenario is determined according to fig 10 the hc values of different drain spacing and depth are shown in fig 9 e and fig 9 f and the results of the significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on hc are listed in table 8 fig 9 shows that h c ranges from 0 68 m to 0 97 m under different prediction scenarios and has positive linear correlation with the drain depth while has no significant trend with drain spacing the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that the drain depth has significant influence on the critical depth of soil desalinization p 0 01 while the drain spacing has no significant influence on the critical depth of soil desalinization p 0 05 this is because the drain depth determines the groundwater level after drainage and thus determines the depth that the salt in leaching water can arrive it can also be found in fig 9 f that the h c increases with the drain depth only when the drain depth becomes deeper than 1 0 m the h c ranges 0 68 m to 0 77 m for those scenarios with the drain depth shallower than 1 0 m and the average hc is 0 73 m which is equal to the hc of p25 with 0 72 m the scenario without subsurface drainage pipe this phenomenon further demonstrates the invalidity of the subsurface drainage pipe to control the groundwater level with the drain depth shallower than 1 0 m 3 5 4 ratio of salt discharge and leaching the ratio of salt discharge and leaching rd l of each prediction scenario was calculated by eq 10 which is shown in fig 9 g and fig 9 h the results of significance test of the influence of the layout parameters on rd l are listed in table 8 fig 9 shows that the ratio of salt discharge and leaching has negative linear correlation with the drain spacing while has positive linear correlation with the drain depth the trend is consistent with the results of significance test which shows that both drain depth and drain spacing has significant influence on the ratio of salt discharge and leaching p 0 01 the rd l is smaller than 100 when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m which demonstrates the ignorable contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization 3 5 5 comparison of indices between the prediction scenarios and corresponding experiment treatments to analyze the reliability of simulated results the indices values of the prediction scenarios were compared with those of field experiments as shown in table 9 the n values of the three scenarios p7 p8 and p9 were chosen to compare with those of the experiment treatments a8 a5 and a2 since their pipe layout parameters are similar the s and hc values of one scenario p8 was compared with that of the experiment treatment a5 since their initial condition and pipe layout parameters are similar rd l was not compared with experiment results since the desalination rate without subsurface pipe is unavailable for field experiment it can be found that the n values calculated by field experiments and prediction scenarios are 27 39 and 39 43 respectively and h c values are 0 8 m and 0 72 m while s values are 2021 kg and 2415 kg respectively which demonstrate the reliability of prediction results in general all the four indices represent the soil desalinization and salt discharge effects of subsurface drainage pipes from different aspects the proposed indices rd l is the only one that can distinguish the contribution of salt discharge by subsurface drainage pipe and leaching hc is necessary to be considered when designing the layout parameters of subsurface pipes since it can guarantee to decrease the soil salinity after leaching and drainage within a certain depth in this study rd l and hc are considered as the effective indices to provide guidance for subsurface pipes layout parameters 3 6 analysis of suitable layout parameters when considering the soil desalinization and salt discharge the quantitative relationship between the two proposed indices including rd l and hc and layout parameters were established to provide guidance for the design of subsurface drainage system in this section as shown in fig 11 the r 2 of the fitted formula ranges from 0 93 to 0 96 and the corresponding rrmse ranges from 1 41 to 3 51 which indicates that the obtained fitted formulas can quantitatively describe the relationship between the two indices and the layout parameters of subsurface pipes considering the major purpose of subsurface drainage system to drain root zone salt out to ensure crop yield in south xinjiang province the quantitative relationships between the rd l and hc and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe were integrated with the economic conditions when figuring out the suitable layout parameters the installation cost of the subsurface pipes can be written as follows 11 c l 0 l a 0 4 b d d where c is the cost of installing subsurface pipes l 0 is the length of area m the value 0 4 means that the excavation section width is 0 4 m when installing subsurface pipes a is the pipe price of per unit length b is the excavation and backfilling earthwork fee of per unit area the constrained conditions are determined by practical situation and construction level and the targeted soil desalinization and salt discharge which are shown as follows 12 d d 1 d d d d 2 h c 0 3 d d 0 43 h c t a r r d l 1 57 l 256 60 d d 11 63 r d l t a r where dd 1 is the shallowest depth to prevent disturbing machine tillage dd 2 is the maximum depth under the condition of the existing pipe laying crane hc tar and rd l tar are the targeted critical depth of soil desalinization and targeted ratio of salt discharge and leaching the drain depth and spacing can then be determined by using eq 12 and different drain depths and spacings can be obtained when considering different targeted soil desalinization and salt discharge indices the empirical formula to calculate the drain depth and spacing recommended by the technical regulation on subsurface drainage and desalination soil part 2 planning design and construction ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2013 hereinafter referred to as the professional standard is as follows 13 l γ k s d d where ks is the saturation hydraulic conductivity m d γ is the empirical coefficient which is 40 30 20 for clay loam and sand when using eq 13 the drain depth is first determined by the critical depth of groundwater the determined drain depth and spacing in the experiment area by the proposed method considering the salt discharge amount and by the professional standard were compared when using eq 13 γ is set as 30 since the area owns sandy soil and the average hydraulic conductivity ks is used as 0 76 m d then l equals to 22 8dd in this area the recommended critical depth of groundwater in arid area is 1 8 2 8 m ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china 2013 then the drain spacing is 41 64 m when using the proposed method shown in eq 12 to determine the drain spacing and depth the dd 1 and dd 2 are set as 0 6 m and 1 8 m different rd l tar are considered while hc tar is set as 0 8 m which is the root zone depth of cotton since the initial salt mass of the soil profile within 80 cm is 10 060 g m2 according to table 5 different rd l tar values are set as 151 182 212 242 273 and 302 which are considered to remove 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 of soil salt in the profile within 80 cm respectively the obtained drain depth is the same as 1 8 m under the rd l tar values and the drain spacings are 122 m 103 m 84 m 65 m 46 m and 28 m respectively it can be found that much shorter drain spacing is needed when the rd l tar is set to remove 100 of the salt in the soil profile when the rd l tar is set to remove below 80 of the soil salt in the profile longer drain spacing can be used compared with results obtained by the professional standard more options of layout parameters can be provided by the proposed method to consider the requirement of washing salt out for arid and semi arid agricultural irrigation areas with shallow groundwater table depth and sandy soil types the subsurface drainage pipes for desalinization are recommended to be installed deeper than 1 m while the drain spacing could be sparse the specific layout parameters could be obtained by solving the eq 11 and eq 12 simultaneously 4 conclusions in this paper the effects of layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe on the soil desalinization were studied through experiments and numerical simulations in arid agricultural areas the swms 2d model was calibrated and validated by using the experimental data which was then used to calculate the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge under different scenarios of drain depth and drain spacing the quantitative relationship between the indices of soil desalinization and salt discharge and layout parameters was obtained to provide guidance for designing subsurface drainage systems in arid and semi arid regions the major conclusions are as follows 1 the drain spacing and drain depth show significant impact on soil desalinization rate while the impact of pipe diameter can be ignored under experimental conditions 2 the swms 2d model is proved to be able to simulate soil water and solute transport under condition of subsurface drainage in the experimental region which can capture the soil water and salt movement and the accumulated water and salt discharge amount well 3 the two proposed indices e g the critical depth of soil desalinization and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching are useful to represent the salt discharge effects of subsurface drainage pipes the critical depth of soil desalinization indicates the ability of the subsurface pipes to control the groundwater table level and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching can distinguish the contribution of subsurface pipes in soil desalinization with leaching 4 under the prediction scenarios all of the four indices have significant positive linear correlations with the drain depth while only the salt discharge amount and the ratio of salt discharge and leaching have significant negative linear correlation influence with the drain spacing 5 subsurface drainage pipe is invalid to discharge soil salt or to control the groundwater level when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m the contribution of subsurface pipe to soil desalinization is ignorable when the drain depth is shallower than 1 0 m 6 integrating the quantitative relationship between the critical depth of soil desalinization the ratio of salt discharge and leaching and the layout parameters of subsurface drainage pipe with the economic conditions provides more options to choose the layout parameters to consider the requirement of discharging salt out declaration of

10387,agricultural diffuse pollution caused by runoff and soil loss from cropland has been a serious environmental problem in the black soil area of northeast china while water and soil conservation measures have led to a sharp decrease in overland flow within source water sub watersheds they have on the other end affected the water security of agricultural and domestic use as the water storage capacity of downstream reservoirs decreases year by year for this study grass barriers which are generally considered to have high sediment reduction efficiency were evaluated for their efficiency as a mitigation measure of diffuse pollution within source water areas standard field plots were used to monitor two groups of grass barriers alfalfa medicago satival and native grass dominated by setaria viridis l beauv and slope gradients 3 and 5 under natural rainfall events over the 2012 2015 period the results indicated that during the maize zea maysl growing season runoff and sediment reduction efficiencies for the alfalfa barrier were 37 91 and 62 30 respectively and more than 50 of the nutrient loads e g total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and nitrate no3 n could be removed by the alfalfa barrier the environmental loads mitigation efficiency of grass barrier in spring was relatively low and unstable both slope and barrier width had a significant impact on the water and soil conservation function of grass barriers while rainfall intensity and grass type were mainly related to runoff reduction overall these finding could provide some specific recommendations for future grass barrier design and large scale application in a source water area of northeast china keywords vegetative filter strips diffuse pollution sloping lands black soil area 1 introduction the black soil area of northeast china is an important grain production region and the largest commercial grain region in china ou et al 2017 due to large scale sloping land reclamation projects soil erosion has gradually intensified over the years directly leading to increased nitrogen n and phosphorus p loadings into surface water bodies resulting in serious agricultural diffuse pollution sui et al 2019 in this region beneficial management practices bmps such as contour tillage terraces are mostly designed for water and soil conservation liu et al 2011 jia et al 2019 so the mitigation of diffuse pollution is mainly achieved by intercepting sediment and runoff dorioz et al 2006 sui et al 2016 furthermore liu et al 2015 pointed out that from 1958 to 2011 the precipitation data of nearly 90 of the meteorological stations in the jilin province the core grain production area of northeast china had a downward trend and the frequency and intensity of droughts increased in addition due to the construction of dams and increase of agricultural water in the upper reaches of the basins the average water storage capacity of major reservoirs in northeast china dropped by 15 49 over the past decade yang and lu 2014 meanwhile soil and water conservation measures in the black soil area reduced surface runoff by 70 90 liu et al 2011 therefore in source water watersheds these bmps could perhaps reduce reservoir and lake inflows leading to a decrease in water supply which may impact production and use of domestic water jiang 2009 thus it is anticipated that application of bmps in source water watersheds of the black soil area should not only effectively control soil erosion but also induce cleaner surface runoff flows into reservoirs contributing to regional water security studies have shown that grass or shrub buffer strips located between fields or in the riparian zone can effectively intercept runoff and sediments and reduce nutrient loads i e nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutant discharges into the river yuan et al 2009 ratté fortin et al 2019 yu et al 2019 these buffer strips are known to be a very economic and effective type of bmps holden et al 2019 usually referred to as vegetative filters which could be spelled out as grass shrub forest and composite daniels and gilliam 1996 ghadiri et al 2001 that being mentioned grass filters are the most widely used vegetative filters because of easy management and low cost and high efficiency in removing from runoff sediments and nutrients from sloping cropland blanco canqui et al 2004 b gilley et al 2008 in recent years a large number of studies on grass filters have been carried out in north america and europe blanco canqui et al 2004b borin et al 2005 liu et al 2008 dunn et al 2011 holden et al 2019 however since the efficiency of grass filters is affected by many factors liu et al 2008 such as vegetation type width topography and seasons leading to various performances they need to be assessed under local conditions syversen 2005 gumiere et al 2015 2013 not surprisingly in southwest and northern china grass filter designs have been adapted to local physiographic characteristics huang et al 2010 pan et al 2011 xiao et al 2011 nonetheless few grass filter studies have been conducted in the black soil area of northeast china vegetation type represents the key to improve efficiency of grass filters thus the ideal grass species should have the following characteristics a strong stress resistance a dense tiller an upright stem a rapid growth and a developed fibrous root system rachman et al 2004b baets et al 2007 for example vetiver vetiveria zizanioides l nash which is found in tropical and subtropical regions has become the most widely used grass species thanks to the above plant traits cao et al 2015 however the black soil area of northeast china has long and cold winters with temperatures lows reaching 40 c ou et al 2017 moreover because grass filters reduce cropland area this will probably lower the overall grain yield in china the allocation of cultivated land is based on the household contract responsibility system and each household has only around 0 7 ha of farmland smith and siciliano 2015 so it is very difficult to promote the implementation of bmps on cultivated land therefore if the grass filter strip can be both narrow and efficient can grow and develop in the cold climate region local farmers might embrace the opportunity to implement this bmp in northeast china slope and rainfall are other critical factors affecting the efficiency of grass filters ghadiri et al 2001 many studies have investigated the impact of these two factors in china most of the literature focussing on land slope issues mainly dealt with a range of 5 20 xiao et al 2011 xia et al 2013 dong et al 2018 while the slopes of most arable land about 80 in northeast china are less than 5 therefore in order to improve the assessment of the actual efficiency of grass filters experimental studies should be carried out using standard plots with a slope less than 5 and according to terrain features of the sloping farmland of the northeast black soil area rainfall simulators have been effectively used to conduct most soil erosion studies blanco canqui et al 2004a xiao et al 2011 cao et al 2015 although the simulator can effectively shorten the experimental period the response of soil hydraulic properties to natural rainfall drops remains hard to determine exactly when vegetative filters are applied in large scale region with great difference in climatic and geographical features it is difficult to obtain the target pollution reduction rate for the vegetative filters design based solely on experimental plot data some scholars have thus combined the use of a vegetative filter models with a distributed hydrologic model for example gumiere et al 2011b hould gosselin et al 2016 and gumiere et al 2014 used the mhydas erosion model and gumiere et al 2013 2015 the hydrotel vfdm to carry out the design and optimal locations of grass filters within a watershed in addition although the vegetative filter strip model vfsmod w is a field scale design tool kuo and muñoz carpena 2009 it has been useful to identify the key factors influencing the efficiency of filters under different scenarios in this study we hypothesized that narrow grass filter strips could effectively intercept sediments and purify surface runoff and thus be a well suited bmp to mitigate diffuse pollution in source water watersheds it is noteworthy vegetation type season rainfall and slope can have a significant influence on the efficiency of grass barriers and hence some design considerations would be recommended for large scale application in the black soil area of northeast china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at a national soil and water conservation field research station located in the xingmu watershed liaoyuan city jilin province the black soil area of northeast china e125 22 40 125 26 10 n42 58 05 43 01 40 the black soil is classified as silty clay loam mollisols and phaeozem and considered as one of the most important soil resources for maintaining food security in china ou et al 2017 the parent materials of the black soil are loessic loams formed during the quaternary period known to have low permeability with fine mechanical composition the soil clay content ranges from 30 to 40 and the organic matter content ranges from 22 g kg 1 to 73 g kg 1 maize is the main source of income for local farmers sloping lands account for about 80 of the total cultivated area and most of the slope is less than 5 the study area belongs to the mid temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 5 2 c the highest temperature is 38 c the lowest temperature is 40 c sui et al 2016 the average annual precipitation is 658 mm and the seasonal distribution uneven in the study area march april and may are spring months june july and august summer months september october and november autumn months the rainfall from june to september accounts for 68 of the average annual precipitation fig 1 2 2 experimental treatments and measurement according to the range of cropland slopes in the black soil area the experiment was carried out on 3 and 5 standard plots 5 m long and 20 m wide over the 2012 2015 period fig 2 there were three treatments for each slope the first was the control only maize zea maysl planted along the slope no grass barrier the second was two alfalfa medicago satival barriers located in the middle and lower edges of the plots 1 m wide with a spacing of 10 m the third was similar to second one the only difference was the vegetation barrier was made of naturally restored native grass dominated by setaria viridis l beauv each treatment had three repetitions the alfalfa medicago satival planting density was about 400 plants m2 and sowing occurred on was may 1 2012 the native grass barrier green bristlegrass setaira viridis l beauv had a density of about 125 plants m2 the grass barriers were not sown each year their root mattress growing from year to year the standard plots had automatic monitoring and collection equipment which could record runoff and sediment outputs during each rainfall at the same time the mixed runoff samples were manually collected and sent to the laboratory for sediment and nutrients concentration analysis canopy coverage of the grass barriers and maize zea maysl were determined by winscanopy regent instruments inc canada and plant height was manually measured table1 root system is significantly related to plant rigidity and soil anti shearing strength järvelä 2002 rachman et al 2004a in this study the winrhizo scanning system was used to analyze the root features of the two grass species fig 3 as introduced in table 2 the two grass species had similar root surface area but the native grass root volume was nearly 30 times smaller than that of alfalfa medicago satival so there were significant differences in soil fixation capacity of the two grass species 2 3 vfsmod w model in this study vfsmod w was applied to simulate the efficiency of grass barriers under different scenarios for identifying the major influencing factors vfsmod w is an event based mechanistic model developed to simulate the runoff and sediment transport processes through a vegetative filter muñoz carpena and parsons 2011 model calibration was conducted to adjust the most sensitive parameters controlling runoff and sediment transport global sensitivity analyses performed by muñoz carpena et al 2007 indicated that the most sensitive parameters of vfsmod w were the saturated hydraulic conductivity vks m

the extent and orientation of the relationship among impacting factors predictor variables soil and water loss response variables all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 18 0 spss chicago il the figures of experimental data were made using origin 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of grass barriers on overland flow a total of 45 rainfall events from 2012 to 2015 were classified into either high or low volume events according to the 37 year 1978 2015 median daily rainfall 12 mm from liaoyuan city meteorological station fig 1 gordon et al 2011 it can be seen from table 3 that under low rainfall volume conditions the runoff exports of all the treatment plots were very small no more than 1 3 mm the response of each treatment to the variation of slope was not obvious and the runoff yield was almost unchanged in spring the runoff export of each treatment was obviously larger than that of the other two seasons mainly due to the fact that it was the beginning of the growing season and thus land cover was low table 1 in summer when the vegetation was fully developed the overland flow decreased and in autumn due to the little change in vegetation cover and low rainfall intensity the control and grass barrier treatments had minimum runoff export in general the control treatment had the largest runoff export in spring and autumn under the two soil slopes but lower than the native grass treatment in summer this was mainly caused by the increase in runoff depth which put more pressure on the stems of the plants meanwhile the roots of the native grass were underdeveloped and the spatial distribution of grass within the barrier was uneven and the density low leading to the emergence of concentrated flows gyssels and poesen 2003 the alfalfa barrier had the best interception capacity and was not affected by seasons and slopes hence it had the lowest surface runoff compared with the control treatment the native grass barrier could reduce a certain amount of runoff but the efficiency was not consistent under high rainfall volume conditions in spring and autumn runoffs of different treatments were similar to those under low rainfall conditions in summer the overland flow of each treatment increased significantly the highest value was from the 5 native grass treatment and the lowest value from the 3 alfalfa treatment the interception capacity of the alfalfa barrier was the highest the average runoff reduction rate of the 3 plot was about 50 and it increased to about 60 for the 5 plot however the native grass treatment did not play a role in reducing runoff under high rainfall conditions in summer fig 2 presents the variation of cumulative overland flow for each season under the two slope gradients in spring due to low vegetation cover table 1 the slope had a larger effect on the runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa barrier treatment the runoff reduction rate of the 3 plot was 38 9 while it was only 7 16 for the 5 plot the runoff export of the native grass barrier treatment was almost similar to that of the control and was not affected by the slope in summer since the vegetation cover and rainfall intensity were higher the runoff export of each treatment was almost twice that of the spring the slope had little effect on the runoff reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment the reduction rates for the 3 and 5 plots were 38 41 and 36 88 respectively however the slope had a larger influence on the native grass treatment the runoff reduction efficiency of the 3 native grass barrier plot was 7 93 while that of the 5 increased to 20 12 in autumn vegetation cover changed little and rainfall decreased rapidly so runoff export of each treatment dropped sharply accounting for only about 10 of the annual overland flow in addition the slope had little effect on the runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa and native grass barriers which were about 70 and 40 for the two slope gradients respectively based on the cumulative overland flow of each treatment and for the three seasons slope had some influence on the reduction efficiency of grass barriers when slope increased from 3 to 5 the average runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa barrier decreased from 42 70 to 33 11 that of native grass from 8 31 to 5 69 4 2 effects of grass barriers on soil loss it can be seen in table 4 that under low rainfall volume conditions the average sediment yield of each treatment in spring was the highest followed by summer and lowest in autumn the difference in sediment yield between treatments was not significant between two slope gradients in spring the sediment yield of native grass barrier treatment was significantly higher than those of the two other treatments p 0 05 while the alfalfa barrier treatment had the lowest yield which was different than those for runoff for all treatments table 3 it was mainly due to the difference in the interception mechanisms of the grass barrier for runoff and sediment ghadiri et al 2001 blanco canqui et al 2004a in all likelihood the grass barriers mitigated runoff by lowering water velocity and then increasing infiltration while the sediment reduction was mainly through sedimentation and vegetation interception hussein et al 2007 yuan et al 2009 in spring due to low vegetation cover table1 the sediment yields of all treatments was were the highestat their maximum values it is noteworthy that these experimental plot results are in agreement with those reported under actual field conditions ratté fortin et al 2019 although coverage height and stiffness of alfalfa medicago satival were relatively poor for summer and autumn the performance of the barrier was still significantly better than the other two treatments due to randomness of natural growth vegetation density and stem strength during the initial growth period spring were very low so sediment yield of the native grass barrier treatment was the highest summer was a vigorous growth period and under low rainfall volume condition surface runoff could not go through the vegetation blocking and intercepting sediments so the resulting yields of the grass barrier treatments obviously declined compared with spring the sediment yield of the two grass barrier treatments decreased by about 90 while that of the control decreased by 50 the sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment increased from about 25 in spring to about 80 while that of the native grass barrier treatment reached about 50 in autumn with the further decline of rainfall intensity sediment yield of each treatment significantly decreased however the reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment remained the highest although it can be seen from table 3 there was no significant difference in runoff export for all three treatments under two rainfall conditions in spring however under high rainfall volume conditions the sediment yield of each treatment in spring was almost twice that of under low rainfall volume conditions an et al 2012 pointed out that raindrop splash dominated the dispersion of soil particles in the black soil sloping lands during the erosion process in their study the contributions of raindrop splash and runoff scouring to soil erosion were 72 29 96 21 and 3 79 27 71 respectively an et al 2013 this suggest that during the long term rainfall high volume rain drop splashing on soil surface and runoff would enhance the carrying capacity of surface runoff therefore in spring overland flow did not significantly change under high rainfall volume condition while the sediment yield sharply increased although sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment was still the best it was significantly influenced by the slope gradient factor the mitigation efficiency for the 3 plot increased from 28 96 under low rainfall volume conditions to 45 39 under high rainfall volume conditions but for the 5 plot the efficiency decreased from 23 60 to 17 15 the reason being that the potential energy of surface runoff increases with the slope gradient in summer although the runoff export of each treatment increased significantly trapping of sediments by the two grass barrier treatments increased significantly due to the higher vegetation cover table1 when compared with those in the spring the reduction rate of the alfalfa treatment for the 5 slope was even 90 because of higher rainfall intensity the sediment yield of the control was almost twice that of spring in autumn due to the accumulation of surface litter soil conservation was further enhanced resulting in a significant drop in sediment yields for all three treatments as illustrated in fig 5 the sediment yield of each treatment in spring and summer accounted for more than 95 of the whole year in spring the difference in sediment yield between the three treatments was not significant only the reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment on the 3 slope reached 43 however the sediment yield of the native grass barrier under the two slope gradients exceeded that of the control the low vegetative cover and weak stiffness of the native grass contributed to the decline in sediment reduction in summer as the grass was in a vigorous growth period sediment reduction efficiency of the two grass barriers greatly increased the removal efficiencies of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were similar about 60 for the 3 slope and reached 93 and 78 for the 5 slope respectively this suggests that for the 5 slope the rigidity of the grass had a large influence on the sediment removal rate of the barriers therefore it is important to select grass species with well developed and dense root systems and upright stems for preventing soil erosion during the whole maize growing season slope had a positive effect on sediment reduction efficiency of grass barriers when the slope increased from 3 to 5 the efficiencies of the alfalfa and native grass barriers rose to 24 95 and 17 67 respectively 4 3 relationship between grass barriers efficiency and rainfall intensity in order to analyze the relationships between rainfall runoff and sediment of a single rainfall event high frequency sampling was performed in 2013 fig 6a shows that there was any significant difference in runoff and sediment yields among the three treatments at the beginning of a rainfall event in spring it suggested that grass barrier could not achieve its role in the early stages of plant growth in summer compared with the control the grass barriers not only significantly delayed the onset of runoff and sediment production but also reduced peak runoff and sediment yield by about 80 this indicated that well developed grass barriers could effectively prevent water and soil losses in the black soil area in autumn it can be seen from fig 6c that the alfalfa barrier still had a high removal efficiency but the performance of the native grass barrier dominated by setaria viridis l beauv was relatively poor mainly due to random growth weak stiffness and relatively short growing period because most of the natural rainfall events in the study area were long and intermittent the intensity was poorly matched with runoff and soil loss yu et al 2007 therefore some independent rainfall events with long intervals between events more than 24 h short duration and high rainfall intensity were screened to identify the impact of intensity on runoff and sediment reduction efficiency of grass barriers in spring and summer it can be seen from fig 7 that runoff reduction of the two grass barriers had a negative correlation with rainfall intensity for the two seasons similar conclusions were reported in many studies huang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 that is as rainfall intensity increases surface runoff velocity and depth increase rapidly leading to submerged flow conditions blanco canqui et al 2006 gumiere et al 2015 2013 consequently roughness was greatly reduced reducing the transport capacity of grass barriers however the relationship between rainfall intensity and sediment trapping by grass barriers was more complex the increase of rainfall intensity had a negative impact on the sediment reduction efficiency in spring but in summer it was negatively related during some rainfall events for the 3 slope fig 7 this was in all likelihood due to the presence of large particle sizes of detached sediments an et al 2012 relatively low runoff velocity on a small slope thus sediments were more likely intercepted by the grass barriers xiao et al 2010 4 4 modeling runoff and sediment transport in grass barrier a total of 18 events calibration and validation events were selected to assess the performance of vfsmod w in simulating runoff and sediment migration in grass barriers including both types alfalfa and native grass optimized values of selected parameters for the 12 calibration events are listed in table 5 in addition goodness of fit indicator values of simulated quantities for the events are also included the ranges of optimal vn and vks for all the events are within the measured parameter ranges for each grass barrier treatment table 5 optimal rna 0 33 54 for each event represented the density of different grass barriers for most of the events optimal d 50 was less than 0 0037 cm coarse 0 5 as well indicating that the study area soil has a low fraction of sand 0 31 the optimal values of d 50 and coarse agreed with the observed sediment particle size distribution of water samples vfsmod w simulated runoff well for most of the calibrated events as shown in table 5 and also satisfactorily for most of the validated events once vfsmod w was tested for flow the model also provided good sediment yield predictions for example fig 8 displays observed and simulated hydrographs and sedimentographs of one of the 18 events in general vsfmod w could be considered as a useful tool to simulate the runoff and sediment trapping efficiency of grass barriers similar to many other bmps standards for the optimal grass barrier are not easily developed in order to quantitatively identify the effect on grass barrier efficiency the vfsmod w model was used to simulate runoff and sediment loss under more than 200 combinations of impacting factors with different characteristic values table 6 thus overcoming the difficulty of limited observation data for statistical analysis the results of multiple linear regressions indicates that the major factors can explain most of the variation in grass barrier protection capability and the impact on runoff was slightly greater than soil loss all the influencing factors had significant impact on the runoff reduction capacity of grass barriers rainfall intensity could explain 25 of the variance in runoff which was almost twice that of the grass type these results corroborate the conclusions of some related studies xiao et al 2010 2012 this suggests that special attention should be paid to the variability of rainfall intensity of the study area when designing grass barriers for a targeted runoff reduction rate compared with runoff only slope and filter width were remarkably related to soil loss illustrating sediment generation and transport in grass barrier were linked in a relatively simplistic way the observed data in this study fig 7 and those of related studies all pointed out that the relationship between rainfall intensity and sediment trapping rate of grass barriers was not consistent and non linear liu et al 2008 so it becomes difficult to identify its influence on soil loss since runoff reduction was governed by increasing infiltration a longer runoff residence time becomes the key to improve the efficiency of grass barriers liu et al 2008 which is why both grass characteristics stem height and stiffness and barrier width are important factors to runoff reduction however because sedimentation and interception represent the main mechanisms of sediment removal in grass barriers gumiere et al 2011a it was not surprising that our observed data supported this theoretical point therefore if the filter width is large enough then soil loss control can be achieved overall when compared to our experimental results the statistical results based on vfsmod w simulations provided clear and robust information on the major factors impacting the efficiency of grass barriers in addition the influence of filter width was also quantitatively assessed by model simulations 4 5 effect of grass barriers on nutrient loads it can be seen from fig 9 that the two types of grass barriers had significant differences in pollution reduction efficiency the removal efficiency of tn was greatly affected by seasons the ratio of no3 tn in runoff was 0 28 thus more than 50 of the nitrogen is in the form of adsorbed organic nitrogen sui et al 2019 thus it was easily intercepted the tn removal rate of the alfalfa barrier for the 5 slope could reach 87 27 in summer but only 28 05 in spring in addition in spring the removal rate of the alfalfa barrier for the 3 slope was obviously better than that for the 5 slope tn removal rate of the alfalfa barrier was almost 5 times that of the native grass barrier in spring and autumn grass barriers were mainly used to remove tn by reducing runoff and intercepting sediments blanco canqui et al 2004a so the alfalfa barrier had a better performance with high plant cover and stem stiffness for the smaller slope in summer the tp removal efficiency was marginally affected by seasons and slope gradients the removal rates of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were about 55 and 25 respectively phosphorus was easily adsorbed to soil particles once blocked by the grass barriers kuo and muñoz carpena 2009 oshunsanya et al 2019 therefore although runoff and sediment reduction efficiency of the native grass barrier varied greatly during the three seasons figs 4 and 5 the tp removal rate was stable in addition because of stem stiffness alfalfa medicago satival the sediment trapping capacity of the alfalfa barrier was also larger than that of the native grass meanwhile observed data indicated that adsorbed phosphorus in runoff accounted for more than 50 of tp loss in the study area sui et al 2016 thus the tp removal efficiency of the alfalfa barrier was about twice that of the native grass barrier ammonia nitrogen nh4 n was mainly removed by soil clay adsorption and oxidation during the runoff transport process therefore reducing surface flow velocity and volume through grass barrier interception was the key to mitigate nh4 n loss in spring due to the low vegetation cover and runoff depth nh4 n was more fully in contact with soil thus it was removed with a relatively high efficiency in summer the bare surface area declined sharply while runoff increased significantly thus nh4 n infiltration was tiny leading to a reduction in the nh4 n removal rate for the native grass barrier due to the formation of concentrated flows gyssels and poesen 2003 cao et al 2015 nh4 n output was significantly greater in autumn as runoff decreased nh4 n reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier also went up in spring due to poor vegetation cover table 1 and relatively high overland flow fig 4 no3 n reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier for the 5 slope was significantly lower in summer the alfalfa barrier for the two slope gradients could reduce no3 n loss by about 60 while the native grass barrier had little influence on no3 n loss this suggests that in summer under large runoff conditions alfalfa medicago sativa l effectively slowed down the runoff velocity thus avoiding the formation of concentrated flow and enhanced no3 n infiltration in autumn overland flow significantly decreased so the two grass barriers had better no3 n removal rates due to the randomness of natural grass it is easy to cause low vegetation cover and concentrated flow in the filter zone thus resulting in significantly higher output loads of dissolved pollutants no3 n and nh4 n compared with the control fig 9 5 conclusions the reduction efficiencies i e removal rates of alfalfa and native grass barriers were quantified under different rainfall volumes rainfall intensities and seasons for two soil slope gradients using standard experimental plots for the growing season when compared to the control maize the runoff reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier was 37 91 while the native grass barrier had almost no interception capacity that is only 1 31 the average sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were 62 30 and 30 86 respectively the sediment interception capacity of grass barriers was significantly better than that for runoff the tn and tp loads reduction efficiencies of the native grass barrier was only half that of the alfalfa barrier and it had no ability to remove dissolved pollutants such as no3 n and nh4 n in addition although grass barriers in summer and autumn had good performance for spring reduction efficiency of the grass barrier was the lowest and not consistent therefore in order to effectively reduce diffuse pollution loads from sloping lands other engineering bmps such as micro basin tillage xiao et al 2010 sui et al 2016 should be applied along with grass barriers compared with the monitoring results of our plot experiments the vfsmod w model combined with multiple linear regressions proved to be quite useful to identify the main influencing factors on grass barrier efficiency rainfall intensity slope grass type and filter width all were remarkably related with the runoff reduction capacity and rainfall intensity had the largest negative influence however because it was different than the runoff reduction mechanism only slope and width had a significant impact on sediment transport in grass barriers overall this study results provided some specific recommendations to guide the construction and management of future grass barriers in a source water area of the black soil region of northeast china

10387,agricultural diffuse pollution caused by runoff and soil loss from cropland has been a serious environmental problem in the black soil area of northeast china while water and soil conservation measures have led to a sharp decrease in overland flow within source water sub watersheds they have on the other end affected the water security of agricultural and domestic use as the water storage capacity of downstream reservoirs decreases year by year for this study grass barriers which are generally considered to have high sediment reduction efficiency were evaluated for their efficiency as a mitigation measure of diffuse pollution within source water areas standard field plots were used to monitor two groups of grass barriers alfalfa medicago satival and native grass dominated by setaria viridis l beauv and slope gradients 3 and 5 under natural rainfall events over the 2012 2015 period the results indicated that during the maize zea maysl growing season runoff and sediment reduction efficiencies for the alfalfa barrier were 37 91 and 62 30 respectively and more than 50 of the nutrient loads e g total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and nitrate no3 n could be removed by the alfalfa barrier the environmental loads mitigation efficiency of grass barrier in spring was relatively low and unstable both slope and barrier width had a significant impact on the water and soil conservation function of grass barriers while rainfall intensity and grass type were mainly related to runoff reduction overall these finding could provide some specific recommendations for future grass barrier design and large scale application in a source water area of northeast china keywords vegetative filter strips diffuse pollution sloping lands black soil area 1 introduction the black soil area of northeast china is an important grain production region and the largest commercial grain region in china ou et al 2017 due to large scale sloping land reclamation projects soil erosion has gradually intensified over the years directly leading to increased nitrogen n and phosphorus p loadings into surface water bodies resulting in serious agricultural diffuse pollution sui et al 2019 in this region beneficial management practices bmps such as contour tillage terraces are mostly designed for water and soil conservation liu et al 2011 jia et al 2019 so the mitigation of diffuse pollution is mainly achieved by intercepting sediment and runoff dorioz et al 2006 sui et al 2016 furthermore liu et al 2015 pointed out that from 1958 to 2011 the precipitation data of nearly 90 of the meteorological stations in the jilin province the core grain production area of northeast china had a downward trend and the frequency and intensity of droughts increased in addition due to the construction of dams and increase of agricultural water in the upper reaches of the basins the average water storage capacity of major reservoirs in northeast china dropped by 15 49 over the past decade yang and lu 2014 meanwhile soil and water conservation measures in the black soil area reduced surface runoff by 70 90 liu et al 2011 therefore in source water watersheds these bmps could perhaps reduce reservoir and lake inflows leading to a decrease in water supply which may impact production and use of domestic water jiang 2009 thus it is anticipated that application of bmps in source water watersheds of the black soil area should not only effectively control soil erosion but also induce cleaner surface runoff flows into reservoirs contributing to regional water security studies have shown that grass or shrub buffer strips located between fields or in the riparian zone can effectively intercept runoff and sediments and reduce nutrient loads i e nitrogen phosphorus and other pollutant discharges into the river yuan et al 2009 ratté fortin et al 2019 yu et al 2019 these buffer strips are known to be a very economic and effective type of bmps holden et al 2019 usually referred to as vegetative filters which could be spelled out as grass shrub forest and composite daniels and gilliam 1996 ghadiri et al 2001 that being mentioned grass filters are the most widely used vegetative filters because of easy management and low cost and high efficiency in removing from runoff sediments and nutrients from sloping cropland blanco canqui et al 2004 b gilley et al 2008 in recent years a large number of studies on grass filters have been carried out in north america and europe blanco canqui et al 2004b borin et al 2005 liu et al 2008 dunn et al 2011 holden et al 2019 however since the efficiency of grass filters is affected by many factors liu et al 2008 such as vegetation type width topography and seasons leading to various performances they need to be assessed under local conditions syversen 2005 gumiere et al 2015 2013 not surprisingly in southwest and northern china grass filter designs have been adapted to local physiographic characteristics huang et al 2010 pan et al 2011 xiao et al 2011 nonetheless few grass filter studies have been conducted in the black soil area of northeast china vegetation type represents the key to improve efficiency of grass filters thus the ideal grass species should have the following characteristics a strong stress resistance a dense tiller an upright stem a rapid growth and a developed fibrous root system rachman et al 2004b baets et al 2007 for example vetiver vetiveria zizanioides l nash which is found in tropical and subtropical regions has become the most widely used grass species thanks to the above plant traits cao et al 2015 however the black soil area of northeast china has long and cold winters with temperatures lows reaching 40 c ou et al 2017 moreover because grass filters reduce cropland area this will probably lower the overall grain yield in china the allocation of cultivated land is based on the household contract responsibility system and each household has only around 0 7 ha of farmland smith and siciliano 2015 so it is very difficult to promote the implementation of bmps on cultivated land therefore if the grass filter strip can be both narrow and efficient can grow and develop in the cold climate region local farmers might embrace the opportunity to implement this bmp in northeast china slope and rainfall are other critical factors affecting the efficiency of grass filters ghadiri et al 2001 many studies have investigated the impact of these two factors in china most of the literature focussing on land slope issues mainly dealt with a range of 5 20 xiao et al 2011 xia et al 2013 dong et al 2018 while the slopes of most arable land about 80 in northeast china are less than 5 therefore in order to improve the assessment of the actual efficiency of grass filters experimental studies should be carried out using standard plots with a slope less than 5 and according to terrain features of the sloping farmland of the northeast black soil area rainfall simulators have been effectively used to conduct most soil erosion studies blanco canqui et al 2004a xiao et al 2011 cao et al 2015 although the simulator can effectively shorten the experimental period the response of soil hydraulic properties to natural rainfall drops remains hard to determine exactly when vegetative filters are applied in large scale region with great difference in climatic and geographical features it is difficult to obtain the target pollution reduction rate for the vegetative filters design based solely on experimental plot data some scholars have thus combined the use of a vegetative filter models with a distributed hydrologic model for example gumiere et al 2011b hould gosselin et al 2016 and gumiere et al 2014 used the mhydas erosion model and gumiere et al 2013 2015 the hydrotel vfdm to carry out the design and optimal locations of grass filters within a watershed in addition although the vegetative filter strip model vfsmod w is a field scale design tool kuo and muñoz carpena 2009 it has been useful to identify the key factors influencing the efficiency of filters under different scenarios in this study we hypothesized that narrow grass filter strips could effectively intercept sediments and purify surface runoff and thus be a well suited bmp to mitigate diffuse pollution in source water watersheds it is noteworthy vegetation type season rainfall and slope can have a significant influence on the efficiency of grass barriers and hence some design considerations would be recommended for large scale application in the black soil area of northeast china 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at a national soil and water conservation field research station located in the xingmu watershed liaoyuan city jilin province the black soil area of northeast china e125 22 40 125 26 10 n42 58 05 43 01 40 the black soil is classified as silty clay loam mollisols and phaeozem and considered as one of the most important soil resources for maintaining food security in china ou et al 2017 the parent materials of the black soil are loessic loams formed during the quaternary period known to have low permeability with fine mechanical composition the soil clay content ranges from 30 to 40 and the organic matter content ranges from 22 g kg 1 to 73 g kg 1 maize is the main source of income for local farmers sloping lands account for about 80 of the total cultivated area and most of the slope is less than 5 the study area belongs to the mid temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 5 2 c the highest temperature is 38 c the lowest temperature is 40 c sui et al 2016 the average annual precipitation is 658 mm and the seasonal distribution uneven in the study area march april and may are spring months june july and august summer months september october and november autumn months the rainfall from june to september accounts for 68 of the average annual precipitation fig 1 2 2 experimental treatments and measurement according to the range of cropland slopes in the black soil area the experiment was carried out on 3 and 5 standard plots 5 m long and 20 m wide over the 2012 2015 period fig 2 there were three treatments for each slope the first was the control only maize zea maysl planted along the slope no grass barrier the second was two alfalfa medicago satival barriers located in the middle and lower edges of the plots 1 m wide with a spacing of 10 m the third was similar to second one the only difference was the vegetation barrier was made of naturally restored native grass dominated by setaria viridis l beauv each treatment had three repetitions the alfalfa medicago satival planting density was about 400 plants m2 and sowing occurred on was may 1 2012 the native grass barrier green bristlegrass setaira viridis l beauv had a density of about 125 plants m2 the grass barriers were not sown each year their root mattress growing from year to year the standard plots had automatic monitoring and collection equipment which could record runoff and sediment outputs during each rainfall at the same time the mixed runoff samples were manually collected and sent to the laboratory for sediment and nutrients concentration analysis canopy coverage of the grass barriers and maize zea maysl were determined by winscanopy regent instruments inc canada and plant height was manually measured table1 root system is significantly related to plant rigidity and soil anti shearing strength järvelä 2002 rachman et al 2004a in this study the winrhizo scanning system was used to analyze the root features of the two grass species fig 3 as introduced in table 2 the two grass species had similar root surface area but the native grass root volume was nearly 30 times smaller than that of alfalfa medicago satival so there were significant differences in soil fixation capacity of the two grass species 2 3 vfsmod w model in this study vfsmod w was applied to simulate the efficiency of grass barriers under different scenarios for identifying the major influencing factors vfsmod w is an event based mechanistic model developed to simulate the runoff and sediment transport processes through a vegetative filter muñoz carpena and parsons 2011 model calibration was conducted to adjust the most sensitive parameters controlling runoff and sediment transport global sensitivity analyses performed by muñoz carpena et al 2007 indicated that the most sensitive parameters of vfsmod w were the saturated hydraulic conductivity vks m s the effective flow width of the strip fwidth m the filter manning s roughness coefficient rna s m1 3 the sediment particle size diameter d 50 cm the filter media grass modified manning s coefficient vn s m1 3 parameter values from the 18 rainfall runoff events observed in 2013 2014 provided the basic datasets for model calibration and validation other parameter values were from the vfsmod w guide

the extent and orientation of the relationship among impacting factors predictor variables soil and water loss response variables all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 18 0 spss chicago il the figures of experimental data were made using origin 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of grass barriers on overland flow a total of 45 rainfall events from 2012 to 2015 were classified into either high or low volume events according to the 37 year 1978 2015 median daily rainfall 12 mm from liaoyuan city meteorological station fig 1 gordon et al 2011 it can be seen from table 3 that under low rainfall volume conditions the runoff exports of all the treatment plots were very small no more than 1 3 mm the response of each treatment to the variation of slope was not obvious and the runoff yield was almost unchanged in spring the runoff export of each treatment was obviously larger than that of the other two seasons mainly due to the fact that it was the beginning of the growing season and thus land cover was low table 1 in summer when the vegetation was fully developed the overland flow decreased and in autumn due to the little change in vegetation cover and low rainfall intensity the control and grass barrier treatments had minimum runoff export in general the control treatment had the largest runoff export in spring and autumn under the two soil slopes but lower than the native grass treatment in summer this was mainly caused by the increase in runoff depth which put more pressure on the stems of the plants meanwhile the roots of the native grass were underdeveloped and the spatial distribution of grass within the barrier was uneven and the density low leading to the emergence of concentrated flows gyssels and poesen 2003 the alfalfa barrier had the best interception capacity and was not affected by seasons and slopes hence it had the lowest surface runoff compared with the control treatment the native grass barrier could reduce a certain amount of runoff but the efficiency was not consistent under high rainfall volume conditions in spring and autumn runoffs of different treatments were similar to those under low rainfall conditions in summer the overland flow of each treatment increased significantly the highest value was from the 5 native grass treatment and the lowest value from the 3 alfalfa treatment the interception capacity of the alfalfa barrier was the highest the average runoff reduction rate of the 3 plot was about 50 and it increased to about 60 for the 5 plot however the native grass treatment did not play a role in reducing runoff under high rainfall conditions in summer fig 2 presents the variation of cumulative overland flow for each season under the two slope gradients in spring due to low vegetation cover table 1 the slope had a larger effect on the runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa barrier treatment the runoff reduction rate of the 3 plot was 38 9 while it was only 7 16 for the 5 plot the runoff export of the native grass barrier treatment was almost similar to that of the control and was not affected by the slope in summer since the vegetation cover and rainfall intensity were higher the runoff export of each treatment was almost twice that of the spring the slope had little effect on the runoff reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment the reduction rates for the 3 and 5 plots were 38 41 and 36 88 respectively however the slope had a larger influence on the native grass treatment the runoff reduction efficiency of the 3 native grass barrier plot was 7 93 while that of the 5 increased to 20 12 in autumn vegetation cover changed little and rainfall decreased rapidly so runoff export of each treatment dropped sharply accounting for only about 10 of the annual overland flow in addition the slope had little effect on the runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa and native grass barriers which were about 70 and 40 for the two slope gradients respectively based on the cumulative overland flow of each treatment and for the three seasons slope had some influence on the reduction efficiency of grass barriers when slope increased from 3 to 5 the average runoff reduction rate of the alfalfa barrier decreased from 42 70 to 33 11 that of native grass from 8 31 to 5 69 4 2 effects of grass barriers on soil loss it can be seen in table 4 that under low rainfall volume conditions the average sediment yield of each treatment in spring was the highest followed by summer and lowest in autumn the difference in sediment yield between treatments was not significant between two slope gradients in spring the sediment yield of native grass barrier treatment was significantly higher than those of the two other treatments p 0 05 while the alfalfa barrier treatment had the lowest yield which was different than those for runoff for all treatments table 3 it was mainly due to the difference in the interception mechanisms of the grass barrier for runoff and sediment ghadiri et al 2001 blanco canqui et al 2004a in all likelihood the grass barriers mitigated runoff by lowering water velocity and then increasing infiltration while the sediment reduction was mainly through sedimentation and vegetation interception hussein et al 2007 yuan et al 2009 in spring due to low vegetation cover table1 the sediment yields of all treatments was were the highestat their maximum values it is noteworthy that these experimental plot results are in agreement with those reported under actual field conditions ratté fortin et al 2019 although coverage height and stiffness of alfalfa medicago satival were relatively poor for summer and autumn the performance of the barrier was still significantly better than the other two treatments due to randomness of natural growth vegetation density and stem strength during the initial growth period spring were very low so sediment yield of the native grass barrier treatment was the highest summer was a vigorous growth period and under low rainfall volume condition surface runoff could not go through the vegetation blocking and intercepting sediments so the resulting yields of the grass barrier treatments obviously declined compared with spring the sediment yield of the two grass barrier treatments decreased by about 90 while that of the control decreased by 50 the sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment increased from about 25 in spring to about 80 while that of the native grass barrier treatment reached about 50 in autumn with the further decline of rainfall intensity sediment yield of each treatment significantly decreased however the reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment remained the highest although it can be seen from table 3 there was no significant difference in runoff export for all three treatments under two rainfall conditions in spring however under high rainfall volume conditions the sediment yield of each treatment in spring was almost twice that of under low rainfall volume conditions an et al 2012 pointed out that raindrop splash dominated the dispersion of soil particles in the black soil sloping lands during the erosion process in their study the contributions of raindrop splash and runoff scouring to soil erosion were 72 29 96 21 and 3 79 27 71 respectively an et al 2013 this suggest that during the long term rainfall high volume rain drop splashing on soil surface and runoff would enhance the carrying capacity of surface runoff therefore in spring overland flow did not significantly change under high rainfall volume condition while the sediment yield sharply increased although sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment was still the best it was significantly influenced by the slope gradient factor the mitigation efficiency for the 3 plot increased from 28 96 under low rainfall volume conditions to 45 39 under high rainfall volume conditions but for the 5 plot the efficiency decreased from 23 60 to 17 15 the reason being that the potential energy of surface runoff increases with the slope gradient in summer although the runoff export of each treatment increased significantly trapping of sediments by the two grass barrier treatments increased significantly due to the higher vegetation cover table1 when compared with those in the spring the reduction rate of the alfalfa treatment for the 5 slope was even 90 because of higher rainfall intensity the sediment yield of the control was almost twice that of spring in autumn due to the accumulation of surface litter soil conservation was further enhanced resulting in a significant drop in sediment yields for all three treatments as illustrated in fig 5 the sediment yield of each treatment in spring and summer accounted for more than 95 of the whole year in spring the difference in sediment yield between the three treatments was not significant only the reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier treatment on the 3 slope reached 43 however the sediment yield of the native grass barrier under the two slope gradients exceeded that of the control the low vegetative cover and weak stiffness of the native grass contributed to the decline in sediment reduction in summer as the grass was in a vigorous growth period sediment reduction efficiency of the two grass barriers greatly increased the removal efficiencies of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were similar about 60 for the 3 slope and reached 93 and 78 for the 5 slope respectively this suggests that for the 5 slope the rigidity of the grass had a large influence on the sediment removal rate of the barriers therefore it is important to select grass species with well developed and dense root systems and upright stems for preventing soil erosion during the whole maize growing season slope had a positive effect on sediment reduction efficiency of grass barriers when the slope increased from 3 to 5 the efficiencies of the alfalfa and native grass barriers rose to 24 95 and 17 67 respectively 4 3 relationship between grass barriers efficiency and rainfall intensity in order to analyze the relationships between rainfall runoff and sediment of a single rainfall event high frequency sampling was performed in 2013 fig 6a shows that there was any significant difference in runoff and sediment yields among the three treatments at the beginning of a rainfall event in spring it suggested that grass barrier could not achieve its role in the early stages of plant growth in summer compared with the control the grass barriers not only significantly delayed the onset of runoff and sediment production but also reduced peak runoff and sediment yield by about 80 this indicated that well developed grass barriers could effectively prevent water and soil losses in the black soil area in autumn it can be seen from fig 6c that the alfalfa barrier still had a high removal efficiency but the performance of the native grass barrier dominated by setaria viridis l beauv was relatively poor mainly due to random growth weak stiffness and relatively short growing period because most of the natural rainfall events in the study area were long and intermittent the intensity was poorly matched with runoff and soil loss yu et al 2007 therefore some independent rainfall events with long intervals between events more than 24 h short duration and high rainfall intensity were screened to identify the impact of intensity on runoff and sediment reduction efficiency of grass barriers in spring and summer it can be seen from fig 7 that runoff reduction of the two grass barriers had a negative correlation with rainfall intensity for the two seasons similar conclusions were reported in many studies huang et al 2010 xiao et al 2011 that is as rainfall intensity increases surface runoff velocity and depth increase rapidly leading to submerged flow conditions blanco canqui et al 2006 gumiere et al 2015 2013 consequently roughness was greatly reduced reducing the transport capacity of grass barriers however the relationship between rainfall intensity and sediment trapping by grass barriers was more complex the increase of rainfall intensity had a negative impact on the sediment reduction efficiency in spring but in summer it was negatively related during some rainfall events for the 3 slope fig 7 this was in all likelihood due to the presence of large particle sizes of detached sediments an et al 2012 relatively low runoff velocity on a small slope thus sediments were more likely intercepted by the grass barriers xiao et al 2010 4 4 modeling runoff and sediment transport in grass barrier a total of 18 events calibration and validation events were selected to assess the performance of vfsmod w in simulating runoff and sediment migration in grass barriers including both types alfalfa and native grass optimized values of selected parameters for the 12 calibration events are listed in table 5 in addition goodness of fit indicator values of simulated quantities for the events are also included the ranges of optimal vn and vks for all the events are within the measured parameter ranges for each grass barrier treatment table 5 optimal rna 0 33 54 for each event represented the density of different grass barriers for most of the events optimal d 50 was less than 0 0037 cm coarse 0 5 as well indicating that the study area soil has a low fraction of sand 0 31 the optimal values of d 50 and coarse agreed with the observed sediment particle size distribution of water samples vfsmod w simulated runoff well for most of the calibrated events as shown in table 5 and also satisfactorily for most of the validated events once vfsmod w was tested for flow the model also provided good sediment yield predictions for example fig 8 displays observed and simulated hydrographs and sedimentographs of one of the 18 events in general vsfmod w could be considered as a useful tool to simulate the runoff and sediment trapping efficiency of grass barriers similar to many other bmps standards for the optimal grass barrier are not easily developed in order to quantitatively identify the effect on grass barrier efficiency the vfsmod w model was used to simulate runoff and sediment loss under more than 200 combinations of impacting factors with different characteristic values table 6 thus overcoming the difficulty of limited observation data for statistical analysis the results of multiple linear regressions indicates that the major factors can explain most of the variation in grass barrier protection capability and the impact on runoff was slightly greater than soil loss all the influencing factors had significant impact on the runoff reduction capacity of grass barriers rainfall intensity could explain 25 of the variance in runoff which was almost twice that of the grass type these results corroborate the conclusions of some related studies xiao et al 2010 2012 this suggests that special attention should be paid to the variability of rainfall intensity of the study area when designing grass barriers for a targeted runoff reduction rate compared with runoff only slope and filter width were remarkably related to soil loss illustrating sediment generation and transport in grass barrier were linked in a relatively simplistic way the observed data in this study fig 7 and those of related studies all pointed out that the relationship between rainfall intensity and sediment trapping rate of grass barriers was not consistent and non linear liu et al 2008 so it becomes difficult to identify its influence on soil loss since runoff reduction was governed by increasing infiltration a longer runoff residence time becomes the key to improve the efficiency of grass barriers liu et al 2008 which is why both grass characteristics stem height and stiffness and barrier width are important factors to runoff reduction however because sedimentation and interception represent the main mechanisms of sediment removal in grass barriers gumiere et al 2011a it was not surprising that our observed data supported this theoretical point therefore if the filter width is large enough then soil loss control can be achieved overall when compared to our experimental results the statistical results based on vfsmod w simulations provided clear and robust information on the major factors impacting the efficiency of grass barriers in addition the influence of filter width was also quantitatively assessed by model simulations 4 5 effect of grass barriers on nutrient loads it can be seen from fig 9 that the two types of grass barriers had significant differences in pollution reduction efficiency the removal efficiency of tn was greatly affected by seasons the ratio of no3 tn in runoff was 0 28 thus more than 50 of the nitrogen is in the form of adsorbed organic nitrogen sui et al 2019 thus it was easily intercepted the tn removal rate of the alfalfa barrier for the 5 slope could reach 87 27 in summer but only 28 05 in spring in addition in spring the removal rate of the alfalfa barrier for the 3 slope was obviously better than that for the 5 slope tn removal rate of the alfalfa barrier was almost 5 times that of the native grass barrier in spring and autumn grass barriers were mainly used to remove tn by reducing runoff and intercepting sediments blanco canqui et al 2004a so the alfalfa barrier had a better performance with high plant cover and stem stiffness for the smaller slope in summer the tp removal efficiency was marginally affected by seasons and slope gradients the removal rates of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were about 55 and 25 respectively phosphorus was easily adsorbed to soil particles once blocked by the grass barriers kuo and muñoz carpena 2009 oshunsanya et al 2019 therefore although runoff and sediment reduction efficiency of the native grass barrier varied greatly during the three seasons figs 4 and 5 the tp removal rate was stable in addition because of stem stiffness alfalfa medicago satival the sediment trapping capacity of the alfalfa barrier was also larger than that of the native grass meanwhile observed data indicated that adsorbed phosphorus in runoff accounted for more than 50 of tp loss in the study area sui et al 2016 thus the tp removal efficiency of the alfalfa barrier was about twice that of the native grass barrier ammonia nitrogen nh4 n was mainly removed by soil clay adsorption and oxidation during the runoff transport process therefore reducing surface flow velocity and volume through grass barrier interception was the key to mitigate nh4 n loss in spring due to the low vegetation cover and runoff depth nh4 n was more fully in contact with soil thus it was removed with a relatively high efficiency in summer the bare surface area declined sharply while runoff increased significantly thus nh4 n infiltration was tiny leading to a reduction in the nh4 n removal rate for the native grass barrier due to the formation of concentrated flows gyssels and poesen 2003 cao et al 2015 nh4 n output was significantly greater in autumn as runoff decreased nh4 n reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier also went up in spring due to poor vegetation cover table 1 and relatively high overland flow fig 4 no3 n reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier for the 5 slope was significantly lower in summer the alfalfa barrier for the two slope gradients could reduce no3 n loss by about 60 while the native grass barrier had little influence on no3 n loss this suggests that in summer under large runoff conditions alfalfa medicago sativa l effectively slowed down the runoff velocity thus avoiding the formation of concentrated flow and enhanced no3 n infiltration in autumn overland flow significantly decreased so the two grass barriers had better no3 n removal rates due to the randomness of natural grass it is easy to cause low vegetation cover and concentrated flow in the filter zone thus resulting in significantly higher output loads of dissolved pollutants no3 n and nh4 n compared with the control fig 9 5 conclusions the reduction efficiencies i e removal rates of alfalfa and native grass barriers were quantified under different rainfall volumes rainfall intensities and seasons for two soil slope gradients using standard experimental plots for the growing season when compared to the control maize the runoff reduction efficiency of the alfalfa barrier was 37 91 while the native grass barrier had almost no interception capacity that is only 1 31 the average sediment reduction efficiency of the alfalfa and native grass barriers were 62 30 and 30 86 respectively the sediment interception capacity of grass barriers was significantly better than that for runoff the tn and tp loads reduction efficiencies of the native grass barrier was only half that of the alfalfa barrier and it had no ability to remove dissolved pollutants such as no3 n and nh4 n in addition although grass barriers in summer and autumn had good performance for spring reduction efficiency of the grass barrier was the lowest and not consistent therefore in order to effectively reduce diffuse pollution loads from sloping lands other engineering bmps such as micro basin tillage xiao et al 2010 sui et al 2016 should be applied along with grass barriers compared with the monitoring results of our plot experiments the vfsmod w model combined with multiple linear regressions proved to be quite useful to identify the main influencing factors on grass barrier efficiency rainfall intensity slope grass type and filter width all were remarkably related with the runoff reduction capacity and rainfall intensity had the largest negative influence however because it was different than the runoff reduction mechanism only slope and width had a significant impact on sediment transport in grass barriers overall this study results provided some specific recommendations to guide the construction and management of future grass barriers in a source water area of the black soil region of northeast china

et al 2018 respectively the measurements were taken from the soil surface at 10 or 20 cm depth intervals down to a depth of 140 cm and within time intervals of nearly 15 days there were some missing data in late may and july in 2017 because of the tdr tube probe failure averaged swcs in 10 60 cm and 80 140 cm soil depths were estimated to compare the difference between wetting zone and non

to test differences among treatment means for significance at α 0 05 3 results there were large variations in monthly precipitation and total precipitation during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 fig 1 the amount of precipitation was higher from april to august in 2018 ranged from 86 to 192 mm per month in 2017 however higher amount of precipitation occurred in july and august and were about 97 105 mm per month annual rainfall in 2018 was 682 37 mm approximately 89 higher than that in 2017 the monthly mean air temperature had almost similar pattern in 2017 and 2018 with an average of 19 7 and 20 2 c in 2017 and 2018 respectively in general the swc showed more fluctuations over measured periods in wetting zone 10 60 cm depth than in non wetting zone 80 140 cm depth especially in 2018 fig 2 swc in wetting zone ranged from 0 16 to 0 25 cm3 cm 3 under i20 treatment and ranged from 0 10 to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 under the i33 i45 and control treatments in 2017 fig 2 a mainly due to larger amount of precipitation in 2018 higher swc in wetting zone was observed for all treatments with the range of 0 12 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and much higher under the highest level of irrigation i20 treatment fig 2 c swc in deep soil layers 80 140 cm depth showed a rising tendency during rainy months with a mean of 0 17 and 0 19 cm3 cm 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 b d soil nmin changed over time and was influenced by experimental treatments and precipitation fig 3 in general the fertigation treatment increased soil nmin during the early growing season before may or june after the fourth fertigation june 28 in 2017 and june 27 in 2018 nmin in 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 and nmin in 0 140 cm soil layer in 2018 decreased nearly by 26 81 and 51 42 respectively soil nmin at the end of growing seasons was still little higher than that at the beginning of growing seasons 10 07 vs 2 41 mg kg 1 in 2017 and 11 98 vs 8 50 mg kg 1 in 2018 the effect of experimental treatment on the averaged soil nmin in the growing season was significant in all soil layers except in the 60 80 cm soil layer in 2017 table 2 soil nmin mostly distributed in the topsoil 0 20 cm table 2 fig 4 the irrigation and additional fertigation treatments i20f150 190 i20f220 260 i33f220 260 i45f220 260 significantly increased soil nmin in 0 20 cm layers compared with the control treatment high fertigation f220 260 associated with low irrigation i33 or i45 still resulted in higher soil nmin in the 20 60 cm soil layer in both years compared with other treatments soil nmin decreased as soil depth increase from 0 to 80 cm under all treatments but fertigation associated with high irrigation i20 had a sharp drop of nmin in 20 40 cm soil layer in both years fig 4 there were no significant differences in monthly dbh increment in 2017 among high irrigation associated treatments i20f150 190 i20f220 260 i20f0 0 and among low irrigation associated treatments i33f220 260 i45f220 260 and control high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased monthly dbh increment from april to july in 2017 compared with low irrigation associated treatments and control but this effect was not significant in the late growing season august september and october table 3 as a result high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased annual dbh growth in 2017 compared with low irrigation associated treatments and control in 2018 however there was no significant treatment effect on either monthly or annual dbh increment like on dbh increment treatment effects on dbh relative growth rate rgr had similar patterns fig 5 high irrigation treatments had higher rgr 0 0066 cm day 1 cm 1 in may while other treatments had a peak of rgr 0 0046 cm day 1 cm 1 in june in 2017 all treatments had the same rgr pattern in 2018 with a peak of 0 0035 cm day 1 cm 1 in may there were no significant differences in stand level total n uptake tnu in 2017 among high irrigation plus additional fertigation treatments i20f80 120 i20f150 190 i20f220 260 although high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment i20f220 260 had a little higher tnu fig 6 high irrigation and high fertigation treatment i20f220 260 had a significant higher tnu in 2017 than the control while there was no significant difference between low or middle fertigation treatments i20f80 120 i20f150 190 and control in 2018 there was still a significant difference between high irrigation plus high fertigation i20f220 260 treatment and control while there were no significant differences between other dif treatments and control and among all dif treatments cumulative dbh increment was significantly positively related to the logarithm of water input amount cumulative precipitation plus irrigation amount in both 2017 and 2018 fig 7 dbh increment responses to water input was higher in 2017 than in 2018 and higher in dry months than in rainy months in each year between dbh increment and nmin a significantly positive linear relationship was observed in dry months in 2017 but no significant relationship observed in dry months in 2018 fig 8 a c in rainy months in both 2017 and 2018 however there was a significantly negative linear relationship between dbh increment and nmin fig 8 b d dbh increment decreased more steeply with increasing nmin in rainy months in 2018 than in 2017 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic distribution of soil water and nmin during two growing seasons in general high irrigation significantly increased swc in the 10 60 cm soil layer and little increased swc in the 80 140 cm soil layer in both early and late growing season in 2017 fig 2 although high irrigation also increased swc in the 10 60 cm soil layer in the early growing season and from august to october in 2018 there was no big difference in swc in the 80 140 cm soil layer in the whole growing season it is obvious that the swc difference in the 10 60 cm soil layer between high and low irrigation were observed in the month that had less precipitation fig 2 the difference in swc responses to irrigation treatments between 2017 and 2018 was mainly due to higher precipitation in 2018 than in 2017 fig 1 these results demonstrated that high drip irrigation i20 was more effective to supply water in the shallow soil layer our previous studies he et al 2020 li et al 2018 showed that the vertical distance of wetting zone beneath the emitter after drip irrigation was up to 50 70 cm in our study site the formation of wetting zone depends on the irrigation level soil texture and initial soil moisture kumar et al 2015 li and liu 2011 naglič et al 2014 drip irrigation is efficient to supply the water constantly and distribute the water uniformly in the shallow soil layer forming soil wetting volume al ogaidi et al 2016 bajpai and kaushal 2020 li et al 2015 thus has the potential to enhance tree growth cao et al 2018 xi et al 2016 2013 especially in dry months it is not surprising that precipitation sharply increased swc regardless of experimental treatments fig 2 in dry months there were big differences in swc among different irrigation levels guo et al 2011 reported that precipitation had about 85 contribution to swc after rainfall and the status of swc after precipitation was influenced by multiple factors such as soil characteristic initial soil water content and precipitation amount besides many researchers testified the precipitation effect on swc in some specific site conditions for example under typical vegetation types on the loess plateau of china liu and shao 2016 and in a grassland vegetation types salve et al 2011 n distribution in soil was highly related to n dissolution and transformation soil water distribution and n acquisition by plant roots barber et al 1963 jungk 2001 verstraete and focht 1977 the movement pattern of nmin has been widely observed kumar et al 2016 li et al 2003 2005 liu et al 2003 rajput and patel 2006 this pattern could be strongly influenced by irrigation and precipitation due to the greater mobility of no3 n in the soil matrix sato et al 2009 smajstrla and locascio 1996 in our study different patterns of seasonal nmin distribution were observed in 2017 and 2018 table 2 fig 3 and the difference was mainly caused by higher precipitation in 2018 the non uniform distribution of nmin in soil profile was caused by fertigation table 2 fig 4 fertigation treatments increased nmin mainly in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm due to different levels of fertigation and irrigation effects there was higher variation of nmin in the topsoil the redistribution of nmin could be influenced by many factors including an amount of organic matter soil water content soil temperature soil texture eltarabily et al 2019 myers et al 1982 rajput and patel 2006 and plant root uptake quiñones et al 2007 these factors will also change how much and how fast n lost by denitrification and deep leaching fang et al 2006 li et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 in accordance with that our results showed that high fertigation associated with low irrigation treatments i33f220 260 and i45f220 260 had higher nmin in the soil than high irrigation associated with either high or low fertigation treatments i20f150 190 and i20f220 260 table 2 fig 3 this might be partially because trees whose growth was enhanced by high irrigation also absorbed more n dickmann et al 2001 thus we also observed a decreasing nmin trend as trees grow after may or june fig 3 the faster movement of nmin out of the measured soil profile might be another reason for the lower nmin in high irrigation treatments and the decreased nmin in soil after heavy rainfall might also be because higher soil water content makes nmin move faster out of the measured soil profile our study did not examine the leaching loss of n in 2017 we observed that tree fine roots already distributed down to 150 cm soil depth the deep root system of p tomentosa help trees access water and n resources in deeper soil layers sparks and benfey 2017 xi et al 2016 2018 4 2 seasonal growth pattern and n uptake in terms of stand basal area increments and total biomass we reported that high irrigation significantly enhanced stand growth in both 2017 and 2018 and additional n fertigation did not further improve early stand growth he at al 2020 in the current study we mainly compared high fertigation associated treatments high irrigation only and control in terms of monthly dbh increments and dbh relative growth rate rgr this analysis further demonstrated that high irrigation associated treatments with additional high fertigation or no fertigation significantly improved tree monthly growth from april to july thus annual growth in 2017 compared with low irrigation plus high fertigation treatments and control table 3 fig 5 in 2018 however there were no significant effects of irrigation or fertigation on monthly dbh increments or rgr the magnitude and timing of growth response to high irrigation highly depended on the precipitation the annual rainfall in 2018 was higher than in 2017 and significant growth response occurred during dry months in 2017 table 3 fig 1 non significant growth response to irrigation in 2018 might suggest that the precipitation in that year met water demand for 3 year old p tomentosa plantations the relationship between stand growth and total water input amount during these two years fig 7 also indicated that water might be a limiting factor for tree growth in dry months soil water availability of different soil layers had different effects on tree growth assaf et al 1974 thomas and hartmann 1998 xi et al 2016 had reported that swc in 0 10 cm soil layer can explain 70 8 of the variation in poplar growth stand basal area was highly related to the water availability at the surface 0 30 cm soil layer xi et al 2017a the soil moisture based drip irrigation could maintain the soil water in that layer and thus improve tree growth although n fertigation significantly increased nmin in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 2 fig 4 the effect of n fertigation on tree growth was not significant the relationships between tree growth and soil nmin were significantly positive or non significant in dry months or significantly negative in rainy months fig 8 this complex relationship was mainly due to the differences in precipitation and irrigation precipitation during dry months rainy months even the whole growing season was higher in 2018 than in 2017 fig 1 more precipitation might cause more negative relationship between tree growth and soil nmin in rainy months in 2018 than in 2017 the precipitation difference during dry months between 2017 and 2018 changed tree growth and soil nmin relationship from significantly positive in dry months of 2017 to non significant in relatively dry months of 2018 fertigation had little or no significant effect on tree growth among different dif treatments table 3 which might be explained by the lag effect of n on plant growth yan 2016 or n lost by deep leaching or ammonium volatilization meisinger 1984 neeteson and carton 2001 the negative correlation between tree growth and nmin in rainy months at least suggested that n fertilizer application was inappropriate during the period of heavy rainfall van den driessche et al 2003 found the response of young aspen seedlings to fertilization was strongly inﬂuenced by rainfall in a region of alberta with precipitation of 319 575 mm to improve n use efficiency wang 2015 recommended urea be applied 6 times a year in 3 to 5 year old p tomentosa plantations and higher amount of urea in the first 3 times in corresponding with tree growth rhythm di et al 2013 found that fine roots mostly distributed in the 0 20 and 70 110 cm soil layer in 5 year old p tomentosa plantations zou et al 2019 also reported the similar distribution patterns in young plantation of p tomentosa b301 clones the drip irrigation and fertigation treatments created the wetting zone matching with fine root distribution of p tomentosa and thus enhancing n absorption during growth period however the increased nmin in the 0 20 cm soil layer by n fertigation did not improve tree growth although high irrigation improved tree growth a significant difference in n uptake was observed only between high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment and the control fig 6 these results implied that n had not become a limiting factor for tree growth in 2 and 3 year old p tomentosa stands the implication was verified by leaf n concentration of over 18 tested for all treatments in two years he et al 2020 raz yaseef et al 2010 found that precipitation was an important variable that determined seasonal or annual tree growth response in semiarid israeli forest our monthly growth analysis demonstrated that the difference in precipitation between 2017 and 2018 caused different growth patterns table 3 fig 5 water availability could be a limiting factor for p tomentosa on sandy loam soils in our research region wang 2015 also reported that the precipitation in the growing season influenced seasonal growth patterns in 3 to 5 year old triploid p tomentosa plantations in subhumid area 5 conclusions high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased soil water contents during dry months of growing season thus enhanced tree growth in 2 and 3 year old triploid p tomentosa plantations on sandy loam soil n fertigation directly increased mineral n content in 0 20 cm topsoil but had no effect on tree growth in such young stands the seasonal tree growth and mineral n distribution in soils were strongly influenced by precipitation in our experimental site the negative relationship between soil mineral n content and tree growth in rainy months suggested avoiding implementing n fertigation during that period for young aged stands the 20 kpa irrigation level with lower n fertigation was recommended to be applied in relatively dry growing season for young triploid p tomentosa plantations on the north china plain the scheduling of drip irrigation and additional n fertigation requires further optimization for p tomentosa plantations in this region long term effects of n fertigation on stand growth and n uptake and mineral n distribution in deep soils and groundwater remain to be

10388,the patterns of soil water and mineral nitrogen nmin distribution stand growth and n uptake in a triploid populus tomentosa plantation under two year drip irrigation and n fertigation dif treatments were investigated there was a positive relationship between stand growth and the amount of precipitation and irrigation precipitation and irrigation affected the content of nmin in top 0 20 cm soil layer after fertigation and the redistribution of nmin in the soil there was no significant difference in n uptake in poplar plantation among dif treatments and the high fertigation in the rainy seasons didn t enhance stand growth thus high level irrigation with lower n fertigation was recommended in the study area the long term effects of fertigation on tree stand growth and nmin

water and n management such as drip irrigation and n application are expected to achieve the potential productivity of p tomentosa xi et al 2016 2017b yan et al 2018 soil water and mineral n distribution patterns under drip and furrow irrigation have been somewhat investigated in our previous studies dai et al 2015 he et al 2018 li et al 2018 however dynamics of soil water and n distribution under drip irrigation and fertigation treatments and their association with tree seasonal growth patterns have been rarely studied the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of drip irrigation and fertigation treatments on water and n distribution in a sandy loam soil on the north china plain the relationships between plant growth parameters and water and n availability during early two years in triploid p tomentosa plantations were also explored to achieve these goals the following variables have been monitored directly and accurately in specific drip irrigation and additional n fertigation dif treatments and an untreated control plots volumetric soil water content swc and mineral n content nmin in different soil layers in two growing seasons and seasonal growth and n uptake in 2 and 3 year stands of p tomentosa plantations 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and plant material the experiment was conducted near qingping town gaotang county shandong province china 36 48 46 n 116 05 24 e the site is characterized by a warm temperate monsoon climate with average frost free period of about 204 days the mean annual temperature and precipitation are 13 2 c and 544 7 mm respectively and the rainfall is mainly in july and august free water surface evaporation is 1880 mm meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature were collected every 10 min by a weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk installed 60 m south of our experimental field monthly average air temperature and precipitation in growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 are illustrated in fig 1 soil physical and chemical characteristics before the experiment are shown in table 1 the plantation was established in the spring of 2016 with 2 year old bare root stem cuttings of triploid p tomentosa clone s86 p tomentosa p bolleana p alba p glandulosa the average height of the cuttings was 3 3 m and the diameter at breast height was 2 7 cm saplings were spaced 2 m apart within the rows with 3 m between rows resulting in the planting density of 1666 trees ha 1 about 70 g organic inorganic compound fertilizer organic matter om 15 n p2o5 k2o 14 12 5 was applied as base fertilizer for each tree the main chemical composition of om was fulvic acid 8 which was made by papermaking wastewater the surface drip irrigation system was installed in october 2016 and irrigation and fertigation were applied from april 2017 onwards two drip laterals with inside diameter of 15 50 mm and outside diameter of 16 76 mm were installed along each tree row one on each side and 30 cm away from the trunk the in line pressure compensating drippers are at a spacing of 50 cm dripnet pc 16250 netafim ltd tel aviv israel the dripper flow rate was 1 6 l h 1 under operating pressure of 100 kpa 2 2 experimental design the experiment was laid out as a randomized block design with 5 replicates each block had thirteen plots to which thirteen experimental treatments were randomly assigned each treatment plot had eight tree belts 8 4 trees per belt 32 trees with the middle four belts 16 trees used for tree growth measurement and the other two belts each side used as a buffer between blocks besides plastic film was buried in 40 cm depth of soil between plots the experimental treatments included twelve drip irrigation and additional fertigation dif treatments and one control the dif treatments were a factorial combination of three levels of irrigation and four levels of n fertigation and the control treatment was no irrigation and no fertigation the surface drip irrigation was conducted when soil water potentials swp at 20 cm soil depth beneath the dripper reached 20 33 and 45 kpa denoted as i20 i33 and i45 respectively these levels of irrigation were set up based on our previous study on the quantitative relationship between triploid p tomentosa growth and soil water availability xi et al 2016 combined with each irrigation level n fertilizer urea was additionally applied in growing seasons through drip irrigation system at four n application rates 0 and 0 80 and 120 150 and 190 220 and 260 kg n ha 1 year 1 in 2017 and 2018 denoted as f0 0 f80 120 f150 190 and f220 260 respectively for details please refer to he et al 2020 weeds were controlled during the experimental period using herbicide and the same amount of irrigation was applied to both the control and dif treatment plots to promote leaf expansion at the beginning of each growing season 2 3 measurements sampling and laboratory analysis each tree in measurement plots was tagged the diameter at breast height dbh was measured monthly for each tagged tree in the growing seasons from april to october from 2017 monthly dbh increments in 2017 and 2018 were calculated and their association with 6 selected treatments i20f150 190 i20f220 260 i20f0 0 i33f220 260 i45f220 260 and control were analyzed relative growth rate rgr was calculated using the formula r g r l n d b h 2 l n d b h 1 t 2 t 1 and seasonal growth patterns associated with different treatments were compared in two consecutive growing seasons volumetric soil water contents swcs were measured in i20f150 190 i33f80 120 i45f0 0 and control plots in the third block regularly from april to october in 2017 and 2018 using a time domain reflectometry tdr tube probe trime pico iph imko inc ettlingen germany for this measurement nine access tubes of 3 m length were installed for tdr tube probes around three representative trees based on averaged dbh and height of the measured plot three glass fiber access tubes around one sampled tree were installed at about 25 50 and 100 cm distance from the trunk monitoring the swc in the wetting zone 25 cm and 50 cm distance and non wetting zone 100 cm distance li et al 2018 respectively the measurements were taken from the soil surface at 10 or 20 cm depth intervals down to a depth of 140 cm and within time intervals of nearly 15 days there were some missing data in late may and july in 2017 because of the tdr tube probe failure averaged swcs in 10 60 cm and 80 140 cm soil depths were estimated to compare the difference between wetting zone and non wetting zone under drip irrigation he et al 2020 soil samples were collected using a 3 cm inner diameter soil auger in different treatment plots in the third block three drippers per treatment were randomly selected as replicates from 10 treatments 9 dif treatments including the combinations of i20 i33 i45 and f80 120 f150 190 f220 260 plus control in 2017 based on the preliminary analysis of

sampling a 2 m 3 m area 6 m2 centered on the stump was excavated to a depth of 100 cm to collect the root component a total of 37 sampled trees were separated into leaf branch stem stump coarse roots 2 mm and fine roots 2 mm components the fresh weight of each component and its subsample were determined in the field the subsamples were taken to the laboratory and oven dried to a constant weight at 65 c for determining dry weight five leaf litter traps 1 m 1 m 1 m2 per trap were randomly distributed throughout each of the plot to estimate stand level leaf litter biomass total biomass tm was the sum of the dry weight of all components subsamples of different components were collected to determine n concentration using continuous flow injection colorimetry seal analytical aa3 seal analytical gmbh norderstedt germany organ n content was calculated by n concentration multiplying dry organ biomass and total n content of each tree nu was determined by summing n content of different components tree n uptake equation n u a 0 a 1 t m was fitted to tree biomass data and tree n content of the sampled trees resulting in a0 15 132 and a1 4 283 fig s1 after plot inventory individual tree total

estimated by summarizing all individual tree nu divided by the plot size 2 4 data analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted using r software r core team 2015 to test the effects of irrigation and fertigation treatments on monthly dbh increment dbh relative growth rate stand n uptake swcs in 10 60 cm and 80 140 cm soil layers and soil nmin in different soil layers tukey s hsd test was used to test differences among treatment means for significance at α 0 05 3 results there were large variations in monthly precipitation and total precipitation during the growing seasons of 2017 and 2018 fig 1 the amount of precipitation was higher from april to august in 2018 ranged from 86 to 192 mm per month in 2017 however higher amount of precipitation occurred in july and august and were about 97 105 mm per month annual rainfall in 2018 was 682 37 mm approximately 89 higher than that in 2017 the monthly mean air temperature had almost similar pattern in 2017 and 2018 with an average of 19 7 and 20 2 c in 2017 and 2018 respectively in general the swc showed more fluctuations over measured periods in wetting zone 10 60 cm depth than in non wetting zone 80 140 cm depth especially in 2018 fig 2 swc in wetting zone ranged from 0 16 to 0 25 cm3 cm 3 under i20 treatment and ranged from 0 10 to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 under the i33 i45 and control treatments in 2017 fig 2 a mainly due to larger amount of precipitation in 2018 higher swc in wetting zone was observed for all treatments with the range of 0 12 0 27 cm3 cm 3 and much higher under the highest level of irrigation i20 treatment fig 2 c swc in deep soil layers 80 140 cm depth showed a rising tendency during rainy months with a mean of 0 17 and 0 19 cm3 cm 3 in 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 2 b d soil nmin changed over time and was influenced by experimental treatments and precipitation fig 3 in general the fertigation treatment increased soil nmin during the early growing season before may or june after the fourth fertigation june 28 in 2017 and june 27 in 2018 nmin in 0 80 cm soil layer in 2017 and nmin in 0 140 cm soil layer in 2018 decreased nearly by 26 81 and 51 42 respectively soil nmin at the end of growing seasons was still little higher than that at the beginning of growing seasons 10 07 vs 2 41 mg kg 1 in 2017 and 11 98 vs 8 50 mg kg 1 in 2018 the effect of experimental treatment on the averaged soil nmin in the growing season was significant in all soil layers except in the 60 80 cm soil layer in 2017 table 2 soil nmin mostly distributed in the topsoil 0 20 cm table 2 fig 4 the irrigation and additional fertigation treatments i20f150 190 i20f220 260 i33f220 260 i45f220 260 significantly increased soil nmin in 0 20 cm layers compared with the control treatment high fertigation f220 260 associated with low irrigation i33 or i45 still resulted in higher soil nmin in the 20 60 cm soil layer in both years compared with other treatments soil nmin decreased as soil depth increase from 0 to 80 cm under all treatments but fertigation associated with high irrigation i20 had a sharp drop of nmin in 20 40 cm soil layer in both years fig 4 there were no significant differences in monthly dbh increment in 2017 among high irrigation associated treatments i20f150 190 i20f220 260 i20f0 0 and among low irrigation associated treatments i33f220 260 i45f220 260 and control high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased monthly dbh increment from april to july in 2017 compared with low irrigation associated treatments and control but this effect was not significant in the late growing season august september and october table 3 as a result high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased annual dbh growth in 2017 compared with low irrigation associated treatments and control in 2018 however there was no significant treatment effect on either monthly or annual dbh increment like on dbh increment treatment effects on dbh relative growth rate rgr had similar patterns fig 5 high irrigation treatments had higher rgr 0 0066 cm day 1 cm 1 in may while other treatments had a peak of rgr 0 0046 cm day 1 cm 1 in june in 2017 all treatments had the same rgr pattern in 2018 with a peak of 0 0035 cm day 1 cm 1 in may there were no significant differences in stand level total n uptake tnu in 2017 among high irrigation plus additional fertigation treatments i20f80 120 i20f150 190 i20f220 260 although high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment i20f220 260 had a little higher tnu fig 6 high irrigation and high fertigation treatment i20f220 260 had a significant higher tnu in 2017 than the control while there was no significant difference between low or middle fertigation treatments i20f80 120 i20f150 190 and control in 2018 there was still a significant difference between high irrigation plus high fertigation i20f220 260 treatment and control while there were no significant differences between other dif treatments and control and among all dif treatments cumulative dbh increment was significantly positively related to the logarithm of water input amount cumulative precipitation plus irrigation amount in both 2017 and 2018 fig 7 dbh increment responses to water input was higher in 2017 than in 2018 and higher in dry months than in rainy months in each year between dbh increment and nmin a significantly positive linear relationship was observed in dry months in 2017 but no significant relationship observed in dry months in 2018 fig 8 a c in rainy months in both 2017 and 2018 however there was a significantly negative linear relationship between dbh increment and nmin fig 8 b d dbh increment decreased more steeply with increasing nmin in rainy months in 2018 than in 2017 4 discussion 4 1 dynamic distribution of soil water and nmin during two growing seasons in general high irrigation significantly increased swc in the 10 60 cm soil layer and little increased swc in the 80 140 cm soil layer in both early and late growing season in 2017 fig 2 although high irrigation also increased swc in the 10 60 cm soil layer in the early growing season and from august to october in 2018 there was no big difference in swc in the 80 140 cm soil layer in the whole growing season it is obvious that the swc difference in the 10 60 cm soil layer between high and low irrigation were observed in the month that had less precipitation fig 2 the difference in swc responses to irrigation treatments between 2017 and 2018 was mainly due to higher precipitation in 2018 than in 2017 fig 1 these results demonstrated that high drip irrigation i20 was more effective to supply water in the shallow soil layer our previous studies he et al 2020 li et al 2018 showed that the vertical distance of wetting zone beneath the emitter after drip irrigation was up to 50 70 cm in our study site the formation of wetting zone depends on the irrigation level soil texture and initial soil moisture kumar et al 2015 li and liu 2011 naglič et al 2014 drip irrigation is efficient to supply the water constantly and distribute the water uniformly in the shallow soil layer forming soil wetting volume al ogaidi et al 2016 bajpai and kaushal 2020 li et al 2015 thus has the potential to enhance tree growth cao et al 2018 xi et al 2016 2013 especially in dry months it is not surprising that precipitation sharply increased swc regardless of experimental treatments fig 2 in dry months there were big differences in swc among different irrigation levels guo et al 2011 reported that precipitation had about 85 contribution to swc after rainfall and the status of swc after precipitation was influenced by multiple factors such as soil characteristic initial soil water content and precipitation amount besides many researchers testified the precipitation effect on swc in some specific site conditions for example under typical vegetation types on the loess plateau of china liu and shao 2016 and in a grassland vegetation types salve et al 2011 n distribution in soil was highly related to n dissolution and transformation soil water distribution and n acquisition by plant roots barber et al 1963 jungk 2001 verstraete and focht 1977 the movement pattern of nmin has been widely observed kumar et al 2016 li et al 2003 2005 liu et al 2003 rajput and patel 2006 this pattern could be strongly influenced by irrigation and precipitation due to the greater mobility of no3 n in the soil matrix sato et al 2009 smajstrla and locascio 1996 in our study different patterns of seasonal nmin distribution were observed in 2017 and 2018 table 2 fig 3 and the difference was mainly caused by higher precipitation in 2018 the non uniform distribution of nmin in soil profile was caused by fertigation table 2 fig 4 fertigation treatments increased nmin mainly in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm due to different levels of fertigation and irrigation effects there was higher variation of nmin in the topsoil the redistribution of nmin could be influenced by many factors including an amount of organic matter soil water content soil temperature soil texture eltarabily et al 2019 myers et al 1982 rajput and patel 2006 and plant root uptake quiñones et al 2007 these factors will also change how much and how fast n lost by denitrification and deep leaching fang et al 2006 li et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 in accordance with that our results showed that high fertigation associated with low irrigation treatments i33f220 260 and i45f220 260 had higher nmin in the soil than high irrigation associated with either high or low fertigation treatments i20f150 190 and i20f220 260 table 2 fig 3 this might be partially because trees whose growth was enhanced by high irrigation also absorbed more n dickmann et al 2001 thus we also observed a decreasing nmin trend as trees grow after may or june fig 3 the faster movement of nmin out of the measured soil profile might be another reason for the lower nmin in high irrigation treatments and the decreased nmin in soil after heavy rainfall might also be because higher soil water content makes nmin move faster out of the measured soil profile our study did not examine the leaching loss of n in 2017 we observed that tree fine roots already distributed down to 150 cm soil depth the deep root system of p tomentosa help trees access water and n resources in deeper soil layers sparks and benfey 2017 xi et al 2016 2018 4 2 seasonal growth pattern and n uptake in terms of stand basal area increments and total biomass we reported that high irrigation significantly enhanced stand growth in both 2017 and 2018 and additional n fertigation did not further improve early stand growth he at al 2020 in the current study we mainly compared high fertigation associated treatments high irrigation only and control in terms of monthly dbh increments and dbh relative growth rate rgr this analysis further demonstrated that high irrigation associated treatments with additional high fertigation or no fertigation significantly improved tree monthly growth from april to july thus annual growth in 2017 compared with low irrigation plus high fertigation treatments and control table 3 fig 5 in 2018 however there were no significant effects of irrigation or fertigation on monthly dbh increments or rgr the magnitude and timing of growth response to high irrigation highly depended on the precipitation the annual rainfall in 2018 was higher than in 2017 and significant growth response occurred during dry months in 2017 table 3 fig 1 non significant growth response to irrigation in 2018 might suggest that the precipitation in that year met water demand for 3 year old p tomentosa plantations the relationship between stand growth and total water input amount during these two years fig 7 also indicated that water might be a limiting factor for tree growth in dry months soil water availability of different soil layers had different effects on tree growth assaf et al 1974 thomas and hartmann 1998 xi et al 2016 had reported that swc in 0 10 cm soil layer can explain 70 8 of the variation in poplar growth stand basal area was highly related to the water availability at the surface 0 30 cm soil layer xi et al 2017a the soil moisture based drip irrigation could maintain the soil water in that layer and thus improve tree growth although n fertigation significantly increased nmin in the 0 20 cm soil layer table 2 fig 4 the effect of n fertigation on tree growth was not significant the relationships between tree growth and soil nmin were significantly positive or non significant in dry months or significantly negative in rainy months fig 8 this complex relationship was mainly due to the differences in precipitation and irrigation precipitation during dry months rainy months even the whole growing season was higher in 2018 than in 2017 fig 1 more precipitation might cause more negative relationship between tree growth and soil nmin in rainy months in 2018 than in 2017 the precipitation difference during dry months between 2017 and 2018 changed tree growth and soil nmin relationship from significantly positive in dry months of 2017 to non significant in relatively dry months of 2018 fertigation had little or no significant effect on tree growth among different dif treatments table 3 which might be explained by the lag effect of n on plant growth yan 2016 or n lost by deep leaching or ammonium volatilization meisinger 1984 neeteson and carton 2001 the negative correlation between tree growth and nmin in rainy months at least suggested that n fertilizer application was inappropriate during the period of heavy rainfall van den driessche et al 2003 found the response of young aspen seedlings to fertilization was strongly inﬂuenced by rainfall in a region of alberta with precipitation of 319 575 mm to improve n use efficiency wang 2015 recommended urea be applied 6 times a year in 3 to 5 year old p tomentosa plantations and higher amount of urea in the first 3 times in corresponding with tree growth rhythm di et al 2013 found that fine roots mostly distributed in the 0 20 and 70 110 cm soil layer in 5 year old p tomentosa plantations zou et al 2019 also reported the similar distribution patterns in young plantation of p tomentosa b301 clones the drip irrigation and fertigation treatments created the wetting zone matching with fine root distribution of p tomentosa and thus enhancing n absorption during growth period however the increased nmin in the 0 20 cm soil layer by n fertigation did not improve tree growth although high irrigation improved tree growth a significant difference in n uptake was observed only between high irrigation plus high fertigation treatment and the control fig 6 these results implied that n had not become a limiting factor for tree growth in 2 and 3 year old p tomentosa stands the implication was verified by leaf n concentration of over 18 tested for all treatments in two years he et al 2020 raz yaseef et al 2010 found that precipitation was an important variable that determined seasonal or annual tree growth response in semiarid israeli forest our monthly growth analysis demonstrated that the difference in precipitation between 2017 and 2018 caused different growth patterns table 3 fig 5 water availability could be a limiting factor for p tomentosa on sandy loam soils in our research region wang 2015 also reported that the precipitation in the growing season influenced seasonal growth patterns in 3 to 5 year old triploid p tomentosa plantations in subhumid area 5 conclusions high irrigation associated treatments significantly increased soil water contents during dry months of growing season thus enhanced tree growth in 2 and 3 year old triploid p tomentosa plantations on sandy loam soil n fertigation directly increased mineral n content in 0 20 cm topsoil but had no effect on tree growth in such young stands the seasonal tree growth and mineral n distribution in soils were strongly influenced by precipitation in our experimental site the negative relationship between soil mineral n content and tree growth in rainy months suggested avoiding implementing n fertigation during that period for young aged stands the 20 kpa irrigation level with lower n fertigation was recommended to be applied in relatively dry growing season for young triploid p tomentosa plantations on the north china plain the scheduling of drip irrigation and additional n fertigation requires further optimization for p tomentosa plantations in this region long term effects of n fertigation on stand growth and n uptake and mineral n distribution in deep soils and groundwater remain to be

10389,computation of integral water capacity iwc as an alternative criterion for soil water availability to plant requires developing of weighting function ω h for each limiting factor may prevail within a particular water or suction range e g hd and hw in the root medium and diminish water availability to plant so far defining hd and hw limits for a particular limiting factor has been primarily soil property based we investigated the possibility of plant response based ω h as a proxy for this purpose a sandy clay loam soil was evenly compacted to three bulk densities db of 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 in large 30 cm diameter and 70 cm depth pvc tubes called pots hereafter sunflower helianthus annuus l seedlings were planted in the pots and after their full establishment at late vegetative growth stage root pruning was implemented by cutting off approximately 75 50 25 and 0 of the root branches in the 0 25 cm section along the root crown two periods of wetting and drying cycles were subsequently imposed and soil water contents and midday leaf stomatal conductance were routinely measured at the end of the experiment total root length in the samples separately taken from three sections 5 25 25 50 and 50 70 cm of each pot was measured using gsa image analyzer software and converted to root length density rld relative stomatal conductance g gc presumably varying between 0 to 1 and comprising impact of all water availability limiting factors in the root medium as function of h were developed and substituted for ω h and the plant response based integral water capacity iwcp was then computed and compared between various imposed treatments and with least limiting water range llwr and plant available water paw for the treatments without root pruning l4 increase in soil compaction from d1 to d2 and from d1 to d3 reduced iwcp by about 17 5 and 20 5 respectively the corresponding decreases for llwr were 22 and 66 respectively and negligible for paw these results showed that paw is almost irresponsive and llwr is over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density while iwcp seems reflect more realistic influence of soil compaction on soil water availability to plants decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1 was by 43 in contrary to llwr and paw our proposed method showed the effect of root length density on plant available water keywords root pruning soil bulk density sunflower water availability weighting functions 1 introduction integral water capacity iwc concept was introduced by groenevelt et al 2001 to compute available soil water content to plants as an alternative to the previous concepts including classical plant available water paw non limiting water range nlwr and least limiting water range llwr the latter is a range of soil water content at which soil physical conditions are least constrained in terms of aeration penetration resistance sr and matric potential h for water supply to the plant da silva et al 1994 de souza et al 2017 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 kazemi et al 2020 groenevelt et al 2001 developed weighting functions ωi h see eq 1 that can be applied to the defined ranges of soil water potential within 0 to 15000 cm or even beyond ωi h takes into account various limiting factors that may restrict soil water availability within the ranges the objective of introducing iwc a superior alternative to paw nlwr and llwr was to avoid using weighting coefficients that sharply rise in a cut off manner from 0 to 1 at the wet range of water release curve wrc and sharply falls from 1 to 0 at the dry side groenevelt et al 2001 defined iwc as 1 i w c 0 i 1 n ω i h c h d h where c h dθ dh is differential water capacity cm 1 ωi h is weighting function accounting for a particular soil water limiting factor that may prevail in a given soil matric potential range h π indicates that in a given h range if more than one limiting factor prevails their impact would be multiplicative to determine ωi h for each limiting factor a pair of lower and upper h limits hw and hd respectively has to be set or assigned to and the ωi h function usually non linear to be defined such that its numerical value vary within 0 to 1 this approach requires as many as hw hd pairs to be selected as there are limiting factors for soil water availability the main questions are a how the two h limits should be defined and set for each limiting factor for water availability in the root medium b what degrees of uncertainty is involved in and c why the plant responses or characters shouldn t be taken in to account in defining the two limits in groenevelt et al 2001 approach the limits are set primarily according to soil physical properties and response or behavior of the plant in question is almost overlooked in spite of introducing various limiting factors e g insufficient aeration rapid drainage low hydraulic conductivity and or high soil penetration resistance and high salinity to equation 1 and developing appropriate ωi h functions groenevelt et al 2001 groenevelt et al 2004 asgarzadeh et al 2010 grant et al 2010 nang et al 2010 the root length density rld as an important factor in water uptake by plants besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 vadez et al 2007 has not been examined in iwc issue besides soil hydraulics water flow from the bulk soil towards the root surface would also depend on rld acevedo hinojosa 1975 hasegawa 1981 hasegawa and sato 1985 implying the necessity of incorporating rld in determining of iwc high rld increases contact surface between soil and root white and kirkegaard 2010 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 and moreover greater rld implies more roots in a given volume of soil meaning that roots become more closer together and thus the mean distance that water has to move from midpoints of the two adjacent parallel roots and reach to the surface of the two roots would be reduced gardner 1960 leaf stomata as ultimate gate ways between the plant system and the atmosphere regulate gas exchange between the two and meanwhile maintain leaf turgor and prevent plant from dehydration cowan 1978 daly et al 2004 in view of chahal 2010 stomatal conductance is the simplest and most useful indicator for measuring plant response to soil water status it is also a quick physiological response of plant to leaf water potential parry 2014 decrease in leaf water potential due to water stress and or high transpiration beyond a threshold value leads to sharp decrease in stomatal conductance cuevas et al 2006 dry and loveys 1999 ewers et al 2001 grimes and williams 1990 naor 1998 tan and layne 1991 farooq et al 2009 brestic and zivcak 2013 it is also reported that leaf stomata response rather quickly to insufficient aeration sojka 1992 and to high soil penetration resistance masle 1998 it may be due to the signal s that is generated in the roots in response to low oxygen concentration and high soil mechanical resistance and is trasfered to the leaves tardieu et al 1991 1992 hartung et al 2002 leading to stomatal action the above findings justify the worthiness of incorporating of the stomatal conductance as a plant response based criterion in place of ω h function it was hypothesized that the relative stomatal conductance g gc the ratio of stomatal conductance at any given h to that under non limiting conditions should vary between 0 and 1 within the full h range near saturated to dry water status this conceptualization is depicted by fig 1 with this approach only a single pair of hw hd limit would be needed fig 1 and stomatal conductance which integrates the effects of any limiting factor in the root zone or medium would be used for computation of iwc the main purposes of this research were a examining relative stomatal conductance function g gc as a proxy for ω h by adopting a single pair of hw hd range b find out how the plant response based integral water capacity iwcp might be affected by the imposed bulk density and rld or root pruning levels and c compare the iwcp with conventional paw and llwr 2 materials and methods a greenhouse experiment was conducted with sunflower plant growing in large pvc pots using a sandy clay loam scl soil sunflower plant was chosen because its root system is sensitive to soil compaction aliari et al 2000 andrade et al 1993 and expands in the soil as distinct branches that spread down evenly from the crown in all directions in the top layer of soil 0 20 cm aliari et al 2000 these features make sunflower root system to be pruned rather easily by cutting off the lateral branches from the crown at the top soil layer and to achieve different rlds 2 1 pots preparation and planting adequate amount of a sandy clay loam soil inceptisol typic haplozerepts was collected from surface layer 0 20 cm of an uncultivated field n 46 3 46 e 38 27 13 located at the vicinity of ahar city east azerbaijan iran and transported to green house where large fractions and clods were crushed and sieved through a 4 76 mm sieve no gravel was present in the soil thirty six pvc tubes called pots hereafter each with 30 cm diameter and 70 cm height were evenly filled up with the prepared soil and packed to the desired bulk densities of 1 35 d1 1 55 d2 and 1 75 d3 mg m 3 based on air dried soil mass each in 12 pots we adopted these bulk densities according to arshad et al 1996 findings for sandy clay loam soil in relation to root growth susceptibility to soil compaction they established two limiting db for each usda soil texture class for sandy clay loam soil as used in our experiment they are a db 1 4 mg m 3 ideal for root growth and activity b 1 4 db 1 75 root growth moderately affected and c db 1 75 mg m 3 restricting root growth the db s of 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 were selected according to the above criteria we did not use relative bulk density criterion weight mw of the wetted soil θm 0 20 required to be compacted to the specified bulk density dbd with occupying a 5 cm thick layer in the pots was computed from mw v dbw dbw dbd 1 θ the sufficient number soil packages weighing mw were prepared and poured into the pots one by one and each compacted to 5 cm thick this procedure continued until the pots filled up a 8 5 kg hammer was allowed to slide down along a rod placed vertically in the center from 60 cm height and drop on to each wet soil layer just poured in and compact it to 5 cm thick the 1 75 mg m 3 was the highest db that we could reach to by the compaction equipment we had each pot was planted by 3 sunflower helianthus annuus l seedlings and all pots were husbanded in the green house average temperature 37 humidity 36 and day light hours 14 until full vegetative growth development and onset of the reproductive stage full or maximum root system proliferation was assumed to occur at this stage aliari et al 2000 when root pruning was implemented to accomplish this task about 75 50 25 and 0 percent of root branches in the upper soil layer 0 25 cm were cut off from the crown in the selected pots and designated by l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively presumably this differential root pruning would lead to various levels of rld as was the aim of the experiment immediately after pruning and before returning the removed soil mass into its place in the pots the cut off cross sections were coated with wood glue to prevent possible fungal or bacteria contamination surface of the pots was fully covered with perlite to minimize evaporation losses in each pruning treatment one out of three pots replicates were considered as control and its water content was maintained around field capacity at h 33 kpa during the experiment the next two replicates exposed to two successive wetting drying cycles and various plant responses were monitored furthermore at each db level 4 pots and totally 12 extra pots were prepared and allocated to sampling of undisturbed soil cores for construction of wrc and soil penetration resistance curve src these extra pots were kept around field capacity during the experiment and did not receive water stress nor root pruning 2 2 measurements daily measurements of soil bulk electrical resistance were carried out by the hand made electrical resistance type sensors installed horizontally at 10 35 and 55 cm depths in the pots and converted to soil water contents gravimetric using a calibration curve prepared for each db 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 for the calibration five levels of soil moisture content ranged from close to saturation to 5 water content was created at each soil compaction 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 g cm 3 level in small pots and their electrical resistance was determined using ohm meter the exact moisture content of the soil in the pots was determined using thermo gravimetric method plant response to the imposed treatments was monitored daily as leaf stomatal conductance g measured with a diffusion porometer delta t co model ap4 at midday during 12 30 to 14 hours the time span that leaf stomata response well to water stress shackel 2011 the collected data as indicator of sunflower plant water status was employed to identify and set up the hd and hw limits fig 1 these limits were prerequisite for ω h development and iwcp computation basic soil properties including texture gee and or 2002 organic carbon oc nelson and sommers 1996 calcium carbonate equivalent cce nelson 1982 ec of the saturated extracts bower and wilcox 1965 n bremner and mulvaney 1982 p olsen and sommers 1982 k knudsen et al 1982 were measured in the sieved 2 mm samples 2 3 determination of wrc and src for determination of wrc and src each of the 12 pots received no water stress and no root pruning was cut along its vertical axis to two halves and core samples were taken from each half by inserting steel cylinders 5 cm diameter and 5 cm height in to the soil at 0 20 20 40 and 40 70 cm depths totally 36 core samples were taken and used for determining wrc and src functions in brief hanging water columns and pressure plates were used to determine equilibrium water contents at full range of absolute matric potentials or pressures from 10 to 15000 cm at each equilibrium pressure soil penetration resistance was measured with a digital micro penetrometer in the laboratory 30 cone angle 6 mm base diameter and 2 mm per minute penetration rate the detailed procedure for obtaining wrc and src functions has been described by neyshabouri et al 2014 van genuchten 1980 model eq 2 was fitted to the observed h θ data using the retc program mualem 1976 m 1 1 n option in order to obtain the model coefficients and apply to c h function eq 2 a 2 θ h θr θs θr 1 αh n m 2a c h θ s θ r n 1 h 1 α h n 1 α h n 1 n 2 where h is the absolute matric potential cm and θr and θs cm3 cm 3 are respectively residual and saturated water contents a power src model eq 3 was fitted to the laboratory measured soil penetration resistances data and coefficients of a and b were determined 3 sr ahb 2 4 computing proposed g gc function and iwcp we substituted ω h function in equation 1 by relative stomatal conductance function g gc ratio of stomatal conductance at a prevailed h under the given set of experimental conditions to that under optimal or non limiting growth condition this ratio which can be rather easily monitored directly reflects plant behavior or response primarily to the prevailed soil water suction h it is conceptualized that g gc as a function of h should be bounded between near 0 and 1 as depicted by fig 1 at the wet range hmin hw domain insufficient aeration and or rapid drainage and in the dry range hd hmax domain low hydraulic conductivity and or high soil penetration resistance would limit water availability leading to some decrease in relative stomatal conductance g gc 1 in the hw hd domain presumably no soil water limitation prevails leading to almost full stomatal opening g gc near 1 to determine hw and hd values we looked for a suitable mathematical model that best fits to the experimental g gc h data for each combination of bulk density root pruning treatment in this regard the curve expert software 1 4 curve expert net usa indicated the vapor pressure model eq 4 to be the best one the developed g gc function eq 4 along with corresponding hw and hd for each treatment were applied to equations 5 and 6 and plant response based integral water capacity iwcp was computed 4 ωp h g h gc exp a b h c ln h 5 e p h ω p h c h 6 i w c p h 1 h 2 e p h d h conventional paw and llwr were also computed for the comparison purposes in the computation θafp or θfc and θsr or θpwp see table 1 for theses abbreviations were taken respectively as the upper and lower limits of the soil available water as used by several researchers da silva et al 1994 neyshabouri et al 2014 de soza et al 2017 farahania et al 2020 kazemi et al 2020 2 5 root separation and rld measurement root separation from the soil mass in each pot as a perquisite for rld measurement was carried out at two stages at the first stage the top 5 25 cm section the 0 5 cm perlite layer was discarded of each pot pvc tube and the soil within was cut off by a chain saw and placed on a screen net fixed within plastic bucket large enough to immerse the whole cut section in the tap water in order to moisten and soften the soil mass surrounding the roots by repeated washing the soil particles eventually were washed out and the intact root remained on the screen this remained mass was dried with blotting paper and weighted with a precise scale about one quarter of the mass as a partial sample was separated weighed cut to pieces then evenly distributed on the white glass plate 30 cm 40 cm and its image was taken using a high resolution digital camera root length cm and area cm2 in the partial sample was determined using gsa image analyzer software gsa 2016 and then extended to the whole root mass in proportion to its weight the obtained total root length was then divided by soil bulk volume in 5 25 cm section and reported as rld cm cm 3 in that section root separation from the remaining 25 70 cm section was carried out with different method this section was cut through vertically to two half cylinders and two sets of soil clods were taken separately from 25 50 and 50 70 cm depths in each half section the weight of moist clods ranged from 195 to 2780 g one set was preserved for root separation the second set was oven dried and weighed for water content measurements which were used to calculate dry weights and then convert them to clods volume taken in the first set in this conversion d1 d2 and d3 bulk densities were appropriately applied to separate roots from the sampled clods they immersed in tap water to soften slake and disperse them with frequent mechanical agitation the suspended mixture of roots and accompanied fine soil particles were passed through a filter with suitable pore size 0 2 mm from here on the procedures describe for the 5 25 section were applied to the separated roots from the clods and rld was determined for each clod the rld for each section 25 50 and 50 70 cm was taken as the average rlds for the clods taken from those sections 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental layout for iwcp was factorial with complete randomized block design with two replications for paw and llwr it was completely randomized block because we only considered the effect of db on them means of the iwcp along with paw and llwr were compared and their responses to the various imposed treatments were discussed statistical analysis was also made using tukey test tukey 1977 for the multiple comparisons at p 0 05 using the sas program sas institute 2013 in order to determine direct and interactive effects of db and rld on iwcp and comparisons among various combinations of db d1 d2 and d3 and root pruning l1 to l4 treatments the graphs were drawn by microsoft excel software 3 results and discussion general physicochemical properties of the studied soil are shown in table 2 the soil texture was sandy clay loam sand 52 silt 26 clay 22 kg 100 kg 1 percent of oc and cce are low and based on npk measurements the required n as urea co nh2 2 at 2 times and p as calcium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous cahpo4 1 time fertilizers were added to the pots the soil was not saline or calcareous the wrc src and c h curves are depicted by fig 2 and the coefficients of van genuchten 1980 wrc model eq 2 and the penetration resistance power model eq 3 along with r2 and sse for the three compaction levels d1 d3 are listed in table 3 with exception for src in d3 r2 values greater than 0 97 and sse as low as 0 002 shows that both models fit to and describe well the experimental data increasing db from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 led to decrease in θs from 0 513 to 0 411 cm 3 cm 3 table 3 and increase in water content at pwp from 0 12 to 0 16 cm 3 cm 3 fig 2 the same increase in db led to a drastic decrease in h corresponding to 2 mpa soil penetration resistance sr from about 21000 in d1 to 3600 cm in d3 as computed from eq 2 c h also decreased with increase in db fig 2 these findings emphasize the key role of the db in soil water availability to plants as reported by da silva et al 1994 and zou et al 2000 3 1 compaction and root pruning effects on rld rld in the entire soil column 5 70 cm for various density pruning dl treatments and their mean comparison is presented in fig 3 the significant effect of db and root pruning on rld is evident raising db from 1 35 to 1 55 then to 1 75 mg m 3 reduced rld from 3 75 in d1l4 to 2 8 then to 1 9 cm cm 3 which is about 50 reduction fig 3 shows that decrease in rld due to increase in db is more or less similar for all root pruning levels designating no interaction effect between db and root pruning effect on rld the measured rld at the three depths and its relative decrease due to root pruning for various treatments are given in table 4 in 5 25 cm section where root pruning was performed decrease in rld is nearly similar for the three compaction levels d1 d2 and d3 the mean rlds in l1 l2 and l3 treatments were respectively 74 49 and 28 percent of that in l4 with no pruning these figures are very close to 75 50 and 25 percent as were expected from the root pruning exercise and implies that no root re growth has occurred after root pruning otherwise rld reductions would had been much less than 74 49 and 28 percent halt in root growth at the end of vegetative growth stage in sunflower is also reported by aliari et al 2000 rld reduction in the entire soil columns 5 70 cm depth averaged over the three bulk density levels were about 64 43 and 24 percent not shown in table 4 for l1 l2 and l3 respectively as compared to l4 with no root pruning the reason for 22 1 and 24 percent decrease in rld for d3l1 and d3l2 in 50 70 cm layer may be the high soil compaction and aeration problem in that depth for the mentioned treatments 3 2 ωp h and ep h functions variation of ωp h taken equal to g gc as function of h which is depicted by fig 4 has been limited to 0 1 range as speculated in fig 1 in the treatments without restrictions to water availability due to compaction or low rld e g d1l4 d1l3 or d1l2 ωp h has reached to its maximum value of 1 or nearly to 1 in d3l1 which experienced both high compaction and sever root pruning 71 reduction in rld table 4 ωp h dropped to its minimum value of 0 601 table 5 which indicates that g gc ratio as a potentially useful criterion for evaluating soil water availability to plants and employing it in iwc computation the daily measurements of stomatal conductance require diffusion porometer accessibility to this device along its maintenance however may be drawbacks of the substituting g gc for ωp h in iwcp computation the large scattering in g gc data around the fitted function may also decrease the accuracy of the hw and hd limits determining from fig 4 the generalization of the idea of replacing ωp h by g gc needs its examination in other plants and various environmental conditions fig 4 distinctly shows existence of the two hmin hw and hd hmax suction domains for all treatments irrespective of their type as speculated in fig 1 but hw hd domain supposed to be the non restrictive suction domain has occurred only for the d1l4 and d3l4 treatments in the rest treatments it is very narrow nearly zero such that hw hd the values of the three suction domains for the various treatments is tabulated and further discussed in table 5 fig 4 shows that increase in db from 1 35 to 1 55 and then to 1 75 mg m 3 has led to the average hmin to rise respectively from 50 to 70 and then 100 cm these increases in hmin is reasonable and reflects greater insufficient aeration with increasing soil compaction which is also has been reported by others da silva et al 1994 zou et al 2000 the hmax values have increased with db which seems unexpected it is expected that at db 1 75 the restriction for water availability due to compaction to be expressed at lower suctions and thus hmax should be lower than those for db of 1 35 and 1 55 mg m 3 greater unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k h may contribute to this contradictory finding dec et al 2008 the scattering of the data points g gc in fig 4 also may contribute to this contradiction and any way needs further investigation fig 5 shows the effective differential water capacity function ep h developed as the product of c h and ωp h ep h thus represents the magnitude of the area below the curves decrease in the peak of ep h curve from about 3 3 10 3 in d1 with no compaction to 1 3 10 3 in d3 treatments is due to the flattening of c h curve fig 2 and to the lower ωp h or g gc for d3 treatment the area under ep h curves confined by each of the three suction domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax and their sum as iwcp are tabulated in table 5 for elaborated discussion table 5 represents the three h domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax determined from g gc functions fig 4 for each combination of density and pruning dl levels for all treatments except d1l2 d3l3 d3l4 hw hd domain is restricted to very narrow range such that hw practically becomes equal to hd it implies that in those treatments the h domain with no water supply restrictions corresponding to g h gc 1 fig 1 in the root zone practically did not exist or prevailed the ωp h max in each dl treatment is expected to occur at hw hd domain and if no restriction to water availability occur g h gc 1 as presented by fig 1 then ωp h max should be equal 1 at d1 db 1 35 mg m 3 level 73 decrease in rld table 4 due to sever root pruning has dropped ωp h max to 0 617 in d1l1 treatment in d1l2 and d1l3 in spite of root pruning and in d1l4 with no pruning ωp h max is very close to 1 implying that with db 1 35 mg m 3 may be called ideal bulk density even with 48 reduction in rld table 4 water availability to sunflower plant has not been restricted at d2 db 1 55 mg m 3 level 75 root pruning along with relatively compacted soil condition has diminished water availability as indicated by the drop of ωp h max from 1 to 0 707 at d3 db 1 75 mg m 3 level 75 root pruning significantly reduced ωp h max to 0 609 in d3l1 interestingly this restrictive effect of db 1 75 has not appeared in d3l2 and d3l4 even with respectively 50 and 25 root pruning ωp h max 1 for both treatments it is speculated that even under high soil compaction enough rld as in d3l4 facilitated water availability to the plant in hw hd domain with sufficient rate that avoided water stress to be developed g gc 1 the last column in table 5 represents contribution of water availability at the three h domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax to the total available water expressed as the fractions of iwcp it is interesting that except in d1l2 d3l3 and d3l4 in the rest of the treatments more than 57 of the available water has been supplied from hd hmax suction domain and the remained 43 from hmin hw domain it may be concluded that water supply to sunflower plant in spite of restrictions due to insufficient aeration and or rapid drainage hmin hw domain and due to high soil penetration resistance and or low hydraulic conductivity hd hmax domain significantly contributed to the total available water as iwcp from the soil and this contribution may reach to even 100 this finding contradicts the paw and llwr availability concepts that assume soil water is available to plants only within two lower and upper suction limits and beyond the two limits soil water is considered as unavailable this deserves more clarification means for the iwcp were compared p 0 05 between the various combinations of bulk density and root pruning dl treatments using tukey test tukey 1977 and sas program sas institute 2013 and is shown in table 5 for d1 and d2 treatments differences among l1 with the other three root pruning levels l2 l3 l4 were significant for d3 treatments the differences between d3l1 and d3l2 and their differences with d3l3 and d3l4 are also significant but between d3l3 and d3l4 is not differences between d1l4 with all other treatments at the three compaction levels except for d1l2 and d1l3 were also significant table 5 3 3 comparison of iwcp llwr and paw the mean values of paw100 paw330 llwr100 llwr330 and iwcp all in cm3 cm 3 for d1 d2 and d3 treatments are depicted by table 6 rld is not taken into account in llwr and paw computation so their values for d1 are the same table 6 for d1 and d2 treatments the maximum belonged to paw100 0 233 and 0 223 cm3 cm 3 respectively and minimum to iwcp 0 139 and 0 118 cm3 cm 3 for d3 treatment the highest db of 1 75 intensely diminished llwr100 and llwr330 to the minimum value 0 080 cm3 cm 3 regarding iwcp root pruning in d1 treatments 73 79 and 25 respectively from l1 to l3 resulted in 44 9 and 13 decrease in iwcp values from l1 to l3 compared to d1l4 as shown in table 5 for d2 treatments root pruning 74 49 and 29 respectively from l1 to l3 caused a 37 14 6 and 8 8 decrease in iwcp values for d2l1 d2l2 and d2l3 respectively compared to d2l4 and 48 2 29 5 and 24 7 compared to d1l4 the iwcp for d2l4 was 82 5 of the value for d1l4 showing that rise in db from 1 35 to 1 55 mg m 3 decreased iwcp by 17 5 while the same rise in db reduced llwr100 24 and llwr330 about 11 table 6 iwcp for d3l1 and d3l2 treatments was 56 8 and 87 1 that for d3l4 iwcp for d3l3 and d3l4 treatments was about similar comparing iwcp mean values between d3 and d1 treatments indicated that increasing soil compaction from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 decreased water availability 20 1 and from 1 55 to 1 75 mg m 3 only by 6 da silva et al 1994 method for water availability shows that llwr100 and llwr330 for d3 treatment were by 66 and 46 smaller than the value for d1 treatment and 56 and 45 lower than d2 treatment table 6 respectively for d2 treatment iwcp was 76 and 81 of paw330 and llwr330 respectively for d3 treatments llwr100 330 were 70 of iwcp value for this treatment iwcp mean value for d3 treatment was greater than llwr100 and llwr330 142 5 of for this treatment for d2 treatments iwcp mean value was 52 9 and 76 1 of its value for paw100 and paw330 and for d3 treatments 55 9 and 68 7 of it respectively it seems the reason that the iwcp values for d1 and d2 are smaller than llwr100 and paw100 are a the inappropriate critical limits selected for the upper and lower limits of current two methods for water availability and b the effect of evapotranspiration demand other environmental variables and soil hydraulic conductivity are not considered while in iwcp the effect of those factors are reflected in the measured g and thus on ωp h for our treatments using groenevelt et al 2001 approach showed increasing soil compaction from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 drastically decreased iwc from 0 229 to 0 038 cm3 cm 3 equivalent to 83 decrease in water availability in groenevelt et al 2001 approach rising in soil compaction from d1 to d2 led to 33 decrease for iwcg the results indicated the advantages of iwcp over llwr and paw are a it responded realistically to soil compaction levels while the other two respond either unrealistically or exaggeratedly and b iwcp considered different levels of rld as an important factor besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 vadez et al 2007 in water availability for plants but paw and llwr basically lack such capability paw is almost irresponsive and llwr is over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density while iwcp seems reflect more realistic influence of soil compaction on soil water availability to plants since almost 75 root pruning caused by 43 decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1 it seems our proposed plant base method for water availability reflected the effect of rld on available water for plants in contrary to llwr paw and groenevelt et al 2001 proposed approach for iwc that the value of soil available water was constant for each soil compaction level and various root pruning levels the diameter of the stem as a growth index also responded to the applied treatments which is consistent with the response of the leaf stomata iwcp showed a good positive r 0 57 and significant p 0 01 correlation with stem diameter of the studied treatments in other words as mentioned above stomatal conductance is a reliable criterion in computing iwcp by the proposed method the results of comparing means of iwcp between db treatments show that the differences between iwcp values for d3 and d2 with d1 were significant but differences between d3 and d2 treatments were not table 6 comparing the results of iwcp among four root pruning levels the results not shown shows that differences in iwcp between l1 and l4 and among l2 and l3 with l4 were significant but between l2 and l3 were not these findings indicate that root pruning would decrease water uptake considerably but the differences between 50 and 75 root pruning were not significant this result is also in consistent with besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 and vadez et al 2007 findings that reported important effect of rld on water uptake of plants for paw100 paw330 llwr100 llwr330 differences among d1 d2 and d3 treatments were significant table 6 4 conclusion we introduced a single weighting function ωp h for computing a plant response based integral water capacity iwcp in a sandy clay loam soil and compared with the conventional paw and llwr being solely soil attributes based in terms of their sensitivity or response to the various imposed soil db and rld in sunflower plant iwcp responded more realistically to the imposed soil compaction levels while the other two responded either unrealistically or exaggeratedly paw was much less responsive and llwr was over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density iwcp reflected rld impact as an important factor in water availability for the plants but paw and llwr basically lacked such capability nearly 75 root pruning led to about 43 decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1while it did not affected either paw or llwr our proposed plant base method thus reflected impact of rld on available water for the examined plant in contrary to llwr paw and groenevelt et al 2001 originally proposed approach sunflower plant stem diameter as a growth criterion also responded to the applied treatments which is consistent with the response of the leaf stomata to those treatments computed iwcp also showed significant p 0 01 positive correlation r 0 57 with stem diameter these findings all reflect the necessity of including appropriate plant attribute s in computing or predicting amount of available soil water to that plant we took relative stomatal conductance as a plant attribute

10389,computation of integral water capacity iwc as an alternative criterion for soil water availability to plant requires developing of weighting function ω h for each limiting factor may prevail within a particular water or suction range e g hd and hw in the root medium and diminish water availability to plant so far defining hd and hw limits for a particular limiting factor has been primarily soil property based we investigated the possibility of plant response based ω h as a proxy for this purpose a sandy clay loam soil was evenly compacted to three bulk densities db of 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 in large 30 cm diameter and 70 cm depth pvc tubes called pots hereafter sunflower helianthus annuus l seedlings were planted in the pots and after their full establishment at late vegetative growth stage root pruning was implemented by cutting off approximately 75 50 25 and 0 of the root branches in the 0 25 cm section along the root crown two periods of wetting and drying cycles were subsequently imposed and soil water contents and midday leaf stomatal conductance were routinely measured at the end of the experiment total root length in the samples separately taken from three sections 5 25 25 50 and 50 70 cm of each pot was measured using gsa image analyzer software and converted to root length density rld relative stomatal conductance g gc presumably varying between 0 to 1 and comprising impact of all water availability limiting factors in the root medium as function of h were developed and substituted for ω h and the plant response based integral water capacity iwcp was then computed and compared between various imposed treatments and with least limiting water range llwr and plant available water paw for the treatments without root pruning l4 increase in soil compaction from d1 to d2 and from d1 to d3 reduced iwcp by about 17 5 and 20 5 respectively the corresponding decreases for llwr were 22 and 66 respectively and negligible for paw these results showed that paw is almost irresponsive and llwr is over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density while iwcp seems reflect more realistic influence of soil compaction on soil water availability to plants decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1 was by 43 in contrary to llwr and paw our proposed method showed the effect of root length density on plant available water keywords root pruning soil bulk density sunflower water availability weighting functions 1 introduction integral water capacity iwc concept was introduced by groenevelt et al 2001 to compute available soil water content to plants as an alternative to the previous concepts including classical plant available water paw non limiting water range nlwr and least limiting water range llwr the latter is a range of soil water content at which soil physical conditions are least constrained in terms of aeration penetration resistance sr and matric potential h for water supply to the plant da silva et al 1994 de souza et al 2017 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 kazemi et al 2020 groenevelt et al 2001 developed weighting functions ωi h see eq 1 that can be applied to the defined ranges of soil water potential within 0 to 15000 cm or even beyond ωi h takes into account various limiting factors that may restrict soil water availability within the ranges the objective of introducing iwc a superior alternative to paw nlwr and llwr was to avoid using weighting coefficients that sharply rise in a cut off manner from 0 to 1 at the wet range of water release curve wrc and sharply falls from 1 to 0 at the dry side groenevelt et al 2001 defined iwc as 1 i w c 0 i 1 n ω i h c h d h where c h dθ dh is differential water capacity cm 1 ωi h is weighting function accounting for a particular soil water limiting factor that may prevail in a given soil matric potential range h π indicates that in a given h range if more than one limiting factor prevails their impact would be multiplicative to determine ωi h for each limiting factor a pair of lower and upper h limits hw and hd respectively has to be set or assigned to and the ωi h function usually non linear to be defined such that its numerical value vary within 0 to 1 this approach requires as many as hw hd pairs to be selected as there are limiting factors for soil water availability the main questions are a how the two h limits should be defined and set for each limiting factor for water availability in the root medium b what degrees of uncertainty is involved in and c why the plant responses or characters shouldn t be taken in to account in defining the two limits in groenevelt et al 2001 approach the limits are set primarily according to soil physical properties and response or behavior of the plant in question is almost overlooked in spite of introducing various limiting factors e g insufficient aeration rapid drainage low hydraulic conductivity and or high soil penetration resistance and high salinity to equation 1 and developing appropriate ωi h functions groenevelt et al 2001 groenevelt et al 2004 asgarzadeh et al 2010 grant et al 2010 nang et al 2010 the root length density rld as an important factor in water uptake by plants besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 vadez et al 2007 has not been examined in iwc issue besides soil hydraulics water flow from the bulk soil towards the root surface would also depend on rld acevedo hinojosa 1975 hasegawa 1981 hasegawa and sato 1985 implying the necessity of incorporating rld in determining of iwc high rld increases contact surface between soil and root white and kirkegaard 2010 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 and moreover greater rld implies more roots in a given volume of soil meaning that roots become more closer together and thus the mean distance that water has to move from midpoints of the two adjacent parallel roots and reach to the surface of the two roots would be reduced gardner 1960 leaf stomata as ultimate gate ways between the plant system and the atmosphere regulate gas exchange between the two and meanwhile maintain leaf turgor and prevent plant from dehydration cowan 1978 daly et al 2004 in view of chahal 2010 stomatal conductance is the simplest and most useful indicator for measuring plant response to soil water status it is also a quick physiological response of plant to leaf water potential parry 2014 decrease in leaf water potential due to water stress and or high transpiration beyond a threshold value leads to sharp decrease in stomatal conductance cuevas et al 2006 dry and loveys 1999 ewers et al 2001 grimes and williams 1990 naor 1998 tan and layne 1991 farooq et al 2009 brestic and zivcak 2013 it is also reported that leaf stomata response rather quickly to insufficient aeration sojka 1992 and to high soil penetration resistance masle 1998 it may be due to the signal s that is generated in the roots in response to low oxygen concentration and high soil mechanical resistance and is trasfered to the leaves tardieu et al 1991 1992 hartung et al 2002 leading to stomatal action the above findings justify the worthiness of incorporating of the stomatal conductance as a plant response based criterion in place of ω h function it was hypothesized that the relative stomatal conductance g gc the ratio of stomatal conductance at any given h to that under non limiting conditions should vary between 0 and 1 within the full h range near saturated to dry water status this conceptualization is depicted by fig 1 with this approach only a single pair of hw hd limit would be needed fig 1 and stomatal conductance which integrates the effects of any limiting factor in the root zone or medium would be used for computation of iwc the main purposes of this research were a examining relative stomatal conductance function g gc as a proxy for ω h by adopting a single pair of hw hd range b find out how the plant response based integral water capacity iwcp might be affected by the imposed bulk density and rld or root pruning levels and c compare the iwcp with conventional paw and llwr 2 materials and methods a greenhouse experiment was conducted with sunflower plant growing in large pvc pots using a sandy clay loam scl soil sunflower plant was chosen because its root system is sensitive to soil compaction aliari et al 2000 andrade et al 1993 and expands in the soil as distinct branches that spread down evenly from the crown in all directions in the top layer of soil 0 20 cm aliari et al 2000 these features make sunflower root system to be pruned rather easily by cutting off the lateral branches from the crown at the top soil layer and to achieve different rlds 2 1 pots preparation and planting adequate amount of a sandy clay loam soil inceptisol typic haplozerepts was collected from surface layer 0 20 cm of an uncultivated field n 46 3 46 e 38 27 13 located at the vicinity of ahar city east azerbaijan iran and transported to green house where large fractions and clods were crushed and sieved through a 4 76 mm sieve no gravel was present in the soil thirty six pvc tubes called pots hereafter each with 30 cm diameter and 70 cm height were evenly filled up with the prepared soil and packed to the desired bulk densities of 1 35 d1 1 55 d2 and 1 75 d3 mg m 3 based on air dried soil mass each in 12 pots we adopted these bulk densities according to arshad et al 1996 findings for sandy clay loam soil in relation to root growth susceptibility to soil compaction they established two limiting db for each usda soil texture class for sandy clay loam soil as used in our experiment they are a db 1 4 mg m 3 ideal for root growth and activity b 1 4 db 1 75 root growth moderately affected and c db 1 75 mg m 3 restricting root growth the db s of 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 were selected according to the above criteria we did not use relative bulk density criterion weight mw of the wetted soil θm 0 20 required to be compacted to the specified bulk density dbd with occupying a 5 cm thick layer in the pots was computed from mw v dbw dbw dbd 1 θ the sufficient number soil packages weighing mw were prepared and poured into the pots one by one and each compacted to 5 cm thick this procedure continued until the pots filled up a 8 5 kg hammer was allowed to slide down along a rod placed vertically in the center from 60 cm height and drop on to each wet soil layer just poured in and compact it to 5 cm thick the 1 75 mg m 3 was the highest db that we could reach to by the compaction equipment we had each pot was planted by 3 sunflower helianthus annuus l seedlings and all pots were husbanded in the green house average temperature 37 humidity 36 and day light hours 14 until full vegetative growth development and onset of the reproductive stage full or maximum root system proliferation was assumed to occur at this stage aliari et al 2000 when root pruning was implemented to accomplish this task about 75 50 25 and 0 percent of root branches in the upper soil layer 0 25 cm were cut off from the crown in the selected pots and designated by l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively presumably this differential root pruning would lead to various levels of rld as was the aim of the experiment immediately after pruning and before returning the removed soil mass into its place in the pots the cut off cross sections were coated with wood glue to prevent possible fungal or bacteria contamination surface of the pots was fully covered with perlite to minimize evaporation losses in each pruning treatment one out of three pots replicates were considered as control and its water content was maintained around field capacity at h 33 kpa during the experiment the next two replicates exposed to two successive wetting drying cycles and various plant responses were monitored furthermore at each db level 4 pots and totally 12 extra pots were prepared and allocated to sampling of undisturbed soil cores for construction of wrc and soil penetration resistance curve src these extra pots were kept around field capacity during the experiment and did not receive water stress nor root pruning 2 2 measurements daily measurements of soil bulk electrical resistance were carried out by the hand made electrical resistance type sensors installed horizontally at 10 35 and 55 cm depths in the pots and converted to soil water contents gravimetric using a calibration curve prepared for each db 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 mg m 3 for the calibration five levels of soil moisture content ranged from close to saturation to 5 water content was created at each soil compaction 1 35 1 55 and 1 75 g cm 3 level in small pots and their electrical resistance was determined using ohm meter the exact moisture content of the soil in the pots was determined using thermo gravimetric method plant response to the imposed treatments was monitored daily as leaf stomatal conductance g measured with a diffusion porometer delta t co model ap4 at midday during 12 30 to 14 hours the time span that leaf stomata response well to water stress shackel 2011 the collected data as indicator of sunflower plant water status was employed to identify and set up the hd and hw limits fig 1 these limits were

determination of wrc and src each of the 12 pots received no water stress and no root pruning was cut along its vertical axis to two halves and core samples were taken from each half by inserting steel cylinders 5 cm diameter and 5 cm height in to the soil at 0 20 20 40 and 40 70 cm depths totally 36 core samples were taken and used for determining wrc and src functions in brief hanging water columns and pressure plates were used to determine equilibrium water contents at full range of absolute matric potentials or pressures from 10 to 15000 cm at each equilibrium pressure soil penetration resistance was measured with a digital micro penetrometer in the laboratory 30 cone angle 6 mm base diameter and 2 mm per minute penetration rate the detailed procedure for obtaining wrc and src functions has been described by neyshabouri et al 2014 van genuchten 1980 model eq 2 was fitted to the observed h θ data using the retc program mualem 1976 m 1 1 n option in order to obtain the model coefficients and apply to c h function eq 2 a 2 θ h θr θs θr 1 αh n m 2a c h θ s θ r n 1 h 1 α h n 1 α h n 1 n 2 where h is the absolute matric potential cm and θr and θs cm3 cm 3 are respectively residual and saturated water contents a power src model eq 3 was fitted to the laboratory measured soil penetration resistances data and coefficients of a and b were determined 3 sr ahb 2 4 computing proposed g gc function and iwcp we substituted ω h function in equation 1 by relative stomatal conductance function g gc ratio of stomatal conductance at a prevailed h under the given set of experimental conditions to that under optimal or non limiting growth condition this ratio which can be rather easily monitored directly reflects plant behavior or response primarily to the prevailed soil water suction h it is conceptualized that g gc as a function of h should be bounded between near 0 and 1 as depicted by fig 1 at the wet range hmin hw domain insufficient aeration and or rapid drainage and in the dry range hd hmax domain low hydraulic conductivity and or high soil penetration resistance would limit water availability leading to some decrease in relative stomatal conductance g gc 1 in the hw hd domain presumably no soil water limitation prevails leading to almost full stomatal opening g gc near 1 to determine hw and hd values we looked for a suitable mathematical model that best fits to the experimental g gc h data for each combination of bulk density root pruning treatment in this regard the curve expert software 1 4 curve expert net usa indicated the vapor pressure model eq 4 to be the best one the developed g gc function eq 4 along with corresponding hw and hd for each treatment were applied to equations 5 and 6 and plant response based integral water capacity iwcp was computed 4 ωp h g h gc exp a b h c ln h 5 e p h ω p h c h 6 i w c p h 1 h 2 e p h d h conventional paw and llwr were also computed for the comparison purposes in the computation θafp or θfc and θsr or θpwp see table 1 for theses abbreviations were taken respectively as the upper and lower limits of the soil available water as used by several researchers da silva et al 1994 neyshabouri et al 2014 de soza et al 2017 farahania et al 2020 kazemi et al 2020 2 5 root separation and rld measurement root separation from the soil mass in each pot as a perquisite for rld measurement was carried out at two stages at the first stage the top 5 25 cm section the 0 5 cm perlite layer was discarded of each pot pvc tube and the soil within was cut off by a chain saw and placed on a screen net fixed within plastic bucket large enough to immerse the whole cut section in the tap water in order to moisten and soften the soil mass surrounding the roots by repeated washing the soil particles eventually were washed out and the intact root remained on the screen this remained mass was dried with blotting paper and weighted with a precise scale about one quarter of the mass as a partial sample was separated weighed cut to pieces then evenly distributed on the white glass plate 30 cm 40 cm and its image was taken using a high resolution digital camera root length cm and area cm2 in the partial sample was determined using gsa image analyzer software gsa 2016 and then extended to the whole root mass in proportion to its weight the obtained total root length was then divided by soil bulk volume in 5 25 cm section and reported as rld cm cm 3 in that section root separation from the remaining 25 70 cm section was carried out with different method this section was cut through vertically to two half cylinders and two sets of soil clods were taken separately from 25 50 and 50 70 cm depths in each half section the weight of moist clods ranged from 195 to 2780 g one set was preserved for root separation the second set was oven dried and weighed for water content measurements which were used to calculate dry weights and then convert them to clods volume taken in the first set in this conversion d1 d2 and d3 bulk densities were appropriately applied to separate roots from the sampled clods they immersed in tap water to soften slake and disperse them with frequent mechanical agitation the suspended mixture of roots and accompanied fine soil particles were passed through a filter with suitable pore size 0 2 mm from here on the procedures describe for the 5 25 section were applied to the separated roots from the clods and rld was determined for each clod the rld for each section 25 50 and 50 70 cm was taken as the average rlds for the clods taken from those sections 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental layout for iwcp was factorial with complete randomized block design with two replications for paw and llwr it was completely randomized block because we only considered the effect of db on them means of the iwcp along with paw and llwr were compared and their responses to the various imposed treatments were discussed statistical analysis was also made using tukey test tukey 1977 for the multiple comparisons at p 0 05 using the sas program sas institute 2013 in order to determine direct and interactive effects of db and rld on iwcp and comparisons among various combinations of db d1 d2 and d3 and root pruning l1 to l4 treatments the graphs were drawn by microsoft excel software 3 results and discussion general physicochemical properties of the studied soil are shown in table 2 the soil texture was sandy clay loam sand 52 silt 26 clay 22 kg 100 kg 1 percent of oc and cce are low and based on npk measurements the required n as urea co nh2 2 at 2 times and p as calcium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous cahpo4 1 time fertilizers were added to the pots the soil was not saline or calcareous the wrc src and c h curves are depicted by fig 2 and the coefficients of van genuchten 1980 wrc model eq 2 and the penetration resistance power model eq 3 along with r2 and sse for the three compaction levels d1 d3 are listed in table 3 with exception for src in d3 r2 values greater than 0 97 and sse as low as 0 002 shows that both models fit to and describe well the experimental data increasing db from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 led to decrease in θs from 0 513 to 0 411 cm 3 cm 3 table 3 and increase in water content at pwp from 0 12 to 0 16 cm 3 cm 3 fig 2 the same increase in db led to a drastic decrease in h corresponding to 2 mpa soil penetration resistance sr from about 21000 in d1 to 3600 cm in d3 as computed from eq 2 c h also decreased with increase in db fig 2 these findings emphasize the key role of the db in soil water availability to plants as reported by da silva et al 1994 and zou et al 2000 3 1 compaction and root pruning effects on rld rld in the entire soil column 5 70 cm for various density pruning dl treatments and their mean comparison is presented in fig 3 the significant effect of db and root pruning on rld is evident raising db from 1 35 to 1 55 then to 1 75 mg m 3 reduced rld from 3 75 in d1l4 to 2 8 then to 1 9 cm cm 3 which is about 50 reduction fig 3 shows that decrease in rld due to increase in db is more or less similar for all root pruning levels designating no interaction effect between db and root pruning effect on rld the measured rld at the three depths and its relative decrease due to root pruning for various treatments are given in table 4 in 5 25 cm section where root pruning was performed decrease in rld is nearly similar for the three compaction levels d1 d2 and d3 the mean rlds in l1 l2 and l3 treatments were respectively 74 49 and 28 percent of that in l4 with no pruning these figures are very close to 75 50 and 25 percent as were expected from the root pruning exercise and implies that no root re growth has occurred after root pruning otherwise rld reductions would had been much less than 74 49 and 28 percent halt in root growth at the end of vegetative growth stage in sunflower is also reported by aliari et al 2000 rld reduction in the entire soil columns 5 70 cm depth averaged over the three bulk density levels were about 64 43 and 24 percent not shown in table 4 for l1 l2 and l3 respectively as compared to l4 with no root pruning the reason for 22 1 and 24 percent decrease in rld for d3l1 and d3l2 in 50 70 cm layer may be the high soil compaction and aeration problem in that depth for the mentioned treatments 3 2 ωp h and ep h functions variation of ωp h taken equal to g gc as function of h which is depicted by fig 4 has been limited to 0 1 range as speculated in fig 1 in the treatments without restrictions to water availability due to compaction or low rld e g d1l4 d1l3 or d1l2 ωp h has reached to its maximum value of 1 or nearly to 1 in d3l1 which experienced both high compaction and sever root pruning 71 reduction in rld table 4 ωp h dropped to its minimum value of 0 601 table 5 which indicates that g gc ratio as a potentially useful criterion for evaluating soil water availability to plants and employing it in iwc computation the daily measurements of stomatal conductance require diffusion porometer accessibility to this device along its maintenance however may be drawbacks of the substituting g gc for ωp h in iwcp computation the large scattering in g gc data around the fitted function may also decrease the accuracy of the hw and hd limits determining from fig 4 the generalization of the idea of replacing ωp h by g gc needs its examination in other plants and various environmental conditions fig 4 distinctly shows existence of the two hmin hw and hd hmax suction domains for all treatments irrespective of their type as speculated in fig 1 but hw hd domain supposed to be the non restrictive suction domain has occurred only for the d1l4 and d3l4 treatments in the rest treatments it is very narrow nearly zero such that hw hd the values of the three suction domains for the various treatments is tabulated and further discussed in table 5 fig 4 shows that increase in db from 1 35 to 1 55 and then to 1 75 mg m 3 has led to the average hmin to rise respectively from 50 to 70 and then 100 cm these increases in hmin is reasonable and reflects greater insufficient aeration with increasing soil compaction which is also has been reported by others da silva et al 1994 zou et al 2000 the hmax values have increased with db which seems unexpected it is expected that at db 1 75 the restriction for water availability due to compaction to be expressed at lower suctions and thus hmax should be lower than those for db of 1 35 and 1 55 mg m 3 greater unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k h may contribute to this contradictory finding dec et al 2008 the scattering of the data points g gc in fig 4 also may contribute to this contradiction and any way needs further investigation fig 5 shows the effective differential water capacity function ep h developed as the product of c h and ωp h ep h thus represents the magnitude of the area below the curves decrease in the peak of ep h curve from about 3 3 10 3 in d1 with no compaction to 1 3 10 3 in d3 treatments is due to the flattening of c h curve fig 2 and to the lower ωp h or g gc for d3 treatment the area under ep h curves confined by each of the three suction domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax and their sum as iwcp are tabulated in table 5 for elaborated discussion table 5 represents the three h domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax determined from g gc functions fig 4 for each combination of density and pruning dl levels for all treatments except d1l2 d3l3 d3l4 hw hd domain is restricted to very narrow range such that hw practically becomes equal to hd it implies that in those treatments the h domain with no water supply restrictions corresponding to g h gc 1 fig 1 in the root zone practically did not exist or prevailed the ωp h max in each dl treatment is expected to occur at hw hd domain and if no restriction to water availability occur g h gc 1 as presented by fig 1 then ωp h max should be equal 1 at d1 db 1 35 mg m 3 level 73 decrease in rld table 4 due to sever root pruning has dropped ωp h max to 0 617 in d1l1 treatment in d1l2 and d1l3 in spite of root pruning and in d1l4 with no pruning ωp h max is very close to 1 implying that with db 1 35 mg m 3 may be called ideal bulk density even with 48 reduction in rld table 4 water availability to sunflower plant has not been restricted at d2 db 1 55 mg m 3 level 75 root pruning along with relatively compacted soil condition has diminished water availability as indicated by the drop of ωp h max from 1 to 0 707 at d3 db 1 75 mg m 3 level 75 root pruning significantly reduced ωp h max to 0 609 in d3l1 interestingly this restrictive effect of db 1 75 has not appeared in d3l2 and d3l4 even with respectively 50 and 25 root pruning ωp h max 1 for both treatments it is speculated that even under high soil compaction enough rld as in d3l4 facilitated water availability to the plant in hw hd domain with sufficient rate that avoided water stress to be developed g gc 1 the last column in table 5 represents contribution of water availability at the three h domains hmin hw hw hd and hd hmax to the total available water expressed as the fractions of iwcp it is interesting that except in d1l2 d3l3 and d3l4 in the rest of the treatments more than 57 of the available water has been supplied from hd hmax suction domain and the remained 43 from hmin hw domain it may be concluded that water supply to sunflower plant in spite of restrictions due to insufficient aeration and or rapid drainage hmin hw domain and due to high soil penetration resistance and or low hydraulic conductivity hd hmax domain significantly contributed to the total available water as iwcp from the soil and this contribution may reach to even 100 this finding contradicts the paw and llwr availability concepts that assume soil water is available to plants only within two lower and upper suction limits and beyond the two limits soil water is considered as unavailable this deserves more clarification means for the iwcp were compared p 0 05 between the various combinations of bulk density and root pruning dl treatments using tukey test tukey 1977 and sas program sas institute 2013 and is shown in table 5 for d1 and d2 treatments differences among l1 with the other three root pruning levels l2 l3 l4 were significant for d3 treatments the differences between d3l1 and d3l2 and their differences with d3l3 and d3l4 are also significant but between d3l3 and d3l4 is not differences between d1l4 with all other treatments at the three compaction levels except for d1l2 and d1l3 were also significant table 5 3 3 comparison of iwcp llwr and paw the mean values of paw100 paw330 llwr100 llwr330 and iwcp all in cm3 cm 3 for d1 d2 and d3 treatments are depicted by table 6 rld is not taken into account in llwr and paw computation so their values for d1 are the same table 6 for d1 and d2 treatments the maximum belonged to paw100 0 233 and 0 223 cm3 cm 3 respectively and minimum to iwcp 0 139 and 0 118 cm3 cm 3 for d3 treatment the highest db of 1 75 intensely diminished llwr100 and llwr330 to the minimum value 0 080 cm3 cm 3 regarding iwcp root pruning in d1 treatments 73 79 and 25 respectively from l1 to l3 resulted in 44 9 and 13 decrease in iwcp values from l1 to l3 compared to d1l4 as shown in table 5 for d2 treatments root pruning 74 49 and 29 respectively from l1 to l3 caused a 37 14 6 and 8 8 decrease in iwcp values for d2l1 d2l2 and d2l3 respectively compared to d2l4 and 48 2 29 5 and 24 7 compared to d1l4 the iwcp for d2l4 was 82 5 of the value for d1l4 showing that rise in db from 1 35 to 1 55 mg m 3 decreased iwcp by 17 5 while the same rise in db reduced llwr100 24 and llwr330 about 11 table 6 iwcp for d3l1 and d3l2 treatments was 56 8 and 87 1 that for d3l4 iwcp for d3l3 and d3l4 treatments was about similar comparing iwcp mean values between d3 and d1 treatments indicated that increasing soil compaction from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 decreased water availability 20 1 and from 1 55 to 1 75 mg m 3 only by 6 da silva et al 1994 method for water availability shows that llwr100 and llwr330 for d3 treatment were by 66 and 46 smaller than the value for d1 treatment and 56 and 45 lower than d2 treatment table 6 respectively for d2 treatment iwcp was 76 and 81 of paw330 and llwr330 respectively for d3 treatments llwr100 330 were 70 of iwcp value for this treatment iwcp mean value for d3 treatment was greater than llwr100 and llwr330 142 5 of for this treatment for d2 treatments iwcp mean value was 52 9 and 76 1 of its value for paw100 and paw330 and for d3 treatments 55 9 and 68 7 of it respectively it seems the reason that the iwcp values for d1 and d2 are smaller than llwr100 and paw100 are a the inappropriate critical limits selected for the upper and lower limits of current two methods for water availability and b the effect of evapotranspiration demand other environmental variables and soil hydraulic conductivity are not considered while in iwcp the effect of those factors are reflected in the measured g and thus on ωp h for our treatments using groenevelt et al 2001 approach showed increasing soil compaction from 1 35 to 1 75 mg m 3 drastically decreased iwc from 0 229 to 0 038 cm3 cm 3 equivalent to 83 decrease in water availability in groenevelt et al 2001 approach rising in soil compaction from d1 to d2 led to 33 decrease for iwcg the results indicated the advantages of iwcp over llwr and paw are a it responded realistically to soil compaction levels while the other two respond either unrealistically or exaggeratedly and b iwcp considered different levels of rld as an important factor besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 vadez et al 2007 in water availability for plants but paw and llwr basically lack such capability paw is almost irresponsive and llwr is over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density while iwcp seems reflect more realistic influence of soil compaction on soil water availability to plants since almost 75 root pruning caused by 43 decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1 it seems our proposed plant base method for water availability reflected the effect of rld on available water for plants in contrary to llwr paw and groenevelt et al 2001 proposed approach for iwc that the value of soil available water was constant for each soil compaction level and various root pruning levels the diameter of the stem as a growth index also responded to the applied treatments which is consistent with the response of the leaf stomata iwcp showed a good positive r 0 57 and significant p 0 01 correlation with stem diameter of the studied treatments in other words as mentioned above stomatal conductance is a reliable criterion in computing iwcp by the proposed method the results of comparing means of iwcp between db treatments show that the differences between iwcp values for d3 and d2 with d1 were significant but differences between d3 and d2 treatments were not table 6 comparing the results of iwcp among four root pruning levels the results not shown shows that differences in iwcp between l1 and l4 and among l2 and l3 with l4 were significant but between l2 and l3 were not these findings indicate that root pruning would decrease water uptake considerably but the differences between 50 and 75 root pruning were not significant this result is also in consistent with besharat et al 2010 blum 2011 and vadez et al 2007 findings that reported important effect of rld on water uptake of plants for paw100 paw330 llwr100 llwr330 differences among d1 d2 and d3 treatments were significant table 6 4 conclusion we introduced a single weighting function ωp h for computing a plant response based integral water capacity iwcp in a sandy clay loam soil and compared with the conventional paw and llwr being solely soil attributes based in terms of their sensitivity or response to the various imposed soil db and rld in sunflower plant iwcp responded more realistically to the imposed soil compaction levels while the other two responded either unrealistically or exaggeratedly paw was much less responsive and llwr was over responsive to soil compaction or bulk density iwcp reflected rld impact as an important factor in water availability for the plants but paw and llwr basically lacked such capability nearly 75 root pruning led to about 43 decrease in iwcp from l4 to l1while it did not affected either paw or llwr our proposed plant base method thus reflected impact of rld on available water for the examined plant in contrary to llwr paw and groenevelt et al 2001 originally proposed approach sunflower plant stem diameter as a growth criterion also responded to the applied treatments which is consistent with the response of the leaf stomata to those treatments computed iwcp also showed significant p 0 01 positive correlation r 0 57 with stem diameter these findings all reflect the necessity of including appropriate plant attribute s in computing or predicting amount of available soil water to that plant we took relative stomatal conductance as a plant attribute
