24140,the capability to describe shoaling over sloping bottom is fundamental to modeling of coastal wave transformation the linear shoaling gradient provides a metric to measure this property in non hydrostatic models with layer integrated formulations the governing equations in boussinesq form facilitate derivation of the linear shoaling gradient which is in the form of a 2 p 2 2 p expansion of the water depth parameter kd with p equal to 1 for a one layer model and 4 n 4 for an n layer model the expansion reproduces the analytical solution from airy wave theory at the shallow water limit and maintains a reasonable approximation up to kd 1 2 and 2 for the one and two layer models additional layers provide rapid and monotonic convergence of the shoaling gradient into deep water numerical experiments of wave propagation over a plane slope illustrate manifestation of the shoaling errors through the transformation processes from deep to shallow water even though outside the zone of active wave transformation shoaling errors from deep to intermediate water are cumulative to produce appreciable impact to the wave amplitude in shallow water keywords multi layer model non hydrostatic model free surface flow wave shoaling shoaling gradient 1 introduction shoaling is a fundamental process in the transformation of ocean surface waves from deep to shallow water the wave amplitude varies with water depth to maintain the energy flux and the resulting nearshore wave pattern has profound influence on the surf zone processes recent advances in boussinesq type and non hydrostatic models have enabled detailed description of coastal wave processes for scientific research and engineering application the linear shoaling gradient which provides a quantitative measure of the wave amplitude variation over a constant slope has been an important metric for assessment of wave models the shoaling gradient determined exactly from airy wave theory has served as a benchmark in formulation of boussinesq type models and assessment of their performance schäffer and madsen 1995 proposed a procedure to compute the shoaling gradient for a boussinesq type model and employed the exact solution to optimize model performance follow on studies with similar strategies include placement of the velocity variable at a number of positions over the water column resulting in a series of boussinesq type formulations and selection of coefficients from expansions of the velocity variables in a highly dispersive model madsen and schäffer 1998 madsen et al 2002 madsen et al 2006 subsequently devised guidelines for the optimal level of expansion and demonstrated the linear shoaling envelope for wave transformation across a wide range water depth parameters donahue et al 2015 alternatively optimized the basis functions of a boussinesq scaled wave model to achieve improved performance in terms of the shoaling gradient an additional layer in a boussinesq type model can improve the shoaling property without utilizing high order terms in the governing equations lynett and liu 2004 derived the shoaling gradient for a two layer model and examined the property in terms of the layer thickness and placement of velocity variables the two sets of governing equations are connected at the interface to ensure continuity of the velocity profile to a desired degree of accuracy in a two layer framework chazel et al 2009 optimized the shoaling property of a low order boussinesq type model well into the deep water range simarro et al 2013 studied the linear shoaling property of low order formulations and proposed a set of bilayer equations to enhance the performance in terms of wave shoaling liu and fang 2016 optimized the placement of velocity variables and their connections between the two layers the optimized model achieves good agreement with the exact shoaling gradient in extremely deep water the non hydrostatic approach is gaining popularity in studies of coastal wave processes owing to the relatively simple and scalable numerical framework involving governing equations with up to first order derivatives bai and cheung 2012 2013a converted a one layer and a two layer non hydrostatic model into boussinesq form and presented the corresponding shoaling gradients for comparison with the exact solution determined from airy wave theory multi layer models have been applied to describe wave transformation over irregular bathymetry and depth induced wave breaking and surf zone processes for the detailed flow kinematics ai et al 2011 ma et al 2012 smit et al 2013 2014 zijlema et al 2011 the performance of models with three or more layers in shoaling which is crucial in determining the wave amplitude before breaking has not been examined in this paper we derive the linear shoaling gradient for layer integrated models and examine its convergence with respect to the exact solution a series of numerical experiments with a plane slope assist interpretation of the shoaling gradient and demonstrate effects of its error in wave transformation from deep to shallow water 2 governing equations consider a two dimensional free surface flow over a varying bottom as shown in fig 1 in the cartesian coordinate system x z the variables d and ζ denote the water depth and surface elevation and h ζ d is the flow depth the water column is divided into n layers with indices i 1 n from the bottom to the surface the layer thickness hi varies in space and time but the layer ratio defined by 1 r i h i h remains constant this provides the elevation for each of the n 1 interfaces at 2 z i j 1 i r j h d for the formulation of the multi layer system bai and cheung 2013b described the theoretical framework of a multi layer non hydrostatic model for free surface flow the use of the dispersion parameter μ and nonlinear parameter ϵ which denote the depth to wavelength and amplitude to depth ratios illustrates the structure of the governing equations and facilitates derivations of linear and nonlinear wave properties the flow depth in the non dimensional form becomes h ϵ ζ d the keller box scheme defines the layout and approximation of the evolution variables over the layers stelling and zijlema 2003 the continuity and momentum equations integrated over layer i read 3 h i u i x u z i z i x u z i 1 z i 1 x w z i w z i 1 0 4 u i t ϵ h i h i u i 2 x

ϵ w z i 1 δ w z i 1 h i 0 where ui wi denotes the layer integrated velocity q z i represents the non hydrostatic pressure at the interface zi and δ w z i is the net vertical velocity across the interface the velocity variables in the layer integrated governing equations 3 5 are interconnected at the internal and external boundaries the horizontal velocity component u z i at the interface is approximated as 6 u z i 1 2 u i u i 1 the vertical velocity component w z i should be distinguished from the vertical velocity of the interface and their difference gives the net flow as 7 δ w z i w z i 1 ϵ z i t u z i z i x the kinematic boundary conditions which define the vertical velocity at the free surface and the bottom are approximated by the layer integrated horizontal velocity un and u 1 as 8 w ζ ζ t ϵ u n ζ x z ϵ ζ 9 w d u 1 d x z d application of the trapezoidal rule over each layer gives the relation 10 w i 1 2 w z i 1 w z i to connect the layer integrated vertical velocity and the vertical velocity at the interface the dynamic boundary condition 11 q ζ 0 ensures the non hydrostatic pressure vanishes at the free surface the formulation of the multi layer system provides the numerical framework for implementation in model development conversion of the governing equations into boussinesq form facilitates derivation of analytical expressions for linear and nonlinear wave properties bai and cheung 2013b summation of the continuity equation 3 from i 1 n and application of the kinematic boundary conditions 8 and 9 give the continuity equation 12 ζ t x i 1 n h i u i 0 the vertical velocity and non hydrostatic pressure in the momentum equation 5 are expressed in terms of ζ and ui for conversion into boussinesq form the vertical velocity at the interface w z i can be sequentially derived from the layer integrated continuity equation 3 starting from the bottom layer with the kinematic boundary condition 9 and ending with the top layer closed by the free surface boundary condition 8 substitution of w z i into eqs 10 and 7 gives rise to the layer integrated vertical velocity wi and the net vertical velocity δ w z i across the interface the vertical velocity terms in turn provide the non hydrostatic pressure q z i through the vertical momentum equation 5 and the dynamic boundary condition 11 substitution of δ w z i and q z i into the layer integrated horizontal momentum equation 4 gives n momentum equations which together with the depth integrated continuity equation 12 form the complete set of governing equations containing ζ and ui as the evolution variables the multi layer non hydrostatic system in boussinesq form possesses identical wave properties as the original system we consider equal layer thickness with r i 1 n to illustrate the overall convergence pattern the derivation of the shoaling gradient requires the linearized governing equations containing first order bottom slope terms after dropping the nonlinear terms denoted by ϵ and high order bottom slope terms in the form 2 d x 2 and d x 2 we have the depth integrated continuity equation and n layer integrated momentum equations in the form 13 ζ t d n i 1 n u i x 1 n d x i 1 n u i 0 14 u i t ζ x μ 2 d 2 4 n 2 j 1 n a i j 3 u j x 2 t μ 2 d 8 n 2 d x j 1 n b i j 2 u j x t 0 i 1 n in which 15 a i j 4 n j 1 2 if i j 4 n i 1 if i j 4 n i 1 2 if i j 16 b i j 25 n 19 if i

cheung 2015 is symmetric and positive definite but the shoaling coefficient matrix bij is neither symmetric nor positive definite denoted by μ 2 in the momentum equations the third order terms define the dispersion property in the non hydrostatic system terms with the first order bottom slope d x which appears in both the continuity and momentum equations accounts for the shoaling process and its effects on dispersion the number of dispersion and shoaling terms increases with n to improve the propagation and shoaling processes without changing the order of the derivatives 3 shoaling gradient the group velocity closely related to the celerity describes the shoaling process through conservation of energy flux madsen and sørensen 1992 introduced the linear shoaling gradient γ to evaluate model effectiveness in describing the variation of wave amplitude a over a gentle bottom slope through the relation 17 1 a a x γ d d x they utilized airy wave theory in conjunction with conservation of energy flux to derive the expression 18 γ a i r y k d t a n h k d 1 k d t a n h k d 1 t a n h 2 k d t a n h k d k d 1 t a n h 2 k d 2 where k is wave number and kd is the water depth parameter madsen and sørensen 1992 this exact solution can be expanded about k d 0 by a taylor series for examination of the asymptopic property 19 γ a i r y 1 4 k d 2 4 k d 4 18 k d 6 540 11 k d 8 3150 o k d 10 the shoaling gradient represents the ratio of the amplitude gradient and bottom slope a positive γairy on an ascending slope d x 0 indicates increasing wave amplitude or vice verse the shoaling gradient converges to 1 4 and zero as kd 0 and respectively schäffer and madsen 1995 developed a procedure to derive the shoaling gradient for boussinesq type equations we adapt their procedure for the boussinesq form of the multi layer non hydrostatic system to evaluate the wave property for direct comparison with the exact solution 18 and its taylor series expansion 19 for wave shoaling on a plane slope the angular frequency ω remains constant while the wave number k x varies with water depth the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity of an n layer model can be expressed as 20 ζ x t a x e i ω t k x d x 21 u l x t u l r i u l i e i ω t k x d x l 1 n where the subscripts r and i indicate the real and imaginary parts of the velocity variable the system is governed by the continuity equation 13 integrated over the water column and the momentum equation 14 for each of the n layers this is different from the boussinesq type equations with multiple layers each of which has its own continuity and momentum equations that must be connected with an additional condition at the layer interface lynett and liu 2004 the present governing equations already include the coupling across the layered flow structure for direct derivation of the shoaling gradient substitution of the shoaling wave system 20 and 21 into the momentum equation 14 yields n complex algebraic equations after dropping the gradient terms the real part comprises n equations in terms of ulr and in matrix form reads 22 μ 2 k 2 d 2 ω a l m 4 n 2 ω σ l m n n u m r n 1 4 n 2 a k n 1 l m 1 n where the subscripts n n and n 1 denote the size of the respective matrix and vectors and σlm is an identity matrix defined as 23 σ l m 1 if l m 0 if l m the real part of the velocity variables can be solved directly from the equation set 22 in terms of the dispersion coefficients aij from eq 15 collection of the imaginary part from the n complex algebraic equations with up to first order gradient terms gives a second set of n equations for the solution of uli 24 8 n 2 μ 2 k 2 d 2 ω a lm 32 n 4 ω σ lm n n u mi n 1 32 n 4 a x 16 n 2 μ 2 k d 2 ω m 1 n a lm u mr x 4 n 2 μ 2 ω kd d x m 1 n b lm u mr 8 n 2 μ 2 ω d 2 k x m 1 n a lm u mr n 1 the source terms on the right hand side include the shoaling coefficients bij from eq 16 as well as the real part of the velocity ulr determined from eq 22 the velocity ulr uli obtained from eqs 22 and 24 is a function of the water depth parameter kd bed slope d x and wave amplitude gradient a x along with the angular frequency ω and wave number gradient k x both of which can be expressed in terms of kd the angular frequency ω in non dimensional form can be derived from the dispersion relation of the multi layer system as 25 ω k d 1 i 1 n 1 ϕ i k d 2 i 1 i 1 n ψ i k d 2 i 1 2 where the coefficients ϕi and ψi are given by bai and cheung 2015 since the angular frequency does not vary in the linear shoaling process the wave number gradient k x can be obtained from ω x 0 the continuity equation 13 provides a linkage between the real and imaginary parts of the velocity derived from the momentum equation 14 substitution of the shoaling wave system 20 and 21 into the continuity equation and collection of the real part yield 26 d x l 1 n u l r d l 1 n u l r x k d l 1 n u l i 0 rearrangement of eq 26 in the form of 17 with a x and d x gives the shoaling gradient for the multi layer non hydrostatic system as a function of kd appendices a c provide the detailed derivations for models with up to three layers as demonstration of the procedures the shoaling gradient takes the form of a rational function in which the numerator and denominator are polynomials of the water depth parameter kd the degrees of the polynomials define the structure of the shoaling gradient and constrain its behavior in limiting conditions an n layer model gives rise to a 2 p 2 2 p expansion in the form 27 γ n 1 i 1 p 1 β i k d 2 i 4 i 1 p α i k d 2 i where αi and βi are rational coefficients and the integer p associated with the degree is defined as 28 p 1 if n 1 4 n 4 if n 1 the constants 1 and 4 in the numerator and denominator of the expansion 27 guarantee convergence to the analytical solution 18 when kd 0 the polynomial in the numerator is always two degrees higher than that in the denominator the unsymmetrical structure reflects the approximation of the velocity profile in the vertical direction forcing the shoaling gradient to infinity as k d while the analytical solution goes to zero the degree increases by eight for each additional layer with the exception from one to two as indicated by the conditional definition of p this implies the one layer model possesses distinctive shoaling properties from models with two or more layers 4 results and discussion the shoaling gradient 27 is evaluated for models with increasing number of layers to demonstrate the convergence with respect to the exact solution 18 as well as its taylor series expansion 19 integration of the shoaling gradient provides an indication of error accumulation for wave propagation from a given water depth to the shore a series of numerical experiments illustrate evolution of the amplitude error as waves propagate over a slope from deep to shallow water 4 1 analytical expressions we follow the general procedures in section 3 to compute the coefficients αi and βi in eq 27 and examine the characteristics of the shoaling gradient from deep to shallow water the one layer model gives a 4 2 expansion in the form 29 γ 1 1 1 2 k d 2 3 16 k d 4 4 k d 2 which can be rewritten without approximation as 30 γ 1 1 4 3 16 k d 2 when comparing with the taylor series expansion 19 of the exact shoaling gradient the one layer model retains the first term to guarantee convergence at the shallow water limit but a coefficient of 3 16 instead of 1 4 for the second term indicates the convergence is not asymptotic to the order of kd 2 the shoaling gradient follows a 8 n 6 8 n 8 rational function expansion for models with two or more layers for illustration the shoaling gradients of the two and three layer models read 31 γ 2 1 0 69 k d 2 7 81 10 3 k d 4 9 28 10 3 k d 6 5 04 10 4 k d 8 4 77 10 6 k d 10 4 k d 2 0 22 k d 4 1 95 10 2 k d 6 1 53 10 3 k d 8 1 32 γ 3 1 0 0 6 k d 2 0 07 k d 4 6 07 10 3 k d 6 6 43 10 4 k d 8 1 38 10 5 k d 10 1 18 10 6 k d 12 2 48 10 8 k d 14 2 09 10 10 k d 16 8 81 10 13 k d 18 4 0 1 48 k d 2 0 37 k d 4 0 05 k d 6 4 38 10 3 k d 8 1 51 10 4 k d 10 3 07 10 6 k d 12 3 33 10 8 k d 14 1 93 10 10 k d 16 1 the coefficients of the rational functions are rounded to three digits to illustrate the structure of the expansion see appendix d for the shoaling gradients with four to 10 layers their values rapidly diminish with increasing order of kd resulting in a gradual variation of the shoaling gradient from deep to shallow water different from the one layer model the taylor series expansions of the rational functions 31 and 32 contain an infinite number of terms 33 γ 2 1 4 15 64 k d 2 11 256 k d 4 13 4096 k d 6 129 65536 k d 8 o k d 10 34 γ 3 1 4 35 144 k d 2 73 1458 k d 4 401 157464 k d 6 15749 5668704 k d 8 o k d 10 where the coefficients are computed without rounding as the number of layers increases the coefficients converge progressively from low to high order to the respective values in the taylor series expansion 19 of the exact solution in contrast the shoaling gradient of a boussineq type model contains a truncated taylor series expansion of the exact solution kennedy et al 2002 the number of terms increases with the order of approximation in the governing equations fig 2 compares the exact shoaling gradient 18 from airy wave theory with models of up to 10 layers the one layer model gives slight overestimation in shallow water primarily due to the coefficient of 3 16 versus 1 4 from the taylor series expansion 19 but follows the downward trend of the other models and the exact solution up to kd 1 2 the use of the same layer integrated horizontal velocity in the approximation of the kinematic free surface and bottom boundary conditions 8 and 9 limits the application in relatively shallow water the 4 2 expansion is literally a quadratic function as indicated by eq 30 with a monotonic decrease for large values of kd models with two or more layers which allow distinct velocities at the surface and the bottom produce a more robust convergence pattern defined by the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion for the full range of water depth parameters their shoaling gradients closely follow the exact solution toward the minimum value of 0 1 at kd 2 and reproduce the upward trend into deeper water albeit with overestimation as the number of layer increases the multi layer solution approaches the exact solution asymptotically and provides a good representation of the shoaling process for coastal wave transformation a quantitative measure of the shoaling error is useful for practical application fig 3 shows the absolute error γ n γ a i r y of the shoaling gradient with respect to the exact solution two ranges of water depth parameters 0 kd 10 and 0 kd 3 are selected to more clearly depict the variation of the errors among the models the one layer model overestimates the shoaling gradient by as much as 0 018 at k d 0 75 the overestimation in the range of 0 kd 1 075 where wave shoaling actively modifies the amplitude has significant implications for coastal wave transformation the shoaling gradient becomes negative for kd 1 075 and its increasing error in the negative range would lead to excessive reduction of the incident wave amplitude from deep water the two layer model also overestimates the shoaling gradient with a local peak at kd 0 9 the error decreases to a local minimum at kd 1 5 before increasing monotonically toward deep water as the number of layers increases the error diminishes rapidly while following the same pattern the positive error from deep to shallow water always results in overestimation of the wave amplitude by models with two or more layers integration of the shoaling gradient from a specific water depth parameter to shallow water provides a way to quantify the overall amplitude error during the shoaling process based on chen and liu 1995 we establish the error metric in relation to airy wave theory in the form 35 a i a a i r y e x p 0 k d γ i γ a i r y k 0 d d k 0 d 1 where k 0 d is a dumpy integration variable fig 4 shows the integrated relative error for models with one to ten layers the one layer model overestimates the shallow water wave amplitude by up to 1 8 when implemented to describe wave shoaling within the range of 0 kd 1 55 while producing underestimations for kd 1 55 due to dominance of the negative error models with two and more layers always overestimate the shallow water wave amplitude regardless the offshore water depth for a 1 error cap the offshore boundary can be implemented at up to kd 2 2 2 6 3 1 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 and 6 1 for the two to 10 layer models respectively the use of equal thickness layers in the present study demonstrates the general convergence and error patterns of the models with layer integrated formulations the results provide general guidance for selection of the number of layers that can provide accurate results for a specific application over a kd range reduction of the layer thickness toward the free surface can better resolve deep water wave kinematics and will likely improve the shoaling gradient for large values of kd while retaining the same number of layers the expansion order and convergence pattern which reflect the treatment of the evolution variables over the water column by the keller box scheme stelling and zijlema 2003 will be different from other multi layer formulations such as ma et al 2012 and zhu et al 2014 based on the sigma coordinate 4 2 numerical experiments the exact shoaling gradient in fig 2 describes the relative amplitude change for propagation of regular waves from deep to shallow water at a given water depth parameter kd positive and negative values indicate increasing and decreasing amplitude of waves propagating up slope the shoaling gradient is close to zero in deep water with a negligible downward trend to 0 01 at k d 4 3 this is followed by a more rapid decrease to 0 1 at k d 2 03 before increasing back to zero at k d 1 2 propagation into shallower water is accompanied by an increasing shoaling gradient reaching 0 25 at k d 0 the shoaling gradient of the multi layer models converges to the exact solution as more and more layers are introduced approximation errors still exist for a finite number of layers and the effects on the wave amplitude are cumulative across the range of depth parameters as already depicted in fig 4 we select the one layer and two layer models which have distinct patterns of the shoaling gradient in relation to the exact solution to illustrate the evolution of the errors in the wave amplitude from deep to shallow water results from the three layer model which has a similar trend of shoaling gradient to the two layer model are also included to illustrate the rapid convergence of the solution the numerical experiments involve a 95 m long flume with a 1 slope starting at 20 m from the wave maker and terminating with a shallow flat section which includes a 5 m sponge layer at the end the regular incident waves have a 1 s period and a small amplitude of 0 05 cm to eliminate nonlinear effects for investigation of the linear shoaling property a grid size of 0 01 m and a time step of 0 001 s are utilized to minimize numerical effects bai and cheung 2016 the first numerical experiment examines wave propagation from k d 3 to 0 5 the dispersion relation from airy wave theory gives a water depth of 0 742 m for the incident waves and 0 058 m over the shallow flat section at the end of the flume fig 5 a demonstrates evolution of the amplitude errors and convergence of the normalized wave amplitudes over the slope in relation to airy wave theory the one layer model which underestimates the shoaling gradient in the negative range shows a decreasing trend of the amplitude over the slope from x 20 to 48 25 m the water depth at x 48 25 m corresponds to k d 1 2 where the shoaling gradient transitions from negative to positive and the model underestimates the amplitude from airy wave theory by 37 further propagation over the slope leads to growing of the wave amplitude with an increasing rate despite a slight overestimation of the amplitude growth from k d 1 2 to 0 5 the resulting amplitude is 35 lower compared with airy wave theory due to the errors accumulated during the earlier shoaling process because of the considerable errors for kd 1 2 application of the one layer model should be limited to relatively long waves such as tsunamis and storm surge yamazaki et al 2009 2011 li et al 2014 bai et al 2015 in contrast to the one layer model the two layer model consistently overestimates the shoaling gradient throughout the propagation the positive shoaling gradient in the model leads to a very subtle increase of the wave amplitude from x 20 to 27 5 m where the range of kd from 3 0 to 2 5 in theory belongs to the initial shoaling process characterized by declining amplitude the amplitude then decreases within the range of negative shoaling gradients to a minimum at x 45 4 m with kd 1 3 but the delay in the initial shoaling process leads to overestimation of the wave amplitude after the minimum the wave amplitude increases in accordance to the positive shoaling gradient well conformed with the exact solution even outside the zone of active wave transformation the shoaling errors accumulate through the propagation process and result in 12 higher amplitude at the shallow flat in comparison with airy wave theory the improved description of the shoaling gradient by the two layer model for kd 1 2 noticeably reduces the absolute error over the full range of water depth parameters down to k d 0 5 the improvement of the shoaling gradient from the two to three layer models which is most evident for kd 2 leads to a smaller amplitude overestimation of 5 at the shallow flat in comparison to airy wave theory the two and three layer models have increasing shoaling errors into deep water where the actual process is expected to be negligible although the shoaling gradient 17 is scaled by the factor d a which exaggerates the rate by the water depth we conduct a second numerical experiment with kd extended to 4 to investigate the effects of the error from deep water the 1 slope now extends from x 20 to 74 m and the water depth decreases from 1 to 0 058 m while the incident wave conditions and modeling settings remain the same in fig 5 b the two layer model produces 4 and 20 higher amplitude over the shallow flat compared to the first numerical experiment and airy wave theory a closer examination reveals modulation of the amplitude along the slope the large initial positive shoaling gradient leads to a more obvious amplitude increase to a local maximum at x 40 m with k d 2 6 as the waves continue to propagate onshore the amplitude begins to decrease until it reaches a local minimum at x 60 5 m with k d 1 3 before the final increase toward shallow water since the first and second numerical experiments involve the same shoaling process from k d 3 to 0 5 the higher amplitude at k d 0 5 in the latter is attributed to the errors from k d 4 to 3 the wave amplitude from the three layer model follows the same modulation pattern but provides a better approximation of the shoaling process resulting in 3 and 9 overestimations over the shallow flat in comparison to the first numerical experiment and airy wave theory the one layer model is way outside its applicable range and the large negative shoaling gradient in deep water leads to substantial underestimation of the wave amplitude by 62 the numerical experiments are conducted with small amplitude waves on a gentle slope for comparison with the analytical solutions of the shoaling gradient which provides leading order approximations of the shoaling process from the linearized multi layer model and airy wave theory the results demonstrate accumulation of errors through the shoaling process and convergence with increasing number of layers in good agreement with the analytical solutions the shoaling gradient serves as a starting point for assessment of fundamental wave properties in model development and practical application nonlinear and high order bottom slope terms which are implicit in the numerical model also play an important role in modifying the shoaling process of finite amplitude waves on a steep slope 5 conclusions numerical models need to properly account for shoaling over the full range of the water depth parameter kd in determining the nearshore wave amplitude the linear shoaling gradient which has served as an important metric for this property allows examination of multi layer non hyrostatic models for coastal wave transformation conversion of the governing equations of the layer integrated system to boussinesq form reveals terms involving the bottom slope that are responsible for the shoaling process the structure of the governing equations which already include coupling among the layers is distinct from that of conventional multi layer boussinesq type models we extend the derivation of the shoaling gradient to multi layer non hydrostatic models and provide examples with up to ten layers for comparison with the exact solution from airy wave theory analysis of the shoaling gradient reveals the scalability and convergence of an n layer non hydrostatic model in describing coastal wave transformation over a kd range the shoaling gradient follows a 4 2 expansion which is literally a quadratic function for the one layer model the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion for models with two or more layers can be represented by a taylor series about k d 0 all models follow closely the exact solution in shallow water the one layer model provides a good approximation up to k d 1 2 and underestimates the shoaling gradient in the negative range into deep water this convergence pattern limits the application to relatively long waves models with two or more layers can closely approximate the exact solution up to k d 2 and give varying overestimation into deep water as more and more layers are introduced the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion as well as the coefficients of its taylor series form converge to the exact solution over an increasing kd range a series of numerical experiments illustrate the manifestation of the shoaling errors in propagation of small amplitude waves from deep to shallow water underestimation of the shoaling gradient by the one layer model leads to excessive attenuation of the amplitude as waves propagate into intermediate depth and offsets the subsequent amplitude increase toward the shallow water models with two or more layers overestimate the shoaling gradient and produce nonphysical increase of the wave amplitude even in deep water where the shoaling process is expected to be negligible these shoaling errors are cumulative with noticeable effects on the predicted wave amplitude in shallow water the effects could be exacerbated with large amplitude waves when the nonlinearity becomes significant the computed shoaling gradient or its integrated form in figs 2 and 4 provides a baseline for selection of the number of layers for modeling of coastal waves over a prescribed range of water depth parameters acknowledgments this paper describes results from

24140,the capability to describe shoaling over sloping bottom is fundamental to modeling of coastal wave transformation the linear shoaling gradient provides a metric to measure this property in non hydrostatic models with layer integrated formulations the governing equations in boussinesq form facilitate derivation of the linear shoaling gradient which is in the form of a 2 p 2 2 p expansion of the water depth parameter kd with p equal to 1 for a one layer model and 4 n 4 for an n layer model the expansion reproduces the analytical solution from airy wave theory at the shallow water limit and maintains a reasonable approximation up to kd 1 2 and 2 for the one and two layer models additional layers provide rapid and monotonic convergence of the shoaling gradient into deep water numerical experiments of wave propagation over a plane slope illustrate manifestation of the shoaling errors through the transformation processes from deep to shallow water even though outside the zone of active wave transformation shoaling errors from deep to intermediate water are cumulative to produce appreciable impact to the wave amplitude in shallow water keywords multi layer model non hydrostatic model free surface flow wave shoaling shoaling gradient 1 introduction shoaling is a fundamental process in the transformation of ocean surface waves from deep to shallow water the wave amplitude varies with water depth to maintain the energy flux and the resulting nearshore wave pattern has profound influence on the surf zone processes recent advances in boussinesq type and non hydrostatic models have enabled detailed description of coastal wave processes for scientific research and engineering application the linear shoaling gradient which provides a quantitative measure of the wave amplitude variation over a constant slope has been an important metric for assessment of wave models the shoaling gradient determined exactly from airy wave theory has served as a benchmark in formulation of boussinesq type models and assessment of their performance schäffer and madsen 1995 proposed a procedure to compute the shoaling gradient for a boussinesq type model and employed the exact solution to optimize model performance follow on studies with similar strategies include placement of the velocity variable at a number of positions over the water column resulting in a series of boussinesq type formulations and selection of coefficients from expansions of the velocity variables in a highly dispersive model madsen and schäffer 1998 madsen et al 2002 madsen et al 2006 subsequently devised guidelines for the optimal level of expansion and demonstrated the linear shoaling envelope for wave transformation across a wide range water depth parameters donahue et al 2015 alternatively optimized the basis functions of a boussinesq scaled wave model to achieve improved performance in terms of the shoaling gradient an additional layer in a boussinesq type model can improve the shoaling property without utilizing high order terms in the governing equations lynett and liu 2004 derived the shoaling gradient for a two layer model and examined the property in terms of the layer thickness and placement of velocity variables the two sets of governing equations are connected at the interface to ensure continuity of the velocity profile to a desired degree of accuracy in a two layer framework chazel et al 2009 optimized the shoaling property of a low order boussinesq type model well into the deep water range simarro et al 2013 studied the linear shoaling property of low order formulations and proposed a set of bilayer equations to enhance the performance in terms of wave shoaling liu and fang 2016 optimized the placement of velocity variables and their connections between the two layers the optimized model achieves good agreement with the exact shoaling gradient in extremely deep water the non hydrostatic approach is gaining popularity in studies of coastal wave processes owing to the relatively simple and scalable numerical framework involving governing equations with up to first order derivatives bai and cheung 2012 2013a converted a one layer and a two layer non hydrostatic model into boussinesq form and presented the corresponding shoaling gradients for comparison with the exact solution determined from airy wave theory multi layer models have been applied to describe wave transformation over irregular bathymetry and depth induced wave breaking and surf zone processes for the detailed flow kinematics ai et al 2011 ma et al 2012 smit et al 2013 2014 zijlema et al 2011 the performance of models with three or more layers in shoaling which is crucial in determining the wave amplitude before breaking has not been examined in this paper we derive the linear shoaling gradient for layer integrated models and examine its convergence with respect to the exact solution a series of numerical experiments with a plane slope assist interpretation of the shoaling gradient and demonstrate effects of its error in wave transformation from deep to shallow water 2 governing equations consider a two dimensional free surface flow over a varying bottom as shown in fig 1 in the cartesian coordinate system x z the variables d and ζ denote the water depth and surface elevation and h ζ d is the flow depth the water column is divided into n layers with indices i 1 n from the bottom to the surface the layer thickness hi varies in space and time but the layer ratio defined by 1 r i h i h remains constant this provides the elevation for each of the n 1 interfaces at 2 z i j 1 i r j h d for the formulation of the multi layer system bai and cheung 2013b described the theoretical framework of a multi layer non hydrostatic model for free surface flow the use of the dispersion parameter μ and nonlinear parameter ϵ which denote the depth to wavelength and amplitude to depth ratios illustrates the structure of the governing equations and facilitates derivations of linear and nonlinear wave properties the flow depth in the non dimensional form becomes h ϵ ζ d the keller box scheme defines the layout and approximation of the evolution

interface the velocity variables in the layer integrated governing equations 3 5 are interconnected at the internal and external boundaries the horizontal velocity component u z i at the interface is approximated as 6 u z i 1 2 u i u i 1 the vertical velocity component w z i should be distinguished from the vertical velocity of the interface and their difference gives the net flow as 7 δ w z i w z

vertical velocity at the interface the dynamic boundary condition 11 q ζ 0 ensures the non hydrostatic pressure vanishes at the free surface the formulation of the multi layer system provides the numerical framework for implementation in model development conversion of the governing equations into boussinesq form facilitates derivation of analytical expressions for linear and nonlinear wave properties bai and cheung 2013b summation of the continuity equation 3 from i 1 n and application of the kinematic boundary conditions 8 and 9 give the continuity equation 12 ζ t x i 1 n h i u i 0 the vertical velocity and non hydrostatic pressure in the momentum equation 5 are expressed in terms of ζ and ui for conversion into boussinesq form the vertical velocity at the interface w z i can be sequentially derived from the layer integrated continuity equation 3 starting from the bottom layer with the kinematic boundary condition 9 and ending with the top layer closed by the free surface boundary condition 8 substitution of w z i into eqs 10 and 7 gives rise to the layer integrated vertical velocity wi and the net vertical velocity δ w z i across the interface the vertical velocity terms in turn provide the non hydrostatic pressure q z i through the vertical momentum equation 5 and the dynamic boundary condition 11 substitution of δ w z i and q z i into the layer integrated horizontal momentum equation 4 gives n momentum equations which together with the depth integrated continuity equation 12 form the complete set of governing equations containing ζ and ui as the evolution variables the multi layer non hydrostatic system in boussinesq form possesses identical wave properties as the original system we consider equal layer thickness with r i 1 n to illustrate the overall convergence pattern the derivation of the shoaling gradient requires the linearized governing equations containing first order bottom slope terms after dropping the nonlinear terms denoted by ϵ and high order bottom slope terms in the form 2 d x 2 and d x 2 we have the depth integrated continuity equation and n layer integrated momentum equations in the form 13 ζ t d n i 1 n u i x 1 n d

cheung 2015 is symmetric and positive definite but the shoaling coefficient matrix bij is neither symmetric nor positive definite denoted by μ 2 in the momentum equations the third order terms define the dispersion property in the non hydrostatic system terms with the first order bottom slope d x which appears in both the continuity and momentum equations accounts for the shoaling process and its effects on dispersion the number of dispersion and shoaling terms increases with n to improve the propagation and shoaling processes without changing the order of the derivatives 3 shoaling gradient the group velocity closely related to the celerity describes the shoaling process through conservation of energy flux madsen and sørensen 1992 introduced the linear shoaling gradient γ to evaluate model effectiveness in describing the variation of wave amplitude a over a gentle bottom slope through the relation 17 1 a a x γ d d x they utilized airy wave theory in conjunction with conservation

10 the shoaling gradient represents the ratio of the amplitude gradient and bottom slope a positive γairy on an ascending slope d x 0 indicates increasing wave amplitude or vice verse the shoaling gradient converges to 1 4 and zero as kd 0 and respectively schäffer and madsen 1995 developed a procedure to derive the shoaling gradient for boussinesq type equations we adapt their procedure for the boussinesq form of the multi layer non hydrostatic system to evaluate the wave property for direct comparison with the exact solution 18 and its taylor series expansion 19 for wave shoaling on a plane slope the angular frequency ω remains constant while the wave number k x varies with water depth the surface elevation and the horizontal velocity of an n layer model can be expressed as 20 ζ x t a x e i ω t k x d x 21 u l x t u l r i u l i e i ω t k x d x l 1 n where the subscripts r and i indicate the real and imaginary parts of the velocity variable the system is governed by the continuity equation 13 integrated over the water column and the momentum equation 14 for each of the n layers this is different from the boussinesq type equations with multiple layers each of which has its own continuity and momentum equations that must be connected with an additional condition at the layer interface lynett and liu 2004 the present governing equations already include the coupling across the layered flow structure for direct derivation of the shoaling gradient substitution of the shoaling wave system 20 and 21 into the momentum equation 14 yields n complex algebraic equations after dropping the gradient terms the real part comprises n equations in terms of ulr and in matrix form reads 22 μ 2 k 2 d 2 ω a l m 4 n 2 ω σ l m n n u m r n 1 4 n 2 a k n 1 l m 1 n where the subscripts n n and n 1 denote the size of the respective matrix and vectors and σlm is an identity matrix defined as 23 σ l m 1 if l m 0 if l m the real part of the velocity variables can be solved directly from the equation set 22 in terms of the dispersion coefficients aij from eq 15 collection of the imaginary part from the n complex algebraic equations with up to first order gradient

the velocity ulr uli obtained from eqs 22 and 24 is a function of the water depth parameter kd bed slope d x and wave amplitude gradient a x along with the angular frequency ω and wave number gradient k x both of which can be expressed in terms of kd the angular frequency ω in non dimensional form can be derived from the dispersion relation of the multi layer system as 25 ω k d 1 i 1 n 1 ϕ i k d 2 i 1 i 1 n ψ i k d 2 i 1 2 where the coefficients ϕi and ψi are given by bai and cheung 2015 since the angular frequency does not vary in the linear shoaling process the wave number gradient k x can be obtained from ω x 0 the continuity equation 13 provides a linkage between the real and imaginary parts of the velocity derived from the momentum equation 14 substitution of the shoaling wave system 20 and 21 into the continuity equation and collection of the real part yield 26 d x l 1 n u l r d l 1 n u l r x k d l 1 n u l i 0 rearrangement of eq 26 in the form of 17 with a x and d x gives the shoaling gradient for the multi layer non hydrostatic system as a function of kd appendices a c provide the detailed derivations for models with up to three layers as demonstration of the procedures the shoaling gradient takes the form of a rational function in which the numerator and denominator are polynomials of the water depth parameter kd the degrees of the polynomials define the structure of the shoaling gradient and constrain its behavior in limiting conditions an n layer model gives rise to a 2 p 2 2 p expansion in the form 27 γ n 1 i 1 p 1 β i k d 2 i 4 i 1 p α i k d 2 i where αi and βi are rational coefficients and the integer p associated with the degree is defined as 28 p 1 if n 1 4 n 4 if n 1 the constants 1 and 4 in the numerator and denominator of the expansion 27 guarantee convergence to the analytical solution 18 when kd 0 the polynomial in the numerator is always two degrees higher than that in the denominator the unsymmetrical structure reflects the approximation of the velocity profile in the vertical direction forcing the shoaling gradient to infinity as k d while the analytical solution goes to zero the degree increases by eight for each additional layer with the exception from one to two as indicated by the conditional definition of p this implies the one layer model possesses distinctive shoaling properties from models with two or more layers 4 results and discussion the shoaling gradient 27 is evaluated for models with increasing number of layers to demonstrate the convergence with respect to the exact solution 18 as well as its taylor series expansion 19 integration of the shoaling gradient provides an indication of error accumulation for wave propagation from a given water depth to the shore a series of numerical experiments illustrate evolution of the amplitude error as waves propagate over a slope from deep to shallow water 4 1 analytical expressions we follow the general procedures in section 3 to compute the coefficients αi and βi in eq 27 and examine the characteristics of the shoaling gradient from deep to shallow water the one layer model gives a 4 2 expansion in the form 29 γ 1 1 1 2 k d 2 3 16 k d 4 4 k d 2 which can be rewritten without approximation as 30 γ 1 1 4 3 16 k d 2 when comparing with the taylor series expansion 19 of the exact shoaling gradient the one layer model retains the first term to guarantee convergence at the shallow water limit but a coefficient of 3 16 instead of 1 4 for the second term indicates the convergence is not asymptotic to the order of kd 2 the shoaling gradient follows a 8 n 6 8 n 8 rational function expansion for models with two or more layers for illustration the shoaling gradients of the two and three layer models read 31 γ 2 1 0 69 k d

coefficients of the rational functions are rounded to three digits to illustrate the structure of the expansion see appendix d for the shoaling gradients with four to 10 layers their values rapidly diminish with increasing order of kd resulting in a gradual variation of the shoaling gradient from deep to shallow water different from the one layer model the taylor series expansions of the rational functions 31 and 32 contain an infinite number of terms 33 γ 2 1 4 15 64 k d 2 11 256 k d 4 13 4096 k d 6 129 65536 k d 8 o k d 10 34 γ 3 1 4 35 144 k d 2 73 1458 k d 4 401 157464 k d 6 15749 5668704 k d 8 o k d 10 where the coefficients are computed without rounding as the number of layers increases the coefficients converge progressively from low to high order to the respective values in the taylor series expansion 19 of the exact solution in contrast the shoaling gradient of a boussineq type model contains a truncated taylor series expansion of the exact solution kennedy et al 2002 the number of terms increases with the order of approximation in the governing equations fig 2 compares the exact shoaling gradient 18 from airy wave theory with models of up to 10 layers the one layer model gives slight overestimation in shallow water primarily due to the coefficient of 3 16 versus 1 4 from the taylor series expansion 19 but follows the downward trend of the other models and the exact solution up to kd 1 2 the use of the same layer integrated horizontal velocity in the approximation of the kinematic free surface and bottom boundary conditions 8 and 9 limits the application in relatively shallow water the 4 2 expansion is literally a quadratic function as indicated by eq 30 with a monotonic decrease for large values of kd models with two or more layers which allow distinct velocities at the surface and the bottom produce a more robust convergence pattern defined by the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion for the full range of water depth parameters their shoaling gradients closely follow the exact solution toward the minimum value of 0 1 at kd 2 and reproduce the upward trend into deeper water albeit with overestimation as the number of layer increases the multi layer solution approaches the exact solution asymptotically and provides a good representation of the shoaling process for coastal wave transformation a quantitative measure of the shoaling error is useful for practical application fig 3 shows the absolute error γ n γ a i r y of the shoaling gradient with respect to the exact solution two ranges of water depth parameters 0 kd 10 and 0 kd 3 are selected to more clearly depict the variation of the errors among the models the one layer model overestimates the shoaling gradient by as much as 0 018 at k d 0 75 the overestimation in the range of 0 kd 1 075 where wave shoaling actively modifies the amplitude has significant implications for coastal wave transformation the shoaling gradient becomes negative for kd 1 075 and its increasing error in the negative range would lead to excessive reduction of the incident wave amplitude from deep water the two layer model also overestimates the shoaling gradient with a local peak at kd 0 9 the error decreases to a local minimum at kd 1 5 before increasing monotonically toward deep water as the number of layers increases the error diminishes rapidly while following the same pattern the positive error from deep to shallow water always results in overestimation of the wave amplitude by models with two or more layers integration of the shoaling gradient from a specific water depth parameter to shallow water provides a way to quantify the overall amplitude error during the shoaling process based on chen and liu 1995 we establish the error metric in relation to airy wave theory in the form 35 a i a a i r y e x p 0 k d γ i γ a i r y k 0 d d k 0 d 1 where k 0 d is a dumpy integration variable fig 4 shows the integrated relative error for models with one to ten layers the one layer model overestimates the shallow water wave amplitude by up to 1 8 when implemented to describe wave shoaling within the range of 0 kd 1 55 while producing underestimations for kd 1 55 due to dominance of the negative error models with two and more layers always overestimate the shallow water wave amplitude regardless the offshore water depth for a 1 error cap the offshore boundary can be implemented at up to kd 2 2 2 6 3 1 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 and 6 1 for the two to 10 layer models respectively the use of equal thickness layers in the present study demonstrates the general convergence and error patterns of the models with layer integrated formulations the results provide general guidance for selection of the number of layers that can provide accurate results for a specific application over a kd range reduction of the layer thickness toward the free surface can better resolve deep water wave kinematics and will likely improve the shoaling gradient for large values of kd while retaining the same number of layers the expansion order and convergence pattern which reflect the treatment of the evolution variables over the water column by the keller box scheme stelling and zijlema 2003 will be different from other multi layer formulations such as ma et al 2012 and zhu et al 2014 based on the sigma coordinate 4 2 numerical experiments the exact shoaling gradient in fig 2 describes the relative amplitude change for propagation of regular waves from deep to shallow water at a given water depth parameter kd positive and negative values indicate increasing and decreasing amplitude of waves propagating up slope the shoaling gradient is close to zero in deep water with a negligible downward trend to 0 01 at k d 4 3 this is followed by a more rapid decrease to 0 1 at k d 2 03 before increasing back to zero at k d 1 2 propagation into shallower water is accompanied by an increasing shoaling gradient reaching 0 25 at k d 0 the shoaling gradient of the multi layer models converges to the exact solution as more and more layers are introduced approximation errors still exist for a finite number of layers and the effects on the wave amplitude are cumulative across the range of depth parameters as already depicted in fig 4 we select the one layer and two layer models which have distinct patterns of the shoaling gradient in relation to the exact solution to illustrate the evolution of the errors in the wave amplitude from deep to shallow water results from the three layer model which has a similar trend of shoaling gradient to the two layer model are also included to illustrate the rapid convergence of the solution the numerical experiments involve a 95 m long flume with a 1 slope starting at 20 m from the wave maker and terminating with a shallow flat section which includes a 5 m sponge layer at the end the regular incident waves have a 1 s period and a small amplitude of 0 05 cm to eliminate nonlinear effects for investigation of the linear shoaling property a grid size of 0 01 m and a time step of 0 001 s are utilized to minimize numerical effects bai and cheung 2016 the first numerical experiment examines wave propagation from k d 3 to 0 5 the dispersion relation from airy wave theory gives a water depth of 0 742 m for the incident waves and 0 058 m over the shallow flat section at the end of the flume fig 5 a demonstrates evolution of the amplitude errors and convergence of the normalized wave amplitudes over the slope in relation to airy wave theory the one layer model which underestimates the shoaling gradient in the negative range shows a decreasing trend of the amplitude over the slope from x 20 to 48 25 m the water depth at x 48 25 m corresponds to k d 1 2 where the shoaling gradient transitions from negative to positive and the model underestimates the amplitude from airy wave theory by 37 further propagation over the slope leads to growing of the wave amplitude with an increasing rate despite a slight overestimation of the amplitude growth from k d 1 2 to 0 5 the resulting amplitude is 35 lower compared with airy wave theory due to the errors accumulated during the earlier shoaling process because of the considerable errors for kd 1 2 application of the one layer model should be limited to relatively long waves such as tsunamis and storm surge yamazaki et al 2009 2011 li et al 2014 bai et al 2015 in contrast to the one layer model the two layer model consistently overestimates the shoaling gradient throughout the propagation the positive shoaling gradient in the model leads to a very subtle increase of the wave amplitude from x 20 to 27 5 m where the range of kd from 3 0 to 2 5 in theory belongs to the initial shoaling process characterized by declining amplitude the amplitude then decreases within the range of negative shoaling gradients to a minimum at x 45 4 m with kd 1 3 but the delay in the initial shoaling process leads to overestimation of the wave amplitude after the minimum the wave amplitude increases in accordance to the positive shoaling gradient well conformed with the exact solution even outside the zone of active wave transformation the shoaling errors accumulate through the propagation process and result in 12 higher amplitude at the shallow flat in comparison with airy wave theory the improved description of the shoaling gradient by the two layer model for kd 1 2 noticeably reduces the absolute error over the full range of water depth parameters down to k d 0 5 the improvement of the shoaling gradient from the two to three layer models which is most evident for kd 2 leads to a smaller amplitude overestimation of 5 at the shallow flat in comparison to airy wave theory the two and three layer models have increasing shoaling errors into deep water where the actual process is expected to be negligible although the shoaling gradient 17 is scaled by the factor d a which exaggerates the rate by the water depth we conduct a second numerical experiment with kd extended to 4 to investigate the effects of the error from deep water the 1 slope now extends from x 20 to 74 m and the water depth decreases from 1 to 0 058 m while the incident wave conditions and modeling settings remain the same in fig 5 b the two layer model produces 4 and 20 higher amplitude over the shallow flat compared to the first numerical experiment and airy wave theory a closer examination reveals modulation of the amplitude along the slope the large initial positive shoaling gradient leads to a more obvious amplitude increase to a local maximum at x 40 m with k d 2 6 as the waves continue to propagate onshore the amplitude begins to decrease until it reaches a local minimum at x 60 5 m with k d 1 3 before the final increase toward shallow water since the first and second numerical experiments involve the same shoaling process from k d 3 to 0 5 the higher amplitude at k d 0 5 in the latter is attributed to the errors from k d 4 to 3 the wave amplitude from the three layer model follows the same modulation pattern but provides a better approximation of the shoaling process resulting in 3 and 9 overestimations over the shallow flat in comparison to the first numerical experiment and airy wave theory the one layer model is way outside its applicable range and the large negative shoaling gradient in deep water leads to substantial underestimation of the wave amplitude by 62 the numerical experiments are conducted with small amplitude waves on a gentle slope for comparison with the analytical solutions of the shoaling gradient which provides leading order approximations of the shoaling process from the linearized multi layer model and airy wave theory the results demonstrate accumulation of errors through the shoaling process and convergence with increasing number of layers in good agreement with the analytical solutions the shoaling gradient serves as a starting point for assessment of fundamental wave properties in model development and practical application nonlinear and high order bottom slope terms which are implicit in the numerical model also play an important role in modifying the shoaling process of finite amplitude waves on a steep slope 5 conclusions numerical models need to properly account for shoaling over the full range of the water depth parameter kd in determining the nearshore wave amplitude the linear shoaling gradient which has served as an important metric for this property allows examination of multi layer non hyrostatic models for coastal wave transformation conversion of the governing equations of the layer integrated system to boussinesq form reveals terms involving the bottom slope that are responsible for the shoaling process the structure of the governing equations which already include coupling among the layers is distinct from that of conventional multi layer boussinesq type models we extend the derivation of the shoaling gradient to multi layer non hydrostatic models and provide examples with up to ten layers for comparison with the exact solution from airy wave theory analysis of the shoaling gradient reveals the scalability and convergence of an n layer non hydrostatic model in describing coastal wave transformation over a kd range the shoaling gradient follows a 4 2 expansion which is literally a quadratic function for the one layer model the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion for models with two or more layers can be represented by a taylor series about k d 0 all models follow closely the exact solution in shallow water the one layer model provides a good approximation up to k d 1 2 and underestimates the shoaling gradient in the negative range into deep water this convergence pattern limits the application to relatively long waves models with two or more layers can closely approximate the exact solution up to k d 2 and give varying overestimation into deep water as more and more layers are introduced the 8 n 6 8 n 8 expansion as well as the coefficients of its taylor series form converge to the exact solution over an increasing kd range a series of numerical experiments illustrate the manifestation of the shoaling errors in propagation of small amplitude waves from deep to shallow water underestimation of the shoaling gradient by the one layer model leads to excessive attenuation of the amplitude as waves propagate into intermediate depth and offsets the subsequent amplitude increase toward the shallow water models with two or more layers overestimate the shoaling gradient and produce nonphysical increase of the wave amplitude even in deep water where the shoaling process is expected to be negligible these shoaling errors are cumulative with noticeable effects on the predicted wave amplitude in shallow water the effects could be exacerbated with large amplitude waves when the nonlinearity becomes significant the computed shoaling gradient or its integrated form in figs 2 and 4 provides a baseline for selection of the number of layers for modeling of coastal waves over a prescribed range of water depth parameters acknowledgments this paper describes results from

24141,terrestrial ecosystem models are driven by climate data which often have daily monthly and seasonal resolutions but few have examined the effects of different temporal resolutions of climate data on modeled vegetation change in this study we investigated the effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on simulated tree species biomass in a temperate forest region of northeast china we conducted the study by using the linkages terrestrial ecosystem model to quantify the relative importance of climate data resolutions daily monthly and seasonal and interspecific competition on predicted tree species biomass from short term 40 years to long term 70 100 years simulations results showed that simulated tree species biomass was sensitive to daily monthly and seasonal climate data the difference in the simulated biomass based on daily vs monthly climate data was not significant for tree species monocultures suggesting that monthly climate data can be used as a surrogate for daily climate data in such simulations however interspecific competition amplifies the differences in biomass simulations under daily and monthly climate data thus increasing prediction uncertainties in mixed species systems results based on climate data at the seasonal resolution showed the greatest departure from the daily and monthly climate data because averaging climate data over a season may result in unrealistic climate estimates for modeling tree biomass growth simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species was highest when using climate data at the daily resolution followed by monthly and seasonal climate data the opposite pattern was true for shade tolerant tree species at the early stages of simulated tree growth inter tree competition was a more important factor affecting the biomass of late successional shade tolerant tree species while different temporal resolutions of climate data were more important for early and mid successional species this trend reverses at the late stages of stand development these results can help guide choosing climate input of terrestrial ecosystem models and aiding results interpretation keywords terrestrial ecosystem model climate data resolutions daily monthly seasonal interspecific competition tree species monocultures mixed species systems linkages model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystem models include physiological vegetation responses in simulating changes of forest composition and structure as well as tree species distributions scheiter and higgins 2009 el masri et al 2019 these models are typically driven by climate data which may have temporal resolutions of climate data from hourly to daily monthly or yearly chiesi et al 2007 de bruijn et al 2014 restrepo coupe et al 2017 while predictions by terrestrial ecosystem models have used different temporal resolutions of climate data few have included or directly compared estimates based on different temporal resolutions of climate data liu et al 2018 however studies have reported that models of tree physiological processes such as photosynthesis are sensitive to temporal resolutions of climate data tang et al 2005 gu et al 2015 jevšenak 2019 previous analyses have suggested that higher temporal resolutions of climate data e g daily reveal greater detail in tree ring studies jevšenak 2019 thomte et al 2020 because the response of trees to extreme climate events such as heat waves or extremes in precipitation may be averaged out of climate data recorded at low resolutions thomte et al 2020 extreme climate events can have strong impacts on physiological processes in some cases reyer et al 2013 feng et al 2018 also prior studies reported differences between simulated and observed ecosystem change were greater when climate data were at lower resolutions e g annual seasonal wang et al 2011 2012 santaren et al 2014 while plant photosynthesis respiration and transpiration vary at fine time scales e g seconds cerullo et al 2007 it is unfeasible to conduct all simulations at the finest resolutions possible due to the limits of data availability the models intended purpose model complexity and computational capacity hanson et al 2004 harrison et al 2021 irauschek et al 2021 if results simulated using climate data at one resolution are related to or transferable to other resolutions predictions using climate data at a given resolution would be more widely applicable to other resolutions determining this requires a systematic comparison of simulation results for terrestrial ecosystem models using daily monthly and seasonal climate data and simulation scenarios that span multiple timeframes e g a few decades to a century predictions for individual species may differ when terrestrial ecosystem models are applied to estimate net ecosystem exchange nee or net primary production npp at different temporal resolutions of climate data hourly daily monthly hanson et al 2004 and the outcomes may be particularly complex when interspecific competition is also considered averaging fine resolution of climate data e g daily to coarser resolutions e g seasonal or monthly boulanger et al 2022 can make separating species level responses and interactions difficult clark et al 2011 gustafson et al 2017 jevšenak and levanič 2018 for example high temperatures and water shortages may reduce photosynthesis of shade tolerant species more than shade intolerant competitors noormets et al 2008 and inhibit their growth kubiske and abrams 1994 thus shade tolerant species would have fewer competitive advantages in this circumstance mcdowell et al 2013 gustafson et al 2016 however if climate extremes e g droughts or heat waves castagneri et al 2015 are averaged out when using coarse resolutions of climate data e g using monthly or seasonal climate data rather than daily climate data this could in turn obscure the limiting climate conditions that would otherwise reduce the modeled growth of shade tolerant plants under unfavorable climate conditions therefore it is important to understand how different temporal resolutions of climate data can amplify or diminish the effects of interspecific competition plant competition is typically at the individual species level clark et al 2010 2011 and plays a crucial role in ecosystem dynamics scheiter et al 2013 weng et al 2015 most terrestrial ecosystem models use plant functional types pft e g broadleaf evergreen and mixed to simulate vegetation

et al 2009 zhu et al 2015 melton and arora 2016 and even using specified fractional coverage of pfts li and arora 2012 melton and arora 2014 however the pft modeling approach is designed for coarse

adequately capture interspecific competition in this study we investigate the effect of climate data at three resolutions daily monthly seasonal on the simulated forest biomass estimates from a terrestrial ecosystem model specifically we i investigate the outcomes of species monocultures and of multi species scenarios to reveal the effects of tree competition ii examine whether the effects diminish or amplify with short medium or long term simulation periods and iii quantify the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and interspecific competition in terrestrial ecosystem model simulation we use the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages 3 0 dijak et al 2017 to simulate individual tree species dynamics and above ground biomass in the xiaoxing an mountains for the next 100 years under current climate conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate data the xiaoxing an mountains are the major temperate forest region in china with dense forests comprised of a wide variety of tree species and forest types forest types in the south are mainly korean pine spruce fir and hardwood forests forest types in the north include larch forests birch forests and small portions of mixed coniferous and mixed hardwood forests the region is in the middle to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere where climate change is significant the annual temperature in the region varies with the mean annual temperature roughly between 1 c in the north and 1 c in the south the mean annual precipitation is between 550 and 650 mm the study area is in the middle and southern part of the xiaoxing an mountains with an area of about 1 5 million ha containing eight forestry bureaus and the fenglin national nature reserve located between 127 50 130 10 e and 47 05 49 10 n fig 1 the main tree species include korean pine pinus koraiensis spruce picea spp fir abies nephrolepis larch larix gmelinii elm ulmus spp walnut juglans mandshurica cork tree

platyphylla and aspen populus davidiana we included those 15 species in this study we conducted the study using the observed climate scenario for the period 1980 to 2010 the climate data for that period were derived from the historical records of the region s meteorology stations including daily temperature minimum and maximum and precipitation mean wind speeds were obtained from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn daily mean radiation data were obtained from a dataset of 716 meteorological stations in china shared by the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center http data tpdc ac cn we performed quality control on the data including missing value imputation and erroneous value identification to remove illogical numbers e g negative precipitation the processed daily climate data were aggregated into monthly averages and seasonal averages for the study area 2 2 method overview we used a terrestrial ecosystem model linkages 3 0 dijak et al 2017 to estimate tree species biomass based on daily monthly and seasonal resolutions of climate data we did this for monocultures without interspecific competition and repeated it for mixed species systems with interspecific competition thus the study has six scenarios table 3 for the monocultures we simulated only one of the 15 tree species at a time for the mixed species scenario we simulated all 15 species simultaneously to examine the short medium and long term effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on the modeled individual tree species biomass we analyzed the simulation outcomes at years 40 70 and 100 respectively we designed a 2 with and without interspecific competition 3 daily monthly and seasonal climate data factorial experiment to quantify the relative importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data with and without interspecific competition on simulated species biomass table 1 to account for environmental heterogeneity across our study area we stratified our study area into eight different land types based on elevation 600 m as the threshold slope orientation 90 270 for sunny slopes 0 90 and 270 360 for shaded slopes and cumulative temperature 2200 c d isotherm according to previous studies liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 to ensure an adequate number of sample plots across the heterogenous area our criteria for selecting the points takes into account mentioned environmental heterogeneity elevation and slope orientation in liang et al 2011 in total 58 plots were selected and each plot was replicated 10 times within each land type to account for variation in the climate and environment resulting in each land type having about 70 plots fig 1 2 3 linkages 3 0 and parameterization the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages 3 0 dijak et al 2017 was developed from earlier versions of the model pastor and post 1985 wullschleger et al 2003 to simulate compositional and structural dynamics of forest stands linkages 3 0 uses daily climate data as opposed to the monthly climate data used in previous versions the linkages model has seven main modules temperature tempe moisture moist decomposition decomp

biological and ecological traits including degree day maximum and minimum shade tolerance longevity and the growth parameters tables 2 3 were obtained from the scientific database of china plant species and previous applications of linkages in the region zhou et al 1994 dijak et al 2017 liu et al 2020 2 4 model simulations and data analysis we define four seasons in accordance to the template climate in our area spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter december january and february and our input monthly and seasonal climate data were averaged from daily climate data then we input daily monthly and seasonal climate data into linkages 3 0 for monocultures and mixed species forest systems based on the current climate 1980 2009 we used linkages 3 0 to simulate forest change up to 100 years from a starting point of bare ground each of the six scenarios table 4 was repeated 10 times to account for stochasticity in climate and in ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes for each scenario we analyzed the simulated outcomes in the short term 40 years mid term 40 70 years and long term 70 100 years the response variable was simulated biomass for individual species we used analysis of variance anova with least significant difference lsd methods to analyze the differences among the simulation results for the six scenarios in the short 40 year mid 70 year and long term 100 year duration of the simulation prior to this we tested the normality of the data i e whether or not the data obeyed a normal distribution using the shapiro wilk test and the chi square statistic with bartlett s sphericity test we quantified the relative importance of the resolutions of climate data the interspecific competition and their interactions on simulated above ground forest biomass using linear and logistic regression models that decompose r squared and allocate a relative share of r squared to each variable based on the shapley attribution system groemping 2006 broto et al 2020 we investigated factors that were critical for the effect of different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly seasonal and for interspecific competition based on the relaimpo package in r which calculates relative importance metrics for linear models groemping 2006 3 results 3 1 effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on monoculture systems values of simulated biomass among seasonal monthly and daily climate data were significantly different from short 40 years to long 70 100 years simulation periods table 5 simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data resolutions had no significant differences among all three simulation periods 40 years 40 70 years and 70 100 years for most species table 5 simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data captured more detailed responses of biomass change over time than did results based on climate data at a seasonal resolution fig 3 a e for basswood fig 3a spruce fig 3b and fir fig 3c biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data were higher than results for daily and monthly climate data however biomass estimates for white birch fig 3d aspen fig 3e korean pine fig 3f and mongolian oak fig 3g were lower when based on seasonal climate data than when based on monthly or daily climate data simulated biomass values based on seasonal data were markedly different from values based on monthly or daily climate data especially for mongolian oak fig 3g maple fig 3h white birch fig 3d aspen fig 3e and korean pine fig 3f simulated biomass of mongolian oak increased greatly to 116 87 mg ha and 107 48 mg ha under daily and monthly resolutions of climate data respectively while it increased to only 18 93 mg ha at year 100 for estimates based on the seasonal climate data fig 3g under the daily and monthly climate data maple biomass peaked at about year 60 and then decreased and leveled off in contrast maple biomass estimated based on seasonal climate data was consistently lower than when based on daily or monthly climate data until approximately simulation year 70 when the estimates based on seasonal climate data consistently exceeded those based on daily or monthly climate data fig 3h 3 2 effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on multi species systems with interspecific competition i e for multi species stands the simulated biomass values based on seasonal climate data were significantly different from estimates based on monthly and daily climate data for simulation periods of 40 70 and 100 years table 6 the differences between results for monthly and daily climate data were much greater than those in the no competition monoculture scenario except for korean pine fig 4 f and mongolian oak fig 5 g for basswood fig 5a spruce fig 4b and fir fig 4c results based on seasonal climate data were still higher than results for daily and monthly climate data but for white birch fig 4d aspen fig 4e korean pine fig 4f and mongolian oak fig 4g biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data were notably lower than those for monthly or daily climate data these differences were more pronounced in this simulation scenario that incorporates interspecific competition fig 4 than for scenarios based on species monocultures fig 5 unlike the monoculture scenarios that exclude effects of interspecific competition simulated biomass incorporating interspecific competition differed significantly between daily and monthly climate data starting with medium term simulations 40 70 years and increasing for long term simulations 70 100 years table 5 results based on daily climate data were mostly higher than those for monthly climate data except for spruce fig 4b and fir fig 4c simulated biomass for many individual species was much lower under the interspecific competition scenario compared to the monoculture scenario however the modeled total biomass was much higher for the averaged biomass under the no competition scenario 3 3 the relative importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal and interspecific competition for the shade tolerant or climax species such as spruce fir korean pine and maple the effects associated with interspecific competition greatly outweighed those associated with different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly seasonal fig 5 for the early successional shade intolerant species such as aspen and birch and the mid successional species such as mongolian oak and basswood the resolution of the climate data greatly outweighed effects of interspecific competition fig 5 meanwhile the relative importance of interspecific competition for shade tolerant species was greatest in the short term 40 years with importance decreasing in mid term 40 70 year and long term 70 100 year simulation periods except for maple for shade intolerant species the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data was greatest in short term simulations and decreased in the mid and long term simulations scenarios interestingly maple a shade tolerant species shares the same response as the shade intolerant species for the mid successional species e g basswood the relative importance of the climate data of resolutions was important in the short term decreased in the mid term and became most important in the long term the interaction of interspecific competition and different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal increased in importance from short term to long term simulation periods for all species except for basswood and maple fig 5 4 discussion simulated species level biomass is sensitive to the temporal resolution i e daily monthly seasonal of climate inputs the difference in the simulated biomass between the daily and monthly climate data resolutions is not significant for single species monocultures suggesting that monthly climate data can serve as a surrogate for daily climate data in such systems however the monthly climate data tends to estimate lower the biomass of early successional and drought tolerant species and estimate higher biomass for shade tolerant late successional species than daily climate data fig 2d g previous studies have shown that daily climate data are better able than monthly climate data to reveal the effects of weather fluctuations on tree growth castagneri et al 2015 jevšenak and levanič 2018 climate data at a monthly resolution inevitably allows some climatic extremes to be averaged out jevšenak and levanič 2018 thereby underestimating the effects of climate extremes such as drought or indicating better growing conditions for mesic species than are supported by the daily climate data castagneri et al 2015 jevšenak and levanič 2018 the simulated biomass based on climate data at the seasonal resolution can generally capture the overall trends in biomass dynamics over time but the simulated trajectories are highly generalized smoothed with little fluctuation in response to climate extremes fig 3g moreover biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data have the greatest differences compared to simulations based on daily or monthly climate data for some species e g white birch aspen and korean pine in fig 4 those differences are dramatic and seem unrealistic because the biomass values estimated using seasonal data are a small fraction of values estimated when using daily or monthly climate data climate data at the seasonal resolution tends to estimate higher biomass of boreal coniferous species such as spruce and fir and to estimate lower biomass of temperate species than daily climate data this is because exceptionally low temperatures that limit the growth of boreal species and exceptionally high temperatures that limit the growth of temperate species are averaged out of seasonal climate averages and no longer limiting marshall and schut 1999 stratton et al 2011 studies of species suitability and distribution have demonstrated limitation of mean climate data to predict species distributions in niche based species distribution models sdms perez navarro et al 2021 for example using mean climate data to simulate could likely result in biased results especially the species decay under extreme events which could lead to populations being mislocated outside of the ecological niche lloret and kitzberger 2018 margalef marrase et al 2020 gardner et al 2021 so models can distort the results of simulation by using mean climate data e g seasonal annual competition among species magnifies the differences of simulated tree species biomass under climate data input with varying resolutions this suggests that for most forests with mixed species simulation results would be sensitive to the temporal resolution of climate data the differences in biomass estimates for monolithic single species systems based on daily vs monthly resolution of climate data are mostly insignificant for mixed species forests those differences in estimated biomass could become significant and the already significant differences between seasonal monthly and daily climate data could become greater increasing prediction uncertainties for most tree species shade intolerant tree species such as white birch and aspen and mid shade tolerant mongolian oak require relatively more light and warmer temperatures while biomass estimates for shade tolerant tree species like spruce and fir that adapt well under wet and cold conditions are very sensitive to increases of temperature therefore climate data of seasonal resolution are inadequate for modeling biomass growth of intolerant tree species because of the low temperature and low light due to averaging but allow shade tolerant species to avoid extreme heat juday et al 2015 nicklen et al 2019 thus when using seasonal climate data for simulations shade tolerant tree species have greater competitiveness and higher biomass than shade intolerant tree species and thus are typically predicted to easily outcompete shade intolerant species with higher light and temperature requirements viereck and johnston 1990 iwata et al 2012 temperli et al 2012 in contrast biomass simulations based on daily and monthly climate data will result in an increase in simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species this is because most early successional species are opportunistic species thus climate data with fine resolutions introduces more variation in climate and thus more opportunities for these shade intolerant species to establish and grow consequently the simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species is highest for climate data at daily resolution second highest at monthly resolution and lowest at seasonal resolution while the opposite result is true for shade tolerant species fig 4 the biomass estimates of tree species based on climate data at the seasonal resolution are significantly different from those at daily and monthly resolutions of climate data the result can be analyzed the growth limiting factors of the tree species i e growth degree days gdd mean minimum temperature in january for example the growing degree days gdd uses a daily temperature threshold of 5 56 c when the daily mean temperature is greater than the daily temperature threshold the exceeded value is accumulated toward the gdd also there is a threshold range of gdd maximum degree day dmax and minimum degree day dmin for each tree species parameterized based on the studies in xiaoxing an mountains when the calculated gdd falls outside the threshold range of gdd tree growth is suppressed we calculated the mean gdd and the two standard deviation for the period 1980 2009 from the 58 plots in the study area at all three temporal resolutions fig 6 calculated gdd falls below dmin least frequently under daily climate data and most frequently under seasonal climate data fig 6 gdd between daily and monthly climate data has smaller differences than between seasonal and daily or monthly climate data fig 6 which explains the smaller differences of biomass between daily and monthly climate data in addition as input climate data goes from daily to seasonal the estimates of gdd are more biased towards lower gdd fig 6 resulting in differences in the simulated biomass of different tree species such as a decrease in biomass of shade intolerant tree species e g e g gdd of mongolian oak falls below dmin more often under the seasonal climate data and an increase in biomass of shade tolerant tree species e g gdd of spruce falls between dmin and dmax fig 6 similarly for the mean minimum january temperature we used 31 days minimum temperature in january to calculate mean minimum january temperature we then compared the mean minimum january temperature against the threshold to determine the mortality and germination of tree species because the mean january minimum temperature is a monthly average it is the same under both daily and monthly climate data however there is a significant difference in the mean minimum january temperature for seasonal climate data compared to daily or monthly climate data with the mean minimum january temperature being lower under daily or monthly data than that under seasonal climate data fig 7 also for the other growth limiting factors there are similar calculations and difference results the differences of growth limiting factors calculated between daily climate data and monthly climate data are smaller than between seasonal and daily or monthly climate data therefore the minor differences in modelled biomass between daily and monthly climate data the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and the interspecific competition on simulated tree biomass varies by species the effects of competition and of the resolutions of climate data differ between late successional species vs early and mid successional species in the linkages modeling framework late successional species tend to benefit from interspecific competition with the importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data increasing over time this may be because late successional species often need pioneer and intermediate successional species to create shaded conditions that favor establishment and growth of late successional species connell and slatyer 1977 comita and hubbell 2009 zanini et al 2006 therefore in the short term late successional species compete with early and mid successional species for space water and nutrients strong interspecific competition occurs at the stand initiation and self thinning stages of development and gradually decreases at later stages of stand development getzin et al 2006 consequently the importance of the different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal gradually increases for the late successional species fig 5 however for the shade intolerant early and mid successional tree species the different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal play a more important role at the early stages of stand development while the importance of interspecific competition on stand development increases over time fig 5 the advantage of the linkages model is that it can simulate biomass change using daily climate data taking into account the effects of weather extremes such as droughts and floods and it can simulate using daily monthly and seasonal climate data separately allowing comparison of predictions based on different temporal resolutions of climate data dijak et al 2017 these advantages are not available in many of the other terrestrial ecosystem models such as pnet ii and biome bgc however linkages is a hybrid empirical and physiological model which uses empirical age size relationships to model above ground woody biomass dynamics rather than carbon dynamics through physiological processes like forest bcc gustafson and keene 2014 linkages is an individual species age cohort model in contrast to most ecosystem process models or dynamic global vegetation models which track only plant functional types as a terrestrial ecosystem model linkages is based on forest plots to simulate tree species dynamics of forest stands the model includes some mechanistic processes such as simulated succession and competition to obtain dynamic changes in forest composition and structure friend et al 1997 seidl et al 2005 however like most models of this type the linkages model does not include spatial interactions at the landscape scale such as seed dispersal fire disturbance and human activities but it may be coupled with a spatially explicit landscape model to simulate those spatial forest landscape dynamics wang et al 2016 also the current linkages 3 0 model uses the same annual threshold approach instead of daily or monthly and recalibrating the parameters for the daily resolution is challenging however results showed minor differences or no difference of the calculated growth limiting factors e g mean minimum january temperature between daily and monthly climate data figs 6 7 some dynamics global vegetation models e g lpj guess that has both daily and monthly climate data input capability also use annual thresholds for the growth limiting factors so the results these models may be consistent with our study by using different temporal resolutions of climate data thus we believe calibrating species parameters to daily climate data may further improve model realism but may not alter the general finding of our study limitations notwithstanding linkages is a suitable model for comparing the effects of climate input with varied resolutions on the simulated forest biomass we would expect consistent results if other ecosystem process models that can process multiple resolutions of climate input were applied in similar studies 5 conclusions we explored the effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on simulation results by using the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages the results showed that biomass estimates of tree species based on climate data at the seasonal resolution were significantly different from those at daily and monthly resolutions of climate data and differences varied between short term 40 year and long term 70 100 year simulation scenarios simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data were not significantly different for simulation periods up to 70 years the results also suggest that interspecific competition magnifies the differences in simulation results under different temporal resolutions of climate data in addition the results indicate that the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and of interspecific competition varies with species for early successional species the temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal play an important role and the relative importance of interspecific competition increases slowly over time for late successional species interspecific competition is an important factor in estimating biomass and the relative importance of the resolution of climate data increases gradually over time these results can help guide choosing climate input of terrestrial ecosystem models and aiding results interpretation for example we suggest that for medium and short term 70 years trends in tree biomass either daily or monthly climate data can be used for monoculture or multi species simulations for long term trends in tree biomass monthly climate data can still be used in place of daily climate data for monoculture simulations whereas monthly climate data cannot be used in place of daily climate data for multi species seasonal climate data cannot replace daily and monthly climate data in any case data availability data will be made available on request credit

24141,terrestrial ecosystem models are driven by climate data which often have daily monthly and seasonal resolutions but few have examined the effects of different temporal resolutions of climate data on modeled vegetation change in this study we investigated the effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on simulated tree species biomass in a temperate forest region of northeast china we conducted the study by using the linkages terrestrial ecosystem model to quantify the relative importance of climate data resolutions daily monthly and seasonal and interspecific competition on predicted tree species biomass from short term 40 years to long term 70 100 years simulations results showed that simulated tree species biomass was sensitive to daily monthly and seasonal climate data the difference in the simulated biomass based on daily vs monthly climate data was not significant for tree species monocultures suggesting that monthly climate data can be used as a surrogate for daily climate data in such simulations however interspecific competition amplifies the differences in biomass simulations under daily and monthly climate data thus increasing prediction uncertainties in mixed species systems results based on climate data at the seasonal resolution showed the greatest departure from the daily and monthly climate data because averaging climate data over a season may result in unrealistic climate estimates for modeling tree biomass growth simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species was highest when using climate data at the daily resolution followed by monthly and seasonal climate data the opposite pattern was true for shade tolerant tree species at the early stages of simulated tree growth inter tree competition was a more important factor affecting the biomass of late successional shade tolerant tree species while different temporal resolutions of climate data were more important for early and mid successional species this trend reverses at the late stages of stand development these results can help guide choosing climate input of terrestrial ecosystem models and aiding results interpretation keywords terrestrial

on request 1 introduction terrestrial ecosystem models include physiological vegetation responses in simulating changes of forest composition and structure as well as tree species distributions scheiter and higgins 2009 el masri et al 2019 these models are typically driven by climate data which may have temporal resolutions of climate data from hourly to daily monthly or yearly chiesi et al 2007 de bruijn et al 2014 restrepo coupe et al 2017 while predictions by terrestrial ecosystem models have used different temporal resolutions of climate data few have included or directly compared estimates based on different temporal resolutions of climate data liu et al 2018 however studies have reported that models of tree physiological processes such as photosynthesis are sensitive to temporal resolutions of climate data tang et al 2005 gu et al 2015 jevšenak 2019 previous analyses have suggested that higher temporal resolutions of climate data e g daily reveal greater detail in tree ring studies jevšenak 2019 thomte et al 2020 because the response of trees to extreme climate events such as heat waves or extremes in precipitation may be averaged out of climate data recorded at low resolutions thomte et al 2020 extreme climate events can have strong impacts on physiological processes in some cases reyer et al 2013 feng et al 2018 also prior studies reported differences between simulated and observed ecosystem change were greater when climate data were at lower resolutions e g annual seasonal wang et al 2011 2012 santaren et al 2014 while plant photosynthesis

data e g daily to coarser resolutions e g seasonal or monthly boulanger et al 2022 can make separating species level responses and interactions difficult clark et al 2011 gustafson et al 2017 jevšenak and levanič 2018 for example high temperatures and water shortages may reduce photosynthesis of shade tolerant species more than shade intolerant competitors noormets et al 2008 and inhibit their growth kubiske and abrams 1994 thus shade tolerant species would have fewer competitive advantages in this circumstance mcdowell et al 2013 gustafson et al 2016 however if climate extremes e g droughts or heat waves castagneri et al 2015 are averaged out when using coarse resolutions of climate data e g using monthly or seasonal climate data rather than daily climate data this could in turn obscure the limiting climate conditions that would otherwise reduce the modeled growth of shade tolerant plants under unfavorable climate conditions therefore it is important to understand how different temporal resolutions of climate data can amplify or diminish the effects of interspecific competition plant competition is typically at the individual species level clark et al 2010 2011 and

diminish or amplify with short medium or long term simulation periods and iii quantify the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and interspecific competition in terrestrial ecosystem model simulation we use the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages 3 0 dijak et al 2017 to simulate individual tree species dynamics and above ground biomass in the xiaoxing an mountains for the next 100 years under current climate conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and climate data the xiaoxing an mountains are the major temperate forest region in china with dense forests

temperature in the region varies with the mean annual temperature roughly between 1 c in the north and 1 c in the south the mean annual precipitation is between 550 and 650 mm the study area is in the middle and southern part of the xiaoxing an mountains with an area of about 1 5 million ha containing eight forestry bureaus and the fenglin national nature reserve located between 127 50 130 10 e and

dijak et al 2017 to estimate tree species biomass based on daily monthly and seasonal resolutions of climate data we did this for monocultures without interspecific competition and repeated it for mixed species systems with interspecific competition thus the study has six scenarios table 3 for the monocultures we simulated only one of the 15 tree species at a time for the mixed species scenario we simulated all 15 species simultaneously to examine the short medium and long term effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on the modeled individual tree species biomass we analyzed the simulation outcomes at years 40 70 and 100 respectively we designed a 2 with and without interspecific competition 3 daily monthly and seasonal climate data factorial experiment to quantify the relative importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data with and without interspecific competition on simulated species biomass table 1 to account for environmental heterogeneity across our study area we stratified our study area into eight different land types based on elevation 600 m as the threshold slope orientation 90 270 for sunny slopes 0 90 and 270 360 for shaded slopes and cumulative temperature 2200 c d isotherm according to previous studies liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2017 to ensure an adequate number of sample plots across the heterogenous area our criteria for selecting the points takes into account mentioned environmental heterogeneity elevation and slope orientation in liang et al 2011 in total 58 plots were selected and each plot was replicated 10 times within each land type to account for variation in the climate and environment resulting in each land type having about 70 plots fig 1 2 3 linkages 3 0 and parameterization the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages 3 0 dijak et al 2017 was developed from earlier versions of the model pastor and post 1985 wullschleger et al 2003 to simulate compositional and structural dynamics of forest stands linkages 3 0 uses daily climate data as opposed to the monthly climate data used in previous versions the linkages model has seven main modules temperature tempe moisture moist decomposition decomp

climate in our area spring march april and may summer june july and august autumn september october and november and winter december january and february and our input monthly and seasonal climate data were averaged from daily climate data then we input daily monthly and seasonal climate data into linkages 3 0 for monocultures and mixed species forest systems based on the current climate 1980 2009 we used linkages 3 0 to simulate forest change up to 100 years from a starting point of bare ground each of the six scenarios table 4 was repeated 10 times to account for stochasticity in climate and in ecophysiological and biogeochemical processes for each scenario we analyzed the simulated outcomes in the short term 40 years mid term 40 70 years and long term 70 100 years the response variable was simulated biomass for individual species we used analysis of variance anova with least significant difference lsd methods to analyze the differences among the simulation results for the six scenarios in the short 40 year mid 70 year and long term 100 year duration of the simulation prior to this we tested the normality of the data i e whether or not the data obeyed a normal distribution using the shapiro wilk test and the chi square statistic with bartlett s sphericity test we quantified the relative importance of the resolutions of climate data the interspecific competition and their interactions on simulated above ground forest biomass using linear and logistic regression models that decompose r squared and allocate a relative share of r squared to each variable based on the shapley attribution system groemping 2006 broto et al 2020 we investigated factors that were critical for the effect of different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly seasonal and for interspecific competition based on the relaimpo package in r which calculates relative importance metrics for linear models groemping 2006 3 results 3 1 effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on monoculture systems values of simulated biomass among seasonal monthly and daily climate data were significantly different from short 40 years to long 70 100 years simulation periods table 5 simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data resolutions had no significant differences among all three simulation periods 40 years 40 70 years and 70 100 years for most species table 5 simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data captured more detailed responses of biomass change over time than did results based on climate data at a seasonal resolution fig 3 a e for basswood fig 3a spruce fig 3b and fir fig 3c biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data were higher than results for daily and monthly climate data however biomass estimates for white birch fig 3d aspen fig 3e korean pine fig 3f and mongolian oak fig 3g were lower when based on seasonal climate data than when based on monthly or daily climate data simulated biomass values based on seasonal data were markedly different from values based on monthly or daily climate data especially for mongolian oak fig 3g maple fig 3h white birch fig 3d aspen fig 3e and korean pine fig 3f simulated biomass of mongolian oak increased greatly to 116 87 mg ha and 107 48 mg ha under daily and monthly resolutions of climate data respectively while it increased to only 18 93 mg ha at year 100 for estimates based on the seasonal climate data fig 3g under the daily and monthly climate data maple biomass peaked at about year 60 and then decreased and leveled off in contrast maple biomass estimated based on seasonal climate data was consistently lower than when based on daily or monthly climate data until approximately simulation year 70 when the estimates based on seasonal climate data consistently exceeded those based on daily or monthly climate data fig 3h 3 2 effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on multi species systems with interspecific competition i e for multi species stands the simulated biomass values based on seasonal climate data were significantly different from estimates based on monthly and daily climate data for simulation periods of 40 70 and 100 years table 6 the differences between results for monthly and daily climate data were much greater than those in the no competition monoculture scenario except for korean pine fig 4 f and mongolian oak fig 5 g for basswood fig 5a spruce fig 4b and fir fig 4c results based on seasonal climate data were still higher than results for daily and monthly climate data but for white birch fig 4d aspen fig 4e korean pine fig 4f and mongolian oak fig 4g biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data were notably lower than those for monthly or daily climate data these differences were more pronounced in this simulation scenario that incorporates interspecific competition fig 4 than for scenarios based on species monocultures fig 5 unlike the monoculture scenarios that exclude effects of interspecific competition simulated biomass incorporating interspecific competition differed significantly between daily and monthly climate data starting with medium term simulations 40 70 years and increasing for long term simulations 70 100 years table 5 results based on daily climate data were mostly higher than those for monthly climate data except for spruce fig 4b and fir fig 4c simulated biomass for many individual species was much lower under the interspecific competition scenario compared to the monoculture scenario however the modeled total biomass was much higher for the averaged biomass under the no competition scenario 3 3 the relative importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal and interspecific competition for the shade tolerant or climax species such as spruce fir korean pine and maple the effects associated with interspecific competition greatly outweighed those associated with different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly seasonal fig 5 for the early successional shade intolerant species such as aspen and birch and the mid successional species such as mongolian oak and basswood the resolution of the climate data greatly outweighed effects of interspecific competition fig 5 meanwhile the relative importance of interspecific competition for shade tolerant species was greatest in the short term 40 years with importance decreasing in mid term 40 70 year and long term 70 100 year simulation periods except for maple for shade intolerant species the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data was greatest in short term simulations and decreased in the mid and long term simulations scenarios interestingly maple a shade tolerant species shares the same response as the shade intolerant species for the mid successional species e g basswood the relative importance of the climate data of resolutions was important in the short term decreased in the mid term and became most important in the long term the interaction of interspecific competition and different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal increased in importance from short term to long term simulation periods for all species except for basswood and maple fig 5 4 discussion simulated species level biomass is sensitive to the temporal resolution i e daily monthly seasonal of climate inputs the difference in the simulated biomass between the daily and monthly climate data resolutions is not significant for single species monocultures suggesting that monthly climate data can serve as a surrogate for daily climate data in such systems however the monthly climate data tends to estimate lower the biomass of early successional and drought tolerant species and estimate higher biomass for shade tolerant late successional species than daily climate data fig 2d g previous studies have shown that daily climate data are better able than monthly climate data to reveal the effects of weather fluctuations on tree growth castagneri et al 2015 jevšenak and levanič 2018 climate data at a monthly resolution inevitably allows some climatic extremes to be averaged out jevšenak and levanič 2018 thereby underestimating the effects of climate extremes such as drought or indicating better growing conditions for mesic species than are supported by the daily climate data castagneri et al 2015 jevšenak and levanič 2018 the simulated biomass based on climate data at the seasonal resolution can generally capture the overall trends in biomass dynamics over time but the simulated trajectories are highly generalized smoothed with little fluctuation in response to climate extremes fig 3g moreover biomass estimates based on seasonal climate data have the greatest differences compared to simulations based on daily or monthly climate data for some species e g white birch aspen and korean pine in fig 4 those differences are dramatic and seem unrealistic because the biomass values estimated using seasonal data are a small fraction of values estimated when using daily or monthly climate data climate data at the seasonal resolution tends to estimate higher biomass of boreal coniferous species such as spruce and fir and to estimate lower biomass of temperate species than daily climate data this is because exceptionally low temperatures that limit the growth of boreal species and exceptionally high temperatures that limit the growth of temperate species are averaged out of seasonal climate averages and no longer limiting marshall and schut 1999 stratton et al 2011 studies of species suitability and distribution have demonstrated limitation of mean climate data to predict species distributions in niche based species distribution models sdms perez navarro et al 2021 for example using mean climate data to simulate could likely result in biased results especially the species decay under extreme events which could lead to populations being mislocated outside of the ecological niche lloret and kitzberger 2018 margalef marrase et al 2020 gardner et al 2021 so models can distort the results of simulation by using mean climate data e g seasonal annual competition among species magnifies the differences of simulated tree species biomass under climate data input with varying resolutions this suggests that for most forests with mixed species simulation results would be sensitive to the temporal resolution of climate data the differences in biomass estimates for monolithic single species systems based on daily vs monthly resolution of climate data are mostly insignificant for mixed species forests those differences in estimated biomass could become significant and the already significant differences between seasonal monthly and daily climate data could become greater increasing prediction uncertainties for most tree species shade intolerant tree species such as white birch and aspen and mid shade tolerant mongolian oak require relatively more light and warmer temperatures while biomass estimates for shade tolerant tree species like spruce and fir that adapt well under wet and cold conditions are very sensitive to increases of temperature therefore climate data of seasonal resolution are inadequate for modeling biomass growth of intolerant tree species because of the low temperature and low light due to averaging but allow shade tolerant species to avoid extreme heat juday et al 2015 nicklen et al 2019 thus when using seasonal climate data for simulations shade tolerant tree species have greater competitiveness and higher biomass than shade intolerant tree species and thus are typically predicted to easily outcompete shade intolerant species with higher light and temperature requirements viereck and johnston 1990 iwata et al 2012 temperli et al 2012 in contrast biomass simulations based on daily and monthly climate data will result in an increase in simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species this is because most early successional species are opportunistic species thus climate data with fine resolutions introduces more variation in climate and thus more opportunities for these shade intolerant species to establish and grow consequently the simulated biomass of shade intolerant tree species is highest for climate data at daily resolution second highest at monthly resolution and lowest at seasonal resolution while the opposite result is true for shade tolerant species fig 4 the biomass estimates of tree species based on climate data at the seasonal resolution are significantly different from those at daily and monthly resolutions of climate data the result can be analyzed the growth limiting factors of the tree species i e growth degree days gdd mean minimum temperature in january for example the growing degree days gdd uses a daily temperature threshold of 5 56 c when the daily mean temperature is greater than the daily temperature threshold the exceeded value is accumulated toward the gdd also there is a threshold range of gdd maximum degree day dmax and minimum degree day dmin for each tree species parameterized based on the studies in xiaoxing an mountains when the calculated gdd falls outside the threshold range of gdd tree growth is suppressed we calculated the mean gdd and the two standard deviation for the period 1980 2009 from the 58 plots in the study area at all three temporal resolutions fig 6 calculated gdd falls below dmin least frequently under daily climate data and most frequently under seasonal climate data fig 6 gdd between daily and monthly climate data has smaller differences than between seasonal and daily or monthly climate data fig 6 which explains the smaller differences of biomass between daily and monthly climate data in addition as input climate data goes from daily to seasonal the estimates of gdd are more biased towards lower gdd fig 6 resulting in differences in the simulated biomass of different tree species such as a decrease in biomass of shade intolerant tree species e g e g gdd of mongolian oak falls below dmin more often under the seasonal climate data and an increase in biomass of shade tolerant tree species e g gdd of spruce falls between dmin and dmax fig 6 similarly for the mean minimum january temperature we used 31 days minimum temperature in january to calculate mean minimum january temperature we then compared the mean minimum january temperature against the threshold to determine the mortality and germination of tree species because the mean january minimum temperature is a monthly average it is the same under both daily and monthly climate data however there is a significant difference in the mean minimum january temperature for seasonal climate data compared to daily or monthly climate data with the mean minimum january temperature being lower under daily or monthly data than that under seasonal climate data fig 7 also for the other growth limiting factors there are similar calculations and difference results the differences of growth limiting factors calculated between daily climate data and monthly climate data are smaller than between seasonal and daily or monthly climate data therefore the minor differences in modelled biomass between daily and monthly climate data the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and the interspecific competition on simulated tree biomass varies by species the effects of competition and of the resolutions of climate data differ between late successional species vs early and mid successional species in the linkages modeling framework late successional species tend to benefit from interspecific competition with the importance of different temporal resolutions of climate data increasing over time this may be because late successional species often need pioneer and intermediate successional species to create shaded conditions that favor establishment and growth of late successional species connell and slatyer 1977 comita and hubbell 2009 zanini et al 2006 therefore in the short term late successional species compete with early and mid successional species for space water and nutrients strong interspecific competition occurs at the stand initiation and self thinning stages of development and gradually decreases at later stages of stand development getzin et al 2006 consequently the importance of the different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal gradually increases for the late successional species fig 5 however for the shade intolerant early and mid successional tree species the different temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal play a more important role at the early stages of stand development while the importance of interspecific competition on stand development increases over time fig 5 the advantage of the linkages model is that it can simulate biomass change using daily climate data taking into account the effects of weather extremes such as droughts and floods and it can simulate using daily monthly and seasonal climate data separately allowing comparison of predictions based on different temporal resolutions of climate data dijak et al 2017 these advantages are not available in many of the other terrestrial ecosystem models such as pnet ii and biome bgc however linkages is a hybrid empirical and physiological model which uses empirical age size relationships to model above ground woody biomass dynamics rather than carbon dynamics through physiological processes like forest bcc gustafson and keene 2014 linkages is an individual species age cohort model in contrast to most ecosystem process models or dynamic global vegetation models which track only plant functional types as a terrestrial ecosystem model linkages is based on forest plots to simulate tree species dynamics of forest stands the model includes some mechanistic processes such as simulated succession and competition to obtain dynamic changes in forest composition and structure friend et al 1997 seidl et al 2005 however like most models of this type the linkages model does not include spatial interactions at the landscape scale such as seed dispersal fire disturbance and human activities but it may be coupled with a spatially explicit landscape model to simulate those spatial forest landscape dynamics wang et al 2016 also the current linkages 3 0 model uses the same annual threshold approach instead of daily or monthly and recalibrating the parameters for the daily resolution is challenging however results showed minor differences or no difference of the calculated growth limiting factors e g mean minimum january temperature between daily and monthly climate data figs 6 7 some dynamics global vegetation models e g lpj guess that has both daily and monthly climate data input capability also use annual thresholds for the growth limiting factors so the results these models may be consistent with our study by using different temporal resolutions of climate data thus we believe calibrating species parameters to daily climate data may further improve model realism but may not alter the general finding of our study limitations notwithstanding linkages is a suitable model for comparing the effects of climate input with varied resolutions on the simulated forest biomass we would expect consistent results if other ecosystem process models that can process multiple resolutions of climate input were applied in similar studies 5 conclusions we explored the effects of daily monthly and seasonal climate data on simulation results by using the terrestrial ecosystem model linkages the results showed that biomass estimates of tree species based on climate data at the seasonal resolution were significantly different from those at daily and monthly resolutions of climate data and differences varied between short term 40 year and long term 70 100 year simulation scenarios simulation results based on daily and monthly climate data were not significantly different for simulation periods up to 70 years the results also suggest that interspecific competition magnifies the differences in simulation results under different temporal resolutions of climate data in addition the results indicate that the relative importance of daily monthly and seasonal climate data and of interspecific competition varies with species for early successional species the temporal resolutions of climate data daily monthly and seasonal play an important role and the relative importance of interspecific competition increases slowly over time for late successional species interspecific competition is an important factor in estimating biomass and the relative importance of the resolution of climate data increases gradually over time these results can help guide choosing climate input of terrestrial ecosystem models and aiding results interpretation for example we suggest that for medium and short term 70 years trends in tree biomass either daily or monthly climate data can be used for monoculture or multi species simulations for long term trends in tree biomass monthly climate data can still be used in place of daily climate data for monoculture simulations whereas monthly climate data cannot be used in place of daily climate data for multi species seasonal climate data cannot replace daily and monthly climate data in any case data availability data will be made available on request credit

24142,climate change and disturbance from human activities are key threats facing many wildlife populations worldwide the ability to quantify the effects of such threats on individual health and population dynamics is critical for effective management and conservation we used stochastic dynamic programming sdp a method for implementing state dependent life history theory to explore the impacts of changes in prey availability and anthropogenic disturbance on survival and reproductive success of cook inlet belugas delphinapterus leucas cib an endangered and isolated population in decline we predicted behavioral decisions whether to forage travel to a new location or rest of pregnant cibs within a spatially and seasonally dynamic prey landscape we used those decisions to explore time activity budgets and spatial use under a variety of hypothetical environmental scenarios and estimate the resulting impacts on body condition and vital rates in all scenarios foraging activity was highest during summer to capitalize on abundant prey which in the model was assumed to be eulachon thaleichthys pacificus and salmonids oncorhynchus spp this resulted in large increases in blubber reserves that pregnant cibs relied on during october to april when prey was assumed to be less abundant prey availability outside of summer months was still critical as it either exacerbated or buffered against reductions in prey availability during summer months spatial predictions of habitat use indicated that pregnant cibs should forage in areas used historically that now appear to be abandoned suggesting that prey availability alone is unlikely to explain the recent range contraction of cibs to upper cook inlet reductions in prey availability from late spring to early fall adversely affected vital rates but intermittent disturbances that resulted in lost foraging opportunities such as those caused by anthropogenic activities during the ice free season had little impact on body condition or vital rates if prey were abundant during the summer and early fall accurate assessment of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on cibs requires robust data on both disturbances and year round prey availability as intermittent disturbances adversely affected survival and reproductive success when they occurred in environments with reduced prey availability our model represents an initial effort to fill a critical information gap for informing cib management decisions providing insights into conditions under which reductions in vital rates might be expected

and extraction pollution noise ecotourism and fishing avila et al 2018 williams et al 2015 may exacerbate or interact with effects of climate change to influence population dynamics williams et al 2022 the ability to quantify how environmental and human associated perturbations affect populations at multiple timescales is critical for effective management and conservation particularly for populations with life history traits that inherently increase their extinction risk such as a restricted geographic range geographic isolation low population density low productivity and extended maternal care and large body size davidson et al 2012 2009 the resident beluga whale delphinapterus leucas population in cook inlet a tidally dynamic estuary in the gulf of alaska is geographically reproductively and demographically isolated from other beluga populations laidre et al 2000 o corry crowe et al 2018 in addition to being listed as endangered under the u s endangered species act noaa fisheries has designated cook inlet belugas cibs as one of nine species in the spotlight an initiative that brings attention to and helps mobilize resources to recover species most highly at risk of extinction as of 2018 the cib population size was estimated at 279 individuals cv 0 061 95 probability interval of 250 317 with an annual rate of decline of 2 3 shelden and wade 2019 hunting by alaska natives was originally thought to be a primary factor for the decline but the cib population failed to recover after hunting restrictions were enacted in 1999 hypotheses for the lack of recovery include insufficient prey availability noise pollution habitat loss loss of cultural information and social cohesion and stranding events some of which may be exacerbated by cumulative effects and climate change cib recovery plan national marine fisheries service 2016 shelden et al 2021 human influences are of particular concern given the proximity of belugas to anchorage which lies at the northern end of cook inlet and is home to roughly 40 of alaska s population https live laborstats alaska gov cen 2020 census data html the decline in cib population size coincided with a summer range contraction from 7000 km2 to 3000 km2 that concentrated the population in upper cook inlet where there is a high degree of human disturbance rugh et al 2010 particularly from noise pollution sources of noise pollution include vessel traffic aircraft traffic pile driving sub bottom profiling dredging oil and gas drilling seismic surveys and military activities castellote et al 2019 many beluga populations are experiencing changes in sea ice dynamics and prey community composition resulting in diet shifts changes in habitat use and in some cases reductions in body condition choy et al 2020 hauser 2016 heide jørgensen et al 2010 vacquié garcia et al 2018 yurkowski et al 2017 the diet of belugas is typically diverse but it is often dominated by just a few species at any given time choy et al 2020 loseto et al 2009 marcoux et al 2012 quakenbush et al 2015 anadromous fish are key prey species for cibs from spring to fall castellote et al 2021 huntington 2000 quakenbush et al 2015

stomachs with prey n 18 collected from cibs between march november of 2002 2012 but they are eaten by belugas in other areas of alaska and traditional ecological knowledge indicated cibs followed sockeye salmon up the kenai river huntington 2000 quakenbush et al 2015 many key species are also commercially recreationally and individually subsistence fished in cook inlet with some species likely to be affected by recent and future warming temperatures kovach et al 2015 schoen et al 2017 von biela et al 2022 while no empirical data on prey consumption of cibs exist it is generally believed that intensive foraging occurs during the spring and summer on salmonids and other anadromous fish based on acoustic data and traditional ecological knowledge castellote et al 2020 huntington 2000 prey preferences particularly during the fall to spring period are not well known but non anadromous fish such as saffron cod eleginus gracilis and flatfish and invertebrates have been found in stomachs of cibs quakenbush et al 2015 despite an increase in research efforts in the last decade many information gaps in the ecology of cibs remain limiting effective management of this population that lack of information is due at least in part to environmental conditions such as winter ice cover turbid waters and extreme tidal range that make it difficult to conduct field research only recently have there been limited efforts to understand how prey availability and human activities considered separately or together might influence cib population dynamics norman et al 2020 found that per capita birth rate of cibs was related to prey abundance in a known hotspot of beluga use goetz et al 2012a although the analysis was limited to a single prey species and river tributary the recent effort by warlick 2022 who used an integrated population model ipm parameterized with data from a greater number of sites and prey species identified positive relationships between an index of prey abundance and cib fecundity rates and survival of older calves providing the best evidence to date that prey availability may be one of the factors hindering population recovery in this ipm analysis proxies for anthropogenic stressors including the human population size in anchorage hazardous spill volume and shipping traffic were not correlated with vital rates however the data available for these metrics may be too coarse to detect potential effects and further investigation is needed to better understand whether anthropogenic stressors are adversely affecting cibs warlick 2022 the population consequences of disturbance pcod framework is one that conceptualizes how disturbances that occur at the individual level translate to changes in population dynamics through linkages between behavior health and vital rates new et al 2014 wartzok and tyack 2008 since its inception in 2005 pcod models have been used to investigate the impacts of a variety of non lethal anthropogenic and natural stressors on marine mammal populations primarily using some metric of energy as the variable that links behavioral changes to vital rates keen et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018a applications of this framework are still limited given most pcod models require considerable data on a species biology in a preliminary implementation of this framework for cibs an expert elicitation workshop was held in 2016 to quantify relationships between disturbance and birth rate and calf survival which were then used to understand the impact of a variety of hypothetical disturbance scenarios on these parameters tollit et al 2016 while a useful first step this effort was limited in its application to management decisions since it relied solely on opinion rather than empirical data not only is it difficult to validate output but it did not account for potential interactions between disturbance and environmental conditions the ability to assess such interactions is necessary because the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors is identified in the noaa fisheries cib recovery plan a document that describes the research management actions necessary to support species recovery as a threat of high relative concern national marine fisheries service 2016 the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors is a growing concern for many wildlife populations national academies of science engineering and medicine 2017 orr et al 2020 and simultaneous mitigation of anthropogenic stressors noise pollution and prey availability through fisheries management actions has been identified as the most likely mechanism for reversing the population decline of the endangered beluga population in st lawrence estuary canada williams et al 2021 to address the gaps in our understanding of the impacts of prey availability and disturbance on cib survival and reproductive success we developed a model to predict the movement and foraging decisions of pregnant cibs in a spatially and temporally dynamic environment using stochastic dynamic programming sdp stochastic dynamic programming a term referring to both the model itself and the mathematical method for solving the model clark and mangel 2000 houston et al 1988 is a way to implement state dependent life history theory or the strategic decisions an animal should make over its lifetime or a part of it based on their intrinsic state and external conditions mcnamara and houston 1996 we used these decisions to predict the effects of a variety of informed environmental and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios on female condition survival and reproductive success focusing on pregnant females not only because of increasing evidence suggesting fecundity may be depressed himes boor et al 2023 warlick 2022 but also because the dynamics are simpler to model and parameterize than for other reproductive stages this effort should be considered an initial step in a larger effort to develop a full pcod model for cibs that can be used to predict the effects of different management actions on the population as such we focus much of our discussion on general patterns and highlight specific data needs that would help refine model parameterization and increase the utility of the model for making predictions about cibs 2 methods 2 1 model overview stochastic dynamic programming sdp models can be used to predict how an individual should behave assuming they act in a way that maximizes some expected future reward and that this reward varies depending on the state of the animal for example we expect that an individual in poor body condition the state might undertake a risky foraging strategy the behavior in their attempt to survive the reward as they are balancing the tradeoffs associated with predation and starvation similarly we might expect such decisions to vary depending on how far the animal is from some endpoint or time horizon such as the end of their natural lifespan once predictions are made for all possible combinations of state variables at each time step of the model referred to here as the backward iteration predictions can be used to understand the sequence of behaviors that emerge within a population referred to here as the forward simulation for this model we determined whether a pregnant beluga whale should choose to forage travel or rest the behavior depending on three intrinsic state variables pregnant female blubber mass fetal blubber mass pregnant female stomach fullness and two extrinsic state variables location tidal phase from the first day of pregnancy to birth the time horizon assuming she is attempting to maximize her expected future reproductive success the reward based here on the sum of her own survival probability and that of her fetus once it is born referred to here as calf survival the following sections provide further detail on each of these model components including the specific values and bounds of state variables and the state dynamics how state variables change under each behavior and the derivation of fitness using the sdp equations the state dynamics section primarily focuses on how pregnant female and fetal blubber mass change due to the energy costs and gains associated with behavior in essence a bioenergetic model a simplified schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 including where the bioenergetic model is integrated into the backward iteration and forward simulation as the model is focused on a single gestation event we chose parameter values based on an adult cib female at asymptotic length 383 cm vos et al 2020 r

assumed to be august 4th in the year following conception lasting a total of 475 days robeck et al 2015 the date of birth was based on estimates from fetal and calf morphology shelden et al 2020 and timing of neonate observations mcguire et al 2020b the date of conception was then assumed to occur 475 days prior neonates have been observed as early as july and as late as october in cook inlet mcguire et al 2020b but for model simplicity we assume fixed times for conception and birth it is possible to allow a range of conception and birth times but it would require a different model structure and is outside the scope of this initial model the backward iteration which identifies the optimal behavioral decision for all combinations of state variables was assessed at a time step of 1 day although the physiological dynamics were assessed at a 6 h time step since this was the time step used in the forward simulation to approximately match the length of a tidal phase thus the backward iteration output for a given combination of state variables represented the optimal behavioral decision for a 6 h period for each day this approach assumes that the future expected fitness of each behavior and thus the optimal behavioral decision does not vary within a single day which helped to reduce computational time for the backward iteration while maintaining higher temporal resolution in the forward simulation 2 3 state variables we used blubber mass x t at time t with a particular value denoted by x as the metric to describe a female s energy reserves blubber mass was bounded by a critical x c r i t and upper limit x m a x mortality was assumed to occur when blubber mass was below x c r i t we assumed that x c r i t and x m a x occurred at 80 kg and 543 kg or when blubber mass was 12 or 45 of estimated body mass respectively appendix a behavioral decisions were assessed at 10 kg intervals between x c r i t and x m a x this interval was chosen to balance computational efficiency with discriminatory ability given the total range of blubber mass and daily fluctuations in blubber masses we used fetal blubber mass x f t at time t with a particular value denoted by x f to describe the energy reserves of the fetus as above this variable was bounded by x f c r i t which was assumed to be 0 kg based on the findings that an aborted fetus had essentially no blubber layer burek huntington et al 2015 the upper bound x f m a x was set at 60 of estimated body mass at any given time and thus increased exponentially as the fetus grew appendix a behavioral decisions were assessed at 74 discrete fetal blubber masses from 0 kg to 52 kg intervals were not constant because fetal growth is exponential and blubber masses are very small during early gestation at very small blubber masses we assessed behavioral choices at fetal blubber masses that differed by 0 0001 kg 0 1 kg with increments of 0 01 when blubber masses were 0 01 kg increments of 0 01 kg when blubber masses were between 0 01 and 0 1 and increments of 0 1 when blubber masses were between 0 1 and 1 0 kg from 1 kg in blubber mass onwards we used increments of 1 kg stomach fullness s t at time t with a particular value s described the proportion of prey intake relative to the maximum that could be consumed per time step thus influencing the amount of prey that could be consumed the maximum amount of prey that could be consumed per time step was based on estimates of forestomach capacity and clearance rate see section 2 4 physiological parameters since these estimates resulted in a forestomach that could be filled and cleared within a single time step this state variable essentially represented the proportion of the forestomach that was full with a value of 1 0 being full and a value of 0 5 being empty behaviors were assessed in 0 1 increments ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 location hereafter referred to as cell c t at time t with a particular value c was one of 27 discretized cells in cook inlet fig 2 cell boundaries were delineated based on cib distribution and available prey data average travel distances between each cell were calculated based on cell midpoints cells differed in the amount of energy gained from foraging at any given time see section 2 5 state dynamics when referencing cells in the results and discussion we provide not only the number but also the general geographic area represented by the cell such as knik arm and the susitna delta tidal phase p t at time t with a particular value p was included given the large tidal flux throughout the estuary which is known to influence beluga movement and behavior this state variable had two phases one which encompassed high tide and the upper portions of the rising and falling tide above slack and one that encompassed low tide and the lower portions of the rising and falling tide below slack we split the tidal cycle around slack tide instead of having it encompass solely the rising or falling tide based on observations of beluga behavior and the assumption that water levels must reach some critical threshold to allow access to mud flats or river entrances which are exposed at low tide huntington 2000 tidal activity strongly influences cib movements in portions of their habitat but the relationship between tidal height and behavior is not uniform throughout cook inlet ezer et al 2008 shelden et al 2015 small et al 2017 for example in some areas low tidal heights may make habitat inaccessible whereas in others foraging is observed around river mouths at low tide more research is needed to properly parameterize inlet wide and year round influence of tides on cib movement behavior and energetics as such its inclusion here as a state variable is largely a placeholder to show how it could be included in future efforts 2 4 physiological parameters the dynamics of female and fetal blubber mass depended on how much energy a female beluga expended how much energy she gained from foraging if any and the energy density of blubber energy costs incurred by the female included her own maintenance locomotion pregnancy digestion and urine production assuming that any thermoregulatory costs were negligible we separated the energy costs of pregnancy into two categories 1 the minimum cost a female must invest in the fetus which we assumed to include metabolic costs and energy stored in non blubber tissues and 2 additional energy that was allocated to fetal blubber reserves a complete list of parameter notation and values can be found in table 1 specific references in text to the model parameters are italicized while general references are not below we describe how each parameter was determined while the specific equations describing the dynamics of female and fetal blubber mass are found in section 2 5 state dynamics variability in parameter estimates such as the physiological ones described below can theoretically be incorporated into either the backward iteration or forward simulation in practice it can be challenging to implement in the backward and easier to incorporate into the forward simulation see section 2 7 forward simulation particularly for parameters where individuals with the same state variables may exhibit a range of potential values such as is often the case with metabolic rates as a result incorporating individual variation in parameter estimates is typically focused on the forward simulation excluding age or size specific variation or parameters dealing with the prey landscape e g mchuron et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018b incorporation of variation in parameter estimates into just the forward simulation assumes that optimal behavioral decisions are not affected by such variation in this model we focused mainly on using point estimates given we often had very little if any data to inform these estimates but variation could easily be incorporated into the forward simulation of future efforts maintenance costs were taken from john 2020 who used respirometry measurements from three belugas in human care to estimate resting metabolic rate r m r we used non mass specific values since fat is not believed to contribute notably to an individual s maintenance metabolic costs rea and costa 1992 and mass changes in this model only occurred through changes in blubber reserves that have a high lipid content in support of this differences in mean rmrs between belugas from john 2020 and a single adult male from rosen and trites 2013 were only 1 despite average mass differences of 180 which were primarily due to excess blubber reserves locomotion costs were estimated based on the cost of transport c o t and the cost of surface swimming c o s also derived from john 2020 both of these costs include rmr in the measurement we assumed that when foraging whales spent 100 of the time step swimming 6 h h s w i m whereas for resting we assumed it was 17 since detailed time activity budgets of belugas are largely unknown these values were relatively arbitrarily chosen to produce the general pattern that resting was less energetically costly than the other two behaviors minimum gestation costs e m g e s t a t i o n included the heat increment of gestation and the energy stored in the fetus and associated tissues instead of assuming a fixed allocation of blubber reserves e b g e s t a t i o n we modeled it using a separate sdp model to identify the optimal value for each day based on female blubber mass fetal blubber mass and energy gain appendix a this provided a mechanism for changes in maternal body condition to influence fetal growth and hence probability of survival something that has been detected in other cetacean species christiansen et al 2014 smith 2021 this was done in lieu of using researcher assigned a priori rules about fetal energy allocation under poor maternal body condition we took a conservative approach by assuming that females could not allocate more energy than what was expected based on fetal age appendix a meaning that a female could not make up reductions at one point in time by over allocating at another time there are no available data for the heat increment of feeding h i f the metabolic cost of processing food digestive efficiency d e f percent of ingested energy left after fecal energy losses or urinary energy loss u e l for beluga whales existing hif values for pinnipeds range from 4 3 to 19 4 of gross energy intake with values that can be influenced by the proximate composition of prey rosen and worthy 2018 feeding trials where animals were fed lipid rich prey resulted in hif values between 5 1 and 12 4 we used a value of 10 for h i f of gross energy intake since much of the summer prey eaten by cibs is relatively energy dense particularly eulachon for d e f we used a value of 95 based on data from bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus and pinnipeds reddy et al 1994 rosen and worthy 2018 values of uel in pinnipeds typically range from about 6 9 to 9 5 of digestive energy intake after energy lost to feces we assumed a value of 8 we used a value of 34 32 mj kg 1 for the energy density of female blubber e d b l u b b e r kuhnlein et al 2002 which assumes that blubber energy density is constant throughout the year while this is unlikely to be true since seasonal changes in lipid content of blubber are common in cetaceans koopman 2007 we did not have the data to resolve this further the energy density of fetal blubber e d f e t a l b l u b b e r was based on the estimated protein and lipid composition of blubber given fetal age appendix a there were very few data available to characterize the prey landscape experienced by cibs and estimate the energy gained from foraging e g a i n we primarily used data from salmonids with some additional data from eulachon salmonids were the only prey for which we had any data to approximate abundance sourced from spatially and temporally explicit set net harvest and escapement data these data were only available for 15 of the 27 cells and were extremely limited or absent from several of the cells located in the upper inlet where beluga presence is concentrated fig 2 we provide a brief overview of our approach in the following paragraphs with a more in depth description of how the prey landscape was parameterized in appendix b the daily total number of each salmonid species in each cell was summed and subsequently combined with species specific mass and energy density estimates to convert numbers of fish to energy availability generalized additive models were used to estimate daily energy availability from salmonids summed across all species for each cell fig b1 energy availability was converted to energy gain as described in appendix b to this value we added the energy gained from eulachon approximated based on the timing and location of eulachon runs barrett et al 1984 spangler 2002 we also added a static value of 40 mj primarily to parameterize the prey landscape from october to april the timing and spatial distribution of this static value was approximated from acoustic presence absence data of belugas from 13 acoustic moorings throughout cook inlet castellote et al 2020 appendix b the specific value of 40 mj was chosen after preliminary model runs indicated too little energy resulted in complete starvation and too much reduced seasonal fluctuations in blubber mass see section 3 3 sensitivity analysis operating under the assumption that cibs experience seasonal fluctuations in prey availability for all time steps we assumed a reduced energy gain from foraging when the tidal phase was below slack which was proportional to the percent of the cell with exposed mudflats during low tide corresponding to inaccessible foraging habitat if a cell had no exposed mudflats then there was no influence of tidal phase on energy gain as mentioned previously the general assumption about reduced foraging during lower tides is not uniformly true across cook inlet however this assumption is simply intended to capture the general pattern that prey availability and foraging success is unlikely to be uniform throughout the day since stomach fullness was a state variable s the energy gained from foraging was not only based on the prey landscape but also on the value of s the maximum prey mass that could be consumed in a 6 hour time step was 22 kg which was calculated based on maximum estimates of forestomach capacity 11 kg calculated from the equation s 0 47 l 2 36 and clearance rates 3 hr both of which were derived from data collected from fin whales balaenoptera physalus vikingsson 1997 there are anecdotal reports of forestomach capacities of belugas that suggest it may be higher than 11 kg up to 22 28 kg quakenbush et al 2015 vladykov 1964 but we chose not to use these here because they are based on so few observations since s represented the proportion of the forestomach that was full s 0 5 being empty and s 1 0 being full the value for the amount of prey that could be consumed decreased linearly from s 0 5 to s 1 0 with specific maximum consumption estimates of 22 kg s 0 5 19 8 kg s 0 6 17 6 kg s 0 7 15 4 kg s 0 8 13 2 kg s 0 9 and 11 0 kg s 1 0 these maximum consumption estimates were combined with average cell and time specific prey energy density estimates to convert from prey in kg to energy in mj the energy gained from foraging was the minimum based on prey energy availability and maximum allowable consumption given s our approach to quantifying e g a i n has limitations and is unlikely to be entirely representative of the prey landscape experienced by cibs not only did we lack comprehensive data on prey abundance of key species like salmonids and eulachon but we know virtually nothing about abundance of other prey species in any season nor how prey abundance relates to energy gain what is important however is that the result is a temporally and spatially dynamic prey energy landscape characterized by seasonally abundant prey resources fig b3 we have thus captured the essence of our understanding of the prey field that cibs experience even if the specific details are incomplete 2 5 state dynamics the blubber mass dynamics of a pregnant adult female beluga when foraging was 1 x t 1 min x t e g a i n d e f e f o r a g e e h i f e u r i n e e m g e s t a

in eq 1 e f o r a g e represents maintenance and locomotion costs eq 4 e h i f e g a i n h i f and e u r i n e e g a i n d e f u e l the costs associated with the fetus the energy density of fetal blubber and the maximum value of fetal blubber mass all vary with time but notation is omitted for simplicity in nature there is some lag between energy intake and blubber deposition but here deposition and catabolism is assumed to occur within the same time step the blubber mass dynamics of a female that was traveling or resting were similar except e f o r a g e was replaced with e t r a v e l eq 5 or e r e s t eq 6 for the latter two e g a i n 0 and since e h i f and e u r i n e are calculated relative to e g a i n they also equaled zero when a whale was traveling or resting 3 x t 1 min x t e t r a v e l o r e r e s t e m g e s t a t i o n e b g e s t a t i o n e d b l u b b e r x m a x the energetic costs of each behavior were calculated as 4 e fora ge x cos h swim 5 e trav el x c c cot d c c rmr h rema in 6 e rest x rmr 6 h swim cos h swim where d c c is the distance in km between the current cell c and the new cell c h r e m a i n is the number of hours remaining in a time step once a whale reaches c which was calculated based on an assumed transit rate of 5 km hr 1 and the distance traveled richard et al 2001 whales were allowed to travel to any cell within 120 km of their current cell i e any cell they could reach in a single day the energy cost of foraging was typically more energetically expensive than traveling assuming a distance 30 km the distance that could be traveled in single time step particularly when considering the added costs of e h i f and e u r i n e when foraging 2 6 sdp equations when solving the sdp equations we assume that all individuals act in such a way to maximize their expected reproductive success which for this model is based on a single reproductive event and a female s probability of survival the fitness function f x x f c p s t is defined as the expected total probability that a female will survive the year and her fetus once born will survive given that x t x x f t x f c t c p t p and s t s where the expectation is taken over the stochastic events of survival and food distribution and taking into account errors in decision making as described later in this section at the last time step in the model t fitness was calculated as 7 f x x f c p s t ϕ x ϕ x ϕ f x f φ x x f where ϕ x is the probability that a female with blubber mass x survives to the following year and ϕ f x f is the probability that a fetus with blubber mass x f at the time of birth t t survives to one year of age the fitness associated with the newly born fetus calf was conditioned on female survival ϕ x ϕ f x f since we assumed the calf would die regardless of its own blubber mass if the female was not alive to provide milk since the relationships between survival probability and female and calf blubber mass are unknown we parameterized these functions using estimates of the annual probability of reproductive female and young of the year survival of cibs from the model described in himes boor et al 2023 and a sigmoidal function figs a5 and a6 fitness at all other model time steps was calculated by iterating backwards through time where fitness is the maximum future expected fitness across all three behaviors 8 f x x

resting respectively and the optimal behavioral decision is the one that maximizes a pregnant belugas future expected fitness across all potential behaviors we used two dimensional linear interpolation to account for continuous physiological state variables that must be treated as discrete variables for computational purposes clark and mangel 2000 we computed the fitness value of foraging v f o r a g e x x f c p s t traveling v t r a v e l x x f c p s t and resting v r e s t i n g x x f c p s t as 9 v f o r a g e x x f c p s t e μ f x x f c p s t 1 10 v t r a v e l x x f c p t max c o v e r η c e μ f x x f c p s t 1 11 v r e s t x x f c p t e μ f x x f c p s t 1 where μ is the daily rate of background mortality e g mortality due to predation disease and x and x f are the future expected maternal and fetal blubber masses given the specific behavior and the values of other state variables eqs 1 and 2 in eq 10 s and p are the expected stomach fullness and tidal state upon arrival given the time to travel from c to c and η c is all the cells within 120 km of c we modeled μ as static across all behaviors so its inclusion here is irrelevant however we have included it to show how it could easily be incorporated as a spatially and or temporally dynamic value the optimal cell to travel to is the one that results in the maximum value of v t r a v e l if at any time a female s blubber mass fell below x c r i t then her fitness went to zero the above equations were solved backward starting at t t and resulted in the identification of the optimal time and state dependent behaviors in addition to the optimal behaviors we also calculated a probability distribution of behavior appendix c this calculation relies on the differences between the specific values of fitness for each behavior and the optimal value and an optimality parameter that determines how optimal a whale behaves very small optimality values result in a higher probability of selecting the optimal behavior whereas larger optimality values result in more random behavior i e as the value increases the probability of each behavior becomes more similar using a probability distribution instead of simply the optimal behavior accounts for ties in fitness when two behaviors have the same fitness value the fact that animals may not always behave optimally particularly when there are very small differences in fitness among behaviors and that there may be errors in decision making this approach takes care of these issues in a natural and consistent way we calculated probability distributions for both the behavior and travel decisions 2 7 forward simulation we used the probability distribution of behaviors from the backward iteration in monte carlo simulations to determine the distribution of behaviors changes in female and fetal blubber mass and survival estimates in a population of 50 pregnant cibs in undisturbed and disturbed environments fig 1 table 2 see 2 8 disturbance scenarios simulations started on the first day of pregnancy t 1 the initial values of the state variable for each female at t 1 were selected as follows randomly drawn from a normal distribution for female blubber mass assumed to be a fixed value for fetal blubber mass stomach fullness and tidal phase randomly drawn from values between 1 and 27 for cell table 1 thereafter values for female and fetal blubber mass were updated as described in section 2 5 state dynamics depending on the behavior that was selected stomach fullness was updated based on energy intake and time and cell specific estimates of prey energy density tidal phase alternated between time steps and cell changed depending on travel decisions when the selected behavior was to travel and the new location was greater than could be transited in 6 hours the time step was advanced according to the distance traveled and transit speed since we used the probability distribution of behaviors from the backward iteration instead of the optimal one each behavior had a probability of being chosen given the values of each state variable at the beginning of the time step we used the following sequence to identify which behavior was chosen at each time step 1 select a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 2 randomly order behavioral choices and 3 sequentially sum the probability of the behavioral choices based on their random order the selected behavior was the one that caused the sum to exceed the value of the random number we used the same approach to select which cell a whale selected when the chosen behavior was to travel we did not include background mortality the probability of mortality due to factors other than starvation in the forward simulations because we only ran a single replicate of 50 individuals per scenario meaning that a random mortality in one scenario would greatly impact average population survival estimates 2 8 disturbance scenarios disturbance was included using seven hypothetical scenarios meant to mimic anthropogenic activities changes in the availability of prey and the interaction between the two table 2 these scenarios were implemented in the forward simulation only meaning there was the potential for mismatch in the behavioral decisions from the backward iteration and the environments that were encountered in the forward simulation the anthropogenic activity scenario was designed to represent any significant and sustained human disturbance with specific values based on the activities occurring as part of the port of alaska modernization program in knik arm cell 1 this activity involves in water pile driving and pile removal operations the presence and movement of small boats and barges with heavy equipment and other shore based activities that overall cause both physical and underwater noise disturbance within cib habitat the parameters for this disturbance scenario were based on the current operations of this activity which can span a single 6 hour period per day for 6 days per week from april to november in each year these parameters captured the most extensive disturbance a beluga would likely encounter in this section of cook inlet for the purposes of this modeling effort and independently of the effectiveness of the mitigation program in place for this port project e g national marine fisheries service 2020 which is outside the scope of this paper we assumed that a whale in cell 1 at the time of disturbance would respond by leaving and traveling to another cell determined using the probability of traveling to a given cell as described above the prey availability scenarios described in table 2 were intended to capture varying reductions in prey species during a presumed critical foraging time for cibs while we refer to them here using the species that informed the prey landscape salmonids and eulachon table 2 results reflect changes in the overall prey landscape and are thus not specific to these prey groups 2 9 sensitivity analysis we explored the sensitivity of model output to uncertainties in key parameter inputs specifically we ran separate backward iterations using altered parameter values for optimality a different terminal fitness function and different winter prey energy gain values one higher and one lower than the baseline scenario we refer to these two prey sensitivity scenarios as reduced winter prey or increased winter prey for ease of reference even though they affected more than just the winter months this approach re running the backward iteration using the altered winter prey landscape means that behavioral choices are perfectly matched to the environment that is what a whale expects to encounter in the forward simulation is what they encounter this contrasts with the approach used for the disturbance scenarios where prey availability was altered only in the forward simulation while metabolic rates are one of the most influential factors on estimates of energy costs bejarano et al 2017 winship et al 2002 and can influence sdp model output mchuron et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018b we did not explore the sensitivity of the model to this parameter or to parameters that influenced it like the percentage of time spent swimming when foraging this was because we had no empirical knowledge on the energy gained from foraging making the specific values used for metabolic parameters of less importance in this effort this reasoning is also why we present the ratio of energy gains and costs in the results in addition to presenting absolute values 3 results initial runs of the model revealed two movement patterns that led us to alter the model to better match known behavior of cibs the first was that the model indicated a high probability of traveling to and foraging in cells 15 kenai and 16 kasilof in july and august because of an abundance of spawning salmon in these rivers at that time appendix d fig d1 this timing coincides with the drift gillnet fishery that includes the mouth of these rivers as well as the commercial fishery and personal use dipnetting in the rivers and is a period when belugas are largely absent see discussion because of this we removed foraging in these two cells cell 15 and cell 16 as a behavioral choice in the backward iteration from july 1 to august 31 the second deviation from observed beluga behavior was that use of cell 1 knik arm which in initial model runs was very low during the entire year despite evidence that belugas use this area intensively during the late summer and fall castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a shelden et al 2015 this is also the cell where the port of alaska is located and in our model the cell where the anthropogenic disturbance was simulated while we had escapement and harvest data for sockeye and coho salmon in cell 1 primarily from july september with a peak in august total daily numbers of fish were low compared with other cells during that time in our dataset this may be because small and medium size sockeye and coho runs occur in numerous rivers and creeks in knik arm and so likely add up to a substantial number of fish but escapement is only monitored in one location for each species to somewhat correct for this we used the prey data from july 5 to september 20 from cell 6 susitna to characterize cell 1 during august 15 october 31 appendix b this effectively extended the length of time abundant prey were available to cibs fig b3 the results below are from models with these modifications 3 1 baseline scenario foraging activity was highest in the summer and lowest in the spring with an average of 81 1 summer june aug 67 4 fall sept nov 66 8 winter dec feb and 61 7 spring mar may of time spent foraging table 3 fig d2 when not foraging simulated pregnant cibs spent more time resting than traveling in the spring 32 0 resting vs 6 3 traveling and winter 32 1 vs 1 1 whereas time spent between the two behaviors was more evenly distributed in the summer 8 2 vs 10 7 and fall 15 9 vs 16 7 variation in cell use primarily followed temporospatial changes in the prey landscape from may to august simulated pregnant cibs primarily used in no particular order cell 6 susitna cell 2 turnagain arm cell 3 chickaloon bay cell 4 potters creek cell 16 kasilof cell 22 ninilchik and cell 1 knik arm fig 3 spatial use in other months can be found in fig d3 we do not provide a description here because the spatial location of prey resources used to parameterize the model during these months was informed by the current habitat use of belugas as such spatial predictions of habitat use during these months are not truly an emergent model property daily mean gross energy costs of pregnant cibs in the baseline scenario ranged from 150 1 to 192 6 mj day 1 with the highest values in summer when the time spent foraging was greatest table 3 fetal energy costs were at their highest point during the second summer of gestation with a maximum of 70 3 mj day 1 spent on fetal maintenance and growth just prior to parturition daily mean energy gain exceeded costs by 4 8 82 8 13 8 in the spring summer and fall respectively but were 25 8 lower than mean daily energy costs in winter table 3 daily mean prey consumption was 48 2 kg day 1 summer 25 5 kg day 1 fall 16 8 kg day 1 winter and 19 7 kg day 1 spring across the entire gestation period average energy consumption of a single whale exceeded energy costs by 30 1 100 486 mj vs 77 225 mj most prey consumption occurred during the summer 52 9 compared with other seasons 9 3 22 9 which was due to both intensive foraging activity on abundant prey and because the gestation period spanned two summers from april to august in the following year when broken up by year a greater mean percentage of the total prey was consumed in the first summer compared with the second 29 0 vs 23 9 but when differences in the length of each summer were considered the average daily rate of prey consumption was higher in the second summer 52 7 kg day 1 vs 45 9 kg day 1 female blubber mass dynamics exhibited strong seasonality with rapid increases in may and early june during the simulated eulachon runs fig 4 regardless of initial starting blubber mass all pregnant cibs reached the maximum blubber mass allowed in the first summer the timing of when that maximum was first reached depended on initial starting mass but it occurred no later than mid july blubber masses were largely maintained at the maximum until the beginning of october after this time blubber masses steadily declined until the following may at the lowest point in the second calendar year mean female blubber mass was 275 2 kg or 29 3 of body mass maximum daily blubber mass changes were 9 3 kg in spring and summer 1 5 kg in fall and 0 11 kg in winter these values were low in the fall because whales had largely reached the maximum allowed blubber mass during that time all pregnant cibs were able to maximize their blubber mass just prior to parturition fetal blubber mass dynamics followed an exponential pattern with very small gains between april and december and rapid growth thereafter until the following august at the time of birth mean fetal blubber mass was 51 7 kg mean female and calf survival probability at the end of the simulation were 98 7 and 97 4 respectively 3 2 disturbance scenarios female blubber mass dynamics in the disturbance scenarios generally followed similar seasonal patterns as in the baseline scenario but the specific values at any given time varied among scenarios fig 5 a if prey were abundant during the summer pregnant whales achieved reasonably high blubber masses at the end of the simulation under the no eulachon scenario 461 2 kg out of a maximum allowed of 543 0 kg when prey energy gain was reduced to 75 of baseline values from may to october 75 salmon eulachon scenario mean terminal blubber mass was reduced by 22 3 422 3 kg or 38 9 of body mass most whales were able to achieve maximum allowable mass gains or close to it in the first summer and fall but because it took them longer to do so this ultimately resulted in reduced blubber mass at the time of parturition when this 75 reduction only applied to values from mid june to october 75 salmon scenario mean terminal blubber masses were 498 6 kg 42 9 of body mass this was still below baseline but considerably higher than values from the 75 salmon eulachon scenario indicating that availability of energy rich prey buffers against changes in prey availability for other species even if it only occurs during a short time window reductions in prey energy gain to 50 of baseline had considerable impacts on blubber mass gain with mean terminal blubber masses of 153 6 kg 18 7 of body mass 50 salmon eulachon scenario and 317 6 kg 32 3 body mass 50 salmon scenario the simulated disturbance had no effect on terminal blubber masses when prey were abundant with all whales still achieving a mean of 540 kg of blubber mass at the end of the simulation disturbance scenario when it coincided with reductions in prey energy gain disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario terminal blubber masses were on average 76 5 of what they were in the absence of disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario indicating synergistic effects between prey availability and disruptions to foraging activity the number of disturbances experienced by simulated belugas was similar between the two scenarios with an average of 41 3 disturbance scenario and 42 1 times disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario per whale the simulated disturbance resulted in more lost time than the nominal disturbance time a single 6 hour time step for 6 days of the week as whales were forced to travel to a new cell and subsequently chose to travel back only to be disturbed again the following day thus this simulated disturbance reflects the effects of 6 lost foraging days per week and may be a more severe energetic effect than actual responses to a daily 6 hour disturbance since whales may simply move a short distance away or remain in the vicinity of the disturbance mean terminal fetal blubber masses remained unchanged from the baseline 51 5 51 7 kg for all disturbance scenarios except for the two scenarios where prey energy gain was 50 of the baseline 33 1 kg and 44 3 kg and the scenario that paired reductions in prey energy gain with anthropogenic disturbance 43 9 kg fig 5b mean female survival probability ranged from 14 7 to 98 7 table d1 in almost all scenarios with reduced energy gain from prey or changes in prey availability mean survival was reduced by a minimum of 1 7 below baseline values fig 5a the one exception was for the 75 salmon scenario where the availability of energy dense prey early in the season allowed whales to maintain survival rates despite small reductions in energy gain from other prey resources for scenarios where prey energy gain was 50 of baseline values poor survival was due to both adult mortality and poor body condition at the end of the simulation model predictions of calf survival followed similar patterns as female survival which was to be expected given it was in part conditioned on female survival for scenarios with a 50 reduction in prey energy gain or where anthropogenic disturbance co occurred with a reduction in prey energy gain this reduction was because of both reduced female and calf condition at time of birth even in the absence of maternal mortality when calf survival was calculated solely based on calf condition it was still reduced by 2 1 to 14 5 below baseline in these three disturbance scenarios 3 3 sensitivity scenarios the sensitivity analysis scenarios largely resulted in similar temporal patterns in female blubber mass fluctuations as in the baseline scenario with the lowest values observed in early may just prior to the start of the simulated eulachon run summer and fall behavior remained largely unchanged from baseline as simulated belugas still exhibited intensive foraging when prey were abundant sensitivity scenarios largely impacted the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations with more abundant winter prey resulting in belugas that were in good body condition year round and less abundant winter prey resulting in a minimal blubber mass that was on average 130 kg lower than the baseline scenario fig 6 in the absence of disturbance female and calf survival in all sensitivity scenarios were the same or very similar as in the baseline scenario 98 0 98 7 and 96 7 97 4 respectively table d1 disturbance scenarios generally had similar effects on survival and reproductive success as in the baseline values with respect to order but the magnitude of the impact and specific value of survival varied among scenarios table d1 for example when the amount of prey energy gained from foraging was increased from 40 mj to 55 mj increased winter prey all disturbance scenarios had similar female 98 3 98 7 and calf 97 1 97 4 survival estimates as the non disturbance scenario except for the 50 salmon eulachon scenario survival estimates for this scenario were 62 6 female and 57 9 calf considerably higher than corresponding values from the baseline scenario 14 7 and 12 4 respectively when winter prey energy was reduced to 30 mj survival estimates were not only lower but complete mortality was observed during the winter and spring in all but two of the disturbance scenarios 75 salmon and 75 salmon eulachon 4 discussion the development of the sdp model described in this paper represents the first step in achieving the end goal of developing a lifetime population consequences of disturbance pcod model to help inform management decisions for the recovery of cibs with a population of just under 300 individuals tools like this are critical to better understand the current causes of the cib decline predict how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes may impact this population and develop mitigation measures to help alleviate such effects while there are limitations to what we can infer from our results primarily because relatively little is known about beluga prey preferences and prey availability in cook inlet our model provides insights into the conditions under which reductions in reproductive success and survival might be expected and provides a tangible product to managers to illustrate the value of behavioral models and the need for obtaining currently unavailable data that can be incorporated into the existing model framework it also highlights a key discrepancy in spatial use of the kenai and kasilof rivers between model output and empirical data that warrants further attention below we provide a discussion of key outputs and how they compare with empirical data highlighting areas of further research to obtain critical data for the successful application of this model by managers table 4 4 1 time activity budgets seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort and body condition have been documented in many beluga populations and are assumed to reflect seasonal changes in prey availability breton honeyman et al 2016 cornick et al 2016 huntington and the communities of buckland 1999 kilabuk 1998 koski and finley 2002 in our model a seasonal pattern of increased foraging effort emerged in response to abundant prey from may september which is consistent with empirical observations foraging was still the predominant behavior in other months but there was an increase in the occurrence of resting behaviors from october to april the sensitivity analyses for winter energy gain resulted in changes in the magnitude of blubber reserve fluctuations with less pronounced fluctuations in blubber reserves when winter prey energy was increased seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort and hence blubber mass still occurred even when winter prey energy gain was great enough for simulated whales to maintain high blubber masses year round indicating the mere presence of seasonality in prey resources regardless of how it affects energy balance is sufficient to induce variation in foraging effort these model outputs provide support for assumptions that prey availability for cibs is lower in the winter than during summer months which are based on observations of intensive foraging in summer on salmon and eulachon pronounced differences in blubber thickness between spring and fall and slower transit rates in summer compared with winter goetz et al 2012b huntington 2000 data from acoustic moorings are also suggestive of lower levels of feeding activity by cibs during winter but also could reflect foraging on benthic prey or in unmonitored offshore waters castellote et al 2020 while foraging effort was reduced from october to april prey energy gain during these months was still critical in ensuring simulated pregnant cibs survived even when they were able to maximize their blubber reserves during summer months given key knowledge gaps in prey availability quantitative comparisons between model output and empirical data are largely uninformative and should be cautiously interpreted for example the percentage time spent foraging in winter and spring was still considerably high 61 7 67 4 but this value is based on our assumptions that the prey landscape during this time is comprised of continuously available prey with a low energy return while foraging if instead the prey landscape from october to april was temporally and or energetically non uniform it is likely that different values for time activity budgets would emerge from the model model predictions of the occurrence of foraging behavior may be slightly high particularly during summer when the model indicated belugas should spend over 80 of their time foraging in comparison lydersen et al 2001 found that belugas from svalbard spent roughly 63 of the summer and autumn in presumed foraging behaviors with a peak monthly estimate of 72 while this would seem to provide support that our model overestimated the amount of time spent foraging cibs and those in svalbard consume different prey species and it is possible that differences in time activity budgets simply reflect the underlying temporal variation in prey availability the potential overestimate in time spent foraging speaks more to errors in the model parameterization rather than errors in the model itself which could be resolved with additional data in our model prey were available at most model time steps but this may not be an accurate assumption since it is possible that prey abundance or foraging efficiency fluctuates throughout the day as environmental conditions change for example chinook and sockeye salmon entering the kenai river took advantage of the flood tide to move rapidly into the river welch et al 2014 which would likely influence beluga foraging behavior in addition we assumed that there were no restrictions on prey availability during the above slack phase however the tidal cycle and how it affects habitat and prey availability is much more complex and there still may be access issues at some high tide levels that limit foraging opportunities behaviors were also assumed to occur for the entire time step when a whale may not need 6 h of continuous foraging to achieve high rates of prey energy gain particularly when prey are abundant or when a whale s stomach is partially full this assumption would result in overestimates of the amount of time spent foraging 4 2 energy balance and blubber mass dynamics during intensive foraging in the summer simulated whales consumed an average of 48 2 kg day 1 about 4 of mean body mass during the summer almost 2 times their energy requirements resulting in a maximum blubber gain of 9 3 kg day 1 about 1 of body mass this allowed them to rapidly increase their body condition from 29 3 blubber mass relative to total body mass to 45 between may and mid july in the first summer of gestation model predictions of prey consumption and rates of blubber mass gain may be too high given the potential overestimate in foraging effort although these consumption estimates are feasible for marine mammals particularly for species that exhibit seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort for example owen et al 2017 estimated that humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae consumed 1 2 3 4 times their daily energy requirements whereas savoca et al 2021 estimated that baleen whales consumed between 5 and 30 of their body mass daily depending on prey type a cross sectional study of belugas from bristol bay alaska indicated that adults increased blubber mass relative to total body mass from 33 in may to 48 in september cornick et al 2016 a rate that is roughly two times lower than our model estimates these estimates are not directly comparable to our model output since they are cross sectional were not collected from reproductively active females and may be artificially depressed if whales reached such high blubber masses prior to the sampling in september i e if blubber mass plateaued prior to sampling they do however provide some indication that further adjustments to model parameters that influence the rate of blubber mass gain may be needed such as the prey landscape or stomach fullness model estimates of summer prey consumption were considerably higher than daily food consumption of belugas in aquaria which average around 11 15 kg day 1 kastelein et al 1994 such discrepancies are not unexpected particularly given that belugas in zoological institutions are fed daily do not experience seasonal fluctuations in food availability and are unlikely to experience the same energetic costs as free ranging belugas because of different environmental conditions and activity patterns estimates from belugas in aquaria are also largely derived from non reproductive individuals for comparison three harvested cibs with relatively full stomachs had between 15 0 and 27 8 kg of salmon in their stomachs along with other prey items quakenbush et al 2015 additional data on beluga energetics and foraging success would help refine our estimates of energy expenditure and gain including metabolic data to identify any seasonal variation in metabolic rates and behavioral data to quantify activity levels during foraging 4 3 spatial use spatial predictions can be an emergent property of this model but here they are not entirely so because we used the spatial distribution of cibs to characterize the prey landscape from october to april for these months we can conclude that spatial variation in prey abundance would generate the general patterns we observe in nature but they are not confirmatory since the distribution and abundance of prey during these months is unknown because model output from may to august was largely informed by the prey data themselves either the harvest escapement data or timing and locations of eulachon runs rather than beluga distributions we limit our discussion below to these months empirical data on the spatial use of cibs comes from aerial surveys goetz et al 2012a vessel sightings mcguire et al 2020a acoustic moorings castellote et al 2021 2016 opportunistic sightings shelden et al 2015 traditional ecological knowledge carter and nielsen 2011 huntington 2000 and limited satellite tracking data goetz et al 2012b hobbs et al 2005 shelden et al 2018 2015 results from these studies indicate that cibs are largely concentrated in upper cook inlet during summer and fall with concentrated use of the susitna region from beluga river to the west to little susitna river to the east knik and turnagain arms chickaloon bay and the east and west coasts of the inlet to west and east foreland from 2008 to 2022 few if any belugas were seen in knik arm during aerial surveys in the month of june for unknown reasons shelden et al 2017 2015 but have been consistently detected from visual and acoustic surveys as early as april with peak presence in the fall castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a a northeastward range contraction occurred from the 1970s to the early 2000s resulting in belugas being concentrated in upper cook inlet close to anchorage rugh et al 2010 shelden et al 2015 shelden and wade 2019 the reason for this contraction is unknown but hypotheses include changes in habitat including prey availability predation risk by killer whales orcinus orca or the abandonment of poorer quality habitat as the population declined rugh et al 2010 model output of spatial use from may august indicated high use of cell 6 susitna with intermittent use of cells 1 knik arm 2 turnagain arm 3 chickaloon bay 4 potters creek 16 kasilof and 22 ninilchik these results are generally consistent with empirical observations showing concentration of cibs in the upper inlet during these months with some key deviations while the model predicted use of turnagain arm during may there were very limited occurrences of whales in this cell in august which is inconsistent with observations during this month mcguire et al 2020a model predictions indicated some use of the mid inlet in june cells 16 and 22 and july cell 22 cibs are not currently observed in these areas during summer months but oral histories indicate belugas were sometimes abundant in both areas from the 1920s to 1930s until the 1980s to 1990s dutton et al 2012 similarly initial model runs indicated the kenai and kasilof rivers and surrounding areas should be important habitat for cibs particularly in july and august belugas have been notably absent from these rivers during these months in recent years although they have used this area historically carter and nielsen 2011 dutton et al 2012 huntington 2000 shelden et al 2015 which is why we excluded foraging in these cells during july and august in our final model despite available and abundant prey data use of the kenai river does occur in other months with whales typically being acoustically and visually detected starting in september and continuing throughout the winter and into early may castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a mismatches between model output and empirical data are likely driven by the lack of prey data for areas of critical beluga habitat upper cook inlet cells or indicative that prey availability is unlikely to be the sole driver of the cib range contraction and habitat use more generally in parameterizing the prey landscape all cells with data included the period of range contraction 2000s onward with some cells also having escapement or harvest data dating back as early as the 1960s table b1 thus model predictions that belugas should use cells in mid cook inlet are not because of biases in the temporal distribution of prey data pre versus post contraction hypotheses about changes in spatial use due to predation risk or contraction to optimal habitats during a population decline are neither supported nor refuted by our model the influence of predation risk on habitat use could easily be tested by incorporating a spatially and if desired temporally explicit mortality parameter in the backward iteration which accounts for the fact that perceived risk of predation may influence behavioral decisions about habitat use castellote et al 2022 in this model we used a single value because there is very limited information on the presence of transient killer whales in cook inlet shelden et al 2003 the kenai river also supports a large commercial fishery and sport and personal fisheries during the summer which may make this area suboptimal due to disturbance or accessibility issues while such disturbances can easily be incorporated into the model either in the backward iteration or forward simulation it is challenging to do so in a meaningful way without a better understanding of the prey landscape and how belugas perceive and respond to fishing activity for example removal of foraging as a behavioral choice in the kenai and kasilof cells during july and august resulted in predicted habitat use similar to what is currently observed but without knowing how accessible this habitat is to belugas and what the prey availability is during those times of accessibility we can only conclude that accessibility issues should remain as a potential hypothesis further efforts are thus needed to understand why belugas do not use these mid inlet areas in july and august during peak prey abundance particularly given indications that prey availability may be hindering population recovery warlick 2022 one area that remains a considerable unknown is the role that cultural information plays in influencing habitat use and how the loss of older individuals from the population may alter this information wade et al 2012 williams and lusseau 2006 the movement of simulated pregnant cibs was largely confined to a few discrete cells while it has been reported that belugas will often remain in the same location for weeks when prey are abundant citta et al 2016 hobbs et al 2005 lydersen et al 2001 other factors in the model could have led to this behavior these factors include perfect knowledge of the environment in the baseline scenario i e they encountered the expected environment in the forward simulation that whales may make decisions based on reasons unrelated to energy gain and the lack of environmental features that may facilitate movement or make it more energetically beneficial to move e g tidal activity for example some belugas in svalbard moved to other distant foraging areas despite abundant prey in their current location which the authors hypothesized may be adaptive behavior in a fluctuating environment lydersen et al 2001 incorporating environmental uncertainty into behavioral decisions in sdp models is possible but this added complexity may not be overly informative since cook inlet is relatively small and there may be more uniformity in responses of prey communities to environmental fluctuations tidal activity influences cib behavior but incorporating these effects into a model are challenging because relationships appear to be site specific howe et al 2015 huntington 2000 indicating behaviors may be driven by more than just energy savings 4 4 environmental change and disturbance in the cib recovery plan anthropogenic disturbance and prey availability are listed as high and medium threats to population recovery respectively national marine fisheries service 2016 cumulative effects from multiple stressors are also listed as a threat of high concern and while there are significant barriers to assessing these impacts in marine mammal populations the combination of multiple stressors is increasingly identified as a concern for marine mammal populations cervin et al 2020 national academies of science engineering and medicine 2017 pirotta et al 2019 silva et al 2021 williams et al 2021 the model output provides insight into specific conditions under which disturbance could impact cib vital rates at least when the only consideration is direct impacts on energy balance specifically the lack of an effect of the simulated anthropogenic disturbance in isolation suggests that if prey are abundant during the summer and early fall and prey during winter is above some critical threshold pregnant cibs at asymptotic length should be able to cope with intermittent disruptions to foraging gain during these months such as those experienced by the port of alaska modernization program there were synergistic impacts when the simulated anthropogenic disturbance co occurred with reductions in prey availability highlighting the need to assess anthropogenic impacts on cibs within the context of resource availability given that body conditions of the current population are unknown it is impossible to know whether the scenario showing no energetic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on pregnant cibs is applicable drone technology cannot yet be used to estimate body condition in cibs as it has for other cetaceans e g christiansen et al 2020 stewart et al 2021 because the waters of cook inlet are too turbid to photograph below the surface other data however suggest that conditions in the inlet may be suboptimal for example a recent estimate of the interbirth interval of cibs himes boor et al 2023 warlick 2022 was considerably longer than previously documented for cibs and other beluga populations harwood et al 2015 jacobson et al 2020 mosnier et al 2015 suydam 2009 in other cetacean species longer interbirth intervals or reduced calving rates have been associated with poor body condition and adverse environmental conditions gailey et al 2020 ijsseldijk et al 2021 kershaw et al 2021 meyer gutbrod et al 2021 seyboth et al 2021 providing some indication that cibs are unlikely to be in optimal body condition and that synergistic impacts may be more likely for this population the average lifespan of cibs also appears to be considerably shorter than the potential lifespan of belugas although causes of mortality are largely unknown mcguire et al 2021 adverse effects of reductions in prey energy gain on survival probability meant to simulate a reduction in prey availability were in large part driven by effects in the second summer of pregnancy when energy gain was reduced to 75 of baseline values access to prey into october allowed whales to achieve near maximum fat masses during the first summer of gestation this was not possible in the second summer because parturition occurred at the beginning of august resulting in reduced female blubber masses at the time of birth under scenarios where prey energy gain was severely reduced 50 of baseline whales were unable to achieve large gains in mass in the summer and fall there was an increase in the percentage of time spent foraging during the fall to help compensate for this reduced prey gain although it was insufficient to offset such severe reductions in prey energy gain even for pregnant females that survived simulations with 50 reduced prey such a prolonged reduction could result in starvation since some females experienced a net loss in blubber mass across the simulation the availability of energy dense prey early in the season modeled here as eulachon even if only for a relatively short period of time helped buffer against reductions in prey energy gain particularly when those reductions were severe highlighting the importance of spring eulachon runs for cibs much of the focus on understanding cib prey preferences has been on salmonids since they appear to be a critical prey resource for this population during summer and early fall when belugas are accumulating blubber reserves to presumably help sustain them during reduced prey availability in other times of the year while model results indicate that prey availability during this time is indeed critical they also highlight the importance of understanding prey availability during other times of the year indeed it was the interplay between the winter and summer prey availability that was important as changes in winter prey either exacerbated or buffered against adverse effects on energy gain during the summer months we modeled prey availability as a reduction in energy availability within a given cell however our results would also apply if prey shifted their distribution to areas that were less accessible to belugas or if energy gained from foraging is effectively reduced in some other way sea ice concentration which was not included in our model is important to consider in future efforts because of its influence on beluga habitat use asselin et al 2011 hornby et al 2016 loseto et al 2006 in cook inlet belugas are commonly found in very open 1 24 ice concentration and open 25 68 pack ice in the winter goetz et al 2012b but associate with habitats that range from ice free to compact pack ice up to 92 moore et al 2000 shelden et al 2018 reductions in sea ice concentrations may allow belugas to expand their winter range heide jørgensen et al 2010 but also may indirectly impact behavior through ecosystem changes hauser et al 2018 incorporating the effects of sea ice on habitat accessibility in our model is relatively straightforward and could be achieved in one or more ways for example it could be modeled by increasing the probability of mortality at high sea ice concentrations because of increased difficulty in finding breathing holes or belugas could simply be excluded from accessing cells with high ice concentrations similar to how we excluded belugas from the kenai and kasilof rivers both options would require little change to the existing model structure to incorporate effects of sea ice on prey availability if known could simply be incorporated into the existing spatially and temporally explicit prey landscape requiring no additional modifications to the model there also may be thermoregulatory changes associated with reduced sea ice and increased warming but a better understanding of how water temperature body condition and metabolic rates interact is needed before such effect could meaningfully be incorporated into the model 4 5 conservation implications behavioral models can provide relevant information to managers for planning human activities and mitigating associated risks to wildlife populations a key feature of sdp models is that decisions here the decision to forage travel or rest are an emergent model property based on the assumption that animals act to maximize the expected future value of a reward here reproductive success which allows for predictions to be based on a population that can potentially adapt their behavior to novel environmental conditions the model described herein is an initial effort to fill a critical information gap for management of cibs a population that has a 19 32 probability of extinction in the next 150 years if vital rates and environmental variability remain unchanged warlick 2022 our model provides insight into habitat use and distribution of cibs notably that prey availability alone is unlikely to have caused the range contraction necessitating further efforts to understand why belugas are not currently using areas of cook inlet that presumably have abundant prey like the kenai river perhaps most importantly model output indicates that the effects of disturbance from human activities on cibs are inextricably linked with prey availability making it impossible to accurately assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in isolation this elevates the importance of better understanding cib behavioral responses to disturbances and collecting prey and beluga body condition data which also would help increase the utility of the model described in this paper through parameterization and or calibration such data are challenging to collect in cook inlet but recent efforts using environmental dna have been successful in characterizing

24142,climate change and disturbance from human activities are key threats facing many wildlife populations worldwide the ability to quantify the effects of such threats on individual health and population dynamics is critical for effective management and conservation we used stochastic dynamic programming sdp a method for implementing state dependent life history theory to explore the impacts of changes in prey availability and anthropogenic disturbance on survival and reproductive success of cook inlet belugas delphinapterus leucas cib an endangered and isolated population in decline we predicted behavioral decisions whether to forage travel to a new location or rest of pregnant cibs within a spatially and seasonally dynamic prey landscape we used those decisions to explore time activity budgets and spatial use under a variety of hypothetical environmental scenarios and estimate the resulting impacts on body condition and vital rates in all scenarios foraging activity was highest during summer to capitalize on abundant prey which in the model was assumed to be eulachon thaleichthys pacificus and salmonids oncorhynchus spp this resulted in large increases in blubber reserves that pregnant cibs relied on during october to april when prey was assumed to be less abundant prey availability outside of summer months was still critical as it either exacerbated or buffered against reductions in prey availability during summer months spatial predictions of habitat use indicated that pregnant cibs should forage in areas used historically that now appear to be abandoned suggesting that prey availability alone is unlikely to explain the recent range contraction of cibs to upper cook inlet reductions in prey availability from late spring to early fall adversely affected vital rates but intermittent disturbances that resulted in lost foraging opportunities such as those caused by anthropogenic activities during the ice free season had little impact on body condition or vital rates if prey were abundant during the summer and early fall accurate assessment of the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on cibs requires robust data on both disturbances and year round prey availability as intermittent disturbances adversely affected survival and reproductive success when they occurred in environments with reduced prey availability our model represents an initial effort to fill a critical information gap for informing cib management decisions providing insights into conditions under which reductions in vital rates might be expected

natives was originally thought to be a primary factor for the decline but the cib population failed to recover after hunting restrictions were enacted in 1999 hypotheses for the lack of recovery include insufficient prey availability noise pollution habitat loss loss of cultural information and social cohesion and stranding events some of which may be exacerbated by cumulative effects and climate change cib recovery plan national marine fisheries service 2016 shelden et al 2021 human influences are of particular concern given the proximity of belugas to anchorage which lies at the northern end of cook inlet and is home to roughly 40 of alaska s population https live laborstats alaska gov cen 2020 census data html the decline in cib population size coincided with a summer range contraction from 7000 km2 to 3000 km2 that concentrated the population in upper cook inlet where there is a high degree of human disturbance rugh et al 2010 particularly from noise pollution sources of noise pollution include vessel traffic aircraft traffic pile driving sub bottom profiling dredging oil and gas drilling seismic surveys and military activities castellote et al 2019 many beluga populations are experiencing changes in sea ice dynamics and prey community composition resulting in diet shifts changes in habitat use and in some cases reductions in body condition choy et al 2020 hauser 2016 heide jørgensen et al 2010 vacquié garcia et al 2018 yurkowski et al 2017 the diet of belugas is typically diverse but it is often dominated by just a few species at any given time choy et al 2020 loseto et al 2009 marcoux et al 2012 quakenbush et al 2015 anadromous fish are key prey species for cibs from spring to fall castellote et al 2021 huntington 2000 quakenbush et al 2015

sockeye salmon up the kenai river huntington 2000 quakenbush et al 2015 many key species are also commercially recreationally and individually subsistence fished in cook inlet with some species likely to be affected by recent and future warming temperatures kovach et al 2015 schoen et al 2017 von biela et al 2022 while no empirical data on prey consumption of cibs exist it is generally believed that intensive foraging occurs during the spring and summer on salmonids and other anadromous fish based on acoustic data and traditional ecological knowledge castellote et al 2020 huntington 2000 prey preferences particularly during the fall to spring period are not well known but non anadromous fish such as saffron cod eleginus gracilis and flatfish and invertebrates have been found in stomachs of cibs quakenbush et al 2015 despite an increase in research efforts in the last decade many information gaps in the ecology of cibs remain limiting effective management of this population that lack of information is due at least in part to environmental conditions such as winter ice cover turbid waters and extreme tidal range that make it difficult to conduct field research only recently have there been limited efforts to understand how prey availability and human activities considered separately or together might influence cib population dynamics norman et al 2020 found that per capita birth rate of cibs was related to prey abundance in a known hotspot of beluga use goetz et al 2012a although the analysis was limited to a single prey species and river tributary the recent effort by warlick 2022 who used an integrated population model ipm parameterized with data from a greater number of sites and prey species identified positive relationships between an index of prey abundance and cib fecundity rates and survival of older calves providing the best evidence to date that prey availability may be one of the factors hindering population recovery in this ipm analysis proxies for anthropogenic stressors including the human population size in anchorage hazardous spill volume and shipping traffic were not correlated with vital rates however the data available for these metrics may be too coarse to detect potential effects and further investigation is needed to better understand whether anthropogenic stressors are adversely affecting cibs warlick 2022 the population consequences of disturbance pcod framework is one that conceptualizes how disturbances that occur at the individual level translate to changes in population dynamics through linkages between behavior health and vital rates new et al 2014 wartzok and tyack 2008 since its inception in 2005 pcod models have been used to investigate the impacts of a variety of non lethal anthropogenic and natural stressors on marine mammal populations primarily using some metric of energy as the variable that links behavioral changes to vital rates keen et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018a applications of this framework are still limited given most pcod models require considerable data on a species biology in a preliminary implementation of this framework for cibs an expert elicitation workshop was held in 2016 to quantify relationships between disturbance and birth rate and calf survival which were then used to understand the impact of a variety of hypothetical disturbance scenarios on these parameters tollit et al 2016 while a useful first step this effort was limited in its application to management decisions since it relied solely on opinion rather than empirical data not only is it difficult to validate output but it did not account for potential interactions between disturbance and environmental conditions the ability to assess such interactions is necessary because the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors is identified in the noaa fisheries cib recovery plan a document that describes the research management actions necessary to support species recovery as a threat of high relative concern national marine fisheries service 2016 the cumulative impacts of multiple stressors is a growing concern for many wildlife populations national academies of science engineering and medicine 2017 orr et al 2020 and simultaneous mitigation of anthropogenic stressors noise pollution and prey availability through fisheries management actions has been identified as the most likely mechanism for reversing the population decline of the endangered beluga population in st lawrence estuary canada williams et al 2021 to address the gaps in our understanding of the impacts of prey availability and disturbance on cib survival and reproductive success we developed a model to predict the movement and foraging decisions of pregnant cibs in a spatially and temporally dynamic environment using stochastic dynamic programming sdp stochastic dynamic programming a term referring to both the model itself and the mathematical method for solving the model clark and mangel 2000 houston et al 1988 is a way to implement state dependent life history theory or the strategic decisions an animal should make over its lifetime or a part of it based on their intrinsic state and external conditions mcnamara and houston 1996 we used these decisions to predict the effects of a variety of informed environmental and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios on female condition survival and reproductive success focusing on pregnant females not only because of increasing evidence suggesting fecundity may be depressed himes boor et al 2023 warlick 2022 but also because the dynamics are simpler to model and parameterize than for other reproductive stages this effort should be considered an initial step in a larger effort to develop a full pcod model for cibs that can be used to predict the effects of different management actions on the population as such we focus much of our discussion on general patterns and highlight specific data needs that would help refine model parameterization and increase the utility of the model for making predictions about cibs 2 methods 2 1 model overview stochastic dynamic programming sdp models can be used to predict how an individual should behave assuming they act in a way that maximizes some expected future reward and that this reward varies depending on the state of the animal for example we expect that an individual in poor body condition the state might undertake a risky foraging strategy the behavior in their attempt to survive the reward as they are balancing the tradeoffs associated with predation and starvation similarly we might expect such decisions to vary depending on how far the animal is from some endpoint or time horizon such as the end of their natural lifespan once predictions are made for all possible combinations of state variables at each time step of the model referred to here as the backward iteration predictions can be used to understand the sequence of behaviors that emerge within a population referred to here as the forward simulation for this model we determined whether a pregnant beluga whale should choose to forage travel or rest the behavior depending on three intrinsic state variables pregnant female blubber mass fetal blubber mass pregnant female stomach fullness and two extrinsic state variables location tidal phase from the first day of pregnancy to birth the time horizon assuming she is attempting to maximize her expected future reproductive success the reward based here on the sum of her own survival probability and that of her fetus once it is born referred to here as calf survival the following sections provide further detail on each of these model components including the specific values and bounds of state variables and the state dynamics how state variables change under each behavior and the derivation of fitness using the sdp equations the state dynamics section primarily focuses on how pregnant female and fetal blubber mass change due to the energy costs and gains associated with behavior in essence a bioenergetic model a simplified schematic of the model is shown in fig 1 including where the bioenergetic model is integrated into the backward iteration and forward simulation as the model is focused on a single gestation event we chose parameter values based on an adult cib female at asymptotic length 383 cm vos et al 2020 r versions 4 0 4 2 were used to run the model and all associated analyses r core team 2022 2 2 time horizon and time steps the model was run from cib conception assumed to be april 16th to birth t assumed to be august 4th in the year following conception lasting a total of 475 days robeck et al 2015 the date of birth was based on estimates from fetal and calf morphology shelden et al 2020 and timing of neonate observations mcguire et al 2020b the date of conception was then assumed to occur 475 days prior neonates have been observed as early as july and as late as october in cook inlet mcguire et al 2020b but for model simplicity we assume fixed times for conception and birth it is possible to allow a range of conception and birth times but it would require a different model structure and is outside the scope of this initial model the backward iteration which identifies the optimal behavioral decision for all combinations of state variables was assessed at a time step of 1 day although the physiological dynamics were assessed at a 6 h time step since this was the time step used in the forward simulation to approximately match the length of a tidal phase thus the backward iteration output for a given combination of state variables represented the optimal behavioral decision for a 6 h period for each day this approach assumes that the future expected fitness of each behavior and thus the optimal behavioral decision does not vary within a single day which helped to reduce computational time for the backward iteration while maintaining higher temporal resolution in the forward simulation 2 3 state variables we used blubber mass x t at time t with a particular value denoted by x as the metric to describe a female s energy reserves blubber mass was bounded by a critical x c r i t and upper limit x m a x mortality was assumed to occur when blubber mass was below x c r i t we assumed that x c r i t and x m a x occurred at 80 kg and 543 kg or when blubber mass was 12 or 45 of estimated body mass respectively appendix a behavioral decisions were assessed at 10 kg intervals between x c r i t and x m a x this interval was chosen to balance computational efficiency with discriminatory ability given the total range of blubber mass and daily fluctuations in blubber masses we used fetal blubber mass x f t at time t with a particular value denoted by x f to describe the energy reserves of the fetus as above this variable was bounded by x f c r i t which was assumed to be 0 kg based on the findings that an aborted fetus had essentially no blubber layer burek huntington et al 2015 the upper bound x f m a x was set at 60 of estimated body mass at any given time and thus increased exponentially as the fetus grew appendix a behavioral decisions were assessed at 74 discrete fetal blubber masses from 0 kg to 52 kg intervals were not constant because fetal growth is exponential and blubber masses are very small during early gestation at very small blubber masses we assessed behavioral choices at fetal blubber masses that differed by 0 0001 kg 0 1 kg with increments of 0 01 when blubber masses were 0 01 kg increments of 0 01 kg when blubber masses were between 0 01 and 0 1 and increments of 0 1 when blubber masses were between 0 1 and 1 0 kg from 1 kg in blubber mass onwards we used increments of 1 kg stomach fullness s t at time t with a particular value s described the proportion of prey intake relative to the maximum that could be consumed per time step thus influencing the amount of prey that could be consumed the maximum amount of prey that could be consumed per time step was based on estimates of forestomach capacity and clearance rate see section 2 4 physiological parameters since these estimates resulted in a forestomach that could be filled and cleared within a single time step this state variable essentially represented the proportion of the forestomach that was full with a value of 1 0 being full and a value of 0 5 being empty behaviors were assessed in 0 1 increments ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 location hereafter referred to as cell c t at time t with a particular value c was one of 27 discretized cells in cook inlet fig 2 cell boundaries were delineated based on cib distribution and available prey data average travel distances between each cell were calculated based on cell midpoints cells differed in the amount of energy gained from foraging at any given time see section 2 5 state dynamics when referencing cells in the results and discussion we provide not only the number but also the general geographic area represented by the cell such as knik arm and the susitna delta tidal phase p t at time t with a particular value p was included given the large tidal flux throughout the estuary which is known to influence beluga movement and behavior this state variable had two phases one which encompassed high tide and the upper portions of the rising and falling tide above slack and one that encompassed low tide and the lower portions of the rising and falling tide below slack we split the tidal cycle around slack tide instead of having it encompass solely the rising or falling tide based on observations of beluga behavior and the assumption that water levels must reach some critical threshold to allow access to mud flats or river entrances which are exposed at low tide huntington 2000 tidal activity strongly influences cib movements in portions of their habitat but the relationship between tidal height and behavior is not uniform throughout cook inlet ezer et al 2008 shelden et al 2015 small et al 2017 for example in some areas low tidal heights may make habitat inaccessible whereas in others foraging is observed around river mouths at low tide more research is needed to properly parameterize inlet wide and year round influence of tides on cib movement behavior and energetics as such its inclusion here as a state variable is largely a placeholder to show how it could be included in future efforts 2 4 physiological parameters the dynamics of female and fetal blubber mass depended on how much energy a female beluga expended how much energy she gained from foraging if any and the energy density of blubber energy costs incurred by the female included her own maintenance locomotion pregnancy digestion and urine production assuming that any thermoregulatory costs were negligible we separated the energy costs of pregnancy into two categories 1 the minimum cost a female must invest in the fetus which we assumed to include metabolic costs and energy stored in non blubber tissues and 2 additional energy that was allocated to fetal blubber reserves a complete list of parameter notation and values can be found in table 1 specific references in text to the model parameters are italicized while general references are not below we describe how each parameter was determined while the specific equations describing the dynamics of female and fetal blubber mass are found in section 2 5 state dynamics variability in parameter estimates such as the physiological ones described below can theoretically be incorporated into either the backward iteration or forward simulation in practice it can be challenging to implement in the backward and easier to incorporate into the forward simulation see section 2 7 forward simulation particularly for parameters where individuals with the same state variables may exhibit a range of potential values such as is often the case with metabolic rates as a result incorporating individual variation in parameter estimates is typically focused on the forward simulation excluding age or size specific variation or parameters dealing with the prey landscape e g mchuron et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018b incorporation of variation in parameter estimates into just the forward simulation assumes that optimal behavioral decisions are not affected by such variation in this model we focused mainly on using point estimates given we often had very little if any data to inform these estimates but variation could easily be incorporated into the forward simulation of future efforts maintenance costs were taken from john 2020 who used respirometry measurements from three belugas in human care to estimate resting metabolic rate r m r we used non mass specific values since fat is not believed to contribute notably to an individual s maintenance metabolic costs rea and costa 1992 and mass changes in this model only occurred through changes in blubber reserves that have a high lipid content in support of this differences in mean rmrs between belugas from john 2020 and a single adult male from rosen and trites 2013 were only 1 despite average mass differences of 180 which were primarily due to excess blubber reserves locomotion costs were estimated based on the cost of transport c o t and the cost of surface swimming c o s also derived from john 2020 both of these costs include rmr in the measurement we assumed that when foraging whales spent 100 of the time step swimming 6 h h s w i m whereas for resting we assumed it was 17 since detailed time activity budgets of belugas are largely unknown these values were relatively arbitrarily chosen to produce the general pattern that resting was less energetically costly than the other two behaviors minimum gestation costs e m g e s t a t i o n included the heat increment of gestation and the energy stored in the fetus and associated tissues instead of assuming a fixed allocation of blubber reserves e b g e s t a t i o n we modeled it using a separate sdp model to identify the optimal value for each day based on female blubber mass fetal blubber mass and energy gain appendix a this provided a mechanism for changes in maternal body condition to influence fetal growth and hence probability of survival something that has been detected in other cetacean species christiansen et al 2014 smith 2021 this was done in lieu of using researcher assigned a priori rules about fetal energy allocation under poor maternal body condition we took a conservative approach by assuming that females could not allocate more energy than what was expected based on fetal age appendix a meaning that a female could not make up reductions at one point in time by over allocating at another time there are no available data for the heat increment of feeding h i f the metabolic cost of processing food digestive efficiency d e f percent of ingested energy left after fecal energy losses or urinary energy loss u e l for beluga whales existing hif values for pinnipeds range from 4 3 to 19 4 of gross energy intake with values that can be influenced by the proximate composition of prey rosen and worthy 2018 feeding trials where animals were fed lipid rich prey resulted in hif values between 5 1 and 12 4 we used a value of 10 for h i f of gross energy intake since much of the summer prey eaten by cibs is relatively energy dense particularly eulachon for d e f we used a value of 95 based on data from bottlenose dolphins tursiops truncatus and pinnipeds reddy et al 1994 rosen and worthy 2018 values of uel in pinnipeds typically range from about 6 9 to 9 5 of digestive energy intake after energy lost to feces we assumed a value of 8 we used a value of 34 32 mj kg 1 for the energy density of female blubber e d b l u b b e r kuhnlein et al 2002 which assumes that blubber energy density is constant throughout the year while this is unlikely to be true since seasonal changes in lipid content of blubber are common in cetaceans koopman 2007 we did not have the data to resolve this further the energy density of fetal blubber e d f e t a l b l u b b e r was based on the estimated protein and lipid composition of blubber given fetal age appendix a there were very few data available to characterize the prey landscape experienced by cibs and estimate the energy gained from foraging e g a i n we primarily used data from salmonids with some additional data from eulachon salmonids were the only prey for which we had any data to approximate abundance sourced from spatially and temporally explicit set net harvest and escapement data these data were only available for 15 of the 27 cells and were extremely limited or absent from several of the cells located in the upper inlet where beluga presence is concentrated fig 2 we provide a brief overview of our approach in the following paragraphs with a more in depth description of how the prey landscape was parameterized in appendix b the daily total number of each salmonid species in each cell was summed and subsequently combined with species specific mass and energy density estimates to convert numbers of fish to energy availability generalized additive models were used to estimate daily energy availability from salmonids summed across all species for each cell fig b1 energy availability was converted to energy gain as described in appendix b to this value we added the energy gained from eulachon approximated based on the timing and location of eulachon runs barrett et al 1984 spangler 2002 we also added a static value of 40 mj primarily to parameterize the prey landscape from october to april the timing and spatial distribution of this static value was approximated from acoustic presence absence data of belugas from 13 acoustic moorings throughout cook inlet castellote et al 2020 appendix b the specific value of 40 mj was chosen after preliminary model runs indicated too little energy resulted in complete starvation and too much reduced seasonal fluctuations in blubber mass see section 3 3 sensitivity analysis operating under the assumption that cibs experience seasonal fluctuations in prey availability for all time steps we assumed a reduced energy gain from foraging when the tidal phase was below slack which was proportional to the percent of the cell with exposed mudflats during low tide corresponding to inaccessible foraging habitat if a cell had no exposed mudflats then there was no influence of tidal phase on energy gain as mentioned previously the general assumption about reduced foraging during lower tides is not uniformly true across cook inlet however this assumption is simply intended to capture the general pattern that prey availability and foraging success is unlikely to be uniform throughout the day since stomach fullness was a state variable s the energy gained from foraging was not only based on the prey landscape but also on the value of s the maximum prey mass that could be consumed in a 6 hour time step was 22 kg which was calculated based on maximum estimates of forestomach capacity 11 kg calculated from the equation s 0 47 l 2 36 and clearance rates 3 hr both of which were derived from data collected from fin whales balaenoptera physalus vikingsson 1997 there are anecdotal reports of forestomach capacities of belugas that suggest it may be higher than 11 kg up to 22 28 kg quakenbush et al 2015 vladykov 1964 but we chose not to use these here because they are based on so few observations since s represented the proportion of the forestomach that was full s 0 5 being empty and s 1 0 being full the value for the amount of prey that could be consumed decreased linearly from s 0 5 to s 1 0 with specific maximum consumption estimates of 22 kg s 0 5 19 8 kg s 0 6 17 6 kg s 0 7 15 4 kg s 0 8 13 2 kg s 0 9 and 11 0 kg s 1 0 these maximum consumption estimates were combined with average cell and time specific prey energy density estimates to convert from prey in kg to energy in mj the energy gained from foraging was the minimum based on prey energy availability and maximum allowable consumption given s our approach to quantifying e g a i n has limitations and is unlikely to be entirely representative of the prey landscape experienced by cibs not only did we lack comprehensive data on prey abundance of key species like salmonids and eulachon but we know virtually nothing about abundance of other prey species in any season nor how prey abundance relates to energy gain what is important however is that the result is a temporally and spatially dynamic prey energy landscape characterized by seasonally abundant prey resources fig b3 we have thus captured the essence of our understanding of the prey field that cibs experience even if the specific details are incomplete 2 5 state dynamics the blubber mass dynamics of a pregnant adult female beluga when foraging was 1 x t 1 min x t e g a i n d e f e f o r a g e e h i f e u r i n e e m g e s t a

in eq 1 e f o r a g e represents maintenance and locomotion costs eq 4 e h i f e g a i n h i f and e u r i n e e g a i n d e f u e l the costs associated with the fetus the energy density of fetal blubber and the maximum value of fetal blubber mass all vary with time but notation is omitted for simplicity in nature there is some lag between energy intake and blubber deposition but here deposition and catabolism is assumed to occur within the same time step the blubber mass dynamics of a female that was traveling or resting were similar except e f o r a g e was replaced with e t r a v e l eq 5 or e r e s t eq 6 for the latter two e g a i n 0 and since e h i f and e u r i n e are calculated relative to e g a i n they also equaled zero when a whale was traveling or resting 3 x t 1 min x t e t r a v e l o r e r e s t e m g e s t a t i o n e b g e s t a t i o n e d b l u b b e r x m a x the energetic costs of each behavior were calculated as 4 e fora ge x cos h swim 5 e trav el x c c cot d c c rmr h rema in 6 e rest x rmr 6 h swim cos h swim where d c c is the distance in km between the current cell c and the new cell c h r e m a i n is the number of hours remaining in a time step once a whale reaches c which was calculated based on an assumed transit rate of 5 km hr 1 and the distance traveled richard et al 2001 whales were allowed to travel to any cell within 120 km of their current cell i e any cell they could reach in a single day the energy cost of foraging was typically more energetically expensive than traveling assuming a distance 30 km the distance that could be traveled in single time step particularly when considering the added costs of e h i f and e u r i n e when foraging 2 6 sdp equations when solving the sdp equations we assume that all individuals act in such a way to maximize their expected reproductive success which for this model is based on a single reproductive event and a female s probability of survival the fitness function f x x f c p s t is defined as the expected total probability that a female will survive the year and her fetus once born will survive given that x t x x f t x f c t c p t p and s t s where the expectation is taken over the stochastic events of survival and food distribution and taking into account errors in decision making as described later in this section at the last time step in the model t fitness was calculated as 7 f x x f c p s t ϕ x ϕ x ϕ f x f φ x x f where ϕ x is the probability that a female with blubber mass x survives to the following year and ϕ f x f is the probability that a fetus with blubber mass x f at the time of birth t t survives to one year of age the fitness associated with the newly born fetus calf was conditioned on female survival ϕ x ϕ f x f since we assumed the calf would die regardless of its own blubber mass if the female was not alive to provide milk since the relationships between survival probability and female and calf blubber mass are unknown we parameterized these functions using estimates of the annual probability of reproductive female and young of the year survival of cibs from the model described in himes boor et al 2023 and a sigmoidal function figs a5 and a6 fitness at all other model time steps was calculated by iterating backwards through time where fitness is the maximum future expected fitness across all three behaviors 8 f x x

resting respectively and the optimal behavioral decision is the one that maximizes a pregnant belugas future expected fitness across all potential behaviors we used two dimensional linear interpolation to account for continuous physiological state variables that must be treated as discrete variables for computational purposes clark and mangel 2000 we computed the fitness value of foraging v f o r a g e x x f c p s t traveling v t r a v e l x x f c p s t and resting v r e s t i n g x x f c p s t as 9 v f o r a g e x x f c p s t e μ f x x f c p s t 1 10 v t r a v e l x x f c p t max c o v e r η c e μ f x x f c p s t 1 11 v r e s t x x f c p t e μ f x x f c p s t 1 where μ is the daily rate of background mortality e g mortality due to predation disease and x and x f are the future expected maternal and fetal blubber masses given the specific behavior and the values of other state variables eqs 1 and 2 in eq 10 s and p are the expected stomach fullness and tidal state upon arrival given the time to travel from c to c and η c is all the cells within 120 km of c we modeled μ as static across all behaviors so its inclusion here is irrelevant however we have included it to show how it could easily be incorporated as a spatially and or temporally dynamic value the optimal cell to travel to is the one that results in the maximum value of v t r a v e l if at any time a female s blubber mass fell below x c r i t then her fitness went to zero the above equations were solved backward starting at t t and resulted in the identification of the optimal time and state dependent behaviors in addition to the optimal behaviors we also calculated a probability distribution of behavior appendix c this calculation relies on the differences between the specific values of fitness for each behavior and the optimal value and an optimality parameter that determines how optimal a whale behaves very small optimality values result in a higher probability of selecting the optimal behavior whereas larger optimality values result in more random behavior i e as the value increases the probability of each behavior becomes more similar using a probability distribution instead of simply the optimal behavior accounts for ties in fitness when two behaviors have the same fitness value the fact that animals may not always behave optimally particularly when there are very small differences in fitness among behaviors and that there may be errors in decision making this approach takes care of these issues in a natural and consistent way we calculated probability distributions for both the behavior and travel decisions 2 7 forward simulation we used the probability distribution of behaviors from the backward iteration in monte carlo simulations to determine the distribution of behaviors changes in female and fetal blubber mass and survival estimates in a population of 50 pregnant cibs in undisturbed and disturbed environments fig 1 table 2 see 2 8 disturbance scenarios simulations started on the first day of pregnancy t 1 the initial values of the state variable for each female at t 1 were selected as follows randomly drawn from a normal distribution for female blubber mass assumed to be a fixed value for fetal blubber mass stomach fullness and tidal phase randomly drawn from values between 1 and 27 for cell table 1 thereafter values for female and fetal blubber mass were updated as described in section 2 5 state dynamics depending on the behavior that was selected stomach fullness was updated based on energy intake and time and cell specific estimates of prey energy density tidal phase alternated between time steps and cell changed depending on travel decisions when the selected behavior was to travel and the new location was greater than could be transited in 6 hours the time step was advanced according to the distance traveled and transit speed since we used the probability distribution of behaviors from the backward iteration instead of the optimal one each behavior had a probability of being chosen given the values of each state variable at the beginning of the time step we used the following sequence to identify which behavior was chosen at each time step 1 select a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 2 randomly order behavioral choices and 3 sequentially sum the probability of the behavioral choices based on their random order the selected behavior was the one that caused the sum to exceed the value of the random number we used the same approach to select which cell a whale selected when the chosen behavior was to travel we did not include background mortality the probability of mortality due to factors other than starvation in the forward simulations because we only ran a single replicate of 50 individuals per scenario meaning that a random mortality in one scenario would greatly impact average population survival estimates 2 8 disturbance scenarios disturbance was included using seven hypothetical scenarios meant to mimic anthropogenic activities changes in the availability of prey and the interaction between the two table 2 these scenarios were implemented in the forward simulation only meaning there was the potential for mismatch in the behavioral decisions from the backward iteration and the environments that were encountered in the forward simulation the anthropogenic activity scenario was designed to represent any significant and sustained human disturbance with specific values based on the activities occurring as part of the port of alaska modernization program in knik arm cell 1 this activity involves in water pile driving and pile removal operations the presence and movement of small boats and barges with heavy equipment and other shore based activities that overall cause both physical and underwater noise disturbance within cib habitat the parameters for this disturbance scenario were based on the current operations of this activity which can span a single 6 hour period per day for 6 days per week from april to november in each year these parameters captured the most extensive disturbance a beluga would likely encounter in this section of cook inlet for the purposes of this modeling effort and independently of the effectiveness of the mitigation program in place for this port project e g national marine fisheries service 2020 which is outside the scope of this paper we assumed that a whale in cell 1 at the time of disturbance would respond by leaving and traveling to another cell determined using the probability of traveling to a given cell as described above the prey availability scenarios described in table 2 were intended to capture varying reductions in prey species during a presumed critical foraging time for cibs while we refer to them here using the species that informed the prey landscape salmonids and eulachon table 2 results reflect changes in the overall prey landscape and are thus not specific to these prey groups 2 9 sensitivity analysis we explored the sensitivity of model output to uncertainties in key parameter inputs specifically we ran separate backward iterations using altered parameter values for optimality a different terminal fitness function and different winter prey energy gain values one higher and one lower than the baseline scenario we refer to these two prey sensitivity scenarios as reduced winter prey or increased winter prey for ease of reference even though they affected more than just the winter months this approach re running the backward iteration using the altered winter prey landscape means that behavioral choices are perfectly matched to the environment that is what a whale expects to encounter in the forward simulation is what they encounter this contrasts with the approach used for the disturbance scenarios where prey availability was altered only in the forward simulation while metabolic rates are one of the most influential factors on estimates of energy costs bejarano et al 2017 winship et al 2002 and can influence sdp model output mchuron et al 2021 pirotta et al 2018b we did not explore the sensitivity of the model to this parameter or to parameters that influenced it like the percentage of time spent swimming when foraging this was because we had no empirical knowledge on the energy gained from foraging making the specific values used for metabolic parameters of less importance in this effort this reasoning is also why we present the ratio of energy gains and costs in the results in addition to presenting absolute values 3 results initial runs of the model revealed two movement patterns that led us to alter the model to better match known behavior of cibs the first was that the model indicated a high probability of traveling to and foraging in cells 15 kenai and 16 kasilof in july and august because of an abundance of spawning salmon in these rivers at that time appendix d fig d1 this timing coincides with the drift gillnet fishery that includes the mouth of these rivers as well as the commercial fishery and personal use dipnetting in the rivers and is a period when belugas are largely absent see discussion because of this we removed foraging in these two cells cell 15 and cell 16 as a behavioral choice in the backward iteration from july 1 to august 31 the second deviation from observed beluga behavior was that use of cell 1 knik arm which in initial model runs was very low during the entire year despite evidence that belugas use this area intensively during the late summer and fall castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a shelden et al 2015 this is also the cell where the port of alaska is located and in our model the cell where the anthropogenic disturbance was simulated while we had escapement and harvest data for sockeye and coho salmon in cell 1 primarily from july september with a peak in august total daily numbers of fish were low compared with other cells during that time in our dataset this may be because small and medium size sockeye and coho runs occur in numerous rivers and creeks in knik arm and so likely add up to a substantial number of fish but escapement is only monitored in one location for each species to somewhat correct for this we used the prey data from july 5 to september 20 from cell 6 susitna to characterize cell 1 during august 15 october 31 appendix b this effectively extended the length of time abundant prey were available to cibs fig b3 the results below are from models with these modifications 3 1 baseline scenario foraging activity was highest in the summer and lowest in the spring with an average of 81 1 summer june aug 67 4 fall sept nov 66 8 winter dec feb and 61 7 spring mar may of time spent foraging table 3 fig d2 when not foraging simulated pregnant cibs spent more time resting than traveling in the spring 32 0 resting vs 6 3 traveling and winter 32 1 vs 1 1 whereas time spent between the two behaviors was more evenly distributed in the summer 8 2 vs 10 7 and fall 15 9 vs 16 7 variation in cell use primarily followed temporospatial changes in the prey landscape from may to august simulated pregnant cibs primarily used in no particular order cell 6 susitna cell 2 turnagain arm cell 3 chickaloon bay cell 4 potters creek cell 16 kasilof cell 22 ninilchik and cell 1 knik arm fig 3 spatial use in other months can be found in fig d3 we do not provide a description here because the spatial location of prey resources used to parameterize the model during these months was informed by the current habitat use of belugas as such spatial predictions of habitat use during these months are not truly an emergent model property daily mean gross energy costs of pregnant cibs in the baseline scenario ranged from 150 1 to 192 6 mj day 1 with the highest values in summer when the time spent foraging was greatest table 3 fetal energy costs were at their highest point during the second summer of gestation with a maximum of 70 3 mj day 1 spent on fetal maintenance and growth just prior to parturition daily mean energy gain exceeded costs by 4 8 82 8 13 8 in the spring summer and fall respectively but were 25 8 lower than mean daily energy costs in winter table 3 daily mean prey consumption was 48 2 kg day 1 summer 25 5 kg day 1 fall 16 8 kg day 1 winter and 19 7 kg day 1 spring across the entire gestation period average energy consumption of a single whale exceeded energy costs by 30 1 100 486 mj vs 77 225 mj most prey consumption occurred during the summer 52 9 compared with other seasons 9 3 22 9 which was due to both intensive foraging activity on abundant prey and because the gestation period spanned two summers from april to august in the following year when broken up by year a greater mean percentage of the total prey was consumed in the first summer compared with the second 29 0 vs 23 9 but when differences in the length of each summer were considered the average daily rate of prey consumption was higher in the second summer 52 7 kg day 1 vs 45 9 kg day 1 female blubber mass dynamics exhibited strong seasonality with rapid increases in may and early june during the simulated eulachon runs fig 4 regardless of initial starting blubber mass all pregnant cibs reached the maximum blubber mass allowed in the first summer the timing of when that maximum was first reached depended on initial starting mass but it occurred no later than mid july blubber masses were largely maintained at the maximum until the beginning of october after this time blubber masses steadily declined until the following may at the lowest point in the second calendar year mean female blubber mass was 275 2 kg or 29 3 of body mass maximum daily blubber mass changes were 9 3 kg in spring and summer 1 5 kg in fall and 0 11 kg in winter these values were low in the fall because whales had largely reached the maximum allowed blubber mass during that time all pregnant cibs were able to maximize their blubber mass just prior to parturition fetal blubber mass dynamics followed an exponential pattern with very small gains between april and december and rapid growth thereafter until the following august at the time of birth mean fetal blubber mass was 51 7 kg mean female and calf survival probability at the end of the simulation were 98 7 and 97 4 respectively 3 2 disturbance scenarios female blubber mass dynamics in the disturbance scenarios generally followed similar seasonal patterns as in the baseline scenario but the specific values at any given time varied among scenarios fig 5 a if prey were abundant during the summer pregnant whales achieved reasonably high blubber masses at the end of the simulation under the no eulachon scenario 461 2 kg out of a maximum allowed of 543 0 kg when prey energy gain was reduced to 75 of baseline values from may to october 75 salmon eulachon scenario mean terminal blubber mass was reduced by 22 3 422 3 kg or 38 9 of body mass most whales were able to achieve maximum allowable mass gains or close to it in the first summer and fall but because it took them longer to do so this ultimately resulted in reduced blubber mass at the time of parturition when this 75 reduction only applied to values from mid june to october 75 salmon scenario mean terminal blubber masses were 498 6 kg 42 9 of body mass this was still below baseline but considerably higher than values from the 75 salmon eulachon scenario indicating that availability of energy rich prey buffers against changes in prey availability for other species even if it only occurs during a short time window reductions in prey energy gain to 50 of baseline had considerable impacts on blubber mass gain with mean terminal blubber masses of 153 6 kg 18 7 of body mass 50 salmon eulachon scenario and 317 6 kg 32 3 body mass 50 salmon scenario the simulated disturbance had no effect on terminal blubber masses when prey were abundant with all whales still achieving a mean of 540 kg of blubber mass at the end of the simulation disturbance scenario when it coincided with reductions in prey energy gain disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario terminal blubber masses were on average 76 5 of what they were in the absence of disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario indicating synergistic effects between prey availability and disruptions to foraging activity the number of disturbances experienced by simulated belugas was similar between the two scenarios with an average of 41 3 disturbance scenario and 42 1 times disturbance 75 salmon eulachon scenario per whale the simulated disturbance resulted in more lost time than the nominal disturbance time a single 6 hour time step for 6 days of the week as whales were forced to travel to a new cell and subsequently chose to travel back only to be disturbed again the following day thus this simulated disturbance reflects the effects of 6 lost foraging days per week and may be a more severe energetic effect than actual responses to a daily 6 hour disturbance since whales may simply move a short distance away or remain in the vicinity of the disturbance mean terminal fetal blubber masses remained unchanged from the baseline 51 5 51 7 kg for all disturbance scenarios except for the two scenarios where prey energy gain was 50 of the baseline 33 1 kg and 44 3 kg and the scenario that paired reductions in prey energy gain with anthropogenic disturbance 43 9 kg fig 5b mean female survival probability ranged from 14 7 to 98 7 table d1 in almost all scenarios with reduced energy gain from prey or changes in prey availability mean survival was reduced by a minimum of 1 7 below baseline values fig 5a the one exception was for the 75 salmon scenario where the availability of energy dense prey early in the season allowed whales to maintain survival rates despite small reductions in energy gain from other prey resources for scenarios where prey energy gain was 50 of baseline values poor survival was due to both adult mortality and poor body condition at the end of the simulation model predictions of calf survival followed similar patterns as female survival which was to be expected given it was in part conditioned on female survival for scenarios with a 50 reduction in prey energy gain or where anthropogenic disturbance co occurred with a reduction in prey energy gain this reduction was because of both reduced female and calf condition at time of birth even in the absence of maternal mortality when calf survival was calculated solely based on calf condition it was still reduced by 2 1 to 14 5 below baseline in these three disturbance scenarios 3 3 sensitivity scenarios the sensitivity analysis scenarios largely resulted in similar temporal patterns in female blubber mass fluctuations as in the baseline scenario with the lowest values observed in early may just prior to the start of the simulated eulachon run summer and fall behavior remained largely unchanged from baseline as simulated belugas still exhibited intensive foraging when prey were abundant sensitivity scenarios largely impacted the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations with more abundant winter prey resulting in belugas that were in good body condition year round and less abundant winter prey resulting in a minimal blubber mass that was on average 130 kg lower than the baseline scenario fig 6 in the absence of disturbance female and calf survival in all sensitivity scenarios were the same or very similar as in the baseline scenario 98 0 98 7 and 96 7 97 4 respectively table d1 disturbance scenarios generally had similar effects on survival and reproductive success as in the baseline values with respect to order but the magnitude of the impact and specific value of survival varied among scenarios table d1 for example when the amount of prey energy gained from foraging was increased from 40 mj to 55 mj increased winter prey all disturbance scenarios had similar female 98 3 98 7 and calf 97 1 97 4 survival estimates as the non disturbance scenario except for the 50 salmon eulachon scenario survival estimates for this scenario were 62 6 female and 57 9 calf considerably higher than corresponding values from the baseline scenario 14 7 and 12 4 respectively when winter prey energy was reduced to 30 mj survival estimates were not only lower but complete mortality was observed during the winter and spring in all but two of the disturbance scenarios 75 salmon and 75 salmon eulachon 4 discussion the development of the sdp model described in this paper represents the first step in achieving the end goal of developing a lifetime population consequences of disturbance pcod model to help inform management decisions for the recovery of cibs with a population of just under 300 individuals tools like this are critical to better understand the current causes of the cib decline predict how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes may impact this population and develop mitigation measures to help alleviate such effects while there are limitations to what we can infer from our results primarily because relatively little is known about beluga prey preferences and prey availability in cook inlet our model provides insights into the conditions under which reductions in reproductive success and survival might be expected and provides a tangible product to managers to illustrate the value of behavioral models and the need for obtaining currently unavailable data that can be incorporated into the existing model framework it also highlights a key discrepancy in spatial use of the kenai and kasilof rivers between model output and empirical data that warrants further attention below we provide a discussion of key outputs and how they compare with empirical data highlighting areas of further research to obtain critical data for the successful application of this model by managers table 4 4 1 time activity budgets seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort and body condition have been documented in many beluga populations and are assumed to reflect seasonal changes in prey availability breton honeyman et al 2016 cornick et al 2016 huntington and the communities of buckland 1999 kilabuk 1998 koski and finley 2002 in our model a seasonal pattern of increased foraging effort emerged in response to abundant prey from may september which is consistent with empirical observations foraging was still the predominant behavior in other months but there was an increase in the occurrence of resting behaviors from october to april the sensitivity analyses for winter energy gain resulted in changes in the magnitude of blubber reserve fluctuations with less pronounced fluctuations in blubber reserves when winter prey energy was increased seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort and hence blubber mass still occurred even when winter prey energy gain was great enough for simulated whales to maintain high blubber masses year round indicating the mere presence of seasonality in prey resources regardless of how it affects energy balance is sufficient to induce variation in foraging effort these model outputs provide support for assumptions that prey availability for cibs is lower in the winter than during summer months which are based on observations of intensive foraging in summer on salmon and eulachon pronounced differences in blubber thickness between spring and fall and slower transit rates in summer compared with winter goetz et al 2012b huntington 2000 data from acoustic moorings are also suggestive of lower levels of feeding activity by cibs during winter but also could reflect foraging on benthic prey or in unmonitored offshore waters castellote et al 2020 while foraging effort was reduced from october to april prey energy gain during these months was still critical in ensuring simulated pregnant cibs survived even when they were able to maximize their blubber reserves during summer months given key knowledge gaps in prey availability quantitative comparisons between model output and empirical data are largely uninformative and should be cautiously interpreted for example the percentage time spent foraging in winter and spring was still considerably high 61 7 67 4 but this value is based on our assumptions that the prey landscape during this time is comprised of continuously available prey with a low energy return while foraging if instead the prey landscape from october to april was temporally and or energetically non uniform it is likely that different values for time activity budgets would emerge from the model model predictions of the occurrence of foraging behavior may be slightly high particularly during summer when the model indicated belugas should spend over 80 of their time foraging in comparison lydersen et al 2001 found that belugas from svalbard spent roughly 63 of the summer and autumn in presumed foraging behaviors with a peak monthly estimate of 72 while this would seem to provide support that our model overestimated the amount of time spent foraging cibs and those in svalbard consume different prey species and it is possible that differences in time activity budgets simply reflect the underlying temporal variation in prey availability the potential overestimate in time spent foraging speaks more to errors in the model parameterization rather than errors in the model itself which could be resolved with additional data in our model prey were available at most model time steps but this may not be an accurate assumption since it is possible that prey abundance or foraging efficiency fluctuates throughout the day as environmental conditions change for example chinook and sockeye salmon entering the kenai river took advantage of the flood tide to move rapidly into the river welch et al 2014 which would likely influence beluga foraging behavior in addition we assumed that there were no restrictions on prey availability during the above slack phase however the tidal cycle and how it affects habitat and prey availability is much more complex and there still may be access issues at some high tide levels that limit foraging opportunities behaviors were also assumed to occur for the entire time step when a whale may not need 6 h of continuous foraging to achieve high rates of prey energy gain particularly when prey are abundant or when a whale s stomach is partially full this assumption would result in overestimates of the amount of time spent foraging 4 2 energy balance and blubber mass dynamics during intensive foraging in the summer simulated whales consumed an average of 48 2 kg day 1 about 4 of mean body mass during the summer almost 2 times their energy requirements resulting in a maximum blubber gain of 9 3 kg day 1 about 1 of body mass this allowed them to rapidly increase their body condition from 29 3 blubber mass relative to total body mass to 45 between may and mid july in the first summer of gestation model predictions of prey consumption and rates of blubber mass gain may be too high given the potential overestimate in foraging effort although these consumption estimates are feasible for marine mammals particularly for species that exhibit seasonal fluctuations in foraging effort for example owen et al 2017 estimated that humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae consumed 1 2 3 4 times their daily energy requirements whereas savoca et al 2021 estimated that baleen whales consumed between 5 and 30 of their body mass daily depending on prey type a cross sectional study of belugas from bristol bay alaska indicated that adults increased blubber mass relative to total body mass from 33 in may to 48 in september cornick et al 2016 a rate that is roughly two times lower than our model estimates these estimates are not directly comparable to our model output since they are cross sectional were not collected from reproductively active females and may be artificially depressed if whales reached such high blubber masses prior to the sampling in september i e if blubber mass plateaued prior to sampling they do however provide some indication that further adjustments to model parameters that influence the rate of blubber mass gain may be needed such as the prey landscape or stomach fullness model estimates of summer prey consumption were considerably higher than daily food consumption of belugas in aquaria which average around 11 15 kg day 1 kastelein et al 1994 such discrepancies are not unexpected particularly given that belugas in zoological institutions are fed daily do not experience seasonal fluctuations in food availability and are unlikely to experience the same energetic costs as free ranging belugas because of different environmental conditions and activity patterns estimates from belugas in aquaria are also largely derived from non reproductive individuals for comparison three harvested cibs with relatively full stomachs had between 15 0 and 27 8 kg of salmon in their stomachs along with other prey items quakenbush et al 2015 additional data on beluga energetics and foraging success would help refine our estimates of energy expenditure and gain including metabolic data to identify any seasonal variation in metabolic rates and behavioral data to quantify activity levels during foraging 4 3 spatial use spatial predictions can be an emergent property of this model but here they are not entirely so because we used the spatial distribution of cibs to characterize the prey landscape from october to april for these months we can conclude that spatial variation in prey abundance would generate the general patterns we observe in nature but they are not confirmatory since the distribution and abundance of prey during these months is unknown because model output from may to august was largely informed by the prey data themselves either the harvest escapement data or timing and locations of eulachon runs rather than beluga distributions we limit our discussion below to these months empirical data on the spatial use of cibs comes from aerial surveys goetz et al 2012a vessel sightings mcguire et al 2020a acoustic moorings castellote et al 2021 2016 opportunistic sightings shelden et al 2015 traditional ecological knowledge carter and nielsen 2011 huntington 2000 and limited satellite tracking data goetz et al 2012b hobbs et al 2005 shelden et al 2018 2015 results from these studies indicate that cibs are largely concentrated in upper cook inlet during summer and fall with concentrated use of the susitna region from beluga river to the west to little susitna river to the east knik and turnagain arms chickaloon bay and the east and west coasts of the inlet to west and east foreland from 2008 to 2022 few if any belugas were seen in knik arm during aerial surveys in the month of june for unknown reasons shelden et al 2017 2015 but have been consistently detected from visual and acoustic surveys as early as april with peak presence in the fall castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a a northeastward range contraction occurred from the 1970s to the early 2000s resulting in belugas being concentrated in upper cook inlet close to anchorage rugh et al 2010 shelden et al 2015 shelden and wade 2019 the reason for this contraction is unknown but hypotheses include changes in habitat including prey availability predation risk by killer whales orcinus orca or the abandonment of poorer quality habitat as the population declined rugh et al 2010 model output of spatial use from may august indicated high use of cell 6 susitna with intermittent use of cells 1 knik arm 2 turnagain arm 3 chickaloon bay 4 potters creek 16 kasilof and 22 ninilchik these results are generally consistent with empirical observations showing concentration of cibs in the upper inlet during these months with some key deviations while the model predicted use of turnagain arm during may there were very limited occurrences of whales in this cell in august which is inconsistent with observations during this month mcguire et al 2020a model predictions indicated some use of the mid inlet in june cells 16 and 22 and july cell 22 cibs are not currently observed in these areas during summer months but oral histories indicate belugas were sometimes abundant in both areas from the 1920s to 1930s until the 1980s to 1990s dutton et al 2012 similarly initial model runs indicated the kenai and kasilof rivers and surrounding areas should be important habitat for cibs particularly in july and august belugas have been notably absent from these rivers during these months in recent years although they have used this area historically carter and nielsen 2011 dutton et al 2012 huntington 2000 shelden et al 2015 which is why we excluded foraging in these cells during july and august in our final model despite available and abundant prey data use of the kenai river does occur in other months with whales typically being acoustically and visually detected starting in september and continuing throughout the winter and into early may castellote et al 2020 mcguire et al 2020a mismatches between model output and empirical data are likely driven by the lack of prey data for areas of critical beluga habitat upper cook inlet cells or indicative that prey availability is unlikely to be the sole driver of the cib range contraction and habitat use more generally in parameterizing the prey landscape all cells with data included the period of range contraction 2000s onward with some cells also having escapement or harvest data dating back as early as the 1960s table b1 thus model predictions that belugas should use cells in mid cook inlet are not because of biases in the temporal distribution of prey data pre versus post contraction hypotheses about changes in spatial use due to predation risk or contraction to optimal habitats during a population decline are neither supported nor refuted by our model the influence of predation risk on habitat use could easily be tested by incorporating a spatially and if desired temporally explicit mortality parameter in the backward iteration which accounts for the fact that perceived risk of predation may influence behavioral decisions about habitat use castellote et al 2022 in this model we used a single value because there is very limited information on the presence of transient killer whales in cook inlet shelden et al 2003 the kenai river also supports a large commercial fishery and sport and personal fisheries during the summer which may make this area suboptimal due to disturbance or accessibility issues while such disturbances can easily be incorporated into the model either in the backward iteration or forward simulation it is challenging to do so in a meaningful way without a better understanding of the prey landscape and how belugas perceive and respond to fishing activity for example removal of foraging as a behavioral choice in the kenai and kasilof cells during july and august resulted in predicted habitat use similar to what is currently observed but without knowing how accessible this habitat is to belugas and what the prey availability is during those times of accessibility we can only conclude that accessibility issues should remain as a potential hypothesis further efforts are thus needed to understand why belugas do not use these mid inlet areas in july and august during peak prey abundance particularly given indications that prey availability may be hindering population recovery warlick 2022 one area that remains a considerable unknown is the role that cultural information plays in influencing habitat use and how the loss of older individuals from the population may alter this information wade et al 2012 williams and lusseau 2006 the movement of simulated pregnant cibs was largely confined to a few discrete cells while it has been reported that belugas will often remain in the same location for weeks when prey are abundant citta et al 2016 hobbs et al 2005 lydersen et al 2001 other factors in the model could have led to this behavior these factors include perfect knowledge of the environment in the baseline scenario i e they encountered the expected environment in the forward simulation that whales may make decisions based on reasons unrelated to energy gain and the lack of environmental features that may facilitate movement or make it more energetically beneficial to move e g tidal activity for example some belugas in svalbard moved to other distant foraging areas despite abundant prey in their current location which the authors hypothesized may be adaptive behavior in a fluctuating environment lydersen et al 2001 incorporating environmental uncertainty into behavioral decisions in sdp models is possible but this added complexity may not be overly informative since cook inlet is relatively small and there may be more uniformity in responses of prey communities to environmental fluctuations tidal activity influences cib behavior but incorporating these effects into a model are challenging because relationships appear to be site specific howe et al 2015 huntington 2000 indicating behaviors may be driven by more than just energy savings 4 4 environmental change and disturbance in the cib recovery plan anthropogenic disturbance and prey availability are listed as high and medium threats to population recovery respectively national marine fisheries service 2016 cumulative effects from multiple stressors are also listed as a threat of high concern and while there are significant barriers to assessing these impacts in marine mammal populations the combination of multiple stressors is increasingly identified as a concern for marine mammal populations cervin et al 2020 national academies of science engineering and medicine 2017 pirotta et al 2019 silva et al 2021 williams et al 2021 the model output provides insight into specific conditions under which disturbance could impact cib vital rates at least when the only consideration is direct impacts on energy balance specifically the lack of an effect of the simulated anthropogenic disturbance in isolation suggests that if prey are abundant during the summer and early fall and prey during winter is above some critical threshold pregnant cibs at asymptotic length should be able to cope with intermittent disruptions to foraging gain during these months such as those experienced by the port of alaska modernization program there were synergistic impacts when the simulated anthropogenic disturbance co occurred with reductions in prey availability highlighting the need to assess anthropogenic impacts on cibs within the context of resource availability given that body conditions of the current population are unknown it is impossible to know whether the scenario showing no energetic impacts of anthropogenic disturbance on pregnant cibs is applicable drone technology cannot yet be used to estimate body condition in cibs as it has for other cetaceans e g christiansen et al 2020 stewart et al 2021 because the waters of cook inlet are too turbid to photograph below the surface other data however suggest that conditions in the inlet may be suboptimal for example a recent estimate of the interbirth interval of cibs himes boor et al 2023 warlick 2022 was considerably longer than previously documented for cibs and other beluga populations harwood et al 2015 jacobson et al 2020 mosnier et al 2015 suydam 2009 in other cetacean species longer interbirth intervals or reduced calving rates have been associated with poor body condition and adverse environmental conditions gailey et al 2020 ijsseldijk et al 2021 kershaw et al 2021 meyer gutbrod et al 2021 seyboth et al 2021 providing some indication that cibs are unlikely to be in optimal body condition and that synergistic impacts may be more likely for this population the average lifespan of cibs also appears to be considerably shorter than the potential lifespan of belugas although causes of mortality are largely unknown mcguire et al 2021 adverse effects of reductions in prey energy gain on survival probability meant to simulate a reduction in prey availability were in large part driven by effects in the second summer of pregnancy when energy gain was reduced to 75 of baseline values access to prey into october allowed whales to achieve near maximum fat masses during the first summer of gestation this was not possible in the second summer because parturition occurred at the beginning of august resulting in reduced female blubber masses at the time of birth under scenarios where prey energy gain was severely reduced 50 of baseline whales were unable to achieve large gains in mass in the summer and fall there was an increase in the percentage of time spent foraging during the fall to help compensate for this reduced prey gain although it was insufficient to offset such severe reductions in prey energy gain even for pregnant females that survived simulations with 50 reduced prey such a prolonged reduction could result in starvation since some females experienced a net loss in blubber mass across the simulation the availability of energy dense prey early in the season modeled here as eulachon even if only for a relatively short period of time helped buffer against reductions in prey energy gain particularly when those reductions were severe highlighting the importance of spring eulachon runs for cibs much of the focus on understanding cib prey preferences has been on salmonids since they appear to be a critical prey resource for this population during summer and early fall when belugas are accumulating blubber reserves to presumably help sustain them during reduced prey availability in other times of the year while model results indicate that prey availability during this time is indeed critical they also highlight the importance of understanding prey availability during other times of the year indeed it was the interplay between the winter and summer prey availability that was important as changes in winter prey either exacerbated or buffered against adverse effects on energy gain during the summer months we modeled prey availability as a reduction in energy availability within a given cell however our results would also apply if prey shifted their distribution to areas that were less accessible to belugas or if energy gained from foraging is effectively reduced in some other way sea ice concentration which was not included in our model is important to consider in future efforts because of its influence on beluga habitat use asselin et al 2011 hornby et al 2016 loseto et al 2006 in cook inlet belugas are commonly found in very open 1 24 ice concentration and open 25 68 pack ice in the winter goetz et al 2012b but associate with habitats that range from ice free to compact pack ice up to 92 moore et al 2000 shelden et al 2018 reductions in sea ice concentrations may allow belugas to expand their winter range heide jørgensen et al 2010 but also may indirectly impact behavior through ecosystem changes hauser et al 2018 incorporating the effects of sea ice on habitat accessibility in our model is relatively straightforward and could be achieved in one or more ways for example it could be modeled by increasing the probability of mortality at high sea ice concentrations because of increased difficulty in finding breathing holes or belugas could simply be excluded from accessing cells with high ice concentrations similar to how we excluded belugas from the kenai and kasilof rivers both options would require little change to the existing model structure to incorporate effects of sea ice on prey availability if known could simply be incorporated into the existing spatially and temporally explicit prey landscape requiring no additional modifications to the model there also may be thermoregulatory changes associated with reduced sea ice and increased warming but a better understanding of how water temperature body condition and metabolic rates interact is needed before such effect could meaningfully be incorporated into the model 4 5 conservation implications behavioral models can provide relevant information to managers for planning human activities and mitigating associated risks to wildlife populations a key feature of sdp models is that decisions here the decision to forage travel or rest are an emergent model property based on the assumption that animals act to maximize the expected future value of a reward here reproductive success which allows for predictions to be based on a population that can potentially adapt their behavior to novel environmental conditions the model described herein is an initial effort to fill a critical information gap for management of cibs a population that has a 19 32 probability of extinction in the next 150 years if vital rates and environmental variability remain unchanged warlick 2022 our model provides insight into habitat use and distribution of cibs notably that prey availability alone is unlikely to have caused the range contraction necessitating further efforts to understand why belugas are not currently using areas of cook inlet that presumably have abundant prey like the kenai river perhaps most importantly model output indicates that the effects of disturbance from human activities on cibs are inextricably linked with prey availability making it impossible to accurately assess the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in isolation this elevates the importance of better understanding cib behavioral responses to disturbances and collecting prey and beluga body condition data which also would help increase the utility of the model described in this paper through parameterization and or calibration such data are challenging to collect in cook inlet but recent efforts using environmental dna have been successful in characterizing

24143,heterogeneity in surface fuels produced by overstory trees and understory vegetation is a major driver of fire behavior and ecosystem dynamics previous attempts at predicting tree leaf and needle litter accumulation over time have been constrained in scope to probabilistic models that consider a limited number of key factors influencing tree litter dispersal patterns and decomposition

decomposition midgley et al 2015 several studies have examined how different tree species litter affects soil nitrogen and carbon lin et al 2017 prescott and grayston 2013 trap et al 2017 more precise representation of spatial litter distributions may lead to a better understanding of ecosystem changes due to litter accumulation from various tree species within forests or wetlands stoler and relyea 2011 and potentially how patterns of decomposition influence fire effects arthur et al 2012 carpenter et al 2020 stephens et al 2004 heterogeneous tree litter and grass patterns are influenced by various factors including overstory structure and prevailing winds which affect when it falls from trees or shrubs where foliage lands and how it influences grass distribution and density through indirect effects on resources jonard et al 2006 pecot et al 2007 riegel et al 1992 staelens et al 2003 once on the ground other processes redistribute and decompose the litter material forrester and bauhus 2016 garcía palacios et al 2016 a number of factors can alter the trajectory of leaves when they fall from the tree including the shape of the needles or leaves the height from which they fall and local winds at the time when they fall nickmans et al 2019 decay variability which depends on climatic conditions species litter characteristics and chemistry moisture retention packing density etc can change the depth and loading of the localized litter accumulation the nutrient composition of the soils and the moisture levels present at any given time adair et al 2008 arthur et al 2012

techniques and photogrammetric methods keane et al 2012 show success when representing surface fuels rowell et al 2020 however they are associated with great financial and labor costs when employed at landscape scales silva et al 2016 aerial lidar can be used at much larger spatial scales and while it can be used to some degree to map coarse woody debris seielstad and queen 2003 or shrubs gajardo et al 2014 it is limited in its ability to detect lower strata surface fuels such as litter or grass due to both signal noise and occlusion consequently most studies using aerial lidar have focused on characterizing the canopy fuel layer and individual tree properties such as tree crown diameter stem spatial density basal area and biomass in several locations goodwin et al 2006 hudak et al 2008 hyde et al 2006 ruiz et al 2014 silva et al 2016 litter and grass continue to be difficult to map with remote sensing so spatially explicit data capturing their patterns at large extents is difficult to find most previous work modeling litter dispersal employs probabilistic approaches ferrari and sugita 1996 created an exponential model based on stem location which staelens et al 2003 expanded to include wind influence jonard et al 2006 used a ballistic and a weibull distribution approach that incorporated height of maximum crown radius which was also used by nickmans et al 2019 to determine soil nutrient characteristics linn et al 2005 used the vertically integrated canopy foliar mass above a location to infer litter and grass patterns but this approach led to litter being only located directly under trees the jonard et al 2006 model assumed all leaves were released from the center of the tree at the height of maximum crown radius and it modeled leaf dispersal patterns using a seed dispersal model designed by greene and johnson 1989 although there is value in each of these approaches they miss some of the processes that impact litter dispersal such as variation in heights and locations of trees from which leaves and needles fall species specific leaf and needle characteristics and dominant seasonal wind events which can create direction bias in litterfall heterogeneity here we describe a mechanistic model called the distribution of understory using elliptical transport duet using a frequently burned longleaf pine woodland in the southeastern u s as a case study two tree species with different canopy and leaf shapes pine needles vs broad leaves are used to test the model duet uses simplified fall trajectories to determine leaf litter and grass spatial patterns from a given overstory structure with specified wind conditions for brevity we define leaf litter as only dead leaves and needles we propose a methodology to model leaf and needle shedding from trees accumulation on the surface decay and compaction over time and the effects of litter buildup on grass growth the model uses elliptical dispersal regions to represent the area covered by litter as a function of winds and aerodynamic characteristics of falling foliage based on surface area and drag coefficients approximated from the average size and shape of an individual leaf we verified the methodology by testing changes in tree height size and shape of an average leaf drag coefficients and wind variance 2 methods 2 1 model design duet accesses canopy structure data stored in three dimensional voxelated density arrays and produces a discretized spatially explicit array of litter deposited on the ground resolved at meter scales the deposition region from a voxel within the tree canopy is an elliptical area defined by gravity local wind estimates and aerodynamic drag of the foliage that is falling models are then used to account for litter decay and compression effects according to each species characteristics and grass growth is predicted based on tree shade and litter cover patterns 2 2 foliage trajectory and deposition duet uses species dependent foliage bulk density for each canopy location in an explicitly resolved forest woodland or shrub layer within the domain of interest as input bulk density values are provided in a three dimensional voxelated array such arrays can be developed from field measured or remotely sensed data linn et al 2005 parsons et al 2018 pimont et al 2016 voxel size depends on the application but for the purposes of this work we choose voxel resolution of 1 or 2 m depending on the simulation we assume that in the absence of wind the foliage from each voxel falls predominantly downward with some oscillating lateral movement due to its unstable aerodynamics this lateral movement during the fall creates a cone of flight paths from each canopy location that intersect the ground within a circle of radius r g r o u n d measured in meters if the ground is flat r g r o u n d represents a minimally sized circular deposition footprint since any other trajectory induced by the presence of wind will be a longer distance with more dispersed patterns this is not strictly true for sloped ground which will be addressed in future work the radius of the resulting deposition pattern is dependent on the time in seconds the leaf requires to fall t f a l l and the lateral distance the leaf could travel during that time assuming minimal wind activity we assume that the leaf reaches terminal vertical velocity quickly and therefore t f a l l is defined using the height off the ground h c divided by the terminal velocity v t e r m i n a l v t e r m i n a l is dependent on the average mass and surface area for a leaf or needle for each species m f o l and a f o l the air density for the area ρ a i r the acceleration due to gravity g and a predefined drag coefficient for the leaves or needles c d either from literature or species specific measurements if available eqs 1 and 2 1 t f a l l h c v t e r m i n a l 2 v t e r m i n a l 2 m f o l g ρ a i r a f o l c d to calculate r g r o u n d we define the effective radius of the voxel of horizontal dimension d x d y to be the radius of the deposition circle if the foliage was located just above the ground when it fell r m i n d x d y π we then add to this minimum radius a distance contributed by oscillating lateral movement r o s c of the foliage as it falls from some height 0 3 r g r o u n d r m i n r o s c for information regarding how r o s c is defined please see appendix a given the circle with radius r g r o u n d meters located at coordinates x c y c on the ground below the canopy location we now perform displacement stretching and rotation to this circle to find the dispersal area for the foliage fig 1 these transformations deform the circle into an ellipse centered at c x c y with radii r m a j o r and r m i n o r aligned along angle θ to define these transformations we use mean horizontal wind velocity components in the x and y directions u and v and their standard deviations σ u and σ v at the very least this methodology requires estimates of wind velocities during the time when foliage is falling for each year since the last burn if more information is available regarding the winds throughout the area the model allows for the option to separate the year into equal sections monthly 4 seasons 6 months etc each with their own wind velocity components this offers the opportunity to designate a particular time of year for each specific species to drop their foliage as different species of trees might drop their foliage at different times of year and implement related wind conditions for that time using t f a l l the mean horizontal displacements in the x and y direction d x and d y for the elliptical region can be computed by integrating the horizontal wind velocity over this time for a discretized spatial and temporal system such as duet this collapses to d x u x t f a l l and d y u y t f a l l because of the terminal velocity approximation gravitational force and drag force are equal that translates to the foliage moving horizontally as the speed of the surrounding air see appendix b for the mathematics of this reduction by adding components of displacement in the x and y directions the net average horizontal movement of the foliage can be represented as the vector d d x i d y j where i and j indicate the directions aligned with the x and y axes the displaced center of the elliptical region for dispersal of the leaves or needles c x c y can be computed as c x x c d x and c y y c d y where x c y c is the center of the voxel distributing its leaves as the circle is displaced to a new location using u and v the angle of incidence for the cone becomes an ellipse as shown in fig 2 the ellipse is now assumed to be aligned such that the major axis is directly in line with the displacement vector d when the circular cross section with radius r g r o u n d of the dispersion path takes on an angular trajectory onto the ground some non zero horizontal distance from x c y c the projected pattern on the ground is much more elliptical in nature the projected ellipse is modeled with a minor axis that remains r g r o u n d and the major axis will be stretched into r d i s p to account for the angle of incidence fall trajectory and the ground 4 r d i s p r g r o u n d sin ψ r g r o u n d h c 2 d 2 h c which equals r g r o u n d for d 0 the rotation of the ellipse is determined by calculating the angle between u and v to align it with the displacement vector d fig 2 for the two stretches the standard deviation of the winds directly affects the breadth of the dispersal region for instance for high standard deviations in wind direction the ellipse will be stretched into a broader area than for low standard deviation this is to account for areas in which vast changes in wind directions occur rapidly during the time when the leaves are falling see appendices a and c for more information regarding the mathematical equations used to define these transformations 2 3 mass dispersal within the elliptical region once the elliptical region is defined duet disperses a portion of the mass for each species from a canopy voxel to a particular location in the elliptical region each species drops a fraction of the mass within the voxel that is shed per year ζ d r o p or per time period during the year when foliage is shed t d r o p ζ d r o p is calculated using the inverse of the number of years a species requires to shed its entire canopy a d r o p e g longleaf pine pinus palustris needles are retained for two years stowe 2019 thus a d r o p 2 which makes ζ d r o p 1 2 and thus each year 1 2 of the mass within a voxel populated by longleaf pine needles will be dispersed as foliage falls along a mean trajectory we assume that the distribution of the foliage within the deposition region is at its maximum at the center since the ellipse defines the outer limit of the potential deviation from the mean fall trajectory the foliage may achieve during its descent we assume that the deposition load declines linearly from the center to any location on the perimeter of the deposition region this means that the distribution of the foliage takes on a conical shape so that the peak of the cone is located at the center of the ellipse where the mean trajectory intersects the ground and the distribution reaches zero at the perimeter of the elliptical fall pattern in the absence of wind as the dispersal region is circular this process creates a circular cone distribution in the presence of a wind field the cone takes on the elliptical base for surface deposition since the integrated mass over the elliptical area is ζ d r o p times the mass within the source canopy cell m c we can solve for the maximum mass of the conical distribution m m a x which occurs at the center point of the ellipse c x c y we use the equation for the volume of a cone using the elliptical radii r m a j o r and r m i n o r 5 ζ d r o p m c 1 3 π r m a j o r r m i n o r m m a x m m a x 3 ζ d r o p m c π r m a j o r r m i n o r once the maximum of the conical distribution is known the deposited mass of the litter at any given point within the elliptical region can be calculated using a linear function with m m a x as the y intercept see section 2 6 for the numerical calculation of the mass dispersal for each year since the region was last burned the elliptical deposition region is identified for foliage falling from all canopy voxels with foliage in them and the resulting mass depositions are accumulated in appropriate ground level voxels this produces a layering effect with each layer tracked separately representing the litter fall per year within the simulation where total litter load is the sum of the layers in one voxel 2 4 litter decay decay is an important process controlling litter mass olson 1963 illustrates well how variables decay among ecosystems we postulate that the loss of litter mass accumulated per year m l i t t e r y e a r with a decay rate for species s d s y e a r can be written 6 m l i t t e r y e a r t d s y e a r m l i t t e r y e a r for mass accumulated in a single year this becomes 7 m l i t t e r y e a r 1 e d s y e a r m l i t t e r y e a r 1 litter is dispersed per year with various wind conditions which results in heterogeneous spatial deposition each year we can imagine this as laying down variably thick litter layers across the forest floor a layer for each year or potentially season depending on the species and location as annual layers build up in different areas the decay rate for each of these layers is affected by the number and thickness of layers that have accumulated above it older layers are likely to have more mass above them thus d s y e a r might be greater due to moisture retention and compaction when greater mass of litter is stacked above a specific year s layer by litter falling in more recent years mueller et al 2021 stephens et al 2004 for this proof of concept demonstration we approximate the annual decay of year layer d s y e a r with the most recent year of deposition defined as y r with the linear function 8 d s y e a r j y e a r 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r j where c p s is a species and area specific compaction rate and m l i t t e r j is the mass of the litter deposited in this area during year j then we have 9 m l i t t e r y e a r t j i y 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r j m l i t t e r y e a r 10 m a s s a c c u m t j 1 y r m l i t t e r j t j 1 y r k j 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r k m l i t t e r j m l i t t e r y r there are two long term effects that result from this increasing decay rate with increasing depth 1 the rate of change of the litter mass with time since last burn decreases with time and can stop changing when 11 j 1 y r k j 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r k m l i t t e r j m y r and 2 over many years there is an homogenization of litter loads as locations where large amounts of litter falls also eventually gain higher decay rates stephens et al 2004 2 5 grass production grass production is affected by light availability belowground competition and inhibition from accumulated tree litter hiers et al 2007 montgomery et al 2010 pecot et al 2007 the amount of grass is influenced by a litter cover factor λ l eq 11 determined by the amount of litter covering the ground in a particular voxel along with a shade factor λ s eq 12 determined by the voxel with the maximum density located above the voxel x y each of these factors are divided by ρ m a x s p e c i e s the maximum density of a given species that can exist within a particular voxel 12 λ l min ρ l i t t e r ρ m a x s p e c i e s ρ m a x s p e c i e s 13 λ s max z ρ s p e c i e s x y z ρ m a x s p e c i e s once these factors are determined grass growth is calculated by taking a fraction of the maximum annual grass growth for the area g r a s s a n n m a x in mass year 14 g r a s s x y e g l λ l g s λ s g r a s s a n n m a x for maximum litter and shade cover λ l λ s 1 and eq 14 simplifies to e g l g s where g l and g s represent the maximum inhibition of grass growth within the given area for litter cover or shade respectively note that if ρ l i t t e r and max z ρ s p e c i e s x y z are equal to 0 we have e 0 1 and there is no reduction in grass growth for circumstances in which only the average value of grass growth is known we normalize these values by finding the average value for the grass across the entire domain using the sum of all of the grass values for every voxel g r a s s x y and dividing by the number of cells in the domain h x h y with h x total voxels in the domain in the x direction h y total voxels in the domain in the y direction 15 g r a s s x y x y g r a s s x y h x h y 2 6 numerical implementation duet has been designed to create numerical simulations of litter and grass for a designated virtual environment the inputs for the system include a canopy voxel array and information regarding species and stems per hectare for the area to be simulated the outputs for the system were designed to be usable by various existing fire or ecosystem models 2 6 1 model inputs duet simulations begin the year of the last burn in which the previously existing grass and litter have been consumed leaving no grass or litter on the ground this can potentially be adjusted for existing grass and litter in future work the provided density array for the shrub or canopy fuels that exist in the area ρ f must be four dimensional with three spatial dimensions per species fourth index is species assuming no litter or grass the first layer of this array may contain shrub or canopy fuel however as some species stretch into the ground level voxels depending on height to foliage on plants and vertical extent of the first cell a list of species specific characteristics and a list of wind values must also be provided the species specific values required include the maximum density of a species ρ m a x s p e c i e s average crown bulk density within the tree ρ a v g an average mass for a single leaf or needle m f o l an average surface area for a single leaf or needle a f o l a drag coefficient for the leaf or needle c d a compaction rate c p s a moisture level for the live leaf m s and a timestep during which the leaves will be dropping from the tree t d r o p for instance the drag coefficient c d can be approximated based on the shape of the leaf a pine needle resembles a thin cylinder which could be approximately c d 0 6 whereas a broadleaf resembles a piece of paper which could be approximately c d 2 43 wind information must be provided for the area per time step although typically we use year length time steps the model can also use shorter time steps to account for the various times during the year that a particular species will lose its canopy the wind file must list the year the step during the year y t and the corresponding average wind speeds in the x and y directions at canopy height u and v along with their standard deviations σ u and σ v these can be directly measured for the area or obtained from gridded meteorological datasets based either on observations e g livneh livneh et al 2013 or the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet abatzoglou 2013 downscaled climate model simulations e g multivariate adaptive constructed analogs comparison project phase 5 maca cmip5 abatzoglou and brown 2012 or fine scale atmospheric simulations e g higrad dupuy et al 2011 koo et al 2012 if a fine scale atmospheric model is used the wind field presents as u and v values for each voxel in the domain array based on the vegetation structure itself and duet will calculate the u v σ u and σ v values for the vertical column corresponding to the canopy voxel dropping its leaves 2 6 2 numerical density calculations once the deposition distribution pattern for foliage originating from a particular canopy voxel and species has been defined by the equations in the previous sections the mass of the foliage is added to the appropriate ground level voxel the mass contribution from each canopy or shrub voxel that contains m c foliage bulk density to each of these ground voxels m x y is calculated using a weighting system based on the conical distribution model discussed above 16 m x y l n x y n 1 e n l n x y ζ d r o p m c l n is the relative height of the cone distribution pattern within voxel x y and e n is the total number of surface voxels contained within the entire elliptical deposition region associated with this source canopy voxel l n x y is defined as 17 l n x y 1 c x x 2 c y y 2 c x e x 2 c y e y 2 with c x c y as the coordinate of the center of the ellipse and e x e y as the corresponding coordinate for the edge of the ellipse such that there exists a straight line that passes through c x c y x y and e x e y appendix c fully defines the equations for e x and e y to illustrate how the numerical model applies the conical distribution for a given ellipse fig 3 shows the predicted litter bulk density at each of the surface voxels within the defined elliptical region from a single canopy voxel located 20 m high with wind values of u 9 m s v 9 m s σ u 5 m s and σ v 12 m s 3 results 3 1 simulation setup 3 1 1 tree maps we consider four synthetic forests to examine the effects on litter dispersal of several species and environmental characteristics including the impact of tree height drag coefficients wind influence average leaf surface area and decay factors to show the impact of tree height we developed two maps with generalized species characteristics a conifer species and a broadleaf species each with a single small tree and a single large tree table 1 reports the specific measurements used in these short versus tall simulations note that the drag coefficients compaction rates and drop rates are nondimensional parameters these parameter values represent average relative relationships developed from a dataset collected at eglin air force base in florida described in further detail below drag coefficients are used to distinguish fall trajectories for coniferous needles versus broadleaves we use a drag coefficient of 2 43 for the broadleaf described above a relatively flat leaf that will have more oscillations due to the larger surface area than the conifer for a coniferous needle which has less surface area and therefore will oscillate less as it falls through the air we use a drag coefficient of 0 6 a map using two identical trees at 10 m tall 5 m height to maximum crown radius and 0 m canopy base height with drag coefficients 0 6 and 2 43 compares drag coefficient effects we also test the model in a domain populated using tree measurements collected at eglin air force base in florida in 2008 ottmar et al 2015 a xeric longleaf pine pinus palustris sand hill forest and grass area with a subtropical climate the recorded tree locations span an area of approximately 67 m x 106 m the terrain in this area was without slope at that scale we used this tree dataset to populate a 400 m x 400 m domain at 2 m lateral resolution using random sampling of the original dataset while preserving measured stem density for a total of 2163 trees in the domain this dataset included two species of trees longleaf pine pinus palustris and turkey oak quercis laevis we used this tree map to test various decay factors and wind field effects 3 1 2 wind conditions to test the effect of winds on the litter deposition several of the simulations used extreme wind conditions using the standard deviation of the winds as a metric for variability we evaluated four idealized wind scenarios including 1 a no wind no standard deviation nwns scenario where the litter deposition is solely reliant on height from the tree and atmospheric drag and represents the circle with radius r g r o u n d 2 a high wind no standard deviation hwns scenario with homogeneous strong winds of 15 m s in every voxel coming directly from the southwest with no standard deviation in trajectory 3 a no wind high standard deviation nwhs scenario where wind speeds average spatially to 0 m s but standard deviation is high at 8 m s in all directions and 4 a high wind high standard deviation hwhs scenario with high average wind speeds 15 m s and high standard deviation 8 m s in both directions the simulations in which these wind scenarios are used are described in table 2 then we examined litter deposition using a more realistic wind profile to incorporate wind gusts that likely cause the leaves to fall from the tree for this purpose we first spun up a wind field in higrad using the same eglin tree plot with a starting wind speed of 13 4112 m s at a height of 34 m which is approximately 10 m above the highest tree in the dataset we used cyclic boundary conditions as described in pimont et al 2016 after allowing the wind to find a relatively steady state over 600 s we then recorded and averaged the mean wind values and variances in each voxel over all time steps to find the average wind speeds and the standard deviation at any given voxel within the three dimensional domain we applied duet using wind information averaged over all voxels from the ground up to the height of the given canopy voxel h c the values for the wind scenarios ranged as 18 1 1872 m s u 13 8865 m s 19 1 04651 m s v 0 9614 m s 20 0 0 m s σ u 24 3431 m s 21 0 0 m s σ v 7 4149 m s within the areas that contained the canopy voxels table 2 includes a list of all the simulations performed to test the functionality of duet 3 2 basic model functionality 3 2 1 effects of tree height to test the model s ability to distinguish litter dispersal from short versus tall trees we used a small domain with 1 m resolution and two general tree types conifer and broadleaf cth and bth simulations described in table 2 we applied species characteristics as defined in table 1 in section 2 7 2 with wind descriptions as defined in section 2 7 3 and table 2 figs 4 and 5 show the results of the tree height comparison the broadleaf tree canopy represented here stretches down to the ground while conifer trees have height to live crown distances of 5 m and 10 m for the short and tall trees respectively when no mean wind is present litter accumulates primarily below and around trees taller trees result in a broader dispersal area compare figs 4a 4c 5a and 5c with a positive mean wind the dispersal area is stretched in the direction of the mean wind for broadleaf trees it begins closer to the base of the tree than for the conifer trees compare fig 4b and 4d and 5b and 5d figs 4c 4d 5c and 5d also show that high wind standard deviations disperse the limited amount of litter from short trees leading to low litter bulk densities in any given voxel 3 2 2 drag coefficient comparison to demonstrate the influence of the drag coefficient on the litter dispersal region we used a small domain with two trees each of which were 10 m tall 5 m maximum radius 0 m height to live crown with drag coefficients 0 6 and 2 43 fig 6 shows the results of the drag coefficient test with the absence of wind influence the drag coefficient does not affect the dispersal region as shown in fig 6a a larger drag coefficient expands the dispersal region due to the inverse relationship with terminal velocity v t e r m i n a l eq 2 as v t e r m i n a l increases the time it takes for the foliage to fall t f a l l increases which in turn increases the maximum horizontal distance that the foliage can be transported and the greater dispersion that can occur broadening the dispersal region fig 6b d show these expansions clearly 3 2 3 decay factor comparison to show the long term effects of the decay factor on litter buildup we ran three five year simulations on a 400 m x 400 m tree map using the two species described in table 1 the first simulation tracks how the litter decays when deposited in the first of the five years with no other litter placed for the duration of the simulation fig 7 to develop fig 7 we calculated the litter deposit for a single year with zero wind influence and then applied the decay function with three different decay factors for 5 years without adding litter after the initial year with a decay factor of 0 1 we lose 1 e 0 1 10 of the mass each year a decay factor of 0 5 results in a loss of 1 e 0 5 40 mass per year and a decay factor of 1 0 results in a loss of 1 e 1 0 63 mass per year in the figure we begin with the same amount of litter dispersal for the first year which is why the litter maps in the column for year 1 are identical since the decay factor of 0 1 only results in 10 loss of mass per year the mass on the ground remains for several years after the initial dispersal in fig 7 the top row of year 5 is only slightly lighter than the top row of year 1 indicating only a slight loss of mass or approximately 1 e 0 1 5 40 mass loss in contrast the decay factor of 1 0 results in a 1 e 1 0 5 99 loss of mass over five years which can be seen in fig 7 in the bottom row on the right which is almost completely devoid of litter 3 3 idealized forest area representation 3 3 1 litter buildup under randomized wind conditions we performed simulations on a 400 m by 400 m domain with 2 m resolution to examine litter dispersion from trees of variable size and shape we populated the domain with 2163 trees with heights ranging from 6 7 m to 23 2 m heights to live crown ranging from 0 m to 17 7 m and height to maximum crown radius ranging from 1 2 m to 12 8 m we chose random wind velocities that ranged as 22 8 998 m s u 5 308 m s 23 8 815 m s v 7 433 m s 24 7 871 m s σ u 8 785 m s 25 7 396 m s σ v 7 330 m s fig 8 shows the litter accumulation over ten years with overlapping ellipses the layering effect for these elliptical dispersal regions is clearly shown in this figure by year 10 there occurs a clear and direct connection with the canopy structure which is strengthened over time 3 3 2 litter deposition under gusty wind conditions because litter deposition from the canopy is sensitive to the variation in the wind fields we next explored the influence of variation in winds through the large eddy simulation model higrad results of which are shown in fig 9 this more realistic wind field represents how we can account for the fully variable wind conditions for each spatial grid cell within the domain since the wind fields in these simulations are a function of the stand scale drag and include minimal wind speeds close to the ground we can see that the dispersal regions are restricted closer to the tree locations within denser stands the attenuation of mean windspeed dominates the distribution of litter with occasional gusts distributing litter farther from originating voxels 4 discussion the duet model can produce a heterogeneous surface litter and grass layer through a mechanistic representation of leaf litter and herbaceous spatial distribution based on tree canopy structure simulations explore critical phenomena that lead to the surface fuel deposition and growth patterns and results agree with expected sensitivities to various canopy and wind parameters however there are processes that affect fuel distribution that are not yet included and continued efforts to validate the model are necessary 4 1 overstory structure and composition duet produces modeled tree litter accumulation that is directly affected by overstory structure including the height and species specific characteristics of the trees in agreement with observations nickmans et al 2019 staelens et al 2003 the model uses the height from which foliage is falling along with the average mass surface area and drag coefficient for the foliage leaves or needles to calculate the fall time for the foliage based on a terminal velocity approximation in conjunction with the average wind speeds associated with the time period in which the foliage falls this fall time helps to define the breadth of the dispersal pattern possible when falling needles or leaves reach the ground the orientation of the wind influenced fall path elongates the otherwise circular pattern into an elliptical region if the path is not straight down figs 4 and 5 in section 3 2 1 show effects of the height of the tree on the deposition region species foliage characteristics also influence the width of the deposition pattern we compare oak leaves which have a larger surface area and thus greater drag mass to pine needles this slows down the fall speed of oak leaves relative to pine needles increases the time aloft and allows for more lateral dispersion therefore the spread is generally broader for a given tree height see fig 6 since access to information on canopy structure is more readily available than understory structure having a model that bases the understory on the canopy may provide the necessary precision for improving fire and ecosystem model inputs silva et al 2016 4 2 wind influence wind events in the area directly affect when and how the litter falls from the tree staelens et al 2003 in duet we use average wind speeds and standard deviations for the area to define the shape and size of the dispersal region as wind is a main driver for mean horizontal movement of litter while it is falling we use average wind speed to determine horizontal displacement as well as the orientation and length of the ellipse in line with the horizontal trajectory the standard deviation of wind speed affects how wide or narrow the ellipse becomes perpendicular to the displacement vector we treat the influences of the wind standard deviations as having a diffusion type effect on the leaves or needles resulting in a conical distribution of leaves when they land while the majority of the leaves follow the mean path the net pattern of foliage deposition from any single canopy source is a maximum at the center of the deposition pattern and the loadings fall off to zero linearly at the perimeter while currently these wind trajectories are static inputs to the model we hope to connect to a database in which we can implement recorded wind information for various time periods throughout the year and potentially expand duet to include dynamic wind inputs figs 4 5 6 and 9 all show the effect wind conditions have on the elliptical regions and the heterogeneity of the result in low wind conditions the dispersal regions remain close to the tree boles while high wind conditions result in wider spread future iterations of the model should incorporate a wind intensity vector that accounts for higher rates of litter drop during high wind events 4 3 decay processes within duet decay processes affect how the bulk density moisture level and depth of litter changes over the years after deposition as well as the inhibition of grass growth with the layering effect created over years of litter accumulation the decay processes are affected both by species specific decay factors and depth of litter on top fig 7 shows three different decay factors and the resulting effect on the litter accumulation through the years after they fall when a smaller decay factor is applied the litter does not decay and reduce as much as a higher decay factor when coupled with the layering effect shown in fig 8 the decay factor has a high influence on the spatial heterogeneity of litter on the ground over years 4 4 model assumptions as with any mathematical model several assumptions were made within the design of duet first we assumed that leaves reach their terminal vertical velocity immediately during the descent whereas in reality the time required to reach terminal velocity is typically reached asymptotically and depends on the air resistance and weight of the object the latter assumption may be less critical for litter resulting from broad leaves than needles as drag forces lead needles to reach terminal velocity in a shorter time but a full consideration of velocity is needed in future work further the decay functions used in duet are appropriate for shorter timeframes and xeric sites of the southeastern u s but don t include nutrient cycling including carbon nitrogen detritivore effects as described in de smedt et al 2018 and climatic effects on litter decomposition rates as described in gavazov 2010 further expanding the decay function and adding live and dead fuel moisture information and grass senescence and decay to the model would improve model accuracy and expand the range of ecosystems to which the model can be applied duet does not currently include redistribution of litter by the wind or animal tracking once on the ground which is observed predominantly in hardwood litter wade and lunsford 1989 many shrub species or trees in shrub stature contribute to the understory characteristics of many surface fire regimes which are currently included as regular trees but can be added as an additional component to the model 4 5 the need for validation while the model produces heterogeneity that meets expected patterns for wind tree height and litter type there is a need for both verification and validation while verification of a model confirms that the model is correctly implemented validation ensures that the model represents the real system it was built to represent accurately in this study we have presented verification of the duet model by testing the model s representation of various idealized scenarios however validation must occur through spatially explicit field data which are just now becoming available at scales to test duet hawley et al 2018 as we have worked with various institutions to gather real world data for validation we have found that typical methods for collecting data on surface fuels tend to be limited to localized measurements and transect descriptions but lack explicit spatial distribution patterns or spatial correlation with canopy structure or arrangement we are currently designing a method for collecting data that may more explicitly describe the litter distribution which should be implemented over the next year we plan to use this newly developed data set to compare our model to previous models and test for improvement in accuracy for now we view duet as a series of hypotheses that brings together the basic influential processes involved in how the canopy affects litter buildup which will be evaluated against these high resolution observations in the future 5 conclusions duet provides complex realistic and adjustable representations of tree leaf litter and grass distributions that directly relate to canopy structure litter decay and wind dynamics potential applications of this model include developing realistic heterogeneous surface fuel representations for spatially explicit fire behavior models and ecological examinations of ecosystem dynamics dependent on variable representation of litter biomass midgley et al 2015 including nutrient cycling within senescence processes lin et al 2017 stoler and relyea 2011 and fine scale fire behavior hiers et al 2009 duet can also be used to examine finer scale litter and grass dynamics that can influence coarser scale fuel and fire dynamics in current stand and landscape level ecosystem models e g keane et al 2011 loudermilk et al 2011 scheller et al 2019 duet has the flexibility to be calibrated for any forest type through the tree species characteristics as well as environmental inputs and parameters by representing leaf fall within an ellipse the model allows for approximations within leaf traits such as surface area and mass and coarse dispersal functions using duet one could vary wind speeds and direction through time and characterize several possible surface fuel representations for simulating ecosystem or fire behavior within the area our results show how the drag coefficient wind dynamics and decay factors affect litter accumulation though space and time through species specific parameterization the model can be calibrated for specific species or generalized for a broad range of species e g conifer vs broadleaves similarly wind inputs can represent specific wind events or averaged values across a given area such mechanistic models are critical for representations of fine scale heterogeneity driven

24143,heterogeneity in surface fuels produced by overstory trees and understory vegetation is a major driver of fire behavior and ecosystem dynamics previous attempts at predicting tree leaf and needle litter accumulation over time have been constrained in scope to probabilistic models that consider a limited number of key factors influencing tree litter dispersal patterns and decomposition processes we present a mechanistic model for estimating variation in surface fuels called the distribution of understory using elliptical transport duet duet uses a pre generated voxelated canopy array and distributes the leaf litter from the trees in an elliptical shape based on tree species characteristics wind data and location specific features duet then calculates grass growth between trees and around the litter patterns and sets moisture levels based on relative humidity in this study we use duet to simulate spatial distributions of leaf litter and illustrate model sensitivity to several parameters providing inputs for testing fuel spatial heterogeneity impacts on fire behavior using process based models keywords tree litter modeling leaves needles surface fuels prescribed fires data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the spread and intensity of wildland fire is determined by an interplay between elements of the fire environment including fuels weather and topography agee 1996 rothermel 1972 fire behavior sensitivity to fuel heterogeneity depends on fire intensity and qualities of the fire environment in low wind and low intensity fire scenarios fire behavior can be particularly sensitive to the distribution of understory or surface fuels consisting of live herbaceous vegetation shrubs and dead leaf litter dell et al 2017 hiers et al 2009 loudermilk et al 2017 prior et al 2018 stephens et al 2004 accounting for the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of surface fuels is thus important for predicting prescribed fire behavior marginal fire spread as well as flanking and backing portions of wildfires atchley et al 2021 campbell lochrie et al 2021 linn et al 2021 recent work has highlighted fire behavior sensitivity to surface fuel distribution for a variety of ecosystems through observation loudermilk et al 2014 o brien et al 2016 skowronski et al 2020 and modeling coen et al 2020 hoffman et al 2018 linn et al 2021 loudermilk et al 2011 parsons et al 2017 in addition to wildland fire behavior tree litter deposition patterns affect ecosystem dynamics by supplying soil nutrients through leaf bark and catkin litter decomposition midgley et al 2015 several studies have examined how different tree species litter affects soil nitrogen and carbon lin et al 2017 prescott and grayston 2013 trap et al 2017 more precise representation of spatial litter distributions may lead to a better understanding of ecosystem changes due to litter accumulation from various tree species within forests or wetlands stoler and relyea 2011 and potentially how patterns of decomposition influence fire effects arthur et al 2012 carpenter et al 2020 stephens et al 2004 heterogeneous tree litter and grass patterns are influenced by various factors including overstory structure and prevailing winds which affect when it falls from trees or shrubs where foliage lands and how it influences grass distribution and density through indirect effects on resources jonard et al 2006 pecot et al 2007 riegel et al 1992 staelens et al 2003 once on the ground other processes redistribute and decompose the litter material forrester and bauhus 2016 garcía palacios et al 2016 a number of factors can alter the trajectory of leaves when they fall from the tree including the shape of the needles or leaves the height from which they fall and local winds at the time when they fall nickmans et al 2019 decay variability which depends on climatic conditions species litter characteristics and chemistry moisture retention packing density etc can change the depth and loading of the localized litter accumulation the nutrient composition of the soils and the moisture levels present at any given time adair et al 2008 arthur et al 2012 babl plauche et al 2022 berg and lönn 2022 cornelissen et al 2017 keane 2008 mitchell et al 1999 traditional sampling methods for obtaining accurate and spatially explicit estimates of the dynamic heterogeneity of surface biomass require considerable investment in personnel time and money keane and reeves 2012 tinkham et al 2012 at stand scales 100 s of ha scientists and managers commonly combine surface biomass sampling approaches with other forest and rangeland inventory methods to estimate the fuel load at landscape or prescribed fire burn block scales for various fuel strata i e

techniques and photogrammetric methods keane et al 2012 show success when representing surface fuels rowell et al 2020 however they are associated with great financial and labor costs when employed at landscape scales silva et al 2016 aerial lidar can be used at much larger spatial scales and while it can be used to some degree to map coarse woody debris seielstad and queen 2003 or shrubs gajardo et al 2014 it is limited in its ability to detect lower strata surface fuels such as litter or grass due to both signal noise and occlusion consequently most studies using aerial lidar have focused on characterizing the canopy fuel layer and individual tree properties such as tree crown diameter stem spatial density basal area and biomass in several locations goodwin et al 2006 hudak et al 2008 hyde et al 2006 ruiz et al 2014 silva et al 2016 litter and grass continue to be difficult to map with remote sensing so spatially explicit data capturing their patterns at large extents is difficult to find most previous work modeling litter dispersal employs probabilistic approaches ferrari and sugita 1996 created an exponential model based on stem location which staelens et al 2003 expanded to include wind influence jonard et al 2006 used a ballistic and a weibull distribution approach that incorporated height of maximum crown radius which was also used by nickmans et al 2019 to determine soil nutrient characteristics linn et al 2005 used the vertically integrated canopy foliar mass above a location to infer litter and grass patterns but this approach led to litter being only located directly under trees the jonard et al 2006 model assumed all leaves were released from the center of the tree at the height of maximum crown radius and it modeled leaf dispersal patterns using a seed dispersal model designed by greene and johnson 1989 although there is value in each of these approaches they miss some of the processes that impact litter dispersal such as variation in heights and locations of trees from which leaves and needles fall species specific leaf and needle characteristics and dominant seasonal wind events which can create direction bias in litterfall heterogeneity here we describe a mechanistic model called the distribution of understory using elliptical transport duet using a frequently burned longleaf pine woodland in the southeastern u s as a case study two tree species with different canopy and leaf shapes pine needles vs broad leaves are used to test the model duet uses simplified fall trajectories to determine leaf litter and grass spatial patterns from a given overstory structure with specified wind conditions for brevity we define leaf litter as only dead leaves and needles we propose a methodology to model leaf and needle shedding from trees accumulation on the surface decay and compaction over time and the effects of litter buildup on grass growth the model uses elliptical dispersal regions to represent the area covered by litter as a function of winds and aerodynamic characteristics of falling foliage based on surface area and drag coefficients approximated from the average size and shape of an individual leaf we verified the methodology by testing changes in tree height size and shape of an average leaf drag coefficients and wind variance 2 methods 2 1 model design duet accesses canopy structure data stored in three dimensional voxelated density arrays and produces a discretized spatially explicit array of litter deposited on the ground resolved at meter scales the deposition region from a voxel within the tree canopy is an elliptical area defined by gravity local wind estimates and aerodynamic drag of the foliage that is falling models are then used to account for litter decay and compression effects according to each species characteristics and grass growth is predicted based on tree shade and litter cover patterns 2 2 foliage trajectory and deposition duet uses species dependent foliage bulk density for each canopy location in an explicitly resolved forest woodland or shrub layer within the domain of interest as input bulk density values are provided in a three dimensional voxelated array such arrays can be developed from field measured or remotely sensed data linn et al 2005 parsons et al 2018 pimont et al 2016 voxel size depends on the application but for the purposes of this work we choose voxel resolution of 1 or 2 m depending on the simulation we assume that in the absence of wind the foliage from each voxel falls predominantly downward with some oscillating lateral movement due to its unstable aerodynamics this lateral movement during the fall creates a cone of flight paths from each canopy location that intersect the ground within a circle of radius r g r o u n d measured in meters if the ground is flat r g r o u n d represents a minimally sized circular deposition footprint since any other trajectory induced by the presence of wind will be a longer distance with more dispersed patterns this is not strictly true for sloped ground which will be addressed in future work the radius of the resulting deposition pattern is dependent on the time in seconds the leaf requires to fall t f a l l and the lateral distance the leaf could travel during that time assuming minimal wind activity we assume that the leaf reaches terminal vertical velocity quickly and therefore t f a l l is defined using the height off the ground h c divided by the terminal velocity v t e r m i n a l v t e r m i n a l is dependent on the average mass and surface area for a leaf or needle for each species m f o l and a f o l the air density for the area ρ a i r the acceleration due to gravity g and a predefined drag coefficient for the leaves or needles c d either from literature or species specific measurements if available eqs 1 and 2 1 t f a l l h c v t e r m i n a l 2 v t e r m i n a l 2 m f o l g ρ a i r a f o l c d to calculate r g r o u n d we define the effective radius of the voxel of horizontal dimension d x d y to be the radius of the deposition circle if the foliage was located just above the ground when it fell r m i n d x d y π we then add to this minimum radius a distance contributed by oscillating lateral movement r o s c of the foliage as it falls from some height 0 3 r g r o u n d r m i n r o s c for information regarding how r o s c is defined please see appendix a given the circle with radius r g r o u n d meters located at coordinates x c y c on the ground below the canopy location we now perform displacement stretching and rotation to this circle to find the dispersal area for the foliage fig 1 these transformations deform the circle into an ellipse centered at c x c y with radii r m a j o r and r m i n o r aligned along angle θ to define these transformations we use mean horizontal wind velocity components in the x and y directions u and v and their standard deviations σ u and σ v at the very least this methodology requires estimates of wind velocities during the time when foliage is falling for each year since the last burn if more information is available regarding the winds throughout the area the model allows for the option to separate the year into equal sections monthly 4 seasons 6 months etc each with their own wind velocity components this offers the opportunity to designate a particular time of year for each specific species to drop their foliage as different species of trees might drop their foliage at different times of year and implement related wind conditions for that time using t f a l l the mean horizontal displacements in the x and y direction d x and d y for the elliptical region can be computed by integrating the horizontal wind velocity over this time for a discretized spatial and temporal system such as duet this collapses to d x u x t f a l l and d y u y t f a l l because of the terminal velocity approximation gravitational force and drag force are equal that translates to the foliage moving horizontally as the speed of the surrounding air see appendix b for the mathematics of this reduction by adding components of displacement in the x and y directions the net average horizontal movement of the foliage can be represented as the vector d d x i d y j where i and j indicate the directions aligned with the x and y axes the displaced center of the elliptical region for dispersal of the leaves or needles c x c y can be computed as c x x c d x and c y y c d y where x c y c is the center of the voxel distributing its leaves as the circle is displaced to a new location using u and v the angle of incidence for the cone becomes an ellipse as shown in fig 2 the ellipse is now assumed to be aligned such that the major axis is directly in line with the displacement vector d when the circular cross section with radius r g r o u n d of the dispersion path takes on an angular trajectory onto the ground some non zero horizontal distance from x c y c the projected pattern on the ground is much more elliptical in nature the projected ellipse is modeled with a minor axis that remains r g r o u n d and the major axis will be stretched into r d i s p to account for the angle of incidence fall trajectory and the ground 4 r d i s p r g r o u n d sin ψ r g r o u n d h c 2 d 2 h c which equals r g r o u n d for d 0 the rotation of the ellipse is determined by calculating the angle between u and v to align it with the displacement vector d fig 2 for the two stretches the standard deviation of the winds directly affects the breadth of the dispersal region for instance for high standard deviations in wind direction the ellipse will be stretched into a broader area than for low standard deviation this is to account for areas in which vast changes in wind directions occur rapidly during the time when the leaves are falling see appendices a and c for more information regarding the mathematical equations used to define these transformations 2 3 mass dispersal within the elliptical region once the elliptical region is defined duet disperses a portion of the mass for each species from a canopy voxel to a particular location in the elliptical region each species drops a fraction of the mass within the voxel that is shed per year ζ d r o p or per time period during the year when foliage is shed t d r o p ζ d r o p is calculated using the inverse of the number of years a species requires to shed its entire canopy a d r o p e g longleaf pine pinus palustris needles are retained for two years stowe 2019 thus a d r o p 2 which makes ζ d r o p 1 2 and thus each year 1 2 of the mass within a voxel populated by longleaf pine needles will be dispersed as foliage falls along a mean trajectory we assume that the distribution of the foliage within the deposition region is at its maximum at the center since the ellipse defines the outer limit of the potential deviation from the mean fall trajectory the foliage may achieve during its descent we assume that the deposition load declines linearly from the center to any location on the perimeter of the deposition region this means that the distribution of the foliage takes on a conical shape so that the peak of the cone is located at the center of the ellipse where the mean trajectory intersects the ground and the distribution reaches zero at the perimeter of the elliptical fall pattern in the absence of wind as the dispersal region is circular this process creates a circular cone distribution in the presence of a wind field the cone takes on the elliptical base for surface deposition since the integrated mass over the elliptical area is ζ d r o p times the mass within the source canopy cell m c we can solve for the maximum mass of the conical distribution m m a x which occurs at the center point of the ellipse c x c y we use the equation for the volume of a cone using the elliptical radii r m a j o r and r m i n o r 5 ζ d r o p m c 1 3 π r m a j o r r m i n o r m m a x m m a x 3 ζ d r o p m c π r m a j o r r m i n o r once the maximum of the conical distribution is known the deposited mass of the litter at any given point within the elliptical region can be calculated using a linear function with m m a x as the y intercept see section 2 6 for the numerical calculation of the mass dispersal for each year since the region was last burned the elliptical deposition region is identified for foliage falling from all canopy voxels with foliage in them and the resulting mass depositions are accumulated in appropriate ground level voxels this produces a layering effect with each layer tracked separately representing the litter fall per year within the simulation where total litter load is the sum of the layers in one voxel 2 4 litter decay decay is an important process controlling litter mass olson 1963 illustrates well how variables decay among ecosystems we postulate that the loss of litter mass accumulated per year m l i t t e r y e a r with a decay rate for species s d s y e a r can be written 6 m l i t t e r y e a r t d s y e a r m l i t t e r y e a r for mass accumulated in a single year this becomes 7 m l i t t e r y e a r 1 e d s y e a r m l i t t e r y e a r 1 litter is dispersed per year with various wind conditions which results in heterogeneous spatial deposition each year we can imagine this as laying down variably thick litter layers across the forest floor a layer for each year or potentially season depending on the species and location as annual layers build up in different areas the decay rate for each of these layers is affected by the number and thickness of layers that have accumulated above it older layers are likely to have more mass above them thus d s y e a r might be greater due to moisture retention and compaction when greater mass of litter is stacked above a specific year s layer by litter falling in more recent years mueller et al 2021 stephens et al 2004 for this proof of concept demonstration we approximate the annual decay of year layer d s y e a r with the most recent year of deposition defined as y r with the linear function 8 d s y e a r j y e a r 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r j where c p s is a species and area specific compaction rate and m l i t t e r j is the mass of the litter deposited in this area during year j then we have 9 m l i t t e r y e a r t j i y 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r j m l i t t e r y e a r 10 m a s s a c c u m t j 1 y r m l i t t e r j t j 1 y r k j 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r k m l i t t e r j m l i t t e r y r there are two long term effects that result from this increasing decay rate with increasing depth 1 the rate of change of the litter mass with time since last burn decreases with time and can stop changing when 11 j 1 y r k j 1 y r c p s m l i t t e r k m l i t t e r j m y r and 2 over many years there is an homogenization of litter loads as locations where large amounts of litter falls also eventually gain higher decay rates stephens et al 2004 2 5 grass production grass production is affected by light availability belowground competition and inhibition from accumulated tree litter hiers et al 2007 montgomery et al 2010 pecot et al 2007 the amount of grass is influenced by a litter cover factor λ l eq 11 determined by the amount of litter covering the ground in a particular voxel along with a shade factor λ s eq 12 determined by the voxel with the maximum density located above the voxel x y each of these factors are divided by ρ m a x s p e c i e s the maximum density of a given species that can exist within a particular voxel 12 λ l min ρ l i t t e r ρ m a x s p e c i e s ρ m a x s p e c i e s 13 λ s max z ρ s p e c i e s x y z ρ m a x s p e c i e s once these factors are determined grass growth is calculated by taking a fraction of the maximum annual grass growth for the area g r a s s a n n m a x in mass year 14 g r a s s x y e g l λ l g s λ s g r a s s a n n m a x for maximum litter and shade cover λ l λ s 1 and eq 14 simplifies to e g l g s where g l and g s represent the maximum inhibition of grass growth within the given area for litter cover or shade respectively note that if ρ l i t t e r and max z ρ s p e c i e s x y z are equal to 0 we have e 0 1 and there is no reduction in grass growth for circumstances in which only the average value of grass growth is known we normalize these values by finding the average value for the grass across the entire domain using the sum of all of the grass values for every voxel g r a s s x y and dividing by the number of cells in the domain h x h y with h x total voxels in the domain in the x direction h y total voxels in the domain in the y direction 15 g r a s s x y x y g r a s s x y h x h y 2 6 numerical implementation duet has been designed to create numerical simulations of litter and grass for a designated virtual environment the inputs for the system include a canopy voxel array and information regarding species and stems per hectare for the area to be simulated the outputs for the system were designed to be usable by various existing fire or ecosystem models 2 6 1 model inputs duet simulations begin the year of the last burn in which the previously existing grass and litter have been consumed leaving no grass or litter on the ground this can potentially be adjusted for existing grass and litter in future work the provided density array for the shrub or canopy fuels that exist in the area ρ f must be four dimensional with three spatial dimensions per species fourth index is species assuming no litter or grass the first layer of this array may contain shrub or canopy fuel however as some species stretch into the ground level voxels depending on height to foliage on plants and vertical extent of the first cell a list of species specific characteristics and a list of wind values must also be provided the species specific values required include the maximum density of a species ρ m a x s p e c i e s

approximated based on the shape of the leaf a pine needle resembles a thin cylinder which could be approximately c d 0 6 whereas a broadleaf resembles a piece of paper which could be approximately c d

year that a particular species will lose its canopy the wind file must list the year the step during the year y t and the corresponding average wind speeds in the x and y directions at canopy height u and v along with their standard deviations σ u and σ v these can be directly measured for the area or obtained from gridded meteorological datasets based either on observations e g livneh livneh et al

characteristics including the impact of tree height drag coefficients wind influence average leaf surface area and decay factors to show the impact of tree height we developed two maps with generalized species characteristics a conifer species and a broadleaf species each with a single small tree and a single large tree table 1 reports the specific measurements used in these short versus tall simulations note that the drag coefficients compaction rates and drop rates are nondimensional parameters these parameter values represent average relative relationships developed from a dataset collected at eglin air force base in florida described in further detail below drag coefficients are used to distinguish fall trajectories for coniferous needles versus broadleaves we use a drag coefficient of 2 43 for the broadleaf described above a relatively flat leaf that will have more oscillations due to the larger surface area than the conifer for a coniferous needle which has less surface area and therefore will oscillate less as it falls through the air we use a drag coefficient of 0 6 a map using two identical trees at 10 m tall 5 m height to maximum crown radius and 0 m canopy base height with drag coefficients 0 6 and 2 43 compares drag coefficient effects we also test the model in a domain populated using tree measurements collected at eglin air force base in florida in 2008 ottmar et al 2015 a xeric longleaf pine pinus palustris sand hill forest and grass area with a subtropical climate the recorded tree locations span an area of approximately 67 m x 106 m the terrain in this area was without slope at that scale we used this tree dataset to populate a 400 m x 400 m domain at 2 m lateral resolution using random sampling of the original dataset while preserving measured stem density for a total of 2163 trees in the domain this dataset included two species of trees longleaf pine pinus palustris and turkey oak quercis laevis we used this tree map to test various decay factors and wind field effects 3 1 2 wind conditions to test the effect of winds on the litter deposition several of the simulations used extreme wind conditions using the standard deviation of the winds as a metric for variability we evaluated four idealized wind scenarios including 1 a no wind no standard deviation nwns scenario where the litter deposition is solely reliant on height from the tree and atmospheric drag and represents the circle with radius r g r o u n d 2 a high wind no standard deviation hwns scenario with homogeneous strong winds of 15 m s in every voxel coming directly from the southwest with no standard deviation in trajectory 3 a no wind high standard deviation nwhs scenario where wind speeds average spatially to 0 m s but standard deviation is high at 8 m s in all directions and 4 a high wind high standard deviation hwhs scenario with high average wind speeds 15 m s and high standard deviation 8 m s in both directions the simulations in which these wind scenarios are used are described in table 2 then we examined litter deposition using a more realistic wind profile to incorporate wind gusts that likely cause the leaves to fall from the tree for this purpose we first spun up a wind field in higrad using the same eglin tree plot with a starting wind speed of 13 4112 m s at a height of 34 m which is approximately 10 m above the highest tree in the dataset we used cyclic boundary conditions as described in pimont et al 2016 after allowing the wind to find a relatively steady state over 600 s we then recorded and averaged the mean wind values and variances in each voxel over all time steps to find the average wind speeds and the standard deviation at any given voxel within the three dimensional domain we applied duet using wind information averaged over all voxels from the ground up to the height of the given canopy voxel h c the values for the wind scenarios ranged as 18 1 1872 m s u 13 8865 m s 19 1 04651 m s v 0 9614 m s 20 0 0 m s σ u 24 3431 m s 21 0 0 m s σ v 7 4149 m s within the areas that contained the canopy voxels table 2 includes a list of all the simulations performed to test the functionality of duet 3 2 basic model functionality 3 2 1 effects of tree height to test the model s ability to distinguish litter dispersal from short versus tall trees we used a small domain with 1 m resolution and two general tree types conifer and broadleaf cth and bth simulations described in table 2 we applied species characteristics as defined in table 1 in section 2 7 2 with wind descriptions as defined in section 2 7 3 and table 2 figs 4 and 5 show the results of the tree height comparison the broadleaf tree canopy represented here stretches down to the ground while conifer trees have height to live crown distances of 5 m and 10 m for the short and tall trees respectively when no mean wind is present litter accumulates primarily below and around trees taller trees result in a broader dispersal area compare figs 4a 4c 5a and 5c with a positive mean wind the dispersal area is stretched in the direction of the mean wind for broadleaf trees it begins closer to the base of the tree than for the conifer trees compare fig 4b and 4d and 5b and 5d figs 4c 4d 5c and 5d also show that high wind standard deviations disperse the limited amount of litter from short trees leading to low litter bulk densities in any given voxel 3 2 2 drag coefficient comparison to demonstrate the influence of the drag coefficient on the litter dispersal region we used a small domain with two trees each of which were 10 m tall 5 m maximum radius 0 m height to live crown with drag coefficients 0 6 and 2 43 fig 6 shows the results of the drag coefficient test with the absence of wind influence the drag coefficient does not affect the dispersal region as shown in fig 6a a larger drag coefficient expands the dispersal region due to the inverse relationship with terminal velocity v t e r m i n a l eq 2 as v t e r m i n a l increases the time it takes for the foliage to fall t f a l l increases which in turn increases the maximum horizontal distance that the foliage can be transported and the greater dispersion that can occur broadening the dispersal region fig 6b d show these expansions clearly 3 2 3 decay factor comparison to show the long term effects of the decay factor on litter buildup we ran three five year simulations on a 400 m x 400 m tree map using the two species described in table 1 the first simulation tracks how the litter decays when deposited in the first of the five years with no other litter placed for the duration of the simulation fig 7 to develop fig 7 we calculated the litter deposit for a single year with zero wind influence and then applied the decay function with three different decay factors for 5 years without adding litter after the initial year with a decay factor of 0 1 we lose 1 e 0 1 10 of the mass each year a decay factor of 0 5 results in a loss of 1 e 0 5 40 mass per year and a decay factor of 1 0 results in a loss of 1 e 1 0 63 mass per year in the figure we begin with the same amount of litter dispersal for the first year which is why the litter maps in the column for year 1 are identical since the decay factor of 0 1 only results in 10 loss of mass per year the mass on the ground remains for several years after the initial dispersal in fig 7 the top row of year 5 is only slightly lighter than the top row of year 1 indicating only a slight loss of mass or approximately 1 e 0 1 5 40 mass loss in contrast the decay factor of 1 0 results in a 1 e 1 0 5 99 loss of mass over five years which can be seen in fig 7 in the bottom row on the right which is almost completely devoid of litter 3 3 idealized forest area representation 3 3 1 litter buildup under randomized wind conditions we performed simulations on a 400 m by 400 m domain with 2 m resolution to examine litter dispersion from trees of variable size and shape we populated the domain with 2163 trees with heights ranging from 6 7 m to 23 2 m heights to live crown ranging from 0 m to 17 7 m and height to maximum crown radius ranging from 1 2 m to 12 8 m we chose random wind velocities that ranged as 22 8 998 m s u 5 308 m s 23 8 815 m s v 7 433 m s 24 7 871 m s σ u 8 785 m s 25 7 396 m s σ v 7 330 m s fig 8 shows the litter accumulation over ten years with overlapping ellipses the layering effect for these elliptical dispersal regions is clearly shown in this figure by year 10 there occurs a clear and direct connection with the canopy structure which is strengthened over time 3 3 2 litter deposition under gusty wind conditions because litter deposition from the canopy is sensitive to the variation in the wind fields we next explored the influence of variation in winds through the large eddy simulation model higrad results of which are shown in fig 9 this more realistic wind field represents how we can account for the fully variable wind conditions for each spatial grid cell within the domain since the wind fields in these simulations are a function of the stand scale drag and include minimal wind speeds close to the ground we can see that the dispersal regions are restricted closer to the tree locations within denser stands the attenuation of mean windspeed dominates the distribution of litter with occasional gusts distributing litter farther from originating voxels 4 discussion the duet model can produce a heterogeneous surface litter and grass layer through a mechanistic representation of leaf litter and herbaceous spatial distribution based on tree canopy structure simulations explore critical phenomena that lead to the surface fuel deposition and growth patterns and results agree with expected sensitivities to various canopy and wind parameters however there are processes that affect fuel distribution that are not yet included and continued efforts to validate the model are necessary 4 1 overstory structure and composition duet produces modeled tree litter accumulation that is directly affected by overstory structure including the height and species specific characteristics of the trees in agreement with observations nickmans et al 2019 staelens et al 2003 the model uses the height from which foliage is falling along with the average mass surface area and drag coefficient for the foliage leaves or needles to calculate the fall time for the foliage based on a terminal velocity approximation in conjunction with the average wind speeds associated with the time period in which the foliage falls this fall time helps to define the breadth of the dispersal pattern possible when falling needles or leaves reach the ground the orientation of the wind influenced fall path elongates the otherwise circular pattern into an elliptical region if the path is not straight down figs 4 and 5 in section 3 2 1 show effects of the height of the tree on the deposition region species foliage characteristics also influence the width of the deposition pattern we compare oak leaves which have a larger surface area and thus greater drag mass to pine needles this slows down the fall speed of oak leaves relative to pine needles increases the time aloft and allows for more lateral dispersion therefore the spread is generally broader for a given tree height see fig 6 since access to information on canopy structure is more readily available than understory structure having a model that bases the understory on the canopy may provide the necessary precision for improving fire and ecosystem model inputs silva et al 2016 4 2 wind influence wind events in the area directly affect when and how the litter falls from the tree staelens et al 2003 in duet we use average wind speeds and standard deviations for the area to define the shape and size of the dispersal region as wind is a main driver for mean horizontal movement of litter while it is falling we use average wind speed to determine horizontal displacement as well as the orientation and length of the ellipse in line with the horizontal trajectory the standard deviation of wind speed affects how wide or narrow the ellipse becomes perpendicular to the displacement vector we treat the influences of the wind standard deviations as having a diffusion type effect on the leaves or needles resulting in a conical distribution of leaves when they land while the majority of the leaves follow the mean path the net pattern of foliage deposition from any single canopy source is a maximum at the center of the deposition pattern and the loadings fall off to zero linearly at the perimeter while currently these wind trajectories are static inputs to the model we hope to connect to a database in which we can implement recorded wind information for various time periods throughout the year and potentially expand duet to include dynamic wind inputs figs 4 5 6 and 9 all show the effect wind conditions have on the elliptical regions and the heterogeneity of the result in low wind conditions the dispersal regions remain close to the tree boles while high wind conditions result in wider spread future iterations of the model should incorporate a wind intensity vector that accounts for higher rates of litter drop during high wind events 4 3 decay processes within duet decay processes affect how the bulk density moisture level and depth of litter changes over the years after deposition as well as the inhibition of grass growth with the layering effect created over years of litter accumulation the decay processes are affected both by species specific decay factors and depth of litter on top fig 7 shows three different decay factors and the resulting effect on the litter accumulation through the years after they fall when a smaller decay factor is applied the litter does not decay and reduce as much as a higher decay factor when coupled with the layering effect shown in fig 8 the decay factor has a high influence on the spatial heterogeneity of litter on the ground over years 4 4 model assumptions as with any mathematical model several assumptions were made within the design of duet first we assumed that leaves reach their terminal vertical velocity immediately during the descent whereas in reality the time required to reach terminal velocity is typically reached asymptotically and depends on the air resistance and weight of the object the latter assumption may be less critical for litter resulting from broad leaves than needles as drag forces lead needles to reach terminal velocity in a shorter time but a full consideration of velocity is needed in future work further the decay functions used in duet are appropriate for shorter timeframes and xeric sites of the southeastern u s but don t include nutrient cycling including carbon nitrogen detritivore effects as described in de smedt et al 2018 and climatic effects on litter decomposition rates as described in gavazov 2010 further expanding the decay function and adding live and dead fuel moisture information and grass senescence and decay to the model would improve model accuracy and expand the range of ecosystems to which the model can be applied duet does not currently include redistribution of litter by the wind or animal tracking once on the ground which is observed predominantly in hardwood litter wade and lunsford 1989 many shrub species or trees in shrub stature contribute to the understory characteristics of many surface fire regimes which are currently included as regular trees but can be added as an additional component to the model 4 5 the need for validation while the model produces heterogeneity that meets expected patterns for wind tree height and litter type there is a need for both verification and validation while verification of a model confirms that the model is correctly implemented validation ensures that the model represents the real system it was built to represent accurately in this study we have presented verification of the duet model by testing the model s representation of various idealized scenarios however validation must occur through spatially explicit field data which are just now becoming available at scales to test duet hawley et al 2018 as we have worked with various institutions to gather real world data for validation we have found that typical methods for collecting data on surface fuels tend to be limited to localized measurements and transect descriptions but lack explicit spatial distribution patterns or spatial correlation with canopy structure or arrangement we are currently designing a method for collecting data that may more explicitly describe the litter distribution which should be implemented over the next year we plan to use this newly developed data set to compare our model to previous models and test for improvement in accuracy for now we view duet as a series of hypotheses that brings together the basic influential processes involved in how the canopy affects litter buildup which will be evaluated against these high resolution observations in the future 5 conclusions duet provides complex realistic and adjustable representations of tree leaf litter and grass distributions that directly relate to canopy structure litter decay and wind dynamics potential applications of this model include developing realistic heterogeneous surface fuel representations for spatially explicit fire behavior models and ecological examinations of ecosystem dynamics dependent on variable representation of litter biomass midgley et al 2015 including nutrient cycling within senescence processes lin et al 2017 stoler and relyea 2011 and fine scale fire behavior hiers et al 2009 duet can also be used to examine finer scale litter and grass dynamics that can influence coarser scale fuel and fire dynamics in current stand and landscape level ecosystem models e g keane et al 2011 loudermilk et al 2011 scheller et al 2019 duet has the flexibility to be calibrated for any forest type through the tree species characteristics as well as environmental inputs and parameters by representing leaf fall within an ellipse the model allows for approximations within leaf traits such as surface area and mass and coarse dispersal functions using duet one could vary wind speeds and direction through time and characterize several possible surface fuel representations for simulating ecosystem or fire behavior within the area our results show how the drag coefficient wind dynamics and decay factors affect litter accumulation though space and time through species specific parameterization the model can be calibrated for specific species or generalized for a broad range of species e g conifer vs broadleaves similarly wind inputs can represent specific wind events or averaged values across a given area such mechanistic models are critical for representations of fine scale heterogeneity driven by canopies mitchell et al 2006 their influence on patterns of energy release from fires and resulting patterns of fire effects as well as ecosystem renewal applications credit authorship contribution

as described within section 2 2 to determine r g r o u n d we define the effective radius of the voxel of horizontal dimension d x d y to be the radius of the circle with equal area to the area of the

found by the cauchy momentum equation in lagrangian form this equation was developed to represent linear transport of a unit of material subjected to the forces acting on the unit as it travels

24144,forests as one of the most important carbon sinks on earth are more and more under stress by environmental changes the dynamics of forests and consequently their functions in general begin to change we therefore present a recent model development called forest factory 2 0 which generates various virtual forest stands for different biomes on earth this approach allows to generate forests using the architecture and processes of forest models here we use the individual based gap model formind using forest factory 2 0 we generated 700 000 forest stands in seven different ecoregions in contrast to the tradition of investigating the development of individual forest stands over time we used the forest factory 2 0 as a tool to gain knowledge about forests by analyzing the state space of forests we conducted a structural sensitivity analysis to compare the relationships between structural properties and biomass productivity as well as species evenness of forests in this study we analyze the state space of forests in different biomes and demonstrate the potential of this approach for theoretical ecology keywords forest model forest generator ecosystem functions productivity forest biomass forest factory data availability the method supporting this article has been uploaded to the r repository https git ufz de angermue forestfactory the supporting dataset has been updloaded here 10 5281 zenodo 7920227 1 introduction forests cover 25 of the global land surface gibson et al 2011 they play a major role for the global carbon cycle because of their function as carbon storage and their contributions to global carbon fluxes grace et al 2014 bonan 2008 forests are important for sustaining biodiversity and provide habitat for 70 of all animal species gibson et al 2011 myers et al 2000 pimm et al 2014 further forests exhibit a diversity of spatial structure and change their structure due to natural succession management or disturbances pan et al 2013 while forest ecosystems are exposed to environmental change like all complex adaptive systems they have a certain capacity to cope with it however if these change processes occur too frequently on too large spatial scales with too high intensity the adaptive capacity of the forests may be exceeded global change processes such as climate change and related effects such as drought heat waves fire storms or pest outbreaks ipcc 2013 but also deforestation ipcc 2013 and fragmentation taubert et al 2018 fischer 2021 fao 2022 are accelerating and occur simultaneously as a result the dynamics of the forests would change as well as their tree species composition and structure therefore forests appear to be under increasing pressure mcdowell et al 2020 affecting forest biodiversity in general as well as the diversity of functions provided by forests this shows the urgency of sustaining their functioning understanding and enhancing their adaptive capacity and appropriately adapting their management prerequisite for addressing these challenges however is a sound understanding of structure function relationships esp between the properties of forests species compositional and spatial structural and their functions e g carbon flux and storage to analyze forests ecosystems the perspectives of community ecology organismal aspects diversity of species and structure and ecosystem ecology matter and energy flux aspects biogeochemical cycles are not separable a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of ecosystems can only be gained if these two perspectives are adequately linked to one another loreau 2010 however though there are many empirical studies based on data on forest inventories the number of available samples and plots or the lack of focus in monitoring make it difficult to create a sufficiently complete picture lindenmayer and likens 2009 lindenmayer et al 2011 this challenge may be overcome by using remote sensing data but relating and condensing this large scaled data to the local or individual scale remains a challenge ma et al 2020 another challenge is to capture the inherent spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions and how they change in response to projected changing processes especially among different biomes thus there is a huge variety in the environmental factors which are supposed to influence forest properties species composition and structure and the shape of the structure function relationship the needed relevant variables are mostly not fully covered by the existing inventories and datasets forest models can help to bridge the gap between multiscale field data and processes enabling a multivariate view of forests nevertheless different types of models have different application fields for example global vegetation models have a focus on large spatial scales and time scales whereas individual based models focus on smaller scales as they consider processes at tree level and can thus also analyze structural dynamics maréchaux et al 2021 thus individual based models are particularly suitable for considering ecosystem dynamics as an emergent outcome from the interaction of processes at individual level this allows the identification of structural properties and functional characteristics of forests at different spatial scales as they emerge from the assumed environmental conditions this also opens up the opportunity for correlative analyses of the structure function relationship rödig et al 2018 thurner et al 2017 however the causal relationships underlying them are not yet satisfyingly understood we introduce a new way of sensitivity analysis the variation of parameter values or the comparison of different scenarios is a prominent way of sensitivity analysis to gain causal understanding of relationships we perform sensitivity analysis not by varying parameters but by analyzing millions of initial states to gain understanding of the relationship between forest functions and forest structure for different biomes performing this way of sensitivity analysis is not common so far and methods for this are rare examples for such a powerful application are the use of landscape generators in the context of impact assessments of land use scenarios langhammer et al 2019 engel et al 2012 and the use of weather generators in the frame of climate impact analyses friend 1998 kumagai et al 2004 for forests such a generator was developed by bohn and huth 2017 the so called forest factory approach in one of their studies they generated virtual forest stands that possibly could exist in central europe this multivariate dataset enabled a multidimensional investigation of the relationships between structural properties plant diversity and productivity bohn and huth 2017 bohn et al 2018 this promising approach has shown on the basis of simple mechanisms that over a broad range of forest stands several forest properties biodiversity and structure have to be considered to understand forest productivity the forest factory approach establishes a new way to analyze forests which does not require simulating forests over long periods of time instead the focus of the analysis is on the state space of the forests described by structure properties due to the regional limitations of the forest factory by bohn and huth focus on european forests it offers potential for further research to realize the potential and to analyze a causal relationship between their structural diversity and productivity relationships for different biomes a further development and extension of the forest factory approach is necessary in this study we present a novel software tool the forest factory 2 0 which creates millions of virtual forest stands covering various species compositions and structural properties for different biomes additionally we provide a data product generated with the software tool to demonstrate the potential of this approach for systematic mechanistic analyses of structure function relationships across biomes the data product contains in total 700 000 forest stands including 12 forest properties these forest stands consist of over 11 million individual trees with over 20 tree properties in this study we show examples of ecological analysis based on the generated forests first we compare the state space based on four structural properties of forests between seven regions derived for different biomes second we compare the relationships between the four structural properties of forests and i biomass as a proxy for the carbon stock ii aboveground wood production awp as a proxy for the carbon flux and iii species evenness as an example for a biodiversity index with the analysis we want to show the potential of the presented approach for a wide range of research questions 2 methodical concept with the forest factory 2 0 we have developed a software tool that makes it possible to create virtual natural forests that could exist in nature the forest factory 2 0 allows through its algorithm a fast and generic generation of forests in contrast to forest simulations the forest factory approach does not consider and simulate forests over a long period of time it generates various forests describing different states of succession as well as management and disturbed forest stands also for different species mixtures the forests can be generated for different regions of the world in this study we produced 700 000 forest stands in total for seven different ecoregions the background knowledge i e the information and processes for the generation of forests is provided by forest inventories and studies which are represented in the parameterizations of forest models here we use the forest model formind a large number of ecological properties can be calculated for each generated forest which allows a detailed analysis of the relationships between forest properties comparison of forest stands for different ecoregions is made possible by using the same algorithm for each forest stand generated 2 1 forest factory 2 0 for processes such as competition and productivity the forest factory 2 0 uses the individual and process based forest model formind this forest model allows the simulation of species rich forests and also considers the complex age structure of their tree community formind has been extensively tested and applied to tropical forests köhler and hutz 2004 gutiérrez and huth 2012 huth and ditzer 2001 kammesheidt et al 2001 köhler et al 2003 köhler and huth 2007 rüger et al 2008 fischer et al 2014 rödig et al 2019 temperate forests bohn et al 2014 bruening et al 2021 rüger et al 2007 and grasslands taubert et al 2012 it is an individual based model which means that the growth of every single tree is simulated the model considers four main process groups growth of single trees increment of tree biomass stem diameter and height mortality recruitment and competition e g for light and space formind is also used for large scale simulations paulick et al 2017 rödig et al 2018 e g forest wide carbon balances in the amazon the forest factory 2 0 is implemented as an independent module of formind in c language and uses processes of the forest model formind like competition for light and allometries the processes of the forest model can be modified independently of the forest factory 2 0 it is possible to combine the forest factory 2 0 with other forest models the methodology of the forest factory 2 0 follows the forest factory bohn and huth 2017 that generated forest stands for the temperate zone and was implemented in the language r in this paper we introduce a new version of the forest factory that includes important new components and extensions that make it applicable on a global scale we also provide an r package that facilitates the use of forest factory 2 0 fig 1 this package allows analysis of the data product that we publish or that users generate themselves the forest factory 2 0 can produce a large number of virtual forest stands 20 m x 20 m base area and funnel shape for each available parameterization which is representing an ecoregion every tree in the generated forest stand must have a positive productivity gross primary production respiration in formind a negative productivity causes the dying of trees to calculate the productivity we calculate the biomass increment of every placed tree over one year which results from the different ecoregion specific parameterizations e g climate to create forests for an ecoregion the forest factory needs information on climate conditions and a parameter set which consists of species specific parameters e g concerning the tree geometry productivity and species pool see section 2 3 for details which are representative for an ecoregion as an initial information which is valid for all generated forest stands the forest factory 2 0 assumes a minimum and maximum height of the trees h min and h max an overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x and an initial species pool the overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x is the maximum sum of crown volume of all trees valid for every forest stand the species pool is defined by the parameterization of each ecoregion and each species plant functional type is representing a species or group of species with similar functional and morphological characteristics this initial information is required to start the forest factory 2 0 fig 2 once started the forest factory 2 0 pre selects for each forest stand a minimum and maximum height of trees h min and h max from the initial h min and h max a maximum total crown volume ρ and a group of plant functional types the pre selection for h m i n h m a x and the maximum total crown volume ρ is done by random assuming uniform distributions the boundaries are h m i n h m a x and 0 ρ m a x the pre selection of h min and h max for every forest stands also allows the generation of even aged forests the pre selection of the species pool for each forest stand is done by random assuming a uniform distribution to select the number of species more details in appendix after the pre selection for the forest stand is done one tree after another is planted the explicit position of a tree in the forest stand is not important due to the spatially implicit approach of forest gap models where the position is randomly chosen at the end of the tree placement procedure a tree height for the tree to be planted is selected from a predefined height distribution x e x p 0 05 h x x h m i n h m a x the selected species pool is used to determine randomly the species type of a new tree each species has an equal probability for each tree these two attributes height and species type are selected and are used to calculate other attributes of the tree attributes are derived from processes and the parameter input of the used forest model here we use formind for different forest biomes for the tree placement it is checked if a each tree has a positive productivity b there is still space for the canopy of this tree in each height layer all tree crowns together must not exceed the boundaries of the forest stand and c the maximum total crown volume is not exceeded we allow a certain maximum density in three dimensional space the maximum total crown volume the selection rules for tree height and tree species is the same for each tree if b or c is violated the tree will not be considered the tree placement for this forest is terminated and the created forest stand is saved in a database if a is violated and the calculated productivity over one year is negative an attempt is made to replace the tree with a tree of a different species with the same height and out of the selected species pool for this forest stand if the tree has now a positive productivity it is placed if not the tree placement for this forest is terminated and the forest stand is saved every time a new tree is placed the annual productivity of all previous planted trees have to be recalculated e g due to the change of light availability if one or more trees have a negative productivity the algorithm try to replace them with tree s of another species and if this doesn t work the tree placement for the forest is terminated the generation of a new forest stand starts in this way the forest factory can be used to generate millions of forests for different ecoregions and climates by considering input parameterizations the forests describe different states of succession e g by differentiate h min and h max as well as managed e g even aged forests by the selection of h min and h max values with a small difference or disturbed forest stands e g by selecting a low overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x including different species mixtures the goal is to generate as many potential forest states as possible for specific analyses of e g even aged forests or late successional forests the virtual forests must be filtered according to the desired attributes for the derived forest stands a large number of properties and characteristics can be calculated by using the methods of the forest model e g for leaf area diameter increment lai per height layer size distribution biomass maintenance respiration gross primary production gpp net ecosystem carbon exchange nee since we simulate the productivity of each forest over only one year we here do not focus on temporal evolution but on states and benefit from the knowledge contained in widely applied and long established forest models here formind the forest factory 2 0 enables the possibility for a coupling with other forest models the coupling setup would run an iterative process the forest factory provides tree and forest stand information to the corresponding forest model the calculation of productivity and tree attributes e g due to allometry takes place in the forest model and is reported back to the forest factory 2 2 forest factory bohn and huth 2017 vs forest factory 2 0 in this section we will explain the main differences between the forest factory by bohn and huth 2017 and the forest factory 2 0 and show how we have significantly extended the approach one important advantage of forestfactory 2 0 compared to the forest factory by bohn and huth table 1 is a significant speed increase 3 million forest stands per hour 30 times faster which allows the creation of a huge number of forest stands further it is now possible to create forests for all regions of the world for which parameter sets are available here for the forest model formind as the forest factory 2 0 is a part of the formind model repository functional model improvements are automatically available for the forest factory this allows the forest factory 2 0 to use recently developed sub modules of the forest model for example lidar waveforms or light reflectance spectra can be calculated for the generated forest stands it is also possible to use the generated forests directly as input for simulations to analyze future development of these forests compared to the forest factory by bohn and huth in the forest factory 2 0 the input parameters were reduced there is only one function for tree height distribution to derive stem diameter as input in the old version there were 15 fixed stem diameter distributions this increases the flexibility and the possibilities for analysis with the new forest factory 2 0 we can investigate the state space of the forests more evenly i e different characteristics of the forest structure occur with sufficiently equal abundance appendix fig a1 we provide an open source r phyton package and a data product of forest stands to enable accessibility to a wide range of users the r package https git ufz de angermue forestfactory represents an interface which makes it possible to operate with the forest factory 2 0 from the r platform an overview of the forest dataset is given in appendix table a1 2 3 study sites the parameterizations representing ecoregions in table 2 represent the synthesis of information of many field measurements and inventories not only concerning the species specific allometric tree attributes but also concerning tree growth and productivity due to this we use for all ecoregions the same kind of information only with different values the parameterizations can therefore be interpreted as a kind of recipe with always the same ingredients in different quantities the cooking process the algorithm of the forest factory 2 works for all parameterizations according to the same principle the used parameterizations belong to different forest stands in different regions and we decided to use the names of the ecoregions in the paper to make clear where the investigated forests are located for the generation of temperate forests in germany we use a daily based climate data set of the hainich national park thuringia germany for the year 2007 for the other regions we used reduced climate information which is described in the appendix section 3 2 4 simulations analysis in this study we present results for forest stands in seven different ecoregions see table 2 the ecoregions consist of two temperate regions one in north america one in europe and five tropical regions two in south america one in central america one in africa one in asia for each region we generated 100 000 forest stands with the forest factory 2 0 initial parameters h m i n 5 m h m a x 65 m and the overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x 0 78 each region provides an initial species pool we analyzed all forest stands for structural attributes basal area lai height heterogeneity maximum height and functional characteristics above ground wood productivity awp aboveground biomass and species evenness as an indicator for biodiversity species evenness is calculated by the shannon equitability index heip 1974 peet 1975 the shannon index shannon 1948 is normalized by the logarithm of the maximum number of species we treat pfts as species here in a first step we explored under which structural conditions forests can exist in different ecoregions for this we use a state space approach this space is determined here by four structural variables maximum height basal area height heterogeneity and lai in chapter 3 1 we investigated this state space of forests mentioned above by using diagrams fig 3 similar to the classical diagrams of whittaker in which he analyzed the relation between climate average annual temperature and precipitation and vegetation types whittaker 1970 instead of climatic attributes we investigate here four structural properties two in each figure we analyzed maximum height of trees this corresponds to the forest height and basal area which are typical properties to describe the structure of forests additionally we investigated the role of tree height variability here by using the standard deviation of the tree heights which we define as height heterogeneity and leaf area index each generated forest stand can be represented as a point in the state space by a combination of these structural properties we generated 700 000 forest stands each representing a possible state resulting in 700 000 points in the state space 100 000 for each ecoregion to analyze the state space of the generated forest stands with positive productivity section 3 1 we examined the area which is covered by 100 000 forest stands of the same ecoregion by calculating the envelope around the points each point represents one forest stand these envelopes are calculated with the r package concaveman which uses convex hulls with concavity for details please see appendix section 4 to investigate the relationship between different forest properties and characteristics section 3 2 we derived heatmaps fig 4 5 where the x and y axis describe structural properties and the color describe functional characteristics biomass carbon stock awp carbon flow and evenness biodiversity the maps are rastered so one cell contains information of several forest stands with the same structural properties the shown value for a cell represents the mean value over these forest stands we also derived maximum value and standard deviation for these analyses shown in the appendix to allow direct comparison of forests between the seven ecoregions we examined forests by their functions biomass awp evenness that are similar in all four structural properties fig 6 for these similar structured forests we calculated the mean value of their functional characteristics and compared them in a 1 1 graph for three different regions additionally the regression line and the adjusted r² were calculated for all analysis we considered only forest stands with a basal area under 100 in the appendix the analysis of the maximum values and the standard deviation of the biomass awp and species evenness have been added see appendix figs a7 a11 3 results 3 1 analysis of forest structure in different ecoregions in the first step we are looking at the structural characteristics of forest stands for the different ecoregions created by the forest factory 2 0 fig 3 by calculating the basal area maximum height height heterogeneity and lai for each forest stand the analysis in fig 3 shows which combinations of maximum height basal area and height heterogeneity lai lead to forests with positive productivity forests with properties outside the envelope line don t have positive productivity we observe mostly similarly shaped envelopes with different sizes for the different ecoregions represented by the different colors the analysis shows typical limitations of forest stands forest stands with a high basal area and low or moderate maximum height empty area at the right bottom in fig 3a do not occur large trees have large crowns this tree allometries in combination with limited space restrict the abundance of these trees and also influences the resulting basal area empty area at top left the physiological and species specific allometric interactions result in a typical shape in the state space that curves to the right our forest stands can also be analyzed in a different state space consisting of the lai and the height heterogeneity in most ecoregions the largest values for tree height heterogeneity occur for forest stands with low lai values while the highest lai values occur in forests with low to moderate tree height heterogeneity fig 3b as expected the brazilian amazon has a large diversity of forest stands and the shape of the envelope is quite different compared to other regions e g without a peak at the top left high height heterogeneity low lai the smallest area within the envelopes in both figures 3a 3b is found for mountain forests of ecuador low maximum tree height we also investigated the frequency distributions of the forest properties of the forests within the illustrated areas appendix fig a1 3 2 relationship between forest structure and ecosystem functions in different ecoregions the forest factory 2 0 allows us also to analyze how structural properties maximum height and basal area affect functional characteristics biomass above ground wood productivity awp and evenness in the species composition normalized shannon index as proxy for biodiversity the biomass related plots fig 4 a b c reveal a structure function relationship that is quite similar for all investigated regions biomass is largely determined by the basal area and maximum height the analysis of the german forest stands fig 4 a shows some interesting details for forests with high biomass and high basal area top right area forests with a lower maximum height 40 m 45 m have on average a higher biomass than forests with a larger maximum height 45 m with the forest factory it is possible to analyze each individual tree of the corresponding forest stands in this area the result is that all of these forest stands consist of trees of the species picea abies this is the tree species with the largest maximum height in the analysis for this region but it has a low wood density which leads to a lower forest biomass in all three regions we observe that awp increases with the basal area and decreases with maximum height while shape and strength of the combined effects are region specific also the range of awp values differs due to climate variations between the temperate germany fig 4d and the tropic regions fig 4 e f which leads to lower awp values for the german forest stands nevertheless we observe that for germany fig 4a and the amazon fig 4b forest stands with high awp have a high maximum height and basal area in all three ecoregions there occur also forest stands with high awp values that have only moderate basal area and height concerning the evenness of species forest stands fig 4 g h i show a similar structure function relationship for the amazon fig 4h and tanzania fig 4i species evenness is increasing with basal area but decreasing with maximum height for the temperate forests in germany fig 4g the situation is more intricate forest stands between low and medium maximum height 0 m 35 m and with medium basal area have high evenness values in a second step we analyzed how two other structural properties here height heterogeneity and lai affect the functional characteristics of forest stands for the three investigated ecoregions fig 5 in all cases forest stands with large biomass values fig 5 a b c can only be found if the lai is high additionally in the amazon and tanzania these forest stands also need height heterogeneity values above 8 m we also analyzed forest productivity fig 5 d e f forest stands with high awp values have one pattern in common high productivity goes along with low height heterogeneity and medium lai in the amazon and tanzania 4 7 t o d m y r 1 h a 1 and high lai in germany 5 13 t o d m y r 1 h a 1 lower awp values of forest stands in germany can be explained by the shorter vegetation period in contrast to the other ecoregions for the forests in the amazon we also observe highly productive forests with large lai 10 and high height heterogeneity 10 m analogous to the biomass for germany it is remarkable that we observe only a few forest stands with medium height heterogeneity 6 m 10 m and medium lai 2 10 forest stands with these properties have low awp values these forests are next to an area in the state space without forest stands white area possibly due to the negative productivity of trees for species evenness fig 5 g h i we got no clear trends like in the first and second row above a certain lai 3 we find tanzanian forests with high species evenness 0 5 1 the highest evenness values 0 7 can be found at the outer edge of the envelope the analysis of biomass awp and species evenness in german forests fig 5 a d g shows that forests with height heterogeneity smaller than 3 m and lai larger than 6 have on average a lower evenness besides all these forests have a high biomass and a high productivity results for the standard deviation and maximal biomass values productivity and species evenness can be found in the appendix in fig 5 we analyzed mean values for details see methods and appendix figs a8 a10 3 3 comparison of structure function relationships for different ecoregions in the previous sections we examined structure function relationships for different ecoregions here we directly compare the structure function relationships for three ecoregions amazonian german and tanzanian forests to explore how generally the derived relationships apply for comparisons for all ecoregions see appendix figs a11 a13 specifically we compare mean biomasses blue points in fig 6 a b c mean awps red points in fig 6 d e f and mean species evennesses green points in fig 6 g h i of forest stands that have similar states according to the four structural properties used in the figures above but are from different regions we show them in 1 1 graphs we consider forest states as similar if they have similar maximal height height heterogeneity lai and basal area details in section 2 4 we observe a strong correlation for the biomass high r² value the biomass of forest stands with similar properties are not identical not on the 1 1 line for the awp fig 6 d e f we see a good correlation the four structural dimensions are sufficient to find relations between awp for different regions but less effective than between the biomass we see no correlation in the evenness relationships for the different regions fig 6 g h i that indicates that we may need more information in addition to structural properties to get a better correlation 4 discussion in this paper we explored the forest factory 2 0 a new open source software tool to simulate and analyze forests from different biomes on earth we demonstrated several benefits of the approach and provide insights into how this method can increase our knowledge on structure function relationships of forests and overall forest functioning breaking with the tradition of investigating the development of individual forest stands over time we used the forest factory 2 0 as a tool to gain knowledge about forests by analyzing the state space of forests resulting from species pool and environmental factors the simple algorithm of the forest factory allows comparison of a large number of forest stands from different biomes 3 million forest stands per hour generated with the same process driven architecture this also provides a causal understanding of forest structure function relationships as we showed in section 3 in this manuscript we present a method to investigate the relationship between structure maximum height basal area lai height heterogeneity and productivity biomass and awp or biodiversity species evenness of forests with the forest factory 2 0 it is also possible to analyze other forest properties such as diameter increment or net ecosystem exchange additionally it enables us to explore the role of other more complex structural characteristics like stem size distribution or height layer specific information with this systematic approach we could investigate the causes of the differences and similarities of forest stands e g why forests with similar structure show different or similar biomass or productivity values this could allow us to calculate transfer functions for structure function relationships of forests from one ecoregion to another outlined in section 3 3 here we generated forest datasets for seven forest regions to illustrate the approach it is also possible to use other parameterizations from other forest models to generate forests for additional regions with this approach it is not only possible to create forests that already exist but also could occur using the forest factory 2 0 to create forest states beyond the currently existing ones provides a fuller understanding of forests beyond the constraints of empirical data such as national forest inventories or remote sensing data some of these forest states may be due to current changes in disturbance regimes or management and for some forest states it may not even be clear which successional or disturbance pathways will lead to them in addition to the promising research area of realistic forest selection it is also interesting to study forests that have almost no or even negative productivity this analysis can be used to identify stressed forest stands in forest inventories or generally describe and understand the state space of stressed forests this might help to detect potential regime shifts and to explore adaptive capacities of forests and forest ecosystems as seen in fig 3d there are forests with medium height heterogeneity and lai that have low productivity these forests are next to an area in the state space without forest stands white area white areas may indicate that forest stands in this area of the state space have negative productivity such forests are not generated by the algorithm due to the productivity condition further analysis could reveal if this white area represents a transition from forests with low positive to forests with negative productivity this area in the state space could give information on the limits of coping capacity of forest stands if this were the case these forests could change from being a carbon sink to being a carbon source in this study we presented how the forest factory 2 0 can be used to study region specific patterns and the ecological mechanisms behind them every forest stand consists of many individual trees that are modeled by the selected forest model here formind for each single tree additional information is available data product of the forest factory 2 0 this allows the analysis of specific forest attributes by analyzing the productivity or other properties of each tree in the forest hence yielding a deeper understanding of forest dynamics the forest factory 2 0 also offers the possibility for jointly addressing research questions from community ecology organismal aspects diversity of species and structure to ecosystem ecology matter and energy flux aspects biogeochemical cycles loreau 2010 for making forest factory 2 0 easier to use for different user groups it might be useful to generate forests with only certain tree species for user groups that want to generate lidar data with forest factory 2 0 at the moment forests with certain tree species can of course be sorted out of the data product or generated by changing the parameterization possible tree species should be selected during the initialization of forest factory 2 0 perhaps users only want to study multilayer forests so it would be interesting to allow other height distributions that make these forests more likely e g bimodal height distributions even if they already exist in the data product another direction would be to allow different spatial resolutions for forest factory 2 0 if users want to create larger contiguous forests without filtering and rearranging the ones already generated an additional extension could be to allow different mechanisms for tree placement it would be possible to remove trees in the virtual forest stands to mimic interventions also we could implement mechanisms which guarantee a denser packing of forest stands and may widen the envelopes in fig 3 nevertheless the presented envelopes show that we can already cover a broad range of different forest structures with the current approach furthermore the coupling of the forest factory with other modules of formind allows us to explore additional properties and characteristics of the generated forest for example to derive typical remote sensing data and indexes based on radiative transfer models for instance bruenning et al 2021 use the forest factory 2 0 to explore the relationship between lidar profiles and aboveground biomass it is also possible to combine radiative transfer models with the forest factory 2 0 to generate reflection spectra for a huge number of forest stands henniger et al 2023 virtual forests are also used in studies by the remote sensing community frazer et al 2005 frazer et al 2011 widlowski et al 2015 in addition to the typical remote sensing forest variables point clouds lidar profiles the generated forests allow the calculation of additional properties basal area lai awp net ecosystem exchange also at the tree level thus the presented approach can help to downscale the satellite imagery based data and to translate the remote sensing measurements available for large areas to the level of individual trees it is also possible to combine the forest factory 2 0 approach with other forest models the new approach of looking at forests in terms of states rather than simulations over time along with forest factory 2 0 s free coupling possibility offers a promising path to compare forest models and learn more about their capabilities and limitations specifically it opens up the possibility of using different forest models to generate different databases of forest stands as shown in this study with formind and then analyzing these comparatively using the methods presented in addition to the possibility of combining the forest factory 2 0 with other forest models the forest factory 2 0 is also an additional test for parameterizations we can analyze forests that cannot be created by the forest succession for which the parameterization was made these forests may be possible under different environmental conditions like climate change or due to disturbances e g fallen trees another possible application is the use of generated forest stands to initialize models simulating forest development for different forest models over a longer period of time with this application it is possible e g to analyze the further behavior of these forests under climate change or management scenarios natural extinction processes or implementation of new species again the advantage is that we can simulate forests with states beyond those that currently exist and gain information that we cannot obtain from inventory or remote sensing observations with forest models we can analyze the development of these forest stands which allows new ways of analysis for example we can explore forest states that are more resilient to climate change and should be pursued in forest management the presented way of analyzing forests in a digital universe of processes and mechanisms also offers new possibilities for data scientists the freely available datasets of generated forest stands can be used to train artificial intelligence models ai that estimates additional forest tree attributes from just a few attributes of forest stands the resulting relationships could be used to gain a deeper understanding at the level of individual trees from large scale remote sensing observations in addition all relationships shown in the graphs and the data product could be condensed into equations with symbolic regression ais with the forest factory 2 0 researchers can generate virtual forests for their needs or use the open source forest data to analyze a digital forest universe of forest states funding the research

permission to conduct research there appendix additional information for method section pre defined forest stand attributes for each forest stand we select a minimum and maximum tree height h m i n a n d h m a x a a species pool b and a total crown volume of trees c the forest factory 2 0 receives as an initial input a minimum and maximum height of the trees h m i n a n d h m a x this applies to all trees in all forest stands from the range of h m i n a n d h m a x a forest stand specific h m i n a n d h m a x a is chosen randomly for each forest stand we assume an equally distributed probability distribution in the mentioned range the parameterization of each ecoregion defines the total species pool for forest factory 2 0 for each forest stand a forest stand specific species pool b is chosen for this purpose a number between 1 and the number of species in the total species pool is chosen uniformly distributed it determines how many species the forest stand specific species pool should contain each species has an equal probability of being included in the forest stand specific species pool until the next to last species selected number of species 1 is selected to ensure that it is possible to plant trees within the selected height range between h m i n and h m a x which is different for each forest stand we check whether at least one of the species selected so far has a maximum attainable height greater than or equal to h m a x if this is not the case the last species is selected so that a tree with h m a x could be placed forest factory 2 0 receives as input also a maximum total crown volume this total crown volume can be seen as a kind of crown density proportion of crown volume to forest stand volume none of the generated forest stands have a total crown volume above this input value for each forest stand between 0 and the maximum total crown volume a forest stand specific maximum total crown volume c is randomly chosen assuming an equal

24144,forests as one of the most important carbon sinks on earth are more and more under stress by environmental changes the dynamics of forests and consequently their functions in general begin to change we therefore present a recent model development called forest factory 2 0 which generates various virtual forest stands for different biomes on earth this approach allows to generate forests using the architecture and processes of forest models here we use the individual based gap model formind using forest factory 2 0 we generated 700 000 forest stands in seven different ecoregions in contrast to the tradition of investigating the development of individual forest stands over time we used the forest factory 2 0 as a tool to gain knowledge about forests by analyzing the state space of forests we conducted a structural sensitivity analysis to compare the relationships between structural properties and biomass productivity as well as species evenness of forests in this study we analyze the state space of forests in different biomes and demonstrate the potential of this approach for theoretical ecology keywords forest model forest generator ecosystem functions productivity

updloaded here 10 5281 zenodo 7920227 1 introduction forests cover 25 of the global land surface gibson et al 2011 they play a major role for the global carbon cycle because of their function as carbon storage and their contributions to global carbon fluxes grace et al 2014 bonan 2008 forests are important for sustaining biodiversity and provide habitat for 70 of all animal species gibson et al 2011 myers et al 2000 pimm et al 2014 further forests exhibit a diversity of spatial structure and change their structure due to natural succession management or disturbances pan et al 2013 while forest ecosystems are exposed to environmental change like all complex adaptive systems they have a certain capacity to cope with it however if these change processes occur too frequently on too large spatial scales with too high intensity the adaptive capacity of the forests may be exceeded global change processes such as climate change and related effects such as drought heat waves fire storms or pest outbreaks ipcc 2013 but also deforestation ipcc 2013 and fragmentation taubert et al 2018 fischer 2021 fao 2022 are accelerating and occur simultaneously as a result the dynamics of the forests would change as well as their tree species composition and structure therefore forests appear to be under increasing pressure mcdowell et al 2020 affecting forest biodiversity in general as well as the diversity of functions provided by forests this shows the urgency of sustaining their functioning understanding and enhancing their adaptive capacity and appropriately adapting their management prerequisite for addressing these challenges however is a sound understanding of structure function relationships esp between the properties of forests species compositional and spatial structural and their functions e g carbon flux and storage to analyze forests ecosystems the perspectives of community ecology organismal aspects diversity of species and structure and ecosystem ecology matter and energy flux aspects biogeochemical cycles are not separable a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of ecosystems can only be gained if these two perspectives are adequately linked to one another loreau 2010 however though there are many empirical studies based on data on forest inventories the number of available samples and plots or the lack of focus in monitoring make it difficult to create a sufficiently complete picture lindenmayer and likens 2009 lindenmayer et al 2011 this challenge may be overcome by using remote sensing data but relating and condensing this large scaled data to the local or individual scale remains a challenge ma et al 2020 another challenge is to capture the inherent spatial heterogeneity of environmental conditions and how they change in response to projected changing processes especially among different biomes thus there is a huge variety in the environmental factors which are supposed to influence forest properties species composition and structure and the shape of the structure function relationship the needed relevant variables are mostly not fully covered by the existing inventories and datasets forest models can help to bridge the gap between multiscale field data and processes enabling a multivariate view of forests nevertheless different types of models have different application fields for example global vegetation models have a focus on large spatial scales and time scales whereas individual based models focus on smaller scales as they consider processes at tree level and can thus also analyze structural dynamics maréchaux et al 2021 thus individual based models are particularly suitable for considering ecosystem dynamics as an emergent outcome from the interaction of processes at individual level this allows the identification of structural properties and functional characteristics of forests at different spatial scales as they emerge from the assumed environmental conditions this also opens up the opportunity for correlative analyses of the structure function relationship rödig et al 2018 thurner et al 2017 however the causal relationships underlying them are not yet satisfyingly understood we introduce a new way of sensitivity analysis the variation of parameter values or the comparison of different scenarios is a prominent way of sensitivity analysis to gain causal understanding of relationships we perform sensitivity analysis not by varying parameters but by analyzing millions of initial states to gain understanding of the relationship between forest functions and forest structure for different biomes performing this way of sensitivity analysis is not common so far and methods for this are rare examples for such a powerful application are the use of landscape generators in the context of impact assessments of land use scenarios langhammer et al 2019 engel et al 2012 and the use of weather generators in the frame of climate impact analyses friend 1998 kumagai et al 2004 for forests such a generator was developed by bohn and huth 2017 the so called forest factory approach in one of their studies they generated virtual forest stands that possibly could exist in central europe this multivariate dataset enabled a multidimensional investigation of the relationships between structural properties plant diversity and productivity bohn and huth 2017 bohn et al 2018 this promising approach has shown on the basis of simple mechanisms that over a broad range of forest stands several forest properties biodiversity and structure have to be considered to understand forest productivity the forest factory approach establishes a new way to analyze forests which does not require simulating forests over long periods of time instead the focus of the analysis is on the state space of the forests described by structure properties due to the regional limitations of the forest factory by bohn and huth focus on european forests it offers potential for further research to realize the potential and to analyze a causal relationship between their structural diversity and productivity relationships for different biomes a further development and extension of the forest factory approach is necessary in this study we present a novel software tool the forest factory 2 0 which creates millions of virtual forest stands covering various species compositions and structural properties for different biomes additionally we provide a data product generated with the software tool to demonstrate the potential of this approach for systematic mechanistic analyses of structure function relationships across biomes the data product contains in total 700 000 forest stands including 12 forest properties these forest stands consist of over 11 million individual trees with over 20 tree properties in this study we show examples of ecological analysis based on the generated forests first we compare the state space based on four structural properties of forests between seven regions derived for different biomes second we compare the relationships between the four structural properties of forests and i biomass as a proxy for the carbon stock ii aboveground wood production awp as a proxy for the carbon flux and iii species evenness as an example for a biodiversity index with the analysis we want to show the potential of the presented approach for a wide range of research questions 2 methodical concept with the forest factory 2 0 we have developed a software tool that makes it possible to create virtual natural forests that could exist in nature the forest factory 2 0 allows through its algorithm a fast and generic generation of forests in contrast to forest simulations the forest factory approach does not consider and simulate forests over a long period of time it generates various forests describing different states of succession as well as management and disturbed forest stands also for different species mixtures the forests can be generated for different regions of the world in this study we produced 700 000 forest stands in total for seven different ecoregions the background knowledge i e the information and processes for the generation of forests is provided by forest inventories and studies which are represented in the parameterizations of forest models here we use the forest model formind a large number of ecological properties can be calculated for each generated forest which allows a detailed analysis of the relationships between forest properties comparison of forest stands for different ecoregions is made possible by using the same algorithm for each forest stand generated 2 1 forest factory 2 0 for processes such as competition and productivity the forest factory 2 0 uses the individual and process based forest model formind this forest model allows the simulation of species rich forests and also considers the complex age structure of their tree community formind has been extensively tested and applied to tropical forests köhler and hutz 2004 gutiérrez and huth 2012 huth and ditzer 2001 kammesheidt et al 2001 köhler et al 2003 köhler and huth 2007 rüger et al 2008 fischer et al 2014 rödig et al 2019 temperate forests bohn et al 2014 bruening et al 2021 rüger et al 2007 and grasslands taubert et al 2012 it is an individual based model which means that the growth of every single tree is simulated the model considers four main process groups growth of single trees increment of tree biomass stem diameter and height mortality recruitment and competition e g for light and space formind is also used for large scale simulations paulick et al 2017 rödig et al 2018 e g forest wide carbon balances in the amazon the forest factory 2 0 is implemented as an independent module of formind in c language and uses processes of the forest model formind like competition for light and allometries the processes of the forest model can be modified independently of the forest factory 2 0 it is possible to combine the forest factory 2 0 with other forest models the methodology of the forest factory 2 0 follows the forest factory bohn and huth 2017 that generated forest stands for the temperate zone and was implemented in the language r in this paper we introduce a new version of the forest factory that includes important new components and extensions that make it applicable on a global scale we also provide an r package that facilitates the use of forest factory 2 0 fig 1 this package allows analysis of the data product that we publish or that users generate themselves the forest factory 2 0 can produce a large number of virtual forest stands 20 m x 20 m base area and funnel shape for each available parameterization which is representing an ecoregion every tree in the generated forest stand must have a positive productivity gross primary production respiration in formind a negative productivity causes the dying of trees to calculate the productivity we calculate the biomass increment of every placed tree over one year which results from the different ecoregion specific parameterizations e g climate to create forests for an ecoregion the forest factory needs information on climate conditions and a parameter set which consists of species specific parameters e g concerning the tree geometry productivity and species pool see section 2 3 for details which are representative for an ecoregion as an initial information which is valid for all generated forest stands the forest factory 2 0 assumes a minimum and maximum height of the trees h min and h max an overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x and an initial species pool the overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x is the maximum sum of crown volume of all trees valid for every forest stand the species pool is defined by the parameterization of each ecoregion and each species plant functional type is representing a species or group of species with similar functional and morphological characteristics this initial information is required to start the forest factory 2 0 fig 2 once started the forest factory 2 0 pre selects for each forest stand a minimum and maximum height of trees h min and h max from the initial h min and h max a maximum total crown volume ρ and a group of plant functional types the pre selection for h m i n h m a x and the maximum total crown volume ρ is done by random assuming uniform distributions the boundaries are h m i n h m a x and 0 ρ m a x the pre selection of h min and h max for every forest stands also allows the generation of even aged forests the pre selection of the species pool for each forest stand is done by random assuming a uniform distribution to select the number of species more details in appendix after the pre selection for the forest stand is done one tree after another is planted the explicit position of a tree in the forest stand is not important due to the spatially implicit approach of forest gap models where the position is randomly chosen at the end of the tree placement procedure a tree height for the tree to be planted is selected from a predefined height distribution x e x p 0 05 h x x h m i n h m a x the selected species pool is used to determine randomly the species type of a new tree each species has an equal probability for each tree these two attributes height and species type are selected and are used to calculate other attributes of the tree attributes are derived from processes and the parameter input of the used forest model here we use formind for different forest biomes for the tree placement it is checked if a each tree has a positive productivity b there is still space for the canopy of this tree in each height layer all tree crowns together must not exceed the boundaries of the forest stand and c the maximum total crown volume is not exceeded we allow a certain maximum density in three dimensional space the maximum total crown volume the selection rules for tree height and tree species is the same for each tree if b or c is violated the tree will not be considered the tree placement for this forest is terminated and the created forest stand is saved in a database if a is violated and the calculated productivity over one year is negative an attempt is made to replace the tree with a tree of a different species with the same height and out of the selected species pool for this forest stand if the tree has now a positive productivity it is placed if not the tree placement for this forest is terminated and the forest stand is saved every time a new tree is placed the annual productivity of all previous planted trees have to be recalculated e g due to the change of light availability if one or more trees have a negative productivity the algorithm try to replace them with tree s of another species and if this doesn t work the tree placement for the forest is terminated the generation of a new forest stand starts in this way the forest factory can be used to generate millions of forests for different ecoregions and climates by considering input parameterizations the forests describe different states of succession e g by differentiate h min and h max as well as managed e g even aged forests by the selection of h min and h max values with a small difference or disturbed forest stands e g by selecting a low overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x including different species mixtures the goal is to generate as many potential forest states as possible for specific analyses of e g even aged forests or late successional forests the virtual forests must be filtered according to the desired attributes for the derived forest stands a large number of properties and characteristics can be calculated by using the methods of the forest model e g for leaf area diameter increment lai per height layer size distribution biomass maintenance respiration gross primary production gpp net ecosystem carbon exchange nee since we simulate the productivity of each forest over only one year we here do not focus on temporal evolution but on states and benefit from the knowledge contained in widely applied and long established forest models here formind the forest factory 2 0 enables the possibility for a coupling with other forest models the coupling setup would run an iterative process the forest factory provides tree and forest stand information to the corresponding forest model the calculation of productivity and tree attributes e g due to allometry takes place in the forest model and is reported back to the forest factory 2 2 forest factory bohn and huth 2017 vs forest factory 2 0 in this section we will explain the main differences between the forest factory by bohn and huth 2017 and the forest factory 2 0 and show how we have significantly extended the approach one important advantage of forestfactory 2 0 compared to the forest factory by bohn and huth table 1 is a significant speed increase 3 million forest stands per hour 30 times faster which allows the creation of a huge number of forest stands further it is now possible to create forests for all regions of the world for which parameter sets are available here for the forest model formind as the forest factory 2 0 is a part of the formind model repository functional model improvements are automatically available for the forest factory this allows the forest factory 2 0 to use recently developed sub modules of the forest model for example lidar waveforms or light reflectance spectra can be calculated for the generated forest stands it is also possible to use the generated forests directly as input for simulations to analyze future development of these forests compared to the forest factory by bohn and huth in the forest factory 2 0 the input parameters were reduced there is only one function for tree height distribution to derive stem diameter as input in the old version there were 15 fixed stem diameter distributions this increases the flexibility and the possibilities for analysis with the new forest factory 2 0 we can investigate the state space of the forests more evenly i e different characteristics of the forest structure occur with sufficiently equal abundance appendix fig a1 we provide an open source r phyton package and a data product of forest stands to enable accessibility to a wide range of users the r package https git ufz de angermue forestfactory represents an interface which makes it possible to operate with the forest factory 2 0 from the r platform an overview of the forest dataset is given in appendix table a1 2 3 study sites the parameterizations representing ecoregions in table 2 represent the synthesis of information of many field measurements and inventories not only concerning the species specific allometric tree attributes but also concerning tree growth and productivity due to this we use for all ecoregions the same kind of information only with different values the parameterizations can therefore be interpreted as a kind of recipe with always the same ingredients in different quantities the cooking process the algorithm of the forest factory 2 works for all parameterizations according to the same principle the used parameterizations belong to different forest stands in different regions and we decided to use the names of the ecoregions in the paper to make clear where the investigated forests are located for the generation of temperate forests in germany we use a daily based climate data set of the hainich national park thuringia germany for the year 2007 for the other regions we used reduced climate information which is described in the appendix section 3 2 4 simulations analysis in this study we present results for forest stands in seven different ecoregions see table 2 the ecoregions consist of two temperate regions one in north america one in europe and five tropical regions two in south america one in central america one in africa one in asia for each region we generated 100 000 forest stands with the forest factory 2 0 initial parameters h m i n 5 m h m a x 65 m and the overall maximum total crown volume ρ m a x 0 78 each region provides an initial species pool we analyzed all forest stands for structural attributes basal area lai height heterogeneity maximum height and functional characteristics above ground wood productivity awp aboveground biomass and species evenness as an indicator for biodiversity species evenness is calculated by the shannon equitability index heip 1974 peet 1975 the shannon index shannon 1948 is normalized by the logarithm of the maximum number of species we treat pfts as species here in a first step we explored under which structural conditions forests can exist in different ecoregions for this we use a state space approach this space is determined here by four structural variables maximum height basal area height heterogeneity and lai in chapter 3 1 we investigated this state space of forests mentioned above by using diagrams fig 3 similar to the classical diagrams of whittaker in which he analyzed the relation between climate average annual temperature and precipitation and vegetation types whittaker 1970 instead of climatic attributes we investigate here four structural properties two in each figure we analyzed maximum height of trees this corresponds to the forest height and basal area which are typical properties to describe the structure of forests additionally we investigated the role of tree height variability here by using the standard deviation of the tree heights which we define as height heterogeneity and leaf area index each generated forest stand can be represented as a point in the state space by a combination of these structural properties we generated 700 000 forest stands each representing a possible state resulting in 700 000 points in the state space 100 000 for each ecoregion to analyze the state space of the generated forest stands with positive productivity section 3 1 we examined the area which is covered by 100 000 forest stands of the same ecoregion by calculating the envelope around the points each point represents one forest stand these envelopes are calculated with the r package concaveman which uses convex hulls with concavity for details please see appendix section 4 to investigate the relationship between different forest properties and characteristics section 3 2 we derived heatmaps fig 4 5 where the x and y axis describe structural properties and the color describe functional characteristics biomass carbon stock awp carbon flow and evenness biodiversity the maps are rastered so one cell contains information of several forest stands with the same structural properties the shown value for a cell represents the mean value over these forest stands we also derived maximum value and standard deviation for these analyses shown in the appendix to allow direct comparison of forests between the seven ecoregions we examined forests by their functions biomass awp evenness that are similar in all four structural properties fig 6 for these similar structured forests we calculated the mean value of their functional characteristics and compared them in a 1 1 graph for three different regions additionally the regression line and the adjusted r² were calculated for all analysis we considered only forest stands with a basal area under 100 in the appendix the analysis of the maximum values and the standard deviation of the biomass awp and species evenness have been added see appendix figs a7 a11 3 results 3 1 analysis of forest structure in different ecoregions in the first step we are looking at the structural characteristics of forest stands for the different ecoregions created by the forest factory 2 0 fig 3 by calculating the basal area maximum height height heterogeneity and lai for each forest stand the analysis in fig 3 shows which combinations of maximum height basal area and height heterogeneity lai lead to forests with positive productivity forests with properties outside the envelope line don t have positive productivity we observe mostly similarly shaped envelopes with different sizes for the different ecoregions represented by the different colors the analysis shows typical limitations of forest stands forest stands with a high basal area and low or moderate maximum height empty area at the right bottom in fig 3a do not occur large trees have large crowns this tree allometries in combination with limited space restrict the abundance of these trees and also influences the resulting basal area empty area at top left the physiological and species specific allometric interactions result in a typical shape in the state space that curves to the right our forest stands can also be analyzed in a different state space consisting of the lai and the height heterogeneity in most ecoregions the largest values for tree height heterogeneity occur for forest stands with low lai values while the highest lai values occur in forests with low to moderate tree height heterogeneity fig 3b as expected the brazilian amazon has a large diversity of forest stands and the shape of the envelope is quite different compared to other regions e g without a peak at the top left high height heterogeneity low lai the smallest area within the envelopes in both figures 3a 3b is found for mountain forests of ecuador low maximum tree height we also investigated the frequency distributions of the forest properties of the forests within the illustrated areas appendix fig a1 3 2 relationship between forest structure and ecosystem functions in different ecoregions the forest factory 2 0 allows us also to analyze how structural properties maximum height and basal area affect functional characteristics biomass above ground wood productivity awp and evenness in the species composition normalized shannon index as proxy for biodiversity the biomass related plots fig 4 a b c reveal a structure function relationship that is quite similar for all investigated regions biomass is largely determined by the basal area and maximum height the analysis of the german forest stands fig 4 a shows some interesting details for forests with high biomass and high basal area top right area forests with a lower maximum height 40 m 45 m have on average a higher biomass than forests with a larger maximum height 45 m with the forest factory it is possible to analyze each individual tree of the corresponding forest stands in this area the result is that all of these forest stands consist of trees of the species picea abies this is the tree species with the largest maximum height in the analysis for this region but it has a low wood density which leads to a lower forest biomass in all three regions we observe that awp increases with the basal area and decreases with maximum height while shape and strength of the combined effects are region specific also the range of awp values differs due to climate variations between the temperate germany fig 4d and the tropic regions fig 4 e f which leads to lower awp values for the german forest stands nevertheless we observe that for germany fig 4a and the amazon fig 4b forest stands with high awp have a high maximum height and basal area in all three ecoregions there occur also forest stands with high awp values that have only moderate basal area and height concerning the evenness of species forest stands fig 4 g h i show a similar structure function relationship for the amazon fig 4h and tanzania fig 4i species evenness is increasing with basal area but decreasing with maximum height for the temperate forests in germany fig 4g the situation is more intricate forest stands between low and medium maximum height 0 m 35 m and with medium basal area have high evenness values in a second step we analyzed how two other structural properties here height heterogeneity and lai affect the functional characteristics of forest stands for the three investigated ecoregions fig 5 in all cases forest stands with large biomass values fig 5 a b c can only be found if the lai is high additionally in the amazon and tanzania these forest stands also need height heterogeneity values above 8 m we also analyzed forest productivity fig 5 d e f forest stands with high awp values have one pattern in common high productivity goes along with low height heterogeneity and medium lai in the amazon and tanzania 4 7 t o d m y r 1 h a 1 and high lai in germany 5 13 t o d m y r 1 h a 1 lower awp values of forest stands in germany can be explained by the shorter vegetation period in contrast to the other ecoregions for the forests in the amazon we also observe highly productive forests with large lai 10 and high height heterogeneity 10 m analogous to the biomass for germany it is remarkable that we observe only a few forest stands with medium height heterogeneity 6 m 10 m and medium lai 2 10 forest stands with these properties have low awp values these forests are next to an area in the state space without forest stands white area possibly due to the negative productivity of trees for species evenness fig 5 g h i we got no clear trends like in the first and second row above a certain lai 3 we find tanzanian forests with high species evenness 0 5 1 the highest evenness values 0 7 can be found at the outer edge of the envelope the analysis of biomass awp and species evenness in german forests fig 5 a d g shows that forests with height heterogeneity smaller than 3 m and lai larger than 6 have on average a lower evenness besides all these forests have a high biomass and a high productivity results for the standard deviation and maximal biomass values productivity and species evenness can be found in the appendix in fig 5 we analyzed mean values for details see methods and appendix figs a8 a10 3 3 comparison of structure function relationships for different ecoregions in the previous sections we examined structure function relationships for different ecoregions here we directly compare the structure function relationships for three ecoregions amazonian german and tanzanian forests to explore how generally the derived relationships apply for comparisons for all ecoregions see appendix figs a11 a13 specifically we compare mean biomasses blue points in fig 6 a b c mean awps red points in fig 6 d e f and mean species evennesses green points in fig 6 g h i of forest stands that have similar states according to the four structural properties used in the figures above but are from different regions we show them in 1 1 graphs we consider forest states as similar if they have similar maximal height height heterogeneity lai and basal area details in section 2 4 we observe a strong correlation for the biomass high r² value the biomass of forest stands with similar properties are not identical not on the 1 1 line for the awp fig 6 d e f we see a good correlation the four structural dimensions are sufficient to find relations between awp for different regions but less effective than between the biomass we see no correlation in the evenness relationships for the different regions fig 6 g h i that indicates that we may need more information in addition to structural properties to get a better correlation 4 discussion in this paper we explored the forest factory 2 0 a new open source software tool to simulate and analyze forests from different biomes on earth we demonstrated several benefits of the approach and provide insights into how this method can increase our knowledge on structure function relationships of forests and overall forest functioning breaking with the tradition of investigating the development of individual forest stands over time we used the forest factory 2 0 as a tool to gain knowledge about forests by analyzing the state space of forests resulting from species pool and environmental factors the simple algorithm of the forest factory allows comparison of a large number of forest stands from different biomes 3 million forest stands per hour generated with the same process driven architecture this also provides a causal understanding of forest structure function relationships as we showed in section 3 in this manuscript we present a method to investigate the relationship between structure maximum height basal area lai height heterogeneity and productivity biomass and awp or biodiversity species evenness of forests with the forest factory 2 0 it is also possible to analyze other forest properties such as diameter increment or net ecosystem exchange additionally it enables us to explore the role of other more complex structural characteristics like stem size distribution or height layer specific information with this systematic approach we could investigate the causes of the differences and similarities of forest stands e g why forests with similar structure show different or similar biomass or productivity values this could allow us to calculate transfer functions for structure function relationships of forests from one ecoregion to another outlined in section 3 3 here we generated forest datasets for seven forest regions to illustrate the approach it is also possible to use other parameterizations from other forest models to generate forests for additional regions with this approach it is not only possible to create forests that already exist but also could occur using the forest factory 2 0 to create forest states beyond the currently existing ones provides a fuller understanding of forests beyond the constraints of empirical data such as national forest inventories or remote sensing data some of these forest states may be due to current changes in disturbance regimes or management and for some forest states it may not even be clear which successional or disturbance pathways will lead to them in addition to the promising research area of realistic forest selection it is also interesting to study forests that have almost no or even negative productivity this analysis can be used to identify stressed forest stands in forest inventories or generally describe and understand the state space of stressed forests this might help to detect potential regime shifts and to explore adaptive capacities of forests and forest ecosystems as seen in fig 3d there are forests with medium height heterogeneity and lai that have low productivity these forests are next to an area in the state space without forest stands white area white areas may indicate that forest stands in this area of the state space have negative productivity such forests are not generated by the algorithm due to the productivity condition further analysis could reveal if this white area represents a transition from forests with low positive to forests with negative productivity this area in the state space could give information on the limits of coping capacity of forest stands if this were the case these forests could change from being a carbon sink to being a carbon source in this study we presented how the forest factory 2 0 can be used to study region specific patterns and the ecological mechanisms behind them every forest stand consists of many individual trees that are modeled by the selected forest model here formind for each single tree additional information is available data product of the forest factory 2 0 this allows the analysis of specific forest attributes by analyzing the productivity or other properties of each tree in the forest hence yielding a deeper understanding of forest dynamics the forest factory 2 0 also offers the possibility for jointly addressing research questions from community ecology organismal aspects diversity of species and structure to ecosystem ecology matter and energy flux aspects biogeochemical cycles loreau 2010 for making forest factory 2 0 easier to use for different user groups it might be useful to generate forests with only certain tree species for user groups that want to generate lidar data with forest factory 2 0 at the moment forests with certain tree species can of course be sorted out of the data product or generated by changing the parameterization possible tree species should be selected during the initialization of forest factory 2 0 perhaps users only want to study multilayer forests so it would be interesting to allow other height distributions that make these forests more likely e g bimodal height distributions even if they already exist in the data product another direction would be to allow different spatial resolutions for forest factory 2 0 if users want to create larger contiguous forests without filtering and rearranging the ones already generated an additional extension could be to allow different mechanisms for tree placement it would be possible to remove trees in the virtual forest stands to mimic interventions also we could implement mechanisms which guarantee a denser packing of forest stands and may widen the envelopes in fig 3 nevertheless the presented envelopes show that we can already cover a broad range of different forest structures with the current approach furthermore the coupling of the forest factory with other modules of formind allows us to explore additional properties and characteristics of the generated forest for example to derive typical remote sensing data and indexes based on radiative transfer models for instance bruenning et al 2021 use the forest factory 2 0 to explore the relationship between lidar profiles and aboveground biomass it is also possible to combine radiative transfer models with the forest factory 2 0 to generate reflection spectra for a huge number of forest stands henniger et al 2023 virtual forests are also used in studies by the remote sensing community frazer et al 2005 frazer et al 2011 widlowski et al 2015 in addition to the typical remote sensing forest variables point clouds lidar profiles the generated forests allow the calculation of additional properties basal area lai awp net ecosystem exchange also at the tree level thus the presented approach can help to downscale the satellite imagery based data and to translate the remote sensing measurements available for large areas to the level of individual trees it is also possible to combine the forest factory 2 0 approach with other forest models the new approach of looking at forests in terms of states rather than simulations over time along with forest factory 2 0 s free coupling possibility offers a promising path to compare forest models and learn more about their capabilities and limitations specifically it opens up the possibility of using different forest models to generate different databases of forest stands as shown in this study with formind and then analyzing these comparatively using the methods presented in addition to the possibility of combining the forest factory 2 0 with other forest models the forest factory 2 0 is also an additional test for parameterizations we can analyze forests that cannot be created by the forest succession for which the parameterization was made these forests may be possible under different environmental conditions like climate change or due to disturbances e g fallen trees another possible application is the use of generated forest stands to initialize models simulating forest development for different forest models over a longer period of time with this application it is possible e g to analyze the further behavior of these forests under climate change or management scenarios natural extinction processes or implementation of new species again the advantage is that we can simulate forests with states beyond those that currently exist and gain information that we cannot obtain from inventory or remote sensing observations with forest models we can analyze the development of these forest stands which allows new ways of analysis for example we can explore forest states that are more resilient to climate change and should be pursued in forest management the presented way of analyzing forests in a digital universe of processes and mechanisms also offers new possibilities for data scientists the freely available datasets of generated forest stands can be used to train artificial intelligence models ai that estimates additional forest tree attributes from just a few attributes of forest stands the resulting relationships could be used to gain a deeper understanding at the level of individual trees from large scale remote sensing observations in addition all relationships shown in the graphs and the data product could be condensed into equations with symbolic regression ais with the forest factory 2 0 researchers can generate virtual forests for their needs or use the open source forest data to analyze a digital forest universe of forest states funding the research

permission to conduct research there appendix additional information for method section pre defined forest stand attributes for each forest stand we select a minimum and maximum tree height h m i n a n d h m a x a a species pool b and a total crown volume of trees c the forest factory 2 0 receives as an initial input a minimum and maximum height of the trees h m i n a n d h m a x this applies to all trees in all forest stands from the range of h m i n a n d h m a x a forest stand specific h m i n a n d h m a x a is chosen randomly for each forest stand we assume an equally distributed probability distribution in the mentioned range the parameterization of each ecoregion defines the total species pool for forest factory 2 0 for each forest stand a forest stand specific species pool b is chosen for this purpose a number between 1 and the number of species in the total species pool is chosen uniformly distributed it determines how many species the forest stand specific species pool should contain each species has an equal probability of being included in the forest stand specific species pool until the next to last species selected number of species 1 is selected to ensure that it is possible to plant trees within the selected height range between h m i n and h m a x which is different for each forest stand we check whether at least one of the species selected so far has a maximum attainable height greater than or equal to h m a x if this is not the case the last species is selected so that a tree with h m a x could be placed forest factory 2 0 receives as input also a maximum total crown volume this total crown volume can be seen as a kind of crown density proportion of crown volume to forest stand volume none of the generated forest stands have a total crown volume above this input value for each forest stand between 0 and the maximum total crown volume a forest stand specific maximum total crown volume c is randomly chosen assuming an equal
