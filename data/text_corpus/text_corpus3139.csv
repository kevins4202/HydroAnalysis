because of this total organic carbon toc is generally used to determine the required ozone dose for any water sample still the effect of om type on mp ozonation is not well understood in this study effluents from five wastewater treatment plants were collected and the organic matter in these effluents was fractionated using membranes f1 4 and resin hi hoa hon and hob fractions were diluted to the same toc concentration spiked with mps and ozonated at three ozone doses our results show that all five effluents had comparable om compositions and similar mp removal confirming the suitability of om quantity toc to compare the ozone requirements for wastewater effluents from the 19 analysed mps three groups were identified that showed similar removal behaviour the strongest differences between the groups were observed around mp ozone reactivities of 102 104 and 106 m 1 s 1 this indicates the presence of three om groups in the samples that interfere with the removal of different mps mp removal in the resin fraction hon were higher for mps with high and medium ozone reactivity indicating a low interference of om in this fraction with mp ozonation om in the resin fractions hoa and hi showed higher interference with mp ozonation therefore removing the hoa and hi fractions prior to ozonation would result in a lower required ozone dose and a more efficient removal of the mps mp

results and discussion 3 1 organic matter characteristics effluents from five wwtps were fractionated the produced fractions were diluted to the same toc concentration and used in ozonation experiments the five wwtps had varying toc cod uv254 nitrite and bromide levels while their ph was relatively similar table s8 this confirms the dissimilarity of the selected effluents in spite of their different characteristics the five effluents had similar toc and uv254 based fraction compositions for both the size fractions and the resin fractions figs 1 and s7 and also similar fluorescence based compositions fig s9 for the size fractionation the smaller fractions f3 1 10 and f4 1 kda were dominant while the fractions with molecules larger than 10 kda were not significantly present in the tested wwtp effluents hp sec measurements and other literature findings confirm the absence of large molecules 10 kda in wastewater effluents fig s10 komatsu et al 2020 for the resin fractionation hi and hoa were dominant in all effluents hon was present to a lower extent and hob was not present figs 1 and s7 other studies found similar resin fraction composition for wwtp effluents fig s11 3 2 micropollutant removals the removal of the mps was affected by the applied ozone dose and by the ozone reactivity of the individual mps fig 2 based on the observed removals in this study and on ko3 values found in literature table s2 the mps were divided into three reactivity groups group 1 with highly reactive mps ko3 104 m 1 s 1 group 2 with moderately reactive mps 104 ko3 102 m 1 s 1 and group 3 with low reactive mps 102 ko3 m 1 s 1 interestingly despite the large range of ko3 values within each group 100 fold the differences in mp removal between the three groups are larger than the removal differences within each group this is the same for all fractions and all wwtps appendix s8 because there is a gap in removal between sotalol and atenolol and mecoprop and irbesartan while there is no gap in ko3 values between these compounds we conclude that there must be other compounds present in the effluent matrix that cause interference around these values these other compounds are most likely organic compounds and the combination of their ko3 and concentration causes interference with removals of mps that have ko3 values around 102 and 104 m 1 s 1 additionally the group 1 mps were not fully removed at the ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g c which indicates that the wastewater effluents also contain another om group that causes interference with the mps that have ko3 values around 106 m 1 s 1 this insight can be used to select relevant indicator mps to monitor ozonation processes and to help decision makers to set removal criteria for specific groups of mps mp removal was similar in the five wwtp effluents for all three mp groups and at all applied ozone doses fig 3 this means that the similar fraction composition of the om in the five effluents see section 3 1 results in a similar interference with the ozonation of mps because the effluents of different wwtps have a similar om composition the om quantity toc is the most important factor to discriminate between the effluents comparing different water matrixes based on their toc values is a reliable option for mp removal with ozonation which is also confirmed by literature buffle et al 2006 nilsson et al 2017 the fractions showed different interference behaviour with the ozonation of mps removals of group 1 and group 2 mps were higher in the resin fraction hon than in the other fractions for all five wwtp effluents fig 4 the reason for this is that the om in the hon has a lower interference with the ozonation of these mps or more specifically the om groups that interfere with the removal of group 1 and group 2 mps have a lower abundance in the hon fraction than in the other fractions low values for most fluorescence and absorbance characteristics and high cod were observed in the hon tables s10 and s11 which indicates that this om fraction contains saturated hydrocarbons with low abundance of ozone reactive aromatic moieties and low reactivity to ozone lim et al 2022 westerhoff et al 1999 the resin fraction hi showed slightly lower interference than the other fractions statistical significance of the differences in mp removal in the resin fractions were confirmed table s12 only for the highly reactive mps at high ozone doses and for the low reactive mps at low ozone doses the differences between the resin fractions were not significant the lower interference of hon and hi could be due to differences in the ozone reactivities ko3 values of the om that is present in the fractions a lower abundance of highly ko3 106 and moderately ko3 104 reactive om would result in higher mp removal for groups 1 and 2 the size fractions did not show a significant difference in their interference with mp ozonation fig 4 this result is different from our previous study where the smallest size fraction f4 showed a lower interference than the other fractions van gijn et al 2021 the reason for this difference could be a change in the used membranes resulting in different pressure and cross flow velocity conditions appendix s3 this means that the results of membrane fractionation experiments are difficult to reproduce the challenges of consistently creating size om fractions are also underlined in other studies assemi et al 2004 3 3 optimizing micropollutant ozonation 3 3 1 comparing effluents the five wwtps selected in this study showed little variation in om compositions and in interference with mp ozonation after toc standardization note that in this study only dutch wwtps were tested that all make use of a biological treatment process for the removal of om nitrogen and phosphorus table 1 because all studied effluents behaved similarly we conclude that using a standardized ozone dose g o3 g toc is a reliable way to compare mp ozonation results from different wwtps this conclusion is confirmed by another study that compared mp ozonation at 10 swedish wwtp nilsson et al 2017 reported om concentrations in wwtp effluents around the world vary from 3 23 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc table s1 note that doc and toc are comparable in wwtp effluent therefore applying ozonation for mp removal at different wwtps would result in a factor 7 difference in the required ozone input depending on the om levels in the wwtp this underlines the importance of monitoring om in wwtp effluents during mp ozonation 3 3 2 removing fractions in pre treatment the produced resin fractions showed consistent differences in their interference with mp ozonation the hon fraction showed lower interference with the ozonation of mps with high and moderate ozone reactivity while the hoa and hi fractions showed higher interference this means that specifically reducing the hoa and hi fractions before ozonation would result in a reduction of the required ozone for the removal of mps several studies suggested om removing pre treatment before ozonation de wilt et al 2018 hofman caris et al 2017 van gijn et al 2021 biological treatment would be a preferred pre treatment because of its low energy use on the other hand using physical treatment such as ion exchange could be more effective at removing om with specific charge properties e g hoa but also have a higher energy demand hofman caris et al 2017 van gijn et al 2021 further studies are needed to find the optimal balance between a pre treatment that can specifically remove the hoa and hi fractions with lower energy requirements than the alternative direct ozone treatment this will reduce the required ozone input for mp ozonation and make implementation of mp abatement technology more feasible additionally further studies using non target ms screening could be used to shed further light on the molecular compositions of the most interesting fractions jennings et al 2022 remucal et al 2020 3 3 3 om characteristics for inline monitoring a single correlation analyses between the om characteristics of the samples and the observed mp removals was performed to investigate which om characteristics have the most potential to predict mp removals table s13 the three characteristics with the strongest relations with mp removal r2 up to 0 7 were absorbance at 300 nm a300 fluorescence component 2 comp 2 and the ratio of the absorbance slopes at 275 295 and 350 400 nm sr table 2 a300 showed the strongest correlation for mps with high ozone reactivity group 1 at the low and medium ozone dose this relation was not evident for group 1 mps at the highest ozone dose because these mps were removed for 100 at this dose note that the commonly used parameter absorbance at 254 nm a254 showed slightly lower r2 values approximately 0 1 point lower for the relevant mps table s13 comp 2 showed slightly lower r2 values than a300 for most group 1 mps but a slightly stronger potential to predict group 2 mp removal table 2 sr also showed high r2 values for group 2 mps at an ozone dose of 0 4 g o3 g c r2 0 7 but not for any of the other mp groups and ozone doses table 2 contrary to the other mentioned correlations sr showed a positive correlation higher mp removal relating to higher sr measurements none of the measured om characteristics showed correlations r2 all below 0 4 with the removal of group 3 mps table s13 this indicates that om type does not affect the removal of group 3 mps group 3 mps are more likely to be removed via reaction with oh radicals than via direct reaction with ozone ibáñez et al 2013 li et al 2019 lim et al 2022 pocostales et al 2010 vel leitner and roshani 2010 based on literature specifically for size fractions it is expected that the type of om does affect formation of oh gonzales et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could mean that in this study changes in oh formation were compensated by scavenging of oh by the om further studies that combine measurements of oh exposure and mp removal in om fractions are needed to confirm this hypothesis in contrast to the other fluorescence components fluorescence component comp 3 showed no correlation with the mp removal which indicates that comp 3 om does not interfere with mp ozonation table s13 comp 3 most likely consists of terrestrial or microbial humic like om table s4 the low interference of comp 3 is confirmed by the observation that only in the resin fraction with the lowest interference hon comp 3 is dominant fig s9 the reason for the low interference most likely is that the om with this characteristic has a low reactivity with ozone the om characteristics a300 and sr showed the strongest correlations for group 1 and group 2 mps respectively while fluorescence component comp 2 showed strong correlations for both mp groups therefore these measurements can be used to control the applied ozone dose in an ozone reactor for optimal mp removal for application in practise absorbance and fluorescence measurements have the advantage over toc that it is easier to measure them inline in a wwtp 4 conclusions the five tested unfractionated wastewater effluents all showed similar organic matter compositions and similar interferences with mp ozonation this indicates that the quantity of organic matter toc is the most relevant difference between wastewater effluents for ozonation of mps additionally three groups of mp that showed similar removal behaviour within the groups were identified the groups existed around ozone reactivities of the mps of 102 104 and 106 m 1 s 1 in all samples this indicates the presence of three om groups with distinct interference behaviour the resin fractions hoa and hi showed the highest interference with mp ozonation and were abundant in all tested effluents removing these fractions before ozonation will likely increase the efficiency of the ozonation process further studies are needed to determine which pre treatments are most suitable to remove the hoa and hi fractions several organic matter characteristics correlated strong r2 0 7 with the mp removal in the different fractions depending on the ko3 values of the mps removal of mps with higher ozone reactivities correlated best to absorbance at 300 nm while removal of mps with medium ozone reactivities correlated best to sr fluorescence component 2 correlated relatively well to both mp groups r2 0 6 these three organic matter characteristics are useful as inline monitoring tools to continuously determine the required dose and improve the

removal differences within each group this is the same for all fractions and all wwtps appendix s8 because there is a gap in removal between sotalol and atenolol and mecoprop and irbesartan while there is no gap in ko3 values between these compounds we conclude that there must be other compounds present in the effluent matrix that cause interference around these values these other compounds are most likely organic compounds and the combination of their ko3 and concentration causes interference with removals of mps that have ko3 values around 102 and 104 m 1 s 1 additionally the group 1 mps were not fully removed at the ozone dose of 0 2 g o3 g c which indicates that the wastewater effluents also contain another om group that causes interference with the mps that have ko3 values around 106 m 1 s 1 this insight can be used to select relevant indicator mps to monitor ozonation processes and to help decision makers to set removal criteria for specific groups of mps mp removal was similar in the five wwtp effluents for all three mp groups and at all applied ozone doses fig 3 this means that the similar fraction composition of the om in the five effluents see section 3 1 results in a similar interference with the ozonation of mps because the effluents of different wwtps have a similar om composition the om quantity toc is the most important factor to discriminate between the effluents comparing different water matrixes based on their toc values is a reliable option for mp removal with ozonation which is also confirmed by literature buffle et al 2006 nilsson et al 2017 the fractions showed different interference behaviour with the ozonation of mps removals of group 1 and group 2 mps were higher in the resin fraction hon than in the other fractions for all five wwtp effluents fig 4 the reason for this is that the om in the hon has a lower interference with the ozonation of these mps or more specifically the om groups that interfere with the removal of group 1 and group 2 mps have a lower abundance in the hon fraction than in the other fractions low values for most fluorescence and absorbance characteristics and high cod were observed in the hon tables s10 and s11 which indicates that this om fraction contains saturated hydrocarbons with low abundance of ozone reactive aromatic moieties and low reactivity to ozone lim et al 2022 westerhoff et al 1999 the resin fraction hi showed slightly lower interference than the other fractions statistical significance of the differences in mp removal in the resin fractions were confirmed table s12 only for the highly reactive mps at high ozone doses and for the low reactive mps at low ozone doses the differences between the resin fractions were not significant the lower interference of hon and hi could be due to differences in the ozone reactivities ko3 values of the om that is present in the fractions a lower abundance of highly ko3 106 and moderately ko3 104 reactive om would result in higher mp removal for groups 1 and 2 the size fractions did not show a significant difference in their interference with mp ozonation fig 4 this result is different from our previous study where the smallest size fraction f4 showed a lower interference than the other fractions van gijn et al 2021 the reason for this difference could be a change in the used membranes resulting in different pressure and cross flow velocity conditions appendix s3 this means that the results of membrane fractionation experiments are difficult to reproduce the challenges of consistently creating size om fractions are also underlined in other studies assemi et al 2004 3 3 optimizing micropollutant ozonation 3 3 1 comparing effluents the five wwtps selected in this study showed little variation in om compositions and in interference with mp ozonation after toc standardization note that in this study only dutch wwtps were tested that all make use of a biological treatment process for the removal of om nitrogen and phosphorus table 1 because all studied effluents behaved similarly we conclude that using a standardized ozone dose g o3 g toc is a reliable way to compare mp ozonation results from different wwtps this conclusion is confirmed by another study that compared mp ozonation at 10 swedish wwtp nilsson et al 2017 reported om concentrations in wwtp effluents around the world vary from 3 23 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc table s1 note that doc and toc are comparable in wwtp effluent therefore applying ozonation for mp removal at different wwtps would result in a factor 7 difference in the required ozone input depending on the om levels in the wwtp this underlines the importance of monitoring om in wwtp effluents during mp ozonation 3 3 2 removing fractions in pre treatment the produced resin fractions showed consistent differences in their interference with mp ozonation the hon fraction showed lower interference with the ozonation of mps with high and moderate ozone reactivity while the hoa and hi fractions showed higher interference this means that specifically reducing the hoa and hi fractions before ozonation would result in a reduction of the required ozone for the removal of mps several studies suggested om removing pre treatment before ozonation de wilt et al 2018 hofman caris et al 2017 van gijn et al 2021 biological treatment would be a preferred pre treatment because of its low energy use on the other hand using physical treatment such as ion exchange could be more effective at removing om with specific charge properties e g hoa but also have a higher energy demand hofman caris et al 2017 van gijn et al 2021 further studies are needed to find the optimal balance between a pre treatment that can specifically remove the hoa and hi fractions with lower energy requirements than the alternative direct ozone treatment this will reduce the required ozone input for mp ozonation and make implementation of mp abatement technology more feasible additionally further studies using non target ms screening could be used to shed further light on the molecular compositions of the most interesting fractions jennings et al 2022 remucal et al 2020 3 3 3 om characteristics for inline monitoring a single correlation analyses between the om characteristics of the samples and the observed mp removals was performed to investigate which om characteristics have the most potential to predict mp removals table s13 the three characteristics with the strongest relations with mp removal r2 up to 0 7 were absorbance at 300 nm a300 fluorescence component 2 comp 2 and the ratio of the absorbance slopes at 275 295 and 350 400 nm sr table 2 a300 showed the strongest correlation for mps with high ozone reactivity group 1 at the low and medium ozone dose this relation was not evident for group 1 mps at the highest ozone dose because these mps were removed for 100 at this dose note that the commonly used parameter absorbance at 254 nm a254 showed slightly lower r2 values approximately 0 1 point lower for the relevant mps table s13 comp 2 showed slightly lower r2 values than a300 for most group 1 mps but a slightly stronger potential to predict group 2 mp removal table 2 sr also showed high r2 values for group 2 mps at an ozone dose of 0 4 g o3 g c r2 0 7 but not for any of the other mp groups and ozone doses table 2 contrary to the other mentioned correlations sr showed a positive correlation higher mp removal relating to higher sr measurements none of the measured om characteristics showed correlations r2 all below 0 4 with the removal of group 3 mps table s13 this indicates that om type does not affect the removal of group 3 mps group 3 mps are more likely to be removed via reaction with oh radicals than via direct reaction with ozone ibáñez et al 2013 li et al 2019 lim et al 2022 pocostales et al 2010 vel leitner and roshani 2010 based on literature specifically for size fractions it is expected that the type of om does affect formation of oh gonzales et al 2012 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 this could mean that in this study changes in oh formation were compensated by scavenging of oh by the om further studies that combine measurements of oh exposure and mp removal in om fractions are needed to confirm this hypothesis in contrast to the other fluorescence components fluorescence component comp 3 showed no correlation with the mp removal which indicates that comp 3 om does not interfere with mp ozonation table s13 comp 3 most likely consists of terrestrial or microbial humic like om table s4 the low interference of comp 3 is confirmed by the observation that only in the resin fraction with the lowest interference hon comp 3 is dominant fig s9 the reason for the low interference most likely is that the om with this characteristic has a low reactivity with ozone the om characteristics a300 and sr showed the strongest correlations for group 1 and group 2 mps respectively while fluorescence component comp 2 showed strong correlations for both mp groups therefore these measurements can be used to control the applied ozone dose in an ozone reactor for optimal mp removal for application in practise absorbance and fluorescence measurements have the advantage over toc that it is easier to measure them inline in a wwtp 4 conclusions the five tested unfractionated wastewater effluents all showed similar organic matter compositions and similar interferences with mp ozonation this indicates that the quantity of organic matter toc is the most relevant difference between wastewater effluents for ozonation of mps additionally three groups of mp that showed similar removal behaviour within the groups were identified the groups existed around ozone reactivities of the mps of 102 104 and 106 m 1 s 1 in all samples this indicates the presence of three om groups with distinct interference behaviour the resin fractions hoa and hi showed the highest interference with mp ozonation and were abundant in all tested effluents removing these fractions before ozonation will likely increase the efficiency of the ozonation process further studies are needed to determine which pre treatments are most suitable to remove the hoa and hi fractions several organic matter characteristics correlated strong r2 0 7 with the mp removal in the different fractions depending on the ko3 values of the mps removal of mps with higher ozone reactivities correlated best to absorbance at 300 nm while removal of mps with medium ozone reactivities correlated best to sr fluorescence component 2 correlated relatively well to both mp groups r2 0 6 these three organic matter characteristics are useful as inline monitoring tools to continuously determine the required dose and improve the

15696,recently iron based heterogenous catalysts have received much attention in the activation of peracetic acid paa for generating reactive radicals to degrade organic pollutants yet the paa activation efficiency is compromised by the slow transformation from fe iii to fe ii herein considering the electron donating ability of reducing sulfur species a novel advanced oxidation process by combining pyrite and paa simplified as pyrite paa for the abatement of tetracycline tc is proposed in this study in the pyrite paa process tc can be completely removed within 30 min under neutral conditions by the synergy of homogeneous and heterogenous fe ii species ch3c o oo is the main radical generated from the pyrite paa process responsible for tc abatement the excellent activation properties of pyrite can be attributed to the superior electron donating ability of reducing sulfur species to facilitate the reduction of fe iii meanwhile the complexation of leached fe2 with tc favors paa activation and concomitant tc abatement in addition the degradation pathways of tc and the toxicity of the degradation intermediates are analyzed the pyrite paa process shows an excellent tc abatement efficacy in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 the coexistence of cl hco3 and hpo4 2 exhibits negligible effect on tc abatement while the ha slightly inhibits the abatement rate of tc this study highlights the efficient activation of paa by pyrite and the important role of sulfur in promoting the conversion of fe iii to fe ii in the pyrite paa process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrite peracetic acid tetracycline activation dft calculation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction peracetic acid ch3c o ooh paa as a peroxyacid oxidant has been widely used for disinfection and oxidation in food processing aquaculture and other industries liu et al 2017 compared with the traditional chlorine disinfectants application of paa exhibits great advantages with little formation of toxic byproducts such as halogenated compounds acetaldehyde and nitrosamines dell erba et al 2007 considering the high redox potential 1 8 ev of paa some special organic pollutants can be removed by the paa alone chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 for example β lactams antibiotics can be oxidized by paa with the apparent second order rate constants k app of 15 56 44 38 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2017 this provides a broad prospect for the practical application of paa in the water and wastewater treatment however the high selectivity of paa greatly results in the ineffectiveness in the abatement of various organic pollutants recently activation of paa to produce strong oxidizing radicals for the degradation of organic micropollutants has attracted extensive interest in the advanced oxidation processes aops kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b previous studies have confirmed that organic carbon radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and hydroxyl radicals oh can be produced by activation of paa with various methods e g heat wang et al 2020a uv chen et al 2019 and transition metal ions kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 among these methods transition metal activation is widely studied because of its simplicity and high efficiency paa activation with homogeneous transition metal ions including fe2 co2 cu2 mn2 has been previously reported kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 luukkonen et al 2015 rothbart et al 2012 among these various activators fe2 is a good candidate because of its environmental friendliness and good activation performance for example kim et al has demonstrated that the micropollutants can be degraded in the fe2 paa process with the k app in the range of 1 10 105 to 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 0 8 1 however the slow conversion from fe3 to fe2 with the k app of 2 72 m 1 s 1 greatly limits the paa activation efficiency kim et al 2019 at the same time the addition of high concentrations of fe2 can also quench free radicals thereby reducing the effectiveness of pollutant removal xiao et al 2020 therefore iron based heterogeneous catalysts can be an alternative to address the above problems heterogeneous iron based catalysts can not only reduce the quenching effect on radicals and the potential environmental risk but also facilitate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii via the reducing substances on their surfaces for example zhang et al studied the activation of paa by nano zero valent iron in which the released fe2 from nano zero valent iron mainly contributed to the activation process and the reductive fe0 was favorable for the conversion from fe iii to fe ii zhang et al 2022 wang et al also found that activation of paa by nano zero valent iron under uv irradiation and multiple reuse of nano zero valent iron exerted no effect on the removal of pollutants which was mainly because of the reduction of fe iii by uv and fe0 on the surface of nano zero valent iron wang et al 2021b however one major challenge for the application of nano zero valent iron in the paa activation is that the passivation of nano zero valent iron on the surface inhibits the transformation of fe iii to fe ii thereby greatly limiting the activation of paa under neutral and alkaline conditions recently the reductive sulfur species have been introduced into iron based catalysts to enhance the conversion of fe iii to fe ii for instance yang et al found that sulfur conversion product h2s due to the significant iron and sulfur leaching from fes promoted fe ii regeneration yang et al 2022b compared with fes pyrite as the typical iron rich sulfur bearing mineral is advantageous owing to its recyclability and stability in the aops zhou et al 2018 based on the above assumptions pyrite can be expected to achieve efficient activation of paa regarding the efficient activation of paa by iron and the important role of reducing sulfur species for the reduction of fe iii tetracycline tc is widely used as an antibiotic and frequently detected in the wastewater treatment effluents 2 2 mg l groundwater 0 1 µg l and surface water 4 5 µg l xu et al 2020 due to its potential threat to the ecosystem and human health tc is selected as a model pollutant in this study the objectives of this work are i to evaluate the feasibility of the pyrite paa process towards tc abatement and distinguish the homogeneous and heterogeneous contribution to tc abatement ii to determine the reactive radicals contributing to tc abatement and validate their generation pathways iii to elucidate the paa activation mechanism with pyrite especially the synergy between homogeneous and heterogeneous phase iv to identify the degradation intermediates and degradation pathways for tc abatement and elucidate the toxicity of the degradation products v to analyze the effect of various factors on tc abatement and evaluate the application potential of the pyrite paa process in the treatment of real waters 2 materials and methods

suspension and placed on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature with a rotary speed of 500 rpm the reaction solution containing tc pyrite was prepared according to the designed experimental conditions solution ph was adjusted with 0 2 m naoh and h2so4 paa was finally added to start the experiments sample were withdrawn at predetermined intervals filtered through a membrane with a pore size of 0 22

feasibility of paa activation with pyrite for tc abatement fig 1 a displays tc abatement as a function of time in different processes there is a negligible tc adsorption by pyrite tc abatement efficiency in the pyrite h2o2 process and the pyrite paa process is 22 5 and 100 respectively in contrast h2o2 or paa oxidation leads to 10 0 and 25 4 of tc abatement suggesting the inconsequential contribution of h2o2 or paa oxidation to tc abatement in the pyrite paa process in addition the pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the pyrite h2o2 paa oxidation and pyrite paa processes are 0 00615 0 00744 and 0 123 min 1 respectively fig s1 therefore the feasibility of paa activation with pyrite for tc abatement can be validated due to the coexistence of h2o2 in the paa solution the influence of h2o2 with different concentrations on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is further explored as shown in fig 1 b as the concentration of h2o2 increases from 100 µm to 300 µm tc abatement trend exhibits insignificant variation meanwhile the presence of h2o2 with different concentrations exerts inappreciable effect on the paa decay fig s2 the aforementioned results indicate that the contribution of coexisting h2o2 is of minor consequence in the activation of paa with pyrite previous studies have shown that paa has a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy 0 25 ev compared to that of h2o2 0 57 ev da silva et al 2020 kim et al 2019 regarding that fe ii is commonly considered as the reactive species in the pyrite surface he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the activation energy ea for the reaction between fe2 and paa or h2o2 is calculated based on dft calculation text s4 reaction of paa with fe2 possesses much lower activation energy than that of h2o2 eqs 1 3 therefore compared with h2o2 paa can be effectively activated by pyrite 1 h 2 o 2 f e 2 e a 76 48 kcal mol o h oh f e 3 2 c h 3 c o ooh f e 2 e a 20 45 kcal mol c h 3 c o o oh f e 3 3 c h 3 c o ooh f e 2 e a 35 90 kcal mol c h 3 c o o o h f e 3 previous studies have reported that pyrite suffers from the release of fe2 during its application in aops which can affect the generation of reactive radicals he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 therefore the leached fe2 and total fe concentration in the pyrite paa process is monitored as shown in fig 1 c the concentrations of fe2 and total fe are 2 7 and 2 8 µm respectively given the significant leaching of fe2 from pyrite the activation of paa with pyrite may occur in two ways i pyrite directly activates paa via a heterogeneous process ii fe2 is leached form pyrite and indirectly activates paa via a homogeneous process in the previous studies 2 2 bipyridine bpy was used to chelate fe ii on the catalyst surface and the solution blocking the transfer of electrons to the oxidant li et al 2021 yang et al 2022b the effect of bpy on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is studied as shown in fig 1 d the tc abatement is completely inhibited in the presence of bpy 1 10 phenanthroline is a representative strong complexing agent for nitrogen ligands which can form stable complexes with fe2 as shown in fig s3 1 10 phenanthroline with various concentrations does not completely inhibit the tc abatement this is because the strong planarity of 1 10 phenanthroline makes it difficult to chelate with fe ii sites while the planarity of bpy is weaker than 1 10 phenanthroline and can chelate with surface fe ii text s5 therefore 1 10 phenanthroline is chosen to verify the heterogeneous and homogeneous contribution to tc abatement because it can form stable chelates with fe2 without chelating with the fe ii on the pyrite surface thereby inhibiting activation of paa with fe2 in the homogeneous process as shown in fig 1 d the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline exerts an inhibitory effect on tc abatement therefore according to the k obs fig s4 a tc abatement is originated from three parts including the direct paa oxidation 0 00744 min 1 the heterogeneous contribution 0 0320 min 1 and the homogeneous contribution 0 0841 min 1 fig s4 b 3 2 removal mechanism of tc in the pyrite paa process 3 2 1 roles of radicals during tc removal in the paa based aops the radicals mainly include oh ch3c o oo ch3c o o and ch3 kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 in order to distinguish the contribution of the aforementioned radicals to tc abatement the effect of different radical scavengers such as tert butanol tba methanol meoh and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd on tc abatement is studied the presence of these scavengers does not inhibit the activation of paa by pyrite fig s5 as shown in fig 2 a after the addition of tba meoh and 2 4 hd tc abatement is inhibited by 3 4 4 1 and 74 6 respectively correspondingly the k obs of tc abatement is 0 109 0 103 and 0 0109 min 1 fig s6 and fig 2 b respectively tba is a typical scavenger for oh with the k app of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 while meoh is an effective bursting agent for oh and so4 with the k app of 2 5 107 and 9 7 108 m 1s 1 respectively peng et al 2022a wu et al 2022a although the previous study has indicated the production of so4 from pyrite zhou et al 2018 the negligible difference between tba and meoh in the tc abatement indicates the minor contribution of so4 the significant inhibitory effect of 2 4 hd on tc abatement can be explained as the scavenging effect of acetyl per oxygen radicals simplified as r c by 2 4 hd with the k app of 9 2 108 m 1s 1 kim et al 2020 therefore for the pyrite paa process the k obs of tc abatement in k paa k oh and k r c are 0 00710 0 0200 and 0 0959 min 1 respectively fig 2 b to further confirm the formation of r c a stable nitro radical tempo is employed as a radical probe for the identification of co3c o o and ch3 barton et al 1998 as shown in fig s7 a the ch3c o o tempo signal m z 216 1598 and rt at 1 239 min is observed in the lc ms spectra which evidences the generation of ch3c o o in addition the signal of ch3 tempo m z 172 1701 and rt at 0 826 min fig s7 b suggests the generation of ch3 by decarboxylation of co3c o o eq 4 rokhina et al 2010 considering that the ch3c o oo can release oxygen via eqs 5 6 wang et al 2020b the amount of released oxygen is measured as shown in fig s7 c the released oxygen decreases from 2 87 to 1 93 mg l with the increase of the tc concentrations from 0 to 25 µm suggesting the contribution of ch3c o oo co3c o o undergoes self decomposition via eqs 4 and 7 with rate constants of 2 3 105 s 1 and 1 0 109 m 1s 1 which easily outcompetes its reaction with the target contaminant wang et al 2020b in terms of ch3 generated from co3c o o decomposition eq 4 it can be further transformed to ch3oo by oxygen with the rate constant of 4 1 109 m 1s 1 eq 8 wang et al 2020b although ch3oo may be present in the pyrite paa process its contribution to the tc abatement can be neglected due to its weak oxidation capacity for organic pollutants wang et al 2020b therefore given that ch3c o oo is the strongest of the organic carbon radicals and the significant reduction of oxygen release neta et al 1990 the main radical responsible for the abatement of tc is ch3c o oo 4 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 5 2 c h 3 c o oo o 2 products 6 c h 3 c o oo o 2 c h 3 c o o o o 2 7 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o 2 8 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 oo 3 2 2 identification of the active sites it is well known that surface fe ii sites are the main active sites in the activation process of iron heterogeneous catalysts for precursor salts peng et al 2022b zhou et al 2018 meanwhile the involvement of sulfur species also plays an important role for the activation of paa by metal sulfides wang et al 2021a in order to study the possible transformation of fe ii and sulfur on the pyrite surface the variation of chemical valence of iron and sulfur species before and after use is studied by xps as shown in the fig s8 a and fig s8 b fe s and o are the main elements on pyrite surface according to the fe 2p spectra of the fresh pyrite two pairs of peaks are observed fig 3 a the first pair of peaks at 706 7 and 719 5 ev and the second pair at 710 2 and 722 7 ev could be ascribed to fe ii and fe iii respectively zhou et al 2018 the proportion of fe ii and fe iii are 65 and 35 of the total fe on pyrite surface table 1 the fe 2p spectra of the used pyrite exhibits identical peaks as the fresh pyrite with fe ii and fe iii accounting for 58 and 42 respectively it is obvious that the peak intensity of fe ii is significantly lower for the used pyrite indicating the conversion from fe ii to fe iii during the paa activation with regard to the involvement of sulfur species s 2p spectra of fresh pyrite displays two peaks at 162 3 and 163 6 ev which can be ascribed to s2 2 and s8 0 respectively fig 3 b after activation of paa with pyrite an emergence of a peak at 162 2 ev ascribed to s5 2 is observed he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the decrease of the proportion of s2 2 and the increase of s8 0 s5 2 indicate the oxidation of the reducing sulfur species table 1 considering the efficient activation of fe ii for paa and the difficulty of regeneration of fe ii the electron donating s2 2 can facilitate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii and the subsequent rapid activation of paa the morphology and elemental distribution for the pristine and used pyrite are illustrated via sem eds as shown in fig s9 a j the elements including fe s and o are uniformly distributed on the pyrite surface the irregular shape of pyrite particles and their morphology exhibit no significant variation before and after reaction the tem images fig s10 clearly show that the surface of pyrite particles is dominated by 100 crystal plane therefore the 100 crystal plane of pyrite is used as the main reactive crystal plane with paa in order to further clarify the role of different sites fe and s sites on pyrite surface in paa activation dft simulation is performed to calculate the adsorption and activation of paa on the 100 lattice plane of pyrite surface as shown in fig 3 c d and table s1 the fe o bond length and the s o bond length of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site and s i site are 2 150 and 3 369 å respectively the shorter bond length for the adsorption of paa on the fe ii site means the favorable chemisorption which facilitates the electron transfer between paa and pyrite meanwhile the o o bond length of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site and s i site are 1 477 and 1 468 å indicating the lower energy required to breakage of o o bond of paa at the fe ii site especially the adsorption energies eads between paa and the fe ii site or s i site is calculated to be 0 65 and 0 37 ev demonstrating the preferential adsorption and corresponding activation of paa on the fe ii site of pyrite in addition the bader charge analysis of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site reveals that 0 09 electrons are transferred from fe ii with no electron transfer from s i table s2 for the paa adsorption on the s i site there are 0 014 and 0 009 electrons transferred from fe ii and s i respectively the more electrons transferred by paa adsorption on fe ii site can also prove the preferable electron transfer therefore in the heterogeneous pyrite paa process the fe ii sites are the main active sites of paa activation 3 2 3 contribution of homogeneous fe2 to paa activation as mentioned earlier there is a significant amount of leaching fe2 2 7 µm in the pyrite paa process according to the previous study fe2 can promote the decomposition of paa leading to the abatement of organic pollutants kim et al 2019 to analyze the contribution of homogeneous fe2 paa decay in the fe2 paa process is studied in the presence or absence of tc fig s11 the decay rate of paa in the presence of tc is higher than that in the absence of tc this enhanced effect by tc suggests that the complexation of fe2 with tc simplified as fe2 tc can promote the paa activation which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2022 the speciation of fe2 as a function of tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes is calculated by the eqs 9 11 9 f e 2 f e 2 free f e 2 tc 10 tc t c free f e 2 tc 11 k f e 2 tc f e 2 tc fe free 2 t c free where fe2 is the total fe2 concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes fe2 free is the free fe2 concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes fe2 tc is the concentration of fe2 complexes with tc in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes tc is the total tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes tcfree is the free tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes the k f e 2 tc is the complexation stability constant of tc with fe2 5 3 dodgson et al 1956 in the homogeneous fe2 paa process 3 µm fe2 is chosen for analysis of the speciation in the heterogeneous pyrite paa process the leached fe2 concentration from pyrite increases as the tc concentration decreases and the speciation of fe2 as a function of tc concentration in these two processes is simulated in fig s12 a and fig s12 b it is obvious that the fe2 tc complexes play a key role in the paa activation and tc abatement as shown in fig s13 a the ring structure of the tc molecule is labeled from right to left as a b c and d previous studies have shown that there are two possible complexation ways of fe2 with tc wang et al 2015 yang et al 2022a the first way refers to the complexation with the dimethyl n and hydroxyl o structures in the a ring fig s13 b yang et al 2022a and the second one refers to the complexation with amido o and hydroxyl o structures in the a ring fig s13 c wang et al 2015 to shed light on the enhanced mechanism by tc from the theoretical perspective dft calculations are performed to simulate the complexation process between tc molecules and fe2 and obtain the binding energy of fe2 with tc at different complexation sites fig s14 according to the binding energies of the above two structures of the complexes it is obvious that the complexation of fe2 with tc is more preferable than h2o the discrepancy for the binding energies of fe2 with the different sites suggests the complexation of the dimethyl n and hydroxyl o is more likely to occur fig 4 a d displays the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lumo energy of fe2 and fe2 tc to analyze the electron donating property the homo energy of fe2 and fe2 tc are 7 21 and 5 26 ev suggesting that complexation of fe2 with tc gives electrons more easily than fe2 and activates paa efficiently to produce free radicals meanwhile the homo lumo gap of tc before and after complexation is 4 44 and 3 37 ev respectively fig 4 c and d the smaller gap after complexation means that fe2 tc can be more easily degraded this result can also be proved by the electrostatic potential esp before and after complexation as shown in fig 4 e and f the complexation of fe2 significantly affects the electron distribution of tc which can be more easily oxidized by the radicals cai et al 2022 yin et al 2021 these results indicate that the complexation alters the charge distribution of fe2 and tc thus conferring them higher reactivity 3 2 4 the important role of s2 2 previous studies have indicated that the involvement of sulfur species of metal sulfides plays an important role in the activation of the precursor salts wu et al 2022a zhou et al 2018 in the aforementioned xps analysis s2 2 can be transformed into other sulfur species during the paa activation process since the standard reduction potential of sulfur s2 2 s0 0 48 v is much lower than that of iron fe iii fe ii 0 77 v speight 2005 the regeneration of fe ii by s2 2 is thermodynamically favorable in the pyrite surface to further understand the involvement of the sulfur species tem eds and ic analysis are conducted to evaluate the variation of sulfur on the catalyst surface and in the solution as shown in fig s15 a and fig s15 b a significant decrease in the intensity of the sulfur peak could be found in the eds spectra of pyrite before and after reaction therefore it can be assumed that there is a conversion of surface sulfur to hydrophilic sulfur species eg so4 2 according to the results of ic in fig s16 it could be found that so4 2 has been produced during the reaction process regarding that the existing form of leached iron is fe2 fig 1 c it can be speculated that the reducing sulfur species may contribute to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 due to that the negligible reaction between h2o2 and fe3 with the k app of 1 0 10 2 m 1s 1 kim et al 2019 to investigate the underlying mechanism different concentrations of fe3 are added to the pyrite paa process as shown in fig 5 a tc abatement is significant enhanced by the addition of fe3 to the pyrite paa process when the fe3 concentration increases from 0 to 50 µm the k obs of tc abatement increases from 0 123 to 0 348 min 1 fig s17 considering the paa activation by fe3 kim et al 2019 tc abatement in the fe3 paa process is also explored as shown in fig s18 tc abatement is slightly enhanced in the fe3 paa process with the increase of k obs from 0 00850 to 0 0257 min 1 in order to evaluate the contribution of fe3 to tc abatement in the pyrite paa process several kinetic rate constants are defined according to eqs 12 14 12 k pyrite k pyrite paa k paa 13 k f e 3 k f e 3 paa k paa 14 k f e 3 pyrite k f e 3 pyrite paa k f e 3 k pyrite k paa where k paa min 1 is tc abatement rate constant in the single paa oxidation process k f e 3 paa k pyrite paa and k f e 3 pyrite paa min 1 are tc abatement rate constant in the fe3 paa pyrite paa and fe3 pyrite paa processes respectively k f e 3 and k pyrite min 1 are the contribution of fe3 and pyrite to tc abatement rate constant for the fe3 paa and pyrite paa processes respectively and k f e 3 pyrite min 1 is the contribution of fe3 to tc abatement rate constant in the fe3 pyrite paa process the k f e 3 pyrite is significantly increased from 0 0148 to 0 225 min 1 when the fe3 concentration ranges from 5 to 50 µm fig 5 b considering the positive charge of fe3 the zeta potential of pyrite is determined fig s19 the isoelectric point of pyrite is around 2 8 under the experimental conditions the surface of pyrite is negatively charged which is favorable for the adsorption of fe3 on pyrite surface and thus facilitates the reduction of fe3 to fe ii by s2 2 to test the adsorption of fe3 by pyrite the variation of fe3 concentration during the abatement of tc in the fe3 pyrite paa process is measured as shown in fig s20 a rapid decrease of the fe3 concentration is observed the electrostatic attraction between pyrite and fe3 makes it easy for fe3 to adsorb on the pyrite surface and then be reduced by the sulfur species on the surface which can explain the negligible discrepancy for the concentration of fe2 and total fe in the pyrite paa process fig 1 c dft calculations are performed to simulate the adsorption of fe3 at the s i site on pyrite and the differential charge density can be obtained as shown in fig s21 it can be clearly observed that electrons are transferred from the pyrite surface to the fe3 these results suggest that the electron donating s2 2 can regenerate fe ii via adsorption of fe3 on pyrite surface in the pyrite paa process as suggested in earlier literature metal sulfide possesses the surface sulfur vacancies which can expose more active sites for activation of oxidants wu et al 2022a with regard to pyrite a significant epr signal is also observed at g 2 0 fig 5 c which is attributed to sulfur vacancies on pyrite surface as a result a large number of iron active sites is exposed owing to sulfur vacancies facilitating the interaction between the iron active sites and paa to test this point a sulfur is removed from the adsorption site near iron to create sulfur vacancies fig s22 and the adsorption and activation of paa on the 100 lattice planes of pyrite surface are calculated by dft as shown in fig 5 d the bond length of the fe o bond at the fe ii site after paa adsorption decreases from 2 105 to 2 028 å after introduction of the sulfur vacancy making the chemisorption of paa with fe ii site stronger meanwhile the o o bond length increases from 1 477 to 1 481 å indicating that the energy required for the o o bond breakage is lower than that in the absence of sulfur vacancies in addition the eads of 0 97 ev confirms that the presence of sulfur vacancies in pyrite is more favorable for the adsorption and activation of paa table s1 at the same time the presence of the sulfur vacancy leads to an increase of number of electrons transfer from 0 09 to 0 10 for the paa adsorption at the fe ii site table s2 in summary it can be concluded that the presence of sulfur vacancy on pyrite surface is more favorable for paa activation process on the basis of the aforementioned analysis the mechanism of tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is proposed as shown in fig 6 on the one hand pyrite in aqueous solution dissolves fe2 to activate paa to generate ch3c o oo and fe3 the generated fe3 is easily attracted to the negatively charged pyrite and thus is reduced to fe ii by the sulfur species on the other hand paa is adsorbed by the surface fe ii sites of pyrite followed by the electron transfer to generate ch3c o oo and surface fe iii and surface fe iii can also be reduced to fe ii by the sulfur species meanwhile the complexation of fe2 with tc makes fe2 more susceptible to electron transfer with paa and induces tc more susceptible to abatement by radical attack overall the transformation of surface sulfur species from s2 2 to s5 2 s8 0 to hydrophilic so4 2 is important for the reduction of homogeneous fe3 and heterogeneous fe iii 3 2 5 tc degradation pathways and toxicity analysis total organic carbon toc can reflect the mineralization of organic pollutants in the aops as shown in fig s23 the toc is removed by 21 in the pyrite paa process confirming that the partial mineralization of tc and the presence of the degradation intermediates therefore the degradation pathways of tc are investigated using dft calculations and uplc qtof ms analysis considering the elevated reactivity of tc after complexation with fe2 the fukui function for the tc and tc fe2 is shown in the table s3 and table s4 and the atomic numbers of tc and fe2 tc are shown in fig s24 and fig s25 according to the fukui function a high value of f means the tendency of an atom by nucleophilic attack a high value of f suggests the tendency by electrophilic attack and a high value of f0 indicates the tendency by radical attack pino rios et al 2017 the intermediates of tc degradation are identified by uplc qtof ms as shown in fig s26 fig s27 and table s5 based on the detected intermediates and the fukui function the degradation pathway of tc is proposed as shown in fig 7 in pathway i the p 435 is the product of tc after the loss n methyl addition of hydroxyl group and hydrogen tc and fe2 tc in 28 n position of with a f0 value of 0 001 and 0 0209 indicates that the complexation makes the demethylation reactions more likely to occur p 419 is formed as a result of the dihydroxylation of p 435 since the c n bond on the a ring is vulnerable to attack by radicals denitrogenation leads to the formation of p 407 cao et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in pathway ii the loss of the hydroxyl group at the c7 position results in the formation of p 429 which is subsequently converted to p 364 by the ring opening reaction of the a ring and the removal of the amino in 25 n position hydroxyl and methyl groups in 28 n position p 280 is formed from p 364 by ring opening loss of hydroxyl group and oxygen wu et al 2022b in pathway iii the double bond with the c14 position is broken with hydroxyl addition to form p 461 1 subsequently the double bond at position c16 undergoes hydroxylation to form p 477 p 442 is generated by the loss of nh3 and h2o from p 477 cao et al 2019 in pathway iv the product p 397 is formed by the breakage of the double bond at c9 position demethylation at 28 n position deamination at 25 n position 17c position are attacked by radicals for demethylation and c9 position is dehydroxylated to form p 340 p 235 is formed by dihydroxylation c n bond breakage and ring opening reaction zhu et al 2022 finally the aforementioned intermediates from the above pathway are destroyed by radicals attack and are successively oxidized to form p 114 1 2 3 4 cao et al 2019 liu et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 in pathway v c10 position with f0 of 0 0715 and 0 0641 are more susceptible to ring opening reactions by radicals attack to form p 461 2 which can be further oxidized to p 283 and p 165 liu et al 2022b the toxicity of tc and its intermediates evaluated by toxicity estimation software tool based on quantitative structure activity relationship is shown in table s6 and fig s28 four parameters of toxicity including oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity are selected for evaluation in addition four toxicity classes of highly toxic ld50 1000 lc50 1 toxic 1000 ld50 2000 1 lc50 10 harmful 2000 ld50 3000 10 lc50 100 and lowly toxic ld50 3000 lc50 100 for oral rat ld50 and fathead minnow two development toxicities of toxicant and non toxicant two mutagenic properties of positive and negative are specified cai et al 2021 ji et al 2020 the toxicity of tc abatement intermediates gradually decreases with decreasing molecular weight specifically tc p 436 p 429 p 461 and p 477 are highly toxic or toxic toxicant and positive for oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity respectively as the reaction proceeds the final products p 281 p 165 and p 114 are harmful or lowly toxic non toxicant and negative for oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity respectively the reduction in the toxicity of the degradation intermediates proves that degradation of tc in the pyrite paa process exhibits a decrease of the environmental hazard 3 3 effect of various parameters on the tc abatement in the pyrite paa process 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the effect of solution ph on the tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is shown in fig 8 a when the solution ph ranges from 4 0 to 10 0 the tc abatement efficiency can be as high as 100 tc abatement follows the pseudo first order kinetics with k obs increasing from 0 0889 to 0 896 min 1 fig s29 a considering the oxidative nature of paa the tc abatement at different ph conditions is also measured by the single paa oxidation process as shown in fig s29 c it is observed that solution ph can greatly affect the tc abatement rate in the pyrite paa process direct oxidation of tc by paa contributes little to the tc abatement rate for all ph conditions fig 8 a weakly basic ph conditions are more favorable for tc abatement than weakly acidic and basic ph conditions multiple factors are involved in the effect of solution ph on tc abatement firstly solution ph can affect the leaching and hydrolysis of iron the concentration of total fe ions in the solution is about 4 8 µm at ph 4 0 and about 2 8 µm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig s30 a it can be found that there are more leached fe ions under acidic conditions which can explain the higher k obs of tc abatement meanwhile the leached fe can promote the decay of paa which is faster at ph 4 0 than 7 0 fig s29 b however at neutral and alkaline conditions the leached fe is approximately the same and its effect on tc abatement can be neglected for the hydrolysis of fe2 the distribution of fe2 species as a function of ph is simulated as shown in fig s30 d in the ph range of 4 8 5 fe2 is the predominant form present and is able to activate paa to produce radicals for the tc abatement as the ph increased from 8 5 to 10 the content of hydroxyl iron increases while fe2 is easily oxidized to fe3 kim et al 2019 secondly solution ph can affect the species distribution of paa fig s30 b regarding the existing form of paa as paa paa pka of 8 2 eq 15 the protonated species paa is predominant at ph 8 2 while the proportion of paa increases rapidly with increasing ph paa decays more rapidly at ph 10 0 fig s29 b and fig s29 e indicating the favorable decomposition of paa under alkaline conditions at ph 10 0 paa exists mainly in the deprotonated form of paa which can rapidly self decay and be consumed by h2o2 through nucleophilic substitution eqs 16 17 wang et al 2020b thus the reduction of tc abatement under alkaline conditions can be adequately explained by the consumption of paa thirdly solution ph can affect the species distribution of tc fig s30 c and fig s30 e according to a previous study the reactivity of tc with free radicals increases with increasing ph which corresponds to a higher electron density in the ring structure of tc and tc2 than in tc chen et al 2017 meanwhile the strongly protonated tc molecule at low ph is not conducive to the complexation of fe2 while the deprotonated tc at high ph facilitates the generation of fe2 tc complexes which in turn promotes the paa activation and tc abatement chen et al 2016 therefore the elevated reactivity of tc at higher ph conditions facilitates its abatement 15 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o pka 8 2 16 c h 3 c o o

the pyrite paa process after 30 min of reaction 88 of tc is removed for the pyrite dose of 0 05 g l and 100 of tc abatement is achieved for the pyrite doses greater than 0 1 g l the corresponding k obs for tc abatement rises from 0 0748 to 0 170 min 1 fig s31 a and fig 8 b this result is ascribed to that the increase of pyrite dose can lead to the increase of the reactive site and leached fe2 fig s31 b fig 8 c and fig 8 d display the effect of paa dose and tc concentration on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process an increase of paa dose from 20 to 100 µm results in the significant increase of k obs of tc abatement from 0 0203 to 0 827 min 1 fig s31 c and fig 8 c which is due to the generation of more radicals in terms of the effect of tc concentration tc with lower concentration can be completely degraded as the tc concentration increases to 20 µm the k obs decreases from 0 160 to 0 0769 min 1 fig s31 d and fig 8 d this is because the rate of reactive radical production is not sufficient for rapid tc abatement 3 3 3 effect of the coexisting anions humic acid and different water matrixes fig 9 a shows the effect of cl on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process when the concentration of cl is from 0 to 8 mm the tc removal efficiency is almost 100 with k obs of 0 123 min 1 fig s32 a and fig 9 a therefore the presence of cl exerts no effect on tc abatement in despite of the scavenging effect of ch3c o oo by cl chen et al 2019 the produced chlorine radicals can also react with tc which can explain the unaltered tc abatement in the presence of cl fig 9 b and c depict the effect of hpo4 2 and hco3 on tc abatement the abatement efficiency of tc is approximately 95 with the k obs of tc ranging from 0 123 to 0 0958 min 1 and 0 123 to 0 0981 min 1 for hpo4 2 and hco3 respectively fig s32 b fig s32 c fig 9 b and fig 9 c the negligible effect of hpo4 2 and hco3 can be due to their lower reactivity with organic carbon radicals chen et al 2019 fig 9 d illustrates the effect of ha on tc abatement the tc abatement efficiency decreases from 100 to 80 with the k obs decreasing from 0 123 to 0 0597 min 1 fig s32 d and fig 9 d this may be due to that the reaction of ha with radicals can inhibit the abatement of tc wang et al 2020b to test the effectiveness of the pyrite paa process in real water bodies tc removal in different water matrices ultrapure water uw distilled water dw tap water tw surface water sw and municipal wastewater effluent mw is investigated fig s33 the water quality parameters of real water samples are shown in table s7 tc abatement can reach more than 95 in all water matrices thus the application prospects of the pyrite paa process in treatment of waters contaminated by organics can be demonstrated 3 3 4 effect of recycling times of pyrite and applicability in the pyrite paa process recyclability and stability are critical to evaluate the application potential of heterogeneous catalysts as shown in fig s34 although the k obs decreases from 0 123 to 0 0792 min 1 the removal efficiency of tc can still reach more than 90 after three recycles the crystal structure and elemental bonding of pyrite before and after use are conducted to explain by xrd and ftir measurements as shown in fig s35 a xrd patterns show typical diffraction peaks for the pristine and used pyrite jcpds no 42 1340 suggesting the crystal stability of pyrite in terms of the ftir spectra fig s35 b the band at the wavelength of 500 cm 1 belongs to the feo6 coordination octahedron the band at 1000 cm 1 attributes to the vibration of so4 2 and the band at 1250 cm 1 ascribes to the h o h deformation these characteristic groups are considered to be the main components from the surface passivation of pyrite probably due to the oxidation of pyrite during pretreatment mandal et al 2017 after reaction there is no variation in the characteristic bond of pyrite meanwhile the abatement of various organic contaminants including chlortetracycline ctc oxytetracycline otc ampicillin amp cefalexin cfx sulfamethoxazole smx bisphenol a bpa in the pyrite paa process is also evaluated as shown in fig s36 in the pyrite paa process the removal efficiency of various organic pollutants can reach more than 85 based on the above analysis the good stability of pyrite and applicability of pyrite paa process provide a broad prospect for its practical application 4 conclusions activation of paa with pyrite can achieve efficient tc abatement under acidic to alkaline conditions in which ch3c o oo play a major role the activation of paa mainly originates from the fe2 leached from pyrite and the fe ii sites on pyrite surface the electron donating sulfur species on pyrite surface can enhance the reduction from fe iii to fe ii in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phase resulting in the efficient paa activation and concomitant tc abatement the complexation of fe2 with tc in homogeneous solution promotes the electron donating capacity of fe2 towards paa five possible tc degradation pathways are proposed based on the identified degradation intermediates solution ph exerts a significant influence on the abatement rate of tc owing to the leaching of fe2 and the speciation of paa and tc the presence of inorganic ions cl hco3 and hpo4 2 exhibits almost negligible influence on tc abatement whereas ha exerts slightly inhibitory effect owing to its scavenging effect on reactive radicals the contribution of the s2 2 s5 2 s8 0 multivalent sulfur to the reduction transformation from fe iii to fe ii in the paa activation process endows that pyrite has significant advantages of increasing the overall efficiency of paa activation and reducing the required doses of paa and the activator in summary the pyrite

15696,recently iron based heterogenous catalysts have received much attention in the activation of peracetic acid paa for generating reactive radicals to degrade organic pollutants yet the paa activation efficiency is compromised by the slow transformation from fe iii to fe ii herein considering the electron donating ability of reducing sulfur species a novel advanced oxidation process by combining pyrite and paa simplified as pyrite paa for the abatement of tetracycline tc is proposed in this study in the pyrite paa process tc can be completely removed within 30 min under neutral conditions by the synergy of homogeneous and heterogenous fe ii species ch3c o oo is the main radical generated from the pyrite paa process responsible for tc abatement the excellent activation properties of pyrite can be attributed to the superior electron donating ability of reducing sulfur species to facilitate the reduction of fe iii meanwhile the complexation of leached fe2 with tc favors paa activation and concomitant tc abatement in addition the degradation pathways of tc and the toxicity of the degradation intermediates are analyzed the pyrite paa process shows an excellent tc abatement efficacy in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 the coexistence of cl hco3 and hpo4 2 exhibits negligible effect on tc abatement while the ha slightly inhibits the abatement rate of tc this study highlights the efficient activation of paa by pyrite and the important role of sulfur in promoting the conversion of fe iii to fe ii in the pyrite paa process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pyrite peracetic acid tetracycline activation dft calculation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction peracetic acid ch3c o ooh paa as a peroxyacid oxidant has been widely used for disinfection and oxidation in food processing aquaculture and other industries liu et al 2017 compared with the traditional chlorine disinfectants application of paa exhibits great advantages with little formation of toxic byproducts such as halogenated compounds acetaldehyde and nitrosamines dell erba et al 2007 considering the high redox potential 1 8 ev of paa some special organic pollutants can be removed by the paa alone chen et al 2022 zhang et al 2017 for example β lactams antibiotics can be oxidized by paa with the apparent second order rate constants k app of 15 56 44 38 m 1 s 1 zhang et al 2017 this provides a broad prospect for the practical application of paa in the water and wastewater treatment however the high selectivity of paa greatly results in the ineffectiveness in the abatement of various organic pollutants recently activation of paa to produce strong oxidizing radicals for the degradation of organic micropollutants has attracted extensive interest in the advanced oxidation processes aops kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b previous studies have confirmed that organic carbon radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and hydroxyl radicals oh can be produced by activation of paa with various methods e g heat wang et al 2020a uv chen et al 2019 and transition metal ions kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 among these methods transition metal activation is widely studied because of its simplicity and high efficiency paa activation with homogeneous transition metal ions including fe2 co2 cu2 mn2 has been previously reported kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 luukkonen et al 2015 rothbart et al 2012 among these various activators fe2 is a good candidate because of its environmental friendliness and good activation performance for example kim et al has demonstrated that the micropollutants can be degraded in the fe2 paa process with the k app in the range of 1 10 105 to 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 at ph 3 0 8 1 however the slow conversion from fe3 to fe2 with the k app of 2 72 m 1 s 1 greatly limits the paa activation efficiency kim et al 2019 at the same time the addition of high concentrations of fe2 can also quench free radicals thereby reducing the effectiveness of pollutant removal xiao et al 2020 therefore iron based heterogeneous catalysts can be an alternative to address the above problems heterogeneous iron based catalysts can not only reduce the quenching effect on radicals and the potential environmental risk but also facilitate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii via the reducing substances on their surfaces for example zhang et al studied the activation of paa by nano zero valent iron in which the released fe2 from nano zero valent iron mainly contributed to the activation process and the reductive fe0 was favorable for the conversion from fe iii to fe ii zhang et al 2022 wang et al also found that activation of paa by nano zero valent iron under uv irradiation and multiple reuse of nano zero valent iron exerted no effect on the removal of pollutants which was mainly because of the reduction of fe iii by uv and fe0 on the surface of nano zero valent iron wang et al 2021b however one major challenge for the application of nano zero valent iron in the paa activation is that the passivation of nano zero valent iron on the surface inhibits the transformation of fe iii to fe ii thereby greatly limiting the activation of paa under neutral and alkaline conditions recently the reductive sulfur species have been introduced into iron based catalysts to enhance the conversion of fe iii to fe ii for instance yang et al found that sulfur conversion product h2s due to the significant iron and sulfur leaching from fes promoted fe ii regeneration yang et al 2022b compared with fes pyrite as the typical iron rich sulfur bearing mineral is advantageous owing to its recyclability and stability in the aops zhou et al 2018 based on the above assumptions pyrite can be expected to achieve efficient activation of paa regarding the efficient activation of paa by iron and the important role of reducing sulfur species for the reduction of fe iii tetracycline tc is widely used as an antibiotic and frequently detected in the wastewater treatment effluents 2 2 mg l groundwater 0 1 µg l and surface water 4 5 µg l xu et al 2020 due to its potential threat to the ecosystem and human health tc is selected as a model pollutant in this study the objectives of this work are i to evaluate the feasibility of the pyrite paa process towards tc abatement and distinguish the homogeneous and heterogeneous contribution to tc abatement ii to determine the reactive radicals contributing to tc abatement and validate their generation pathways iii to elucidate the paa activation mechanism with pyrite especially the synergy between homogeneous and heterogeneous phase iv to identify the degradation intermediates and degradation pathways for tc abatement and elucidate the toxicity of the degradation products v to analyze the effect of various factors on tc abatement and evaluate the application potential of the pyrite paa process in the treatment of real waters 2 materials and methods

feasibility of paa activation with pyrite for tc abatement fig 1 a displays tc abatement as a function of time in different processes there is a negligible tc adsorption by pyrite tc abatement efficiency in the pyrite h2o2 process and the pyrite paa process is 22 5 and 100 respectively in contrast h2o2 or paa oxidation leads to 10 0 and 25 4 of tc abatement suggesting the inconsequential contribution of h2o2 or paa oxidation to tc abatement in the pyrite paa process in addition the pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the pyrite h2o2 paa oxidation and pyrite paa processes are 0 00615 0 00744 and 0 123 min 1 respectively fig s1 therefore the feasibility of paa activation with pyrite for tc abatement can be validated due to the coexistence of h2o2 in the paa solution the influence of h2o2 with different concentrations on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is further explored as shown in fig 1 b as the concentration of h2o2 increases from 100 µm to 300 µm tc abatement trend exhibits insignificant variation meanwhile the presence of h2o2 with different concentrations exerts inappreciable effect on the paa decay fig s2 the aforementioned results indicate that the contribution of coexisting h2o2 is of minor consequence in the activation of paa with pyrite previous studies have shown that paa has a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy 0 25 ev compared to that of h2o2 0 57 ev da silva et al 2020 kim et al 2019 regarding that fe ii is commonly considered as the reactive species in the pyrite surface he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the activation energy ea for the reaction between fe2 and paa or h2o2 is calculated based on dft calculation text s4 reaction of paa with fe2 possesses much lower activation energy than that of h2o2 eqs 1

radicals he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 therefore the leached fe2 and total fe concentration in the pyrite paa process is monitored as shown in fig 1 c the concentrations of fe2 and total fe are 2 7 and 2 8 µm respectively given the significant leaching of fe2 from pyrite the activation of paa with pyrite may occur in two ways i pyrite directly activates paa via a heterogeneous process ii fe2 is leached form pyrite and indirectly activates paa via a homogeneous process in the previous studies 2 2 bipyridine bpy was used to chelate fe ii on the catalyst surface and the solution blocking the transfer of electrons to the oxidant li et al 2021 yang et al 2022b the effect of bpy on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is studied as shown in fig 1 d the tc abatement is completely inhibited in the presence of bpy 1 10 phenanthroline is a representative strong complexing agent for nitrogen ligands which can form stable complexes with fe2 as shown in fig s3 1 10 phenanthroline with various concentrations does not completely inhibit the tc abatement this is because the strong planarity of 1 10 phenanthroline makes it difficult to chelate with fe ii sites while the planarity of bpy is weaker than 1 10 phenanthroline and can chelate with surface fe ii text s5 therefore 1 10 phenanthroline is chosen to verify the heterogeneous and homogeneous contribution to tc abatement because it can form stable chelates with fe2 without chelating with the fe ii on the pyrite surface thereby inhibiting activation of paa with fe2 in the homogeneous process as shown in fig 1 d the presence of 1 10 phenanthroline exerts an inhibitory effect on tc abatement therefore according to the k obs fig s4 a tc abatement is originated from three parts including the direct paa oxidation 0 00744 min 1 the heterogeneous contribution 0 0320 min 1 and the homogeneous contribution 0 0841 min 1 fig s4 b 3 2 removal mechanism of tc in the pyrite paa process 3 2 1 roles of radicals during tc removal in the paa based aops the radicals mainly include oh ch3c o oo ch3c o o and ch3 kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 in order to distinguish the contribution of the aforementioned radicals to tc abatement the effect of different radical scavengers such as tert butanol tba methanol meoh and 2 4 hexadiene 2 4 hd on tc abatement is studied the presence of these scavengers does not inhibit the activation of paa by pyrite fig s5 as shown in fig 2 a after the addition of tba meoh and 2 4 hd tc abatement is inhibited by 3 4 4 1 and 74 6 respectively correspondingly the k obs of tc abatement is 0 109 0 103 and 0 0109 min 1 fig s6 and fig 2 b respectively tba is a typical scavenger for oh with the k app of 6 0 108 m 1s 1 while meoh is an effective bursting agent for oh and so4 with the k app of 2 5 107 and 9 7 108 m 1s 1 respectively peng et al 2022a wu et al 2022a although the previous study has indicated the production of so4 from pyrite zhou et al 2018 the negligible difference between tba and meoh in the tc abatement indicates the minor contribution of so4 the significant inhibitory effect of 2 4 hd on tc abatement can be explained as the scavenging effect of acetyl per oxygen radicals simplified as r c by 2 4 hd with the k app of 9 2 108 m 1s 1 kim et al 2020 therefore for the pyrite paa process the k obs of tc abatement in k paa k oh and k r c are 0 00710 0 0200 and 0 0959 min 1 respectively fig 2 b to further confirm the formation of r c a stable nitro radical tempo is employed as a radical probe for the identification of co3c o o and ch3 barton et al 1998 as shown in fig s7 a the ch3c o o tempo signal m z 216 1598 and rt at 1 239 min is observed in the lc ms spectra which evidences the generation of ch3c o o in addition the signal of ch3 tempo m z 172 1701 and rt at 0 826 min fig s7 b suggests the generation of ch3 by decarboxylation of co3c o o eq 4 rokhina et al 2010 considering that the ch3c o oo can release oxygen via eqs 5 6 wang et al 2020b the amount of released oxygen is measured as shown in fig s7 c the released oxygen decreases from 2 87 to 1 93 mg l with the increase of the tc concentrations from 0 to 25 µm suggesting the contribution of ch3c o oo co3c o o undergoes self decomposition via eqs 4 and 7 with rate constants of 2 3 105 s 1 and 1 0 109 m 1s 1 which easily outcompetes its reaction with the target contaminant wang et al 2020b in terms of ch3 generated from co3c o o decomposition eq 4 it can be further transformed to ch3oo by oxygen with the rate constant of 4 1 109 m 1s 1 eq 8 wang et al 2020b although ch3oo may be present in the pyrite paa process its contribution to the tc abatement can be neglected due to its weak oxidation capacity for organic pollutants wang et al 2020b therefore given that ch3c o oo is the strongest of the organic carbon radicals and the significant reduction of oxygen release neta et al 1990 the main radical responsible for the abatement of tc is ch3c o oo 4 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 5 2 c h 3 c o oo o 2 products 6 c h 3 c o oo o 2 c h 3 c o o o o 2 7 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o o 2 8 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 oo 3 2 2 identification of the active sites it is well known that surface fe ii sites are the main active sites in the activation process of iron heterogeneous catalysts for precursor salts peng et al 2022b zhou et al 2018 meanwhile the involvement of sulfur species also plays an important role for the activation of paa by metal sulfides wang et al 2021a in order to study the possible transformation of fe ii and sulfur on the pyrite surface the variation of chemical valence of iron and sulfur species before and after use is studied by xps as shown in the fig s8 a and fig s8 b fe s and o are the main elements on pyrite surface according to the fe 2p spectra of the fresh pyrite two pairs of peaks are observed fig 3 a the first pair of peaks at 706 7 and 719 5 ev and the second pair at 710 2 and 722 7 ev could be ascribed to fe ii and fe iii respectively zhou et al 2018 the proportion of fe ii and fe iii are 65 and 35 of the total fe on pyrite surface table 1 the fe 2p spectra of the used pyrite exhibits identical peaks as the fresh pyrite with fe ii and fe iii accounting for 58 and 42 respectively it is obvious that the peak intensity of fe ii is significantly lower for the used pyrite indicating the conversion from fe ii to fe iii during the paa activation with regard to the involvement of sulfur species s 2p spectra of fresh pyrite displays two peaks at 162 3 and 163 6 ev which can be ascribed to s2 2 and s8 0 respectively fig 3 b after activation of paa with pyrite an emergence of a peak at 162 2 ev ascribed to s5 2 is observed he et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the decrease of the proportion of s2 2 and the increase of s8 0 s5 2 indicate the oxidation of the reducing sulfur species table 1 considering the efficient activation of fe ii for paa and the difficulty of regeneration of fe ii the electron donating s2 2 can facilitate the conversion of fe iii to fe ii and the subsequent rapid activation of paa the morphology and elemental distribution for the pristine and used pyrite are illustrated via sem eds as shown in fig s9 a j the elements including fe s and o are uniformly distributed on the pyrite surface the irregular shape of pyrite particles and their morphology exhibit no significant variation before and after reaction the tem images fig s10 clearly show that the surface of pyrite particles is dominated by 100 crystal plane therefore the 100 crystal plane of pyrite is used as the main reactive crystal plane with paa in order to further clarify the role of different sites fe and s sites on pyrite surface in paa activation dft simulation is performed to calculate the adsorption and activation of paa on the 100 lattice plane of pyrite surface as shown in fig 3 c d and table s1 the fe o bond length and the s o bond length of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site and s i site are 2 150 and 3 369 å respectively the shorter bond length for the adsorption of paa on the fe ii site means the favorable chemisorption which facilitates the electron transfer between paa and pyrite meanwhile the o o bond length of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site and s i site are 1 477 and 1 468 å indicating the lower energy required to breakage of o o bond of paa at the fe ii site especially the adsorption energies eads between paa and the fe ii site or s i site is calculated to be 0 65 and 0 37 ev demonstrating the preferential adsorption and corresponding activation of paa on the fe ii site of pyrite in addition the bader charge analysis of paa adsorbed on the fe ii site reveals that 0 09 electrons are transferred from fe ii with no electron transfer from s i table s2 for the paa adsorption on the s i site there are 0 014 and 0 009 electrons transferred from fe ii and s i respectively the more electrons transferred by paa adsorption on fe ii site can also prove the preferable electron transfer therefore in the heterogeneous pyrite paa process the fe ii sites are the main active sites of paa activation 3 2 3 contribution of homogeneous fe2 to paa activation as mentioned earlier there is a significant amount of leaching fe2 2 7 µm in the pyrite paa process according to the previous study fe2 can promote the decomposition of paa leading to the abatement of organic pollutants kim et al 2019 to analyze the contribution of homogeneous fe2 paa decay in the fe2 paa process is studied in the presence or absence of tc fig s11 the decay rate of paa in the presence of tc is higher than that in the absence of tc this enhanced effect by tc suggests that the complexation of fe2 with tc simplified as fe2 tc can promote the paa activation which is consistent with our previous study zhang et al 2022 the speciation of fe2 as a function of tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes is calculated by the eqs 9 11 9 f e 2 f e 2 free f e 2 tc 10 tc t c free f e 2 tc 11 k f e 2 tc f e 2 tc fe free 2 t c free where fe2 is the total fe2 concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes fe2 free is the free fe2 concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes fe2 tc is the concentration of fe2 complexes with tc in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes tc is the total tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes tcfree is the free tc concentration in the fe2 paa and pyrite paa processes the k f e 2 tc is the complexation stability constant of tc with fe2 5 3 dodgson et al 1956 in the homogeneous fe2 paa process 3 µm fe2 is chosen for analysis of the speciation in the heterogeneous pyrite paa process the leached fe2 concentration from pyrite increases as the tc concentration decreases and the speciation of fe2 as a function of tc concentration in these two processes is simulated in fig s12 a and fig s12 b it is obvious that the fe2 tc complexes play a key role in the paa activation and tc abatement as shown in fig s13 a the ring structure of the tc molecule is labeled from right to left as a b c and d previous studies have shown that there are two possible complexation ways of fe2 with tc wang et al 2015 yang et al 2022a the first way refers to the complexation with the dimethyl n and hydroxyl o structures in the a ring fig s13 b yang et al 2022a and the second one refers to the complexation with amido o and hydroxyl o structures in the a ring fig s13 c wang et al 2015 to shed light on the enhanced mechanism by tc from the theoretical perspective dft calculations are performed to simulate the complexation process between tc molecules and fe2 and obtain the binding energy of fe2 with tc at different complexation sites fig s14 according to the binding energies of the above two structures of the complexes it is obvious that the complexation of fe2 with tc is more preferable than h2o the discrepancy for the binding energies of fe2 with the different sites suggests the complexation of the dimethyl n and hydroxyl o is more likely to occur fig 4 a d displays the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and lumo energy of fe2 and fe2 tc to analyze the electron donating property the homo energy of fe2 and fe2 tc are 7 21 and 5 26 ev suggesting that complexation of fe2 with tc gives electrons more easily than fe2 and activates paa efficiently to produce free radicals meanwhile the homo lumo gap of tc before and after complexation is 4 44 and 3 37 ev respectively fig 4 c and d the smaller gap after complexation means that fe2 tc can be more easily degraded this result can also be proved by the electrostatic potential esp before and after complexation as shown in fig 4 e and f the complexation of fe2 significantly affects the electron distribution of tc which can be more easily oxidized by the radicals cai et al 2022 yin et al 2021 these results indicate that the complexation alters the charge distribution of fe2 and tc thus conferring them higher reactivity 3 2 4 the important role of s2 2 previous studies have indicated that the involvement of sulfur species of metal sulfides plays an important role in the activation of the precursor salts wu et al 2022a zhou et al 2018 in the aforementioned xps analysis s2 2 can be transformed into other sulfur species during the paa activation process since the standard reduction potential of sulfur s2 2 s0 0 48 v is much lower than that of iron fe iii fe ii 0 77 v speight 2005 the regeneration of fe ii by s2 2 is thermodynamically favorable in the pyrite surface to further understand the involvement of the sulfur species tem eds and ic analysis are conducted to evaluate the variation of sulfur on the catalyst surface and in the solution as shown in fig s15 a and fig s15 b a significant decrease in the intensity of the sulfur peak could be found in the eds spectra of pyrite before and after reaction therefore it can be assumed that there is a conversion of surface sulfur to hydrophilic sulfur species eg so4 2 according to the results of ic in fig s16 it could be found that so4 2 has been produced during the reaction process regarding that the existing form of leached iron is fe2 fig 1 c it can be speculated that the reducing sulfur species may contribute to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 due to that the negligible reaction between h2o2 and fe3 with the k app of 1 0 10 2 m 1s 1 kim et al 2019 to investigate the underlying mechanism different concentrations of fe3 are added to the pyrite paa process as shown in fig 5 a tc abatement is significant enhanced by the addition of fe3 to the pyrite paa process when the fe3 concentration increases from 0 to 50 µm the k obs of tc abatement increases from 0 123 to 0 348 min 1 fig s17 considering the paa activation by fe3 kim et al 2019 tc abatement in the fe3 paa process is also explored as shown in fig s18 tc abatement is slightly enhanced in the fe3 paa process with the increase of k obs from 0 00850 to 0 0257 min 1 in order to evaluate the contribution of fe3 to tc abatement in the pyrite paa process several kinetic rate constants are defined according to eqs 12 14 12 k pyrite k pyrite paa k paa 13 k f e 3 k f e 3 paa k paa 14 k f e 3 pyrite k f e 3 pyrite paa k f e 3 k pyrite k paa where k paa min 1 is tc abatement rate constant in the single paa oxidation process k f e 3 paa k pyrite paa and k f e 3 pyrite paa min 1 are tc abatement rate constant in the fe3 paa pyrite paa and fe3 pyrite paa processes respectively k f e 3 and k pyrite min 1 are the contribution of fe3 and pyrite to tc abatement rate constant for the fe3 paa and pyrite paa processes respectively and k f e 3 pyrite min 1 is the contribution of fe3 to tc abatement rate constant in the fe3 pyrite paa process the k f e 3 pyrite is significantly increased from 0 0148 to 0 225 min 1 when the fe3 concentration ranges from 5 to 50 µm fig 5 b considering the positive charge of fe3 the zeta potential of pyrite is determined fig s19 the isoelectric point of pyrite is around 2 8 under the experimental conditions the surface of pyrite is negatively charged which is favorable for the adsorption of fe3 on pyrite surface and thus facilitates the reduction of fe3 to fe ii by s2 2 to test the adsorption of fe3 by pyrite the variation of fe3 concentration during the abatement of tc in the fe3 pyrite paa process is measured as shown in fig s20 a rapid decrease of the fe3 concentration is observed the electrostatic attraction between pyrite and fe3 makes it easy for fe3 to adsorb on the pyrite surface and then be reduced by the sulfur species on the surface which can explain the negligible discrepancy for the concentration of fe2 and total fe in the pyrite paa process fig 1 c dft calculations are performed to simulate the adsorption of fe3 at the s i site on pyrite and the differential charge density can be obtained as shown in fig s21 it can be clearly observed that electrons are transferred from the pyrite surface to the fe3 these results suggest that the electron donating s2 2 can regenerate fe ii via adsorption of fe3 on pyrite surface in the pyrite paa process as suggested in earlier literature metal sulfide possesses the surface sulfur vacancies which can expose more active sites for activation of oxidants wu et al 2022a with regard to pyrite a significant epr signal is also observed at g 2 0 fig 5 c which is attributed to sulfur vacancies on pyrite surface as a result a large number of iron active sites is exposed owing to sulfur vacancies facilitating the interaction between the iron active sites and paa to test this point a sulfur is removed from the adsorption site near iron to create sulfur vacancies fig s22 and the adsorption and activation of paa on the 100 lattice planes of pyrite surface are calculated by dft as shown in fig 5 d the bond length of the fe o bond at the fe ii site after paa adsorption decreases from 2 105 to 2 028 å after introduction of the sulfur vacancy making the chemisorption of paa with fe ii site stronger meanwhile the o o bond length increases from 1 477 to 1 481 å indicating that the energy required for the o o bond breakage is lower than that in the absence of sulfur vacancies in addition the eads of 0 97 ev confirms that the presence of sulfur vacancies in pyrite is more favorable for the adsorption and activation of paa table s1 at the same time the presence of the sulfur vacancy leads to an increase of number of electrons transfer from 0 09 to 0 10 for the paa adsorption at the fe ii site table s2 in summary it can be concluded that the presence of sulfur vacancy on pyrite surface is more favorable for paa activation process on the basis of the aforementioned analysis the mechanism of tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is proposed as shown in fig 6 on the one hand pyrite in aqueous solution dissolves fe2 to activate paa to generate ch3c o oo and fe3 the generated fe3 is easily attracted to the negatively charged pyrite and thus is reduced to fe ii by the sulfur species on the other hand paa is adsorbed by the surface fe ii sites of pyrite followed by the electron transfer to generate ch3c o oo and surface fe iii and surface fe iii can also be reduced to fe ii by the sulfur species meanwhile the complexation of fe2 with tc makes fe2 more susceptible to electron transfer with paa and induces tc more susceptible to abatement by radical attack overall the transformation of surface sulfur species from s2 2 to s5 2 s8 0 to hydrophilic so4 2 is important for the reduction of homogeneous fe3 and heterogeneous fe iii 3 2 5 tc degradation pathways and toxicity analysis total organic carbon toc can reflect the mineralization of organic pollutants in the aops as shown in fig s23 the toc is removed by 21 in the pyrite paa process confirming that the partial mineralization of tc and the presence of the degradation intermediates therefore the degradation pathways of tc are investigated using dft calculations and uplc qtof ms analysis considering the elevated reactivity of tc after complexation with fe2 the fukui function for the tc and tc fe2 is shown in the table s3 and table s4 and the atomic numbers of tc and fe2 tc are shown in fig s24 and fig s25 according to the fukui function a high value of f means the tendency of an atom by nucleophilic attack a high value of f suggests the tendency by electrophilic attack and a high value of f0 indicates the tendency by radical attack pino rios et al 2017 the intermediates of tc degradation are identified by uplc qtof ms as shown in fig s26 fig s27 and table s5 based on the detected intermediates and the fukui function the degradation pathway of tc is proposed as shown in fig 7 in pathway i the p 435 is the product of tc after the loss n methyl addition of hydroxyl group and hydrogen tc and fe2 tc in 28 n position of with a f0 value of 0 001 and 0 0209 indicates that the complexation makes the demethylation reactions more likely to occur p 419 is formed as a result of the dihydroxylation of p 435 since the c n bond on the a ring is vulnerable to attack by radicals denitrogenation leads to the formation of p 407 cao et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in pathway ii the loss of the hydroxyl group at the c7 position results in the formation of p 429 which is subsequently converted to p 364 by the ring opening reaction of the a ring and the removal of the amino in 25 n position hydroxyl and methyl groups in 28 n position p 280 is formed from p 364 by ring opening loss of hydroxyl group and oxygen wu et al 2022b in pathway iii the double bond with the c14 position is broken with hydroxyl addition to form p 461 1 subsequently the double bond at position c16 undergoes hydroxylation to form p 477 p 442 is generated by the loss of nh3 and h2o from p 477 cao et al 2019 in pathway iv the product p 397 is formed by the breakage of the double bond at c9 position demethylation at 28 n position deamination at 25 n position 17c position are attacked by radicals for demethylation and c9 position is dehydroxylated to form p 340 p 235 is formed by dihydroxylation c n bond breakage and ring opening reaction zhu et al 2022 finally the aforementioned intermediates from the above pathway are destroyed by radicals attack and are successively oxidized to form p 114 1 2 3 4 cao et al 2019 liu et al 2022a wu et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 in pathway v c10 position with f0 of 0 0715 and 0 0641 are more susceptible to ring opening reactions by radicals attack to form p 461 2 which can be further oxidized to p 283 and p 165 liu et al 2022b the toxicity of tc and its intermediates evaluated by toxicity estimation software tool based on quantitative structure activity relationship is shown in table s6 and fig s28 four parameters of toxicity including oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity are selected for evaluation in addition four toxicity classes of highly toxic ld50 1000 lc50 1 toxic 1000 ld50 2000 1 lc50 10 harmful 2000 ld50 3000 10 lc50 100 and lowly toxic ld50 3000 lc50 100 for oral rat ld50 and fathead minnow two development toxicities of toxicant and non toxicant two mutagenic properties of positive and negative are specified cai et al 2021 ji et al 2020 the toxicity of tc abatement intermediates gradually decreases with decreasing molecular weight specifically tc p 436 p 429 p 461 and p 477 are highly toxic or toxic toxicant and positive for oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity respectively as the reaction proceeds the final products p 281 p 165 and p 114 are harmful or lowly toxic non toxicant and negative for oral rat ld50 fathead minnow lc50 96 h development toxicity and mutagenicity respectively the reduction in the toxicity of the degradation intermediates proves that degradation of tc in the pyrite paa process exhibits a decrease of the environmental hazard 3 3 effect of various parameters on the tc abatement in the pyrite paa process 3 3 1 effect of solution ph the effect of solution ph on the tc abatement in the pyrite paa process is shown in fig 8 a when the solution ph ranges from 4 0 to 10 0 the tc abatement efficiency can be as high as 100 tc abatement follows the pseudo first order kinetics with k obs increasing from 0 0889 to 0 896 min 1 fig s29 a considering the oxidative nature of paa the tc abatement at different ph conditions is also measured by the single paa oxidation process as shown in fig s29 c it is observed that solution ph can greatly affect the tc abatement rate in the pyrite paa process direct oxidation of tc by paa contributes little to the tc abatement rate for all ph conditions fig 8 a weakly basic ph conditions are more favorable for tc abatement than weakly acidic and basic ph conditions multiple factors are involved in the effect of solution ph on tc abatement firstly solution ph can affect the leaching and hydrolysis of iron the concentration of total fe ions in the solution is about 4 8 µm at ph 4 0 and about 2 8 µm at ph 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig s30 a it can be found that there are more leached fe ions under acidic conditions which can explain the higher k obs of tc abatement meanwhile the leached fe can promote the decay of paa which is faster at ph 4 0 than 7 0 fig s29 b however at neutral and alkaline conditions the leached fe is approximately the same and its effect on tc abatement can be neglected for the hydrolysis of fe2 the distribution of fe2 species as a function of ph is simulated as shown in fig s30 d in the ph range of 4 8 5 fe2 is the predominant form present and is able to activate paa to produce radicals for the tc abatement as the ph increased from 8 5 to 10 the content of hydroxyl iron increases while fe2 is easily oxidized to fe3 kim et al 2019 secondly solution ph can affect the species distribution of paa fig s30 b regarding the existing form of paa as paa paa pka of 8 2 eq 15 the protonated species paa is predominant at ph 8 2 while the proportion of paa increases rapidly with increasing ph paa decays more rapidly at ph 10 0 fig s29 b and fig s29 e indicating the favorable decomposition of paa under alkaline conditions at ph 10 0 paa exists mainly in the deprotonated form of paa which can rapidly self decay and be consumed by h2o2 through nucleophilic substitution eqs 16 17 wang et al 2020b thus the reduction of tc abatement under alkaline conditions can be adequately explained by the consumption of paa thirdly solution ph can affect the species distribution of tc fig s30 c and fig s30 e according to a previous study the reactivity of tc with free radicals increases with increasing ph which corresponds to a higher electron density in the ring structure of tc and tc2 than in tc chen et al 2017 meanwhile the strongly protonated tc molecule at low ph is not conducive to the complexation of fe2 while the deprotonated tc at high ph facilitates the generation of fe2 tc complexes which in turn promotes the paa activation and tc abatement chen et al 2016 therefore the elevated reactivity of tc at higher ph conditions facilitates its abatement 15 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o pka 8 2 16 c h 3 c o o

the pyrite paa process after 30 min of reaction 88 of tc is removed for the pyrite dose of 0 05 g l and 100 of tc abatement is achieved for the pyrite doses greater than 0 1 g l the corresponding k obs for tc abatement rises from 0 0748 to 0 170 min 1 fig s31 a and fig 8 b this result is ascribed to that the increase of pyrite dose can lead to the increase of the reactive site and leached fe2 fig s31 b fig 8 c and fig 8 d display the effect of paa dose and tc concentration on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process an increase of paa dose from 20 to 100 µm results in the significant increase of k obs of tc abatement from 0 0203 to 0 827 min 1 fig s31 c and fig 8 c which is due to the generation of more radicals in terms of the effect of tc concentration tc with lower concentration can be completely degraded as the tc concentration increases to 20 µm the k obs decreases from 0 160 to 0 0769 min 1 fig s31 d and fig 8 d this is because the rate of reactive radical production is not sufficient for rapid tc abatement 3 3 3 effect of the coexisting anions humic acid and different water matrixes fig 9 a shows the effect of cl on tc abatement in the pyrite paa process when the concentration of cl is from 0 to 8 mm the tc removal efficiency is almost 100 with k obs of 0 123 min 1 fig s32 a and fig 9 a therefore the presence of cl exerts no effect on tc abatement in despite of the scavenging effect of ch3c o oo by cl chen et al 2019 the produced chlorine radicals can also react with tc which can explain the unaltered tc abatement in the presence of cl fig 9 b and c depict the effect of hpo4 2 and hco3 on tc abatement the abatement efficiency of tc is approximately 95 with the k obs of tc ranging from 0 123 to 0 0958 min 1 and 0 123 to 0 0981 min 1 for hpo4 2 and hco3 respectively fig s32 b fig s32 c fig 9 b and fig 9 c the negligible effect of hpo4 2 and hco3 can be due to their lower reactivity with organic carbon radicals chen et al 2019 fig 9 d illustrates the effect of ha on tc abatement the tc abatement efficiency decreases from 100 to 80 with the k obs decreasing from 0 123 to 0 0597 min 1 fig s32 d and fig 9 d this may be due to that the reaction of ha with radicals can inhibit the abatement of tc wang et al 2020b to test the effectiveness of the pyrite paa process in real water bodies tc removal in different water matrices ultrapure water uw distilled water dw tap water tw surface water sw and municipal wastewater effluent mw is investigated fig s33 the water quality parameters of real water samples are shown in table s7 tc abatement can reach more than 95 in all water matrices thus the application prospects of the pyrite paa process in treatment of waters contaminated by organics can be demonstrated 3 3 4 effect of recycling times of pyrite and applicability in the pyrite paa process recyclability and stability are critical to evaluate the application potential of heterogeneous catalysts as shown in fig s34 although the k obs decreases from 0 123 to 0 0792 min 1 the removal efficiency of tc can still reach more than 90 after three recycles the crystal structure and elemental bonding of pyrite before and after use are conducted to explain by xrd and ftir measurements as shown in fig s35 a xrd patterns show typical diffraction peaks for the pristine and used pyrite jcpds no 42 1340 suggesting the crystal stability of pyrite in terms of the ftir spectra fig s35 b the band at the wavelength of 500 cm 1 belongs to the feo6 coordination octahedron the band at 1000 cm 1 attributes to the vibration of so4 2 and the band at 1250 cm 1 ascribes to the h o h deformation these characteristic groups are considered to be the main components from the surface passivation of pyrite probably due to the oxidation of pyrite during pretreatment mandal et al 2017 after reaction there is no variation in the characteristic bond of pyrite meanwhile the abatement of various organic contaminants including chlortetracycline ctc oxytetracycline otc ampicillin amp cefalexin cfx sulfamethoxazole smx bisphenol a bpa in the pyrite paa process is also evaluated as shown in fig s36 in the pyrite paa process the removal efficiency of various organic pollutants can reach more than 85 based on the above analysis the good stability of pyrite and applicability of pyrite paa process provide a broad prospect for its practical application 4 conclusions activation of paa with pyrite can achieve efficient tc abatement under acidic to alkaline conditions in which ch3c o oo play a major role the activation of paa mainly originates from the fe2 leached from pyrite and the fe ii sites on pyrite surface the electron donating sulfur species on pyrite surface can enhance the reduction from fe iii to fe ii in the homogeneous and heterogeneous phase resulting in the efficient paa activation and concomitant tc abatement the complexation of fe2 with tc in homogeneous solution promotes the electron donating capacity of fe2 towards paa five possible tc degradation pathways are proposed based on the identified degradation intermediates solution ph exerts a significant influence on the abatement rate of tc owing to the leaching of fe2 and the speciation of paa and tc the presence of inorganic ions cl hco3 and hpo4 2 exhibits almost negligible influence on tc abatement whereas ha exerts slightly inhibitory effect owing to its scavenging effect on reactive radicals the contribution of the s2 2 s5 2 s8 0 multivalent sulfur to the reduction transformation from fe iii to fe ii in the paa activation process endows that pyrite has significant advantages of increasing the overall efficiency of paa activation and reducing the required doses of paa and the activator in summary the pyrite

15697,recent research underpinned the effectiveness of topological decentralization for urban stormwater networks usns during the planning stage in terms of both capital savings and resilience enhancement however how centralized and decentralized usns structures with various degrees of redundancy i e redundant water flow pathways project resilience under functional and structural failure remains an unresolved issue in this work we present a systemic and generic framework to investigate the impact of adding redundant flow paths on resilience based on three strategies for optimal centralized versus decentralized usns furthermore a tailored graph theory based measure i e eigenvector centrality is proposed to introduce redundant paths to the critical locations of usns the proposed framework is then applied to a real large scale case study the results confirm the critical role of layout decentralization under both functional e g extreme precipitation events and structural failure e g pipe collapse moreover the findings indicate that the implementation of redundant paths could increase resilience performance by up to 8 under functional failure without changing the network s major structural characteristics i e sewer diameters lengths and storage capacity only by leveraging the effective flow redistribution the scheme proposed in this study can be a fruitful initiative for further improving the usns resilience during both planning and rehabilitation stages keywords urban stormwater networks graph theory layout decentralization resilience redundancy 1 introduction urban stormwater networks usns have a focal role within urban water ecosystem in preventing pluvial flooding in urban areas achieving a high level of reliability to minimize the frequency and magnitude of failures is the conventional approach to designing usns david butler et al 2017 this approach has left communities with vulnerable infrastructures to increasing threats such as natural disasters and climate change sweetapple et al 2022 in addition a detailed assessment of planning rehabilitation and management of urban water infrastructures alongside their modeling is often not trivial due to high complexity and interconnection between their components hajibabaei et al 2019 such hurdles are more exacerbated when accounting for the unprecedented impact of climate change combined with ever increasing urbanization butler et al 2014 casal campos et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2022 webber et al 2022 these deviations often manifest themselves in heatwaves flooding and droughts plaguing cities across the globe aghakouchak et al 2014 da silva et al 2022 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 najafi et al 2021 for this reason it is necessary to learn to adapt the infrastructures to mitigate the effects of such exceptional conditions shukla et al 2019 and therefore a paradigm shift from reliability to resilience for urban water infrastructures during all stages including planning operation and rehabilitation is needed sweetapple et al 2022 recent discussions also regard resilience as the core of sustainable development where systems must be resilient to overcome future uncertain threats juan garcia et al 2017 in this context various definitions and interpretations surrounding resilience have been documented in recent literature dong et al 2017 leandro et al 2020 mugume and butler 2017 wang et al 2021 2019 however in this paper we adopt the concept introduced in butler et al 2014 and mugume and butler 2017 wherein resilience is defined as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional loading conditions some literature also divides resilience into two broad categories specified and general resilience sweetapple et al 2022 specified resilience is the resilience of some particular parts of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks whereas general resilience is the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 as it is impossible to predict all potential threats building general resilience in usns to minimize the magnitude and duration of failure when such unexpected threats occur is crucial sweetapple et al 2022 in relation to the threats jeopardizing usns there are two common types of failure 1 functional failure caused by the load alterations on the system and 2 structural failure caused by issues that disrupt the function of single or multiple components of the system mugume et al 2015 the former functional failure is induced by climate change driven precipitation or urbanization increases butler et al 2018 and the latter structural failure is induced by components failure such as sewer blockage pump failure and sensor failure sweetapple et al 2022 thus to build general resilience in usns both functional and structural failures must be considered guptha et al 2021 osheen et al 2022 the first step in achieving an appropriate level of resilient performance is planning and designing of a usn comprising of a proper spatial layout and hydraulic design most studies regarding urban drainage planning have focused on hydraulic design and sewer sizing strategies to achieve optimal solutions afshar and rohani 2012 ahmadi et al 2018 diao 2020 karovic and mays 2014 a few studies have proposed creating optimal topological layouts as the foregoing step among which the most commonly presented methodology adopts the generation of centralized topological layouts duque et al 2020 haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 hsie et al 2019 moeini and afshar 2017 however these reliability based optimization methods often minimize construction design costs and consequently lessen system resilience to overcome this challenge recent research has emphasized the effectiveness of topological decentralization at the planning stage in terms of both capital investment and resilience enhancement bakhshipour et al 2019 björklund et al 2018 eggimann et al 2015 hesarkazzazi et al 2022 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 consequently topological decentralization at the design stage for improving system resilience is paramount which needs to be undertaken first however for existing usns a transition from centralized to decentralized systems in most cases is unattainable or at least too problematic as a consequence we need to consider other alternatives to build resilience in these existing usns despite certain variations and modifications in the literature on resilience promoting attributes within the realm of usns kwon et al 2021 wang et al 2019 we adhere to two broad categories introduced by mugume et al 2015 1 flexibility and 2 redundancy flexibility is defined based on the inherent system s ability to be reconfigured and adjusted to maintain an acceptable performance level under multiple varying loading conditions flexibility can be implemented via distributed decentralized elements such as green blue infrastructures gbis e g implementation of green roofs rain barrels permeable pavements etc across the catchment however redundancy attribute implies having multiple components with similar functions to lessen failure propagation through the entire system redundancy can be enriched in practice by presenting additional storage tanks providing more spare capacity at certain critical locations e g enlarging pipes and adding alternative water flow paths forming loops which last one is the focus of this study to elaborate more on these attributes for instance gbis can play a crucial role in enhancing the resilience of usns in contrast to grey infrastructures gbis are more flexible in terms of installation adaptation bringing multifunctions and co benefits to urban stormwater management sitzenfrei et al 2022 in recent literature the benefits of these kinds of adaptation measures have been widely discussed and accepted bakhshipour et al 2021 bakhshipour et al 2019 haghighatafshar et al 2018 liu et al 2021 oberascher et al 2022 pour et al 2020 wang et al 2022 for example wang et al 2022 proposed a framework for designing hybrid green blue and grey usns considering both technological and operational resilience they defined technological resilience as the system s performance under extreme loads and operational resilience as the performance and long term efficiency of the system after structural damage or degradation mcclymont et al 2020 proposed a resilience driven multi objective optimization model to find the optimal level of the spatial distribution of gbis based on water quality and quantity performance recently smart data driven measures and decentralized real time control options have been frequently introduced and addressed to enhance urban water systems resilience sitzenfrei et al 2022 for instance oberascher et al 2022 implemented smart rainwater harvesting to reduce potable water consumption and improve urban drainage performance and further evaluated the resilience of the integrated system on a large scale implementation these findings show that the most resilience boosting solutions are costly but yet do not guarantee the higher quality of life index values to conclude building resilience through conventional approaches e g by presenting additional storage or enlarging sewers diameter or more sophisticated methods e g gbi and smart control might be effective but expensive besides resilience is often seen as an extra expense or additional effort in urban water systems planning juan garcia et al 2017 moreover introducing components for enhancing resilience to the design retrofit or rehabilitation procedure of usns increases the complexity of the design operation problem exponentially thus instead of a single threat various threats and their combinations must be considered bakhshipour et al 2021 and as mentioned before since it is impossible to predict all potential threats building general resilience in usns is highly recommended sweetapple et al 2022 as usns are often composed of gravity driven pipelines with a tree like structure incorporating loops is not a common practice in these infrastructures this has culminated in a very small body of research reporting the consequences of adopting alternative water flow paths forming loops as a cost effective approach for resilience enhancement in usns since all sewers edges of the base graph must be included in the final design of a usn each of them drains a certain street haghighi 2012 implementing redundant flow paths through this cost effective way to build general resilience may be an efficient adaptation or design measure hereafter alternative redundant water paths or loops are interchangeably referred to as redundancy in light of this some studies proposed frameworks to describe the topological characteristics of drainage networks for example meshness coefficient proposed by reyes silva et al 2020 leverages graph theory based concepts to quantify and compare the networks with various levels of existing redundant paths with tree like and grid like loop shaped networks the drainage density index suggested by lee et al 2018 is also used to evaluate the structure of the drainage pipe network as the ratio of total pipe length to catchment area indicating the degree of pipe network density when it comes to the consequences of adopting redundancy for structural failures yazdi 2018 and zhang et al 2017 explored the influence of redundant sewers on vulnerability and resilience of usns respectively under pipe blockages they reported that the loop shaped structures demonstrate less vulnerable components and higher resilience than tree like ones under such failure type however concerning the implications for functional failure seo et al 2015 applied the gibbs stochastic network model troutman and karlinger 1992 to create and compare the performance of dendritic with fully looped networks they inferred that the shape of the hydrograph and the fully looped system s peak flow are highly correlated with the catchment slope lu et al 2021 explored the impact of dendritic and looped drainage networks in two catchments in china they concluded that the loop shaped network is more likely to reduce peak runoff at the outlet for the purpose of flood risk reduction reyes silva et al 2020 2021 reported that under functional failure loop shaped usns provide a more resilient response e g recording less flood volume and flood damage costs than tree shaped ones hesarkazzazi et al 2020 proposed an innovative approach that leverages complex network analysis to eliminate alternative water paths from upstream and downstream of a fully looped usn to infer resilience variations however certain deficiencies hinder the generalization for example they have resorted to invert elevations of the inlets manholes to determine the removal of sewers from upstream and downstream nonetheless invert elevations may not always yield an accurate indication of upstream downstream because it primarily depends on the network design characteristics finally the impact of the structures possessing loops was addressed in hesarkazzazi et al 2020 at the design stage only meaning that the networks with various numbers of loops were simultaneously designed and then evaluated there also exists an example of how redundant flow paths in looped networks are capable of reducing the frequency and magnitude of combined sewer overflows csos in a catchment in dresden germany reyes silva et al 2020 however the few aforementioned studies did not address the mechanisms by which redundant paths can improve the resilience of different usn structures centralized versus decentralized under both functional and structural failures moreover currently there is no guidance on the optimal placement of redundant paths for maximizing resilience at the design or rehabilitation stages for existing usns to conclude and based on the presented literature review we identified the following research needs developing cost effective and easy to implement methods to build resilience in usns as an alternative to existing expensive approaches such as adding gbis or extra storage capacity developing a computationally efficient framework for including and assessing redundant flow pathways forming loops in optimal planning and or rehabilitation of de centralized usns benchmarking the performance of the proposed methods using real world test cases therefore this study aims to bridge these research gaps whose key contributions are as follows developing a graph theory based and computationally inexpensive method to optimally introduce redundancy by leveraging an effective flow redistribution throughout usns with practical guidelines for implementation in the real world proposing a framework to systematically assess the impact of redundancy on resilience for optimally designed de centralized usns experiencing functional and structural failures applying the proposed methods and frameworks to a large scale real case study to discover the importance of topological decentralization in relation to redundancy the remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 introduces the relevant methodologies and case study utilized in this study section 3 discusses the implications of the developed methodology for functional and structural failures section 4 outlines the limitations advantages and future work and finally section 5 summarizes the key takeaways from this study 2 methods section 2 1 provides an introduction to graph theory analysis and the measures applied in this study sections 2 2 and 2 3 discuss the de centralized layout generation procedure along with their hydraulic design optimization and sections 2 4 2 6 discuss redundancy promoting strategies resilience assessment and suggested case studies respectively 2 1 complex network analysis of usns the usn topology can be mathematically represented and analyzed using graph theory consider a graph g consisting of a set of vertices v e g manholes storage units and outlets interconnected by a set of links or edges e e g conduits weirs and pumps a convenient method to represent graphs is to use an adjacency matrix the adjacency matrix of a graph is matrix a whose entry a i j 1 if there exists an edge i j and a i j 0 otherwise if the directions of the edges are considered in the graph it is referred to as a directed graph in contrast to an undirected graph in addition various weighting functions for the graph edges such as sewer diameters lengths and hydraulic properties can be defined the first graph measure utilized in this study is the shortest path σ i j which is the path between nodes i and j wherein sum of positive edge weights is minimal dijkstra 1959 the shortest path can be determined for directed and undirected graphs during the design layout generating rehabilitation phases see sections 2 2 and 2 4 the shortest path algorithm is applied by considering the euclidean distance between node pairs i e sewer lengths as weighting functions another definition utilized in this study is the node degree degree centrality which indicates the number of edges connected to a node the more connections a node has the higher the importance degree centrality is in directed graphs e g directions based on flow directions or ground elevations the total node degree k i t o t has two components 1 node indegree k i i n representing the number of incoming edges to a node and 2 node outdegree k i o u t representing the number of outgoing edges from a node shown in eq 1 1 k i tot k i in k i out where a i j represents the entries of the adjacency matrix the next measure in this study is the eigenvector centrality utilized for scoring and ranking influential nodes junctions for the introduction of redundant paths eigenvector centrality is a method of generalizing the degree of centrality which premises that a node s importance can increase in the network by having connections to the other nodes which themselves are important the eigenvector centrality of a node is computed by assigning each node a relative score proportional to the sum of the scores of its connections therefore the scores are normalized by the largest eigenvalue of the nodes the eigenvector centrality of a node is attained a large value if the node has many connections and or many important connections bonacich 1972 latora et al 2017 rajagopal et al 2017 to model the usn characteristics we assigned sewer diameters to edge importance weight of the graph this considers the number of adjacent connections to a node and or their importance relative to the sewer diameters therefore it allows the identification of the nodes that directly and indirectly interact and connect to the main collectors of the network with large diameters the nodes are then ranked based on their eigenvector centrality scores to introduce redundancy the higher the ranking the higher the priority given to that node to construct a redundant path see section 2 4 eqs 2 and 3 represent the eigenvector centrality measure 2 λ c i j 1 v a i j c j where i 1 2 v are the nodes λ is the largest eigenvalue of a c i is the eigenvector centrality eigenvalue of node i c j is the eigenvector centrality eigenvalue of other neighboring nodes relative to node i and a i j are the entries of adjacency matrix a of undirected graph in matrix notion eq 2 can be written as follows 3 a c e λ c e where c is an n dimensional column vector eigenvector whose entry is equal to c j an illustrative example of how eigenvalues and eigenvector are calculated using the power method algorithm for a simple graph below is shown in fig 1 note that this procedure is an iterative approach first the adjacency matrix of the graph with pipe diameters as edge weighting function is calculated a then in the first iteration this matrix is multiplied with an initial approximation vector b where we assigned all values to 1 the result is the eigenvector of a in the first iteration c 1 whose largest value λ 1 is selected this value is then used to normalize c 1 yielding the normalized eigenvector in the first iteration c 1 in the second iteration a is multiplied with the calculated c 1 to obtain the eigenvector in the second iteration c 2 again the largest eigenvalue in the second iteration λ 2 is selected to normalize c 2 resulting in c 2 this procedure is continued until all eigenvalues become stable and finally yielding the stable version of eigenvector of a at the end one can normalize the eigenvector values one more time so that the sum of all nodes centrality values is equal to 1 2 2 de centralized layout generator the layout of a usn representing the arrangements and configurations of sewers and junctions manholes along the sewer flow directions has a critical role in achieving an optimal and low cost design bakhshipour et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 given an entirely flat area i e no effective ground slope as well as directions exist at the planning stage the layout generation process is executed over the undirected base graph with sewer lengths as edge weighting function the base initial graph represents the network i e street network of the desired area which contains all possible sewer pipelines all drainage possibilities upon which the layout generation process flow directions determination is initiated the reason why street network is adopted as the initial base graph is the strong correlation between sewer and road networks for instance mair et al 2017 concluded that on average 50 of the street network lengths correlates with 85 of the total sewer network the step by step procedure of decentralized layout generation is illustrated and explained in fig 2 when the location of outlets is defined note that the process described in this figure is derived from a bigger framework explained in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 wherein layout creations for flat as well as steep areas were addressed separately therefore since a flat case study is considered in this study we only selected and explained the relevant methodology for flat regions it should also be noted that when only a centralized solution is required one outlet is assigned a similar procedure outlined in fig 2 for each separated branch subgraph can be applied see steps 3 and 4 this implies that a simple shortest path algorithm from all inlet nodes to the outlet node is performed over the initial undirected base graph with pipe lengths as graph weights to attain the pipe directions then the removed edges pipes during the shortest path execution are added and cut to generate a tree centralized network that contains all the sewers see steps 3 and 4 in fig 2 however assigning a set of pre defined outlets as outlet candidates to the specific locations of base graph e g in the proximity of river stream necessitates the exploration of all possible layout configurations of outlet placements i e different degree of centralization the degree of centralization dc implicitly quantifies how the usn as a whole is distributed hesarkazzazi et al 2022 as outlined in eq 4 this measure builds a logarithmic relationship between the number of selected outlet nodes o n s from a list of possible outlet candidates and total number of inlet nodes in 4 d c 100 1 l o g 10 o n s l o g 10 i n this measure denotes that if all drainage inlet nodes act as outlet nodes dc is computed equal to 0 complete decentralization which is of course unfeasible whereas if only one outlet node is selected among all the outlet candidates dc is computed equal to 100 fully centralization as demonstrated in fig 2 the developed layout generation process herein is a deterministic approach implying that only one unique layout solution is created for each outlet placement scenario hence when a set of pre defined outlet candidates are defined and placed as previously mentioned all possible combinations of outlet placements should be enumerated different dcs this is done to finally uncover the optimal locations and numbers of outlets from that set of pre defined outlet candidates i e finally selecting the optimal network however hydraulically designing all generated layouts to achieve the optimal one culminates in a significantly large computational demand therefore a combinatorial optimization framework i e brute force or exhaustive search with two layout objective functions was used wherein the only decision variable is the number of possible outlet candidates n p o with 2 n p o 1 possible solutions these two layout objective functions aim to pre screen and discard a large number of the generated layouts prior to hydraulic design optimization these layout functions operate based on sewer lengths and runoff areas distribution through the sewers imposed during the layout generation in order to find the networks having the efficient distribution and subsequently minimizing the hydraulic design costs then all the layout solutions lying on the pareto front as a result of interaction of the two layout objective functions are chosen and forwarded to the hydraulic design optimization see section 2 3 to ultimately choose the optimal fully designed network with the smallest design cost further details regarding the layout generation process can be found in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 2 3 hydraulic design optimization as discussed above the layout solutions on the pareto front are all forwarded to hydraulic design optimization this is performed to size the sewers slopes and pump stations while a set of design criteria objectives and constraints are satisfied to achieve this goal the hydraulic design algorithm introduced by haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 was adopted in this study using an adaptive approach the dynamic wave flow equations in the swmm rossman and huber 2016 were used to design all networks the algorithm requires 3np decision variables given np is the number of pipes sewers this includes np discrete variables for sewer sizes np real variables for sewer slopes and np binary 0 1 variables to determine whether there should be a pump station at a sewer upstream furthermore life cycle cost lcc is considered for the design costs of the case study lcc dos santos et al 2021 includes the capital operation and maintenance costs for a 30 year service life as a result the minimization of lcc is set as the only objective function of the hydraulic design optimization framework surcharge has been permitted while no flooding is allowed to occur in the system under design storm event a 2 year block rain event was utilized for the pipe sizing process according to iranian standards and regulations in flat areas layouts that require lift stations are automatically omitted using a penalty function during the optimization in this study as the area is completely flat the minimum allowable slopes from the local manual are allocated to each pipe based on their diameters therefore the problem simplifies to finding the optimum diameter of pipes in the generated layouts to minimize lcc thus in adaptive algorithm only one vector of decision variables p with size np is needed to assign the diameter of pipes using eq 5 as follows 5 d d m i n d m a x d m i n p where d m a x is the largest commercially available size and d m i n is determined with respect to the telescopic pattern the diameter of every pipe must be equal to or greater than that of its upstream pipes which means that 6 d m a x d u where d u contains pipe diameters connected to the upstream end of the pipe at hand within our optimization framework we employed a genetic algorithm as the optimization engine to find the optimal values for decision variables p the other considered constraints included the minimum and maximum cover depths maximum slopes and maximum velocity all of which were chosen based on the regulations and standards for the analyzed city once all the solutions in the pareto front are hydraulically designed the optimal decentralized layout solution is chosen and proceeded to the redundancy deployment process see section 2 4 note that all the centralized configurations having different outlet locations are also hydraulically designed among which the best one with cheapest lcc is selected to compare the characteristics of redundancy between centralized and decentralized optimal layouts further details regarding the hydraulic design optimization framework design constraints and lcc equation can be found in this study s supplementary material 2 4 redundancy promoting strategies once the optimal decentralized network as well as the centralized one were chosen and hydraulically designed we established a framework to build resilience using a specific redundancy attribute i e adding additional water pathways redundant paths this can be performed during the design or rehabilitation stage for existing systems specifically we are interested in how the flow re distribution imposed by different numbers and locations of redundant flow paths within the optimal de centralized networks affects the resilience the candidate nodes to construct redundant paths are those added after the edges sewers of the base graph are cut to the network during the layout design procedure prescribed in section 2 2 this approach is applicable to both centralized and decentralized systems however pre screening of some of these candidate nodes should be performed beforehand for a decentralized system for instance as shown in fig 3 nodes t s r and q are potential candidates for adding extra paths within the networks by comparing the base graph fig 3 a with the final designed graph fig 3 b however connecting nodes t s and r violates the decentralization notion of its structure and thus couple the two separated subgraphs as we tend to uncover the characteristics of redundancy attributes for each structure centralized vs decentralized networks separately the nodes t s and r are excluded from the redundancy candidates and we continue working with node q only subsequently to add the path to the network concerning node q depending on the achieved design characteristics for node q and its adjacent one node i two situations may occur fig 3 1 invert elevation of node q is smaller than the invert elevation of node i if this scenario occurs the sewer qh is connected to manhole i with a new inlet offset equal to the difference between the q and i invert elevations 2 invert elevation of node q is larger than the invert elevation of node i if this situation occurs the sewer qh is connected to manhole i while a new inlet offset equal to the difference between the q and i invert elevations is placed for sewer ij this procedure is repeated for all candidate nodes one by one i e alternative pathways are added cumulatively and consecutively for decentralized network to finally achieve the network with the maximum number of redundant paths inner loops within each subgraph for centralized network there is of course no pre selection of the candidate nodes and all the nodes cut from the base graph during the layout generation stage are considered for the introduction of redundant paths alternative water flow pathways in this study are systematically and consecutively implemented based on three scenarios approaches 1 adding alternative paths from the upstream sections towards downstream sections hereafter referred to as the upstream scenario approach 2 adding alternative paths from the downstream sections towards upstream sections hereafter referred to as the downstream scenario approach 3 adding alternative paths starting from certain locations determined by eigenvector centrality hereafter referred to as the centrality scenario approach to determine the upstream and downstream locations in scenarios 1 and 2 the shortest path algorithm was executed over undirected branch graphs i e designed centralized and decentralized networks with sewer lengths as edge weights the undirected graph with lengths as edge weights is used to determine the euclidean distance of each node to its corresponding outlet using the shortest path algorithm which has not been feasible in a directed graph as a consequence of direction interference this method yields a more accurate indication of upstream or downstream nodes the shorter the distance of a node from its corresponding outlet the more downstream the location however scenario 3 seeks to cumulatively add alternative paths from the most influential nodes determined by eigenvector centrality using eqs 2 and 3 to clarify more on this approach and how additional paths are constructed a pedagogical example is provided in fig 4 below wherein 1 shows the eigenvector centrality rankings for the nodes using the sewer diameters as edge weights of the graph the bigger the red coloured nodes the larger the centrality values and 2 shows the order of adding the first redundant path based on the aforementioned three approaches upstream downstream and centrality the first redundant path using the upstream and downstream approaches are edges pipes ac pink colour and fh orange colour respectively as shown in 2 using the eigenvector values computed in 1 from all the nodes cut from the base graph node d has the largest eigenvalue therefore the first path based on the centrality approach is constructed as edge pipe ce red colour shown in 2 it is important to note that a minor modification is added to scenario 3 or centrality approach regarding structural failure implications in section 3 2 nine largest sewers downstream of the centralized network carrying the biggest loads in the networks with the largest diameters were selected to showcase the implications of structural failure to ensure the construction of redundant paths surrounding the locations of each blocked sewers for the centrality approach we created compromise rankings as m i n σ i j c in this formula the former σ i j represents the normalized shortest path lengths between 0 and 1 from all nodes i to the source of blocked sewers j and the latter c represents the eigenvector centrality values between 0 and 1 for all nodes this approach by ranking nodes from minimum to maximum values results in higher rankings priorities to the nodes with more eigenvector centralities nodes in directly interacting with the main collectors and with shorter distances to the source nodes of the blocked sewers to construct the redundant paths therefore this allows us to implement redundant paths from the nodes which are both close to each blocked sewer and close to the larger pipelines note that within our approach except for the inlet offset for the sewers other network parameters remain intact e g sewer slopes and diameters implying that the total storage volume of all centralized and decentralized networks remains constant before and after adding redundant paths therefore this enables unlocking the characteristics of flow redistribution single handedly through networks 2 5 resilience evaluation the resilience performance of all de centralized usns was evaluated using eq 7 the performance was assessed during low medium rainfall event 5 year and high intensity event 25 year for functional failure analysis the design rain event 2 year was also utilized for structural failure analysis these rainfall events were selected based on engineering judgments and iranian standards and regulations in flat terrains the following hydraulic performance indicator h p i was used for this purpose in this study möderl et al 2009 as shown in eq 7 7 h p i 100 1 v f l o o d i n g v r u n o f f where h p i represents the hydraulic performance indicator v f l o o d i n g is the total ponded flood volume m 3 and v r u n o f f is the total runoff volume m 3 note that the total ponded flood volume is summation of the flooded water at all nodes that leaves and then renters the drainage network once the flood occurs i e hydraulic gradient line at nodes exceeds a specific threshold 2 6 case studies the entirely flat terrain case study fig 5 is a section within a large industrial city ahvaz in iran with an area of 500 ha 181 subcatchments 530 sewers and 10 outlet candidates in the proximity of the karun river the city has a relatively hot and dry climate and has been recently experiencing high intensity short duration rainfall events for two three instances per year as the city does not currently possess any stormwater management system this has created numerous problems for authorities and citizens such as prolonged urban flooding additional details regarding this case study can be found in bakhshipour et al 2019 it is important to note that the centralized and decentralized networks generated in this study with various numbers of redundant paths are published with open access on the github page https github com iut ibk benchmark casestudies ahvaz git they can serve as infrastructure benchmarks as semi real usns as the produced networks are free from the constraints and boundaries often imposed by real world systems this can also help when facing with limited availability of real world case studies for exploring and exploiting various models and analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 functional failure the optimal decentralized network as well as the best centralized one among all the centralized layout configurations were characterized as shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the dc for the optimal decentralized layout is found to be 69 7 outlet selected out of 10 outlet candidates as shown in fig 6 the decentralized network also achieved an approximately 22 lower lcc than the centralized network with dc 100 as detailed in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 this finding sheds light on the importance of topological decentralization during the design stage furthermore total system storage capacity i e the maximum capacity at which the system can accommodate volumetric flows of centralized solution is achieved 43 larger than that of the decentralized system the reason is correlated with the fact that components in centralized network are heavily interconnected enforcing larger diameters during the design optimization and therefore bigger storage capacity then these two networks were proceeded to the implementation of redundancy promoting strategies to showcase the implementation of redundancy scenarios in this study the first 25 redundant flow paths were allocated and shown for both centralized and decentralized networks of the case study in figs 8 and 9 respectively fig 8 a and b show that redundant paths were accurately in placed from upstream and downstream respectively however as discussed before scenario 3 centrality approach seeks to start targeting the nodes whose connections to their adjacent nodes interact with the primary pipelines of the network this can be seen in fig 8 c where the first 25 redundant paths were constructed mainly around the main central collector of the network the same illustration of the three redundancy scenarios outlined above has been also demonstrated for the decentralized network in fig 9 it is evident that the introduction of additional pipes was successfully undertaken at upstream and downstream sections of the network as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively further scenario 3 centrality approach has been able to successfully construct the redundant paths interacting with the large sewer diameters as shown in fig 9 c note that in this study the determination of upstream downstream and centrality based locations was performed globally in the decentralized networks this implies that we may have a situation where the redundant paths were disproportionally distributed in some specific branches subgraphs of the decentralized network than the other branches therefore in the future the proposed framework could also include the subgraphs of the decentralized network to investigate the effect of homogenously distributing the redundant paths in each branch subgraph of the network after the network characterization the impact of redundancy implementation on the two designed structures centralized with dc 100 vs decentralized with dc 69 is investigated via resilience assessment hpi measure subjected to two types of rainfall induced functional failure 5 and 25 year storm events with total rain amounts equal to 32 3 mm and 49 9 mm respectively these results are shown in fig 10 based on our case study total number of 181 redundant flow paths were introduced to the designed tree like centralized network while 131 redundant pathways after pre selection were subsequently added to the optimal tree like decentralized one to avoid compromising its decentralized structure then we normalize the number of redundant flow paths divide by the total number of redundant paths for each structure to yield 0 100 loop percentage for both structures see fig 10 b and d fig 10 a and b indicate the resilience performance of all networks i e from a fully branch network to fully looped one for two structures i e centralized and decentralized under the 5 year rainfall event fig 10 a shows the swarm plot as a type of scatter plot of hpi values on top of the violin plot depicting the distribution of hpi values hintze and nelson 1998 with respect to the two structures and their relationship with upstream blue colour and downstream orange colour approaches along with the results from the branch network each dot in fig 10 a represents a hpi value corresponding to a network with various numbers of redundant paths fig 10 b shows the hpi values plotted against the percentage of loops alongside the implication of centrality strategy as shown in fig 10 a the hpi values for the branch tree like structures were approximately 89 for both centralized and decentralized layouts the introduction of extra paths from upstream and downstream locations until the placement of the last one 100 loops enhanced resilience by 8 for the centralized layout and 4 for the decentralized layout it is also apparent from fig 10 b that introducing redundancy to the centralized layout gained more momentum for resilience growth than the decentralized layout this is because in decentralized networks volumetric flows can be discharged through several separated main collectors as opposed to centralized ones where there exist very limited primary collectors therefore the lack of effective flow distribution pertaining to centralized networks can to some extent be compensated via redundant path implementation combining this effect with a substantial storage capacity in the centralized system approximately 43 bigger than that of the decentralized system forms a recipe for more rapid resilience growth it is evident that except for the first 20 25 of loops for the centralized solutions the placement of additional loops at upstream outperformed those downstream for both structures this indicates that the placement of initial redundant pathways in this case up to the first 25 both at downstream and upstream performs quite similarly sometimes in favour of downstream further the performance of all three approaches tends to converge for decentralized scenarios when passing almost 80 loops it was also found that the centrality approach substantially outperformed the other two strategies by up to 60 loops for centralized and 70 loops for decentralized configurations thereafter the upstream approach performed slightly better than the centrality one this is because despite the improved performance by first targeting the nodes for connection to the main collectors by the centrality approach placing around 65 of the loops all at upstream could attenuate flood flows more effectively this attenuation is induced by increasing the time of concentration of the entire catchment and dispersing the increased discharges more homogenously through the network similarly fig 10 c and d represent the same implications as fig 10 a and b but when the networks are subject to high intensity rainfall event 25 year event as shown in these figures the significance of decentralization implemented during the design stage is more highlighted under such extreme storm condition similar to the 5 year event the resilience growth rate of centralized scenarios ranging by 8 was recorded to be greater than that of decentralized ones ranging by 5 however the decentralized branch tree solution recorded an hpi of 70 as opposed to 65 for the centralized one continuously outperforming the centralized solutions this finding indicates that despite imposing good flow redistribution via redundancy on centralized solutions alongside their substantial storage capacity topological decentralization executed at the design stage plays a more crucial role in achieving a higher resilience under heavy rain events in terms of different redundancy deployment strategies the patterns achieved are somewhat analogous to those obtained under the 5 year event this shows that the upstream approach outperformed the downstream one starting from 25 for centralized and 20 loops for decentralized solutions however the implementation of these three approaches tends to perform relatively similar for the decentralized network passing around 80 loops moreover centrality approach outperformed the other two approaches by up to 45 loops for the centralized solutions whereas its performance was relatively close to the upstream approach in decentralized networks these implications combined with those achieved under the 5 year rainfall event indicate that the more extreme the event the more significant the impact of redundant paths placement at upstream furthermore as this region entirely flat often faces a problematic inundation period we plotted below the flood duration in hours for both structures with no loops with 25 loops 50 loops 75 loops and 100 loops maximum as shown in fig 11 under 5 and 25 year rainfall events note that as the centrality approach generally outperformed the other two approaches i e upstream and downstream we only showed the flood duration results when redundant paths were constructed using the centrality approach fig 11 the implications of the other two approaches can be found in this manuscript s supplementary material fig 11 shows that as a general pattern when more redundancy is introduced to both structure types the observed flood duration is more reduced the flood duration was reduced from approximately 2 h for the branch network to approximately 1 25 h for the 100 looped system under the 5 year storm event for both structures likewise flood duration gradually waned under the 25 year event when redundancy was introduced with each step of implementation 25 loops 50 loops etc ranging from more than 4 h for the branch network to approximately 3 h for the fully looped structure in addition the decentralized layouts yielded a shorter flood duration than their centralized counterparts with the same loop percentage however there are two exceptions for the networks with 75 and 100 loops under the 5 year storm even where the centralized solutions exhibit lesser flood duration compared to their decentralized ones the reason is that when combining a big storage capacity pertaining to centralized solutions 43 larger with high level of redundancy around 75 loops and more centralized networks outperform decentralized in terms of flood duration however under heavier storm event 25 year event such trade offs turn in favour of flow redistribution imposed by redundancy rather than storage capacity and that is why decentralized structures outperform centralized ones under heavier events in terms of both flood magnitude and duration regardless of the big capacity in the centralized solutions these implications further support the effectiveness of redundant paths for reducing flooding duration as another major component of the resilience definition 3 2 structural failure with regard to structural failure we significantly reduced the relevant sewer diameters to 10 mm to replicate the sewer blockage in the system mugume et al 2014 nonetheless as opposed to the method introduced in mugume et al 2015 where sewer collapse is simulated randomly and cumulatively which can be more useful when the system experiences earthquake stress or random attacks we addressed sewer failure successively and only for large sewers in this study this is because the failure of upstream located sewers did not significantly deteriorate the system resilience as they often carried lower discharge volumes moreover the decentralized scenarios were disregarded herein for the purpose of structural failure because the centralized layout is more vulnerable due to the existence of unique and limited pathways major collectors to discharge the design peak runoff as a result to better showcase and support the implication of blockage consequences on resilience only the nine largest sewers downstream were investigated see fig 12 the results indicate that the blockage of sewer 0 directly connected to the outlet would completely fail the entire system even under the design rainfall event this highlights the vulnerability of centralized layouts since the design peak runoff cannot escape from the system the resilience results of the other eight largest sewer failures under design rainfall are depicted in fig 13 a c fig 13 a demonstrates the results corresponding to the upstream approach b demonstrates the results corresponding to the downstream approach and c demonstrates the results corresponding the centrality approach with a minor modification explained in section 2 4 as shown in fig 13 a cumulatively adding alternative water pathways at each step i e 10 loops 20 loops etc with upstream approach could not significantly enhance the structural resilience via hpi measure under the occurrence of sewer failures 1 4 these sewers had the largest diameter that is 2 m in other words resilience was just slightly improved after implementing each loop step when cumulatively introduced from the upstream locations such an implementation however is accompanied by a better improvement when considering the failure of sewers 5 to 8 thanks to their central locations in the network once the cumulative implementation of redundancy was initiated by downstream approach the resilience was enhanced more rapidly at each step under all sewer failure scenarios see fig 13 a and b this is associated with placing redundant paths in the same sections of failure locations i e both failure and redundancy locations are at downstream sections for effectively storing and dispersing the backwater coming from the blocked sewers this resilience enhancement is specifically more apparent for the failure of sewers 5 to 8 relative to the upstream approach this is again related to the position of the sewers located in the center middle portion of the network to place this into context as the backwater resulting from these blocked sewers travelled upstream alternative pathways were able to retrieve and exchange the discharges to the other parts of the network transferring them between the main large collectors for better and quicker dispersion of the flows in addition once the redundant paths were implemented using the centrality approach the resilience improvement rate received even more successful momentum compared to the downstream approach see fig 13 b and c centrality approach marginally outperformed the downstream one under the failure of sewers 1 4 again this is because the backwater effect occurring from these sewers does not pass main large collectors along their journey to the upstream areas upper left of the network to help them in retrieving a portion of this water in contrast a more significant resilience increase was observed after the collapse of sewers 4 8 specifically sewer 8 compared to the downstream approach for instance the failure of sewer 8 had a constant hpi value of 75 from the network without loop up to the first 10 loops via the downstream approach whereas hpi measure concluded the first 10 loops at approximately 87 using the centrality approach this is correlated with the initiation of constructing the extra pathways surrounding each blocked sewer via the modified centrality approach by leveraging the flow redistribution of backwater flows and thereby yielding a better and quicker flood attenuation from figs 12 and 13 c it is apparent that the backwater coming from the failure of sewer 8 would be more accessible to the major collectors pipelines surrounding its location thus placing alternative paths first around those critical locations using the centrality approach may further help in retrieving and exchanging the design flow volumes between such major pipelines 4 limitations advantages and future work as the implications of this study are based on one specific case study and the local precipitation properties the broad generalization of the results may not be always advisable however we believe that the patterns achieved for both centralized and decentralized layouts under functional and structural failure would still be relevant and applicable regardless of the storm and the case study characteristics it should also be noted that we did not change the major structural characteristics of centralized and decentralized networks via redundancy that is diameter slope length and total storage capacity remained constant for each structure before and after loops introduction however with this minor modification creating redundancy redundant flow paths we could push up resilience performance even by up to 8 under functional failure enlarging added sewers can also be considered at critical locations for further resilience enhancement note that depending on the phase of project e g design or rehabilitation stage introducing redundancy can change the costs related to the system e g lcc for instance during the planning stage introduction of redundant paths converts the existence of two manholes to one see fig 3 and thus could reduce the overall design costs however regardless of the project phase based on our previous experimentation and lcc formula used in this study expenses related to manholes are much smaller than piping process in the network hence although we did not discuss the implications of redundancy implementation for lcc variations redundancy in our context would have marginally affected the lcc in the future we aim to use cumulative runoff areas of each pipe as the edge weighting function instead of diameters for ranking the critical nodes determined by eigenvector centrality approach this allows identifying and ranking the influential nodes more accurately for the introduction of redundant flow pathways we will also present the transition towards an integrated framework by introducing limited alternative path flows to the most sensitive locations of de centralized networks this is achieved by optimizing the inlet offset of the added sewers while integrating the green blue infrastructures gbis this framework will be implemented based on the weak points of the network or even considering functional interdependency e g existing a hospital or school over the road network to successfully avoid or minimize any functional and structural failure surrounding these critical infrastructures 5 conclusion and final remarks there is an urgent need to transition towards resilient usns at all stages as climate change driven precipitations sewer blockages and aging elements are deteriorating the functional and structural operation of these systems therefore a redundancy promoting framework was developed in this study based on three approaches cumulatively introducing redundant water flow paths from upstream downstream and sensitive locations this framework seeks to enhance the usn resilience under functional and structural failure for optimal centralized and decentralized usns this was achieved by leveraging an efficient re distribution of water flows throughout the network the main findings of this study are as follows the importance of topological decentralization is highlighted during the design stage in terms of both capital savings and resilience enhancement using a tailored graph theory based topological measure i e eigenvector centrality the sensitive and critical locations for introducing redundant paths are identified by first interacting with the main collectors of the network constructing redundant paths forming loops initially at critical locations using eigenvector centrality approach outperforms the other two strategies experiencing functional failure however after exceeding a loop threshold the placement of redundant paths all at upstream performs marginally better especially under heavier storm events redundancy in centralized networks contributes more to resilience than that in decentralized networks this is because the lack of efficient flow distribution in centralized networks can be compensated to certain extent via redundant path implementation combining this effect with their substantial storage capacity compared to decentralized ones forms a recipe for more rapid resilience growth although the resilience growth of centralized networks with redundant flow paths forming loops progresses more rapidly than decentralized solutions the decentralized layout solutions with loops continuously outperform centralized ones during heavy rain events introducing redundant paths at downstream would be more promising for centralized layouts experiencing structural failure because the blockage in major pipelines located downstream with more discharge volumes would affect the system s resilience more than upstream blockages data availability all

15697,recent research underpinned the effectiveness of topological decentralization for urban stormwater networks usns during the planning stage in terms of both capital savings and resilience enhancement however how centralized and decentralized usns structures with various degrees of redundancy i e redundant water flow pathways project resilience under functional and structural failure remains an unresolved issue in this work we present a systemic and generic framework to investigate the impact of adding redundant flow paths on resilience based on three strategies for optimal centralized versus decentralized usns furthermore a tailored graph theory based measure i e eigenvector centrality is proposed to introduce redundant paths to the critical locations of usns the proposed framework is then applied to a real large scale case study the results confirm the critical role of layout decentralization under both functional e g extreme precipitation events and structural failure e g pipe collapse moreover the findings indicate that the implementation of redundant paths could increase resilience performance by up to 8 under functional failure without changing the network s major structural characteristics i e sewer diameters lengths and storage capacity only by leveraging the effective flow redistribution the scheme proposed in this study can be a fruitful initiative for further improving the usns resilience during both planning and rehabilitation stages keywords urban stormwater networks graph theory layout decentralization resilience redundancy 1 introduction urban stormwater networks usns have a focal role within urban water ecosystem in preventing pluvial flooding in urban areas achieving a high level of reliability to minimize the frequency and magnitude of failures is the conventional approach to designing usns david butler et al 2017 this approach has left communities with vulnerable infrastructures to increasing threats such as natural disasters and climate change sweetapple et al 2022 in addition a detailed assessment of planning rehabilitation and management of urban water infrastructures alongside their modeling is often not trivial due to high complexity and interconnection between their components hajibabaei et al 2019 such hurdles are more exacerbated when accounting for the unprecedented impact of climate change combined with ever increasing urbanization butler et al 2014 casal campos et al 2018 sitzenfrei et al 2022 webber et al 2022 these deviations often manifest themselves in heatwaves flooding and droughts plaguing cities across the globe aghakouchak et al 2014 da silva et al 2022 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 najafi et al 2021 for this reason it is necessary to learn to adapt the infrastructures to mitigate the effects of such exceptional conditions shukla et al 2019 and therefore a paradigm shift from reliability to resilience for urban water infrastructures during all stages including planning operation and rehabilitation is needed sweetapple et al 2022 recent discussions also regard resilience as the core of sustainable development where systems must be resilient to overcome future uncertain threats juan garcia et al 2017 in this context various definitions and interpretations surrounding resilience have been documented in recent literature dong et al 2017 leandro et al 2020 mugume and butler 2017 wang et al 2021 2019 however in this paper we adopt the concept introduced in butler et al 2014 and mugume and butler 2017 wherein resilience is defined as the degree to which the system minimizes level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional loading conditions some literature also divides resilience into two broad categories specified and general resilience sweetapple et al 2022 specified resilience is the resilience of some particular parts of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks whereas general resilience is the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 as it is impossible to predict all potential threats building general resilience in usns to minimize the magnitude and duration of failure when such unexpected threats occur is crucial sweetapple et al 2022 in relation to the threats jeopardizing usns there are two common types of failure 1 functional failure caused by the load alterations on the system and 2 structural failure caused by issues that disrupt the function of single or multiple components of the system mugume et al 2015 the former functional failure is induced by climate change driven precipitation or urbanization increases butler et al 2018 and the latter structural failure is induced by components failure such as sewer blockage pump failure and sensor failure sweetapple et al 2022 thus to build general resilience in usns both functional and structural failures must be considered guptha et al 2021 osheen et al 2022 the first step in achieving an appropriate level of resilient performance is planning and designing of a usn comprising of a proper spatial layout and hydraulic design most studies regarding urban drainage planning have focused on hydraulic design and sewer sizing strategies to achieve optimal solutions afshar and rohani 2012 ahmadi et al 2018 diao 2020 karovic and mays 2014 a few studies have proposed creating optimal topological layouts as the foregoing step among which the most commonly presented methodology adopts the generation of centralized topological layouts duque et al 2020 haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 hesarkazzazi et al 2021 hsie et al 2019 moeini and afshar 2017 however these reliability based optimization methods often minimize construction design costs and consequently lessen system resilience to overcome this challenge recent research has emphasized the effectiveness of topological decentralization at the planning stage in terms of both capital investment and resilience enhancement bakhshipour et al 2019 björklund et al 2018 eggimann et al 2015 hesarkazzazi et al 2022 wang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 consequently topological decentralization at the design stage for improving system resilience is paramount which needs to be undertaken first however for existing usns a transition from centralized to decentralized systems in most cases is unattainable or at least too problematic as a consequence we need to consider other alternatives to build resilience in these existing usns despite certain variations and modifications in the literature on resilience promoting attributes within the realm of usns kwon et al 2021 wang et al 2019 we adhere to two broad categories introduced by mugume et al 2015 1 flexibility and 2 redundancy flexibility is defined based on the inherent system s ability to be reconfigured and adjusted to maintain an acceptable performance level under multiple varying loading conditions flexibility can be implemented via distributed decentralized elements such as green blue infrastructures gbis e g implementation of green roofs rain barrels permeable pavements etc across the catchment however redundancy attribute implies having multiple components with similar functions to lessen failure propagation through the entire system redundancy can be enriched in practice by presenting additional storage tanks providing more spare capacity at certain critical locations e g enlarging pipes and adding alternative water flow paths forming loops which last one is the focus of this study to elaborate more on these attributes for instance gbis can play a crucial role in enhancing the resilience of usns in contrast to grey infrastructures gbis are more flexible in terms of installation adaptation bringing multifunctions and co benefits to urban stormwater management sitzenfrei et al 2022 in recent literature the benefits of these kinds of adaptation measures have been widely discussed and accepted bakhshipour et al 2021 bakhshipour et al 2019 haghighatafshar et al 2018 liu et al 2021 oberascher et al 2022 pour et al 2020 wang et al 2022 for example wang et al 2022 proposed a framework for designing hybrid green blue and grey usns considering both technological and operational resilience they defined technological resilience as the system s performance under extreme loads and operational resilience as the performance and long term efficiency of the system after structural damage or degradation mcclymont et al 2020 proposed a resilience driven multi objective optimization model to find the optimal level of the spatial distribution of gbis based on water quality and quantity performance recently smart data driven measures and decentralized real time control options have been frequently introduced and addressed to enhance urban water systems resilience sitzenfrei et al 2022 for instance oberascher et al 2022 implemented smart rainwater harvesting to reduce potable water consumption and improve urban drainage performance and further evaluated the resilience of the integrated system on a large scale implementation these findings show that the most resilience boosting solutions are costly but yet do not guarantee the higher quality of life index values to conclude building resilience through conventional approaches e g by presenting additional storage or enlarging sewers diameter or more sophisticated methods e g gbi and smart control might be effective but expensive besides resilience is often seen as an extra expense or additional effort in urban water systems planning juan garcia et al 2017 moreover introducing components for enhancing resilience to the design retrofit or rehabilitation procedure of usns increases the complexity of the design operation problem exponentially thus instead of a single threat various threats and their combinations must be considered bakhshipour et al 2021 and as mentioned before since it is impossible to predict all potential threats building general resilience in usns is highly recommended sweetapple et al 2022 as usns are often composed of gravity driven pipelines with a tree like structure incorporating loops is not a common practice in these infrastructures this has culminated in a very small body of research reporting the consequences of adopting alternative water flow paths forming loops as a cost effective approach for resilience enhancement in usns since all sewers edges of the base graph must be included in the final design of a usn each of them drains a certain street haghighi 2012 implementing redundant flow paths through this cost effective way to build general resilience may be an efficient adaptation or design measure hereafter alternative redundant water paths or loops are interchangeably referred to as redundancy in light of this some studies proposed frameworks to describe the topological characteristics of drainage networks for example meshness coefficient proposed by reyes silva et al 2020 leverages graph theory based concepts to quantify and compare the networks with various levels of existing redundant paths with tree like and grid like loop shaped networks the drainage density index suggested by lee et al 2018 is also used to evaluate the structure of the drainage pipe network as the ratio of total pipe length to catchment area indicating the degree of pipe network density when it comes to the consequences of adopting redundancy for structural failures yazdi 2018 and zhang et al 2017 explored the influence of redundant sewers on vulnerability and resilience of usns respectively under pipe blockages they reported that the loop shaped structures demonstrate less vulnerable components and higher resilience than tree like ones under such failure type however concerning the implications for functional failure seo et al 2015 applied the gibbs stochastic network model troutman and karlinger 1992 to create and compare the performance of dendritic with fully looped networks they inferred that the shape of the hydrograph and the fully looped system s peak flow are highly correlated with the catchment slope lu et al 2021 explored the impact of dendritic and looped drainage networks in two catchments in china they concluded that the loop shaped network is more likely to reduce peak runoff at the outlet for the purpose of flood risk reduction reyes silva et al 2020 2021 reported that under functional failure loop shaped usns provide a more resilient response e g recording less flood volume and flood damage costs than tree shaped ones hesarkazzazi et al 2020 proposed an innovative approach that leverages complex network analysis to eliminate alternative water paths from upstream and downstream of a fully looped usn to infer resilience variations however certain deficiencies hinder the generalization for example they have resorted to invert elevations of the inlets manholes to determine the removal of sewers from upstream and downstream nonetheless invert elevations may not always yield an accurate indication of upstream downstream because it primarily depends on the network design characteristics finally the impact of the structures possessing loops was addressed in hesarkazzazi et al 2020 at the design stage only meaning that the networks with various numbers of loops were simultaneously designed and then evaluated there also exists an example of how redundant flow paths in looped networks are capable of reducing the frequency and magnitude of combined sewer overflows csos in a catchment in dresden germany reyes silva et al 2020 however the few aforementioned studies did not address the mechanisms by which redundant paths can improve the resilience of different usn structures centralized versus decentralized under both functional and structural failures moreover currently there is no guidance on the optimal placement of redundant paths for maximizing resilience at the design or rehabilitation stages for existing usns to conclude and based on the presented literature review we identified the following research needs developing cost effective and easy to implement methods to build resilience in usns as an alternative to existing expensive approaches such as adding gbis or extra storage capacity developing a computationally efficient framework for including and assessing redundant flow pathways forming loops in optimal planning and or rehabilitation of de centralized usns benchmarking the performance of the proposed methods using real world test cases therefore this study aims to bridge these research gaps whose key contributions are as follows developing a graph theory based and computationally inexpensive method to optimally introduce redundancy by leveraging an effective flow redistribution throughout usns with practical guidelines for implementation in the real world proposing a framework to systematically assess the impact of redundancy on resilience for optimally designed de centralized usns experiencing functional and structural failures applying the proposed methods and frameworks to a large scale real case study to discover the importance of topological decentralization in relation to redundancy the remainder of the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 introduces the relevant methodologies and case study utilized in this study section 3 discusses the implications of the developed methodology for functional and structural failures section 4 outlines the limitations advantages and future work and finally section 5 summarizes the key takeaways from this study 2 methods section 2 1 provides an introduction to graph theory analysis and the measures applied in this study sections 2 2 and 2 3 discuss the de centralized layout generation procedure along with their hydraulic design optimization and sections 2 4 2 6 discuss redundancy promoting strategies resilience assessment and suggested case studies respectively 2 1 complex network analysis of usns the usn topology can be mathematically represented and analyzed using graph theory consider a graph g consisting of a set of vertices v e g manholes storage units and outlets interconnected by a set of links or edges e e g conduits weirs and pumps a convenient method to represent graphs is to use an adjacency matrix the adjacency matrix of a graph is matrix a whose entry a i j 1 if there exists an edge i j and a i j 0 otherwise if the directions of the edges are considered in the graph it is referred to as a directed graph in contrast to an undirected graph in addition various weighting functions for the graph edges such as sewer diameters lengths and hydraulic properties can be defined the first graph measure utilized in this study is the shortest path σ i j which is the path between nodes i and j wherein sum of positive edge weights is minimal dijkstra 1959 the shortest path can be determined for directed and undirected graphs during the design layout generating rehabilitation phases see sections 2 2 and 2 4 the shortest path algorithm is applied by considering the euclidean distance between node pairs i e sewer lengths as weighting functions another definition utilized in this study is the node degree degree centrality which indicates the number of edges connected to a node the more connections a node has the higher the importance degree centrality is in directed graphs e g directions based on flow directions or ground elevations the total node degree k i t o t has two components 1 node indegree k i i n representing the number of incoming edges to a node and 2 node outdegree k i o u t representing the number of outgoing edges from a node shown in eq 1 1 k i tot k i in k i out where a i j represents the entries of the adjacency matrix the next measure in this study is the eigenvector centrality utilized for scoring and ranking influential nodes junctions for the introduction of redundant paths eigenvector centrality is a method of generalizing the degree of centrality which premises that a node s importance can increase in the network by having connections to the other nodes which themselves are important the eigenvector centrality of a node is computed by assigning each node a relative score proportional to the sum of the scores of its connections therefore the scores are normalized by the largest eigenvalue of the nodes the eigenvector centrality of a node is attained a large value if the node has many connections and or many important connections bonacich 1972 latora et al 2017 rajagopal et al 2017 to model the usn characteristics we assigned sewer diameters to edge importance weight of the graph this considers the number of adjacent connections to a node and or their importance relative to the sewer diameters therefore it allows the identification of the nodes that directly and indirectly interact and connect to the main collectors of the network with large diameters the nodes are then ranked based on their eigenvector centrality scores to introduce redundancy the higher the ranking the higher the priority given to that node to construct a redundant path see section 2 4 eqs 2 and 3 represent the eigenvector centrality measure 2 λ c i j 1 v a i j c j where i 1 2 v are the nodes λ is the largest eigenvalue of a c i is the eigenvector centrality eigenvalue of node i c j is the eigenvector centrality eigenvalue of other neighboring nodes relative to node i and a i j are the entries of adjacency matrix a of undirected graph in matrix notion eq 2 can be written as follows 3 a c e λ c e where c is an n dimensional column vector eigenvector whose entry is equal to c j an illustrative example of how eigenvalues and eigenvector are calculated using the power method algorithm for a simple graph below is shown in fig 1 note that this procedure is an iterative approach first the adjacency matrix of the graph with pipe diameters as edge weighting function is calculated a then in the first iteration this matrix is multiplied with an initial approximation vector b where we assigned all values to 1 the result is the eigenvector of a in the first iteration c 1 whose largest value λ 1 is selected this value is then used to normalize c 1 yielding the normalized eigenvector in the first iteration c 1 in the second iteration a is multiplied with the calculated c 1 to obtain the eigenvector in the second iteration c 2 again the largest eigenvalue in the second iteration λ 2 is selected to normalize c 2 resulting in c 2 this procedure is continued until all eigenvalues become stable and finally yielding the stable version of eigenvector of a at the end one can normalize the eigenvector values one more time so that the sum of all nodes centrality values is equal to 1 2 2 de centralized layout generator the layout of a usn representing the arrangements and configurations of sewers and junctions manholes along the sewer flow directions has a critical role in achieving an optimal and low cost design bakhshipour et al 2019 hesarkazzazi et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 given an entirely flat area i e no effective ground slope as well as directions exist at the planning stage the layout generation process is executed over the undirected base graph with sewer lengths as edge weighting function the base initial graph represents the network i e street network of the desired area which contains all possible sewer pipelines all drainage possibilities upon which the layout generation process flow directions determination is initiated the reason why street network is adopted as the initial base graph is the strong correlation between sewer and road networks for instance mair et al 2017 concluded that on average 50 of the street network lengths correlates with 85 of the total sewer network the step by step procedure of decentralized layout generation is illustrated and explained in fig 2 when the location of outlets is defined note that the process described in this figure is derived from a bigger framework explained in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 wherein layout creations for flat as well as steep areas were addressed separately therefore since a flat case study is considered in this study we only selected and explained the relevant methodology for flat regions it should also be noted that when only a centralized solution is required one outlet is assigned a similar procedure outlined in fig 2 for each separated branch subgraph can be applied see steps 3 and 4 this implies that a simple shortest path algorithm from all inlet nodes to the outlet node is performed over the initial undirected base graph with pipe lengths as graph weights to attain the pipe directions then the removed edges pipes during the shortest path execution are added and cut to generate a tree centralized network that contains all the sewers see steps 3 and 4 in fig 2 however assigning a set of pre defined outlets as outlet candidates to the specific locations of base graph e g in the proximity of river stream necessitates the exploration of all possible layout configurations of outlet placements i e different degree of centralization the degree of centralization dc implicitly quantifies how the usn as a whole is distributed hesarkazzazi et al 2022 as outlined in eq 4 this measure builds a logarithmic relationship between the number of selected outlet nodes o n s from a list of possible outlet candidates and total number of inlet nodes in 4 d c 100 1 l o g 10 o n s l o g 10 i n this measure denotes that if all drainage inlet nodes act as outlet nodes dc is computed equal to 0 complete decentralization which is of course unfeasible whereas if only one outlet node is selected among all the outlet candidates dc is computed equal to 100 fully centralization as demonstrated in fig 2 the developed layout generation process herein is a deterministic approach implying that only one unique layout solution is created for each outlet placement scenario hence when a set of pre defined outlet candidates are defined and placed as previously mentioned all possible combinations of outlet placements should be enumerated different dcs this is done to finally uncover the optimal locations and numbers of outlets from that set of pre defined outlet candidates i e finally selecting the optimal network however hydraulically designing all generated layouts to achieve the optimal one culminates in a significantly large computational demand therefore a combinatorial optimization framework i e brute force or exhaustive search with two layout objective functions was used wherein the only decision variable is the number of possible outlet candidates n p o with 2 n p o 1 possible solutions these two layout objective functions aim to pre screen and discard a large number of the generated layouts prior to hydraulic design optimization these layout functions operate based on sewer lengths and runoff areas distribution through the sewers imposed during the layout generation in order to find the networks having the efficient distribution and subsequently minimizing the hydraulic design costs then all the layout solutions lying on the pareto front as a result of interaction of the two layout objective functions are chosen and forwarded to the hydraulic design optimization see section 2 3 to ultimately choose the optimal fully designed network with the smallest design cost further details regarding the layout generation process can be found in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 2 3 hydraulic design optimization as discussed above the layout solutions on the pareto front are all forwarded to hydraulic design optimization this is performed to size the sewers slopes and pump stations while a set of design criteria objectives and constraints are satisfied to achieve this goal the hydraulic design algorithm introduced by haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 was adopted in this study using an adaptive approach the dynamic wave flow equations in the swmm rossman and huber 2016 were used to design all networks the algorithm requires 3np decision variables given np is the number of pipes sewers this includes np discrete variables for sewer sizes np real variables for sewer slopes and np binary 0 1 variables to determine whether there should be a pump station at a sewer upstream furthermore life cycle cost lcc is considered for the design costs of the case study lcc dos santos et al 2021 includes the capital operation and maintenance costs for a 30 year service life as a result the minimization of lcc is set as the only objective function of the hydraulic design optimization framework surcharge has been permitted while no flooding is allowed to occur in the system under design storm event a 2 year block rain event was utilized for the pipe sizing process according to iranian standards and regulations in flat areas layouts that require lift stations are automatically omitted using a penalty function during the optimization in this study as the area is completely flat the minimum allowable slopes from the local manual are allocated to each pipe based on their diameters therefore the problem simplifies to finding the optimum diameter of pipes in the generated layouts to minimize lcc thus in adaptive algorithm only one vector of decision variables p with size np is needed to assign the diameter of pipes using eq 5 as follows 5 d d m i n d m a x d m i n p where d m a x is the largest commercially available size and d m i n is determined with respect to the telescopic pattern the diameter of every pipe must be equal to or greater than that of its upstream pipes which means that 6 d m a x d u where d u contains pipe diameters connected to the upstream end of the pipe at hand within our optimization framework we employed a genetic algorithm as the optimization engine to find the optimal values for decision variables p the other considered constraints included the minimum and maximum cover depths maximum slopes and maximum velocity all of which were chosen based on the regulations and standards for the analyzed city once all the solutions in the pareto front are hydraulically designed the optimal decentralized layout solution is chosen and proceeded to the redundancy deployment process see section 2 4 note that all the centralized configurations having different outlet locations are also hydraulically designed among which the best one with cheapest lcc is selected to compare the characteristics of redundancy between centralized and decentralized optimal layouts further details regarding the hydraulic design optimization framework design constraints and lcc equation can be found in this study s supplementary material 2 4 redundancy promoting strategies once the optimal decentralized network as well as the centralized one were chosen and hydraulically designed we established a framework to build resilience using a specific redundancy attribute i e adding additional water pathways redundant paths this can be performed during the design or rehabilitation stage for existing systems specifically we are interested in how the flow re distribution imposed by different numbers and locations of redundant flow paths within the optimal de centralized networks affects the resilience the candidate nodes to construct redundant paths are those added after the edges sewers of the base graph are cut to the network during the layout design procedure prescribed in section 2 2 this approach is applicable to both centralized and decentralized systems however pre screening of some of these candidate nodes should be performed beforehand for a decentralized system for instance as shown in fig 3 nodes t s r and q are potential candidates for adding extra paths within the networks by comparing the base graph fig 3 a with the final designed graph fig 3 b however connecting nodes t s and r violates the decentralization notion of its structure and thus couple the two separated subgraphs as we tend to uncover the characteristics of redundancy attributes for each structure centralized vs decentralized networks separately the nodes t s and r are excluded from the redundancy candidates and we continue working with node q only subsequently to add the path to the network concerning node q depending on the achieved design characteristics for node q and its adjacent one node i two situations may occur fig 3 1 invert elevation of node q is smaller than the invert elevation of node i if this scenario occurs the sewer qh is connected to manhole i with a new inlet offset equal to the difference between the q and i invert elevations 2 invert elevation of node q is larger than the invert elevation of node i if this situation occurs the sewer qh is connected to manhole i while a new inlet offset equal to the difference between the q and i invert elevations is placed for sewer ij this procedure is repeated for all candidate nodes one by one i e alternative pathways are added cumulatively and consecutively for decentralized network to finally achieve the network with the maximum number of redundant paths inner loops within each subgraph for centralized network there is of course no pre selection of the candidate nodes and all the nodes cut from the base graph during the layout generation stage are considered for the introduction of redundant paths alternative water flow pathways in this study are systematically and consecutively implemented based on three scenarios approaches 1 adding alternative paths from the upstream sections towards downstream sections hereafter referred to as the upstream scenario approach 2 adding alternative paths from the downstream sections towards upstream sections hereafter referred to as the downstream scenario approach 3 adding alternative paths starting from certain locations determined by eigenvector centrality hereafter referred to as the centrality scenario approach to determine the upstream and downstream locations in scenarios 1 and 2 the shortest path algorithm was executed over undirected branch graphs i e designed centralized and decentralized networks with sewer lengths as edge weights the undirected graph with lengths as edge weights is used to determine the euclidean distance of each node to its corresponding outlet using the shortest path algorithm which has not been feasible in a directed graph as a consequence of direction interference this method yields a more accurate indication of upstream or downstream nodes the shorter the distance of a node from its corresponding outlet the more downstream the location however scenario 3 seeks to cumulatively add alternative paths from the most influential nodes determined by eigenvector centrality using eqs 2 and 3 to clarify more on this approach and how additional paths are constructed a pedagogical example is provided in fig 4 below wherein 1 shows the eigenvector centrality rankings for the nodes using the sewer diameters as edge weights of the graph the bigger the red coloured nodes the larger the centrality values and 2 shows the order of adding the first redundant path based on the aforementioned three approaches upstream downstream and centrality the first redundant path using the upstream and downstream approaches are edges pipes ac pink colour and fh orange colour respectively as shown in 2 using the eigenvector values computed in 1 from all the nodes cut from the base graph node d has the largest eigenvalue therefore the first path based on the centrality approach is constructed as edge pipe ce red colour shown in 2 it is important to note that a minor modification is added to scenario 3 or centrality approach regarding structural failure implications in section 3 2 nine largest sewers downstream of the centralized network carrying the biggest loads in the networks with the largest diameters were selected to showcase the implications of structural failure to ensure the construction of redundant paths surrounding the locations of each blocked sewers for the centrality approach we created compromise rankings as m i n σ i j c in this formula the former σ i j represents the normalized shortest path lengths between 0 and 1 from all nodes i to the source of blocked sewers j and the latter c represents the eigenvector centrality values between 0 and 1 for all nodes this approach by ranking nodes from minimum to maximum values results in higher rankings priorities to the nodes with more eigenvector centralities nodes in directly interacting with the main collectors and with shorter distances to the source nodes of the blocked sewers to construct the redundant paths therefore this allows us to implement redundant paths from the nodes which are both close to each blocked sewer and close to the larger pipelines note that within our approach except for the inlet offset for the sewers other network parameters remain intact e g sewer slopes and diameters implying that the total storage volume of all centralized and decentralized networks remains constant before and after adding redundant paths therefore this enables unlocking the characteristics of flow redistribution single handedly through networks 2 5 resilience evaluation the resilience performance of all de centralized usns was evaluated using eq 7 the performance was assessed during low medium rainfall event 5 year and high intensity event 25 year for functional failure analysis the design rain event 2 year was also utilized for structural failure analysis these rainfall events were selected based on engineering judgments and iranian standards and regulations in flat terrains the following hydraulic performance indicator h p i was used for this purpose in this study möderl et al 2009 as shown in eq 7 7 h p i 100 1 v f l o o d i n g v r u n o f f where h p i represents the hydraulic performance indicator v f l o o d i n g is the total ponded flood volume m 3 and v r u n o f f is the total runoff volume m 3 note that the total ponded flood volume is summation of the flooded water at all nodes that leaves and then renters the drainage network once the flood occurs i e hydraulic gradient line at nodes exceeds a specific threshold 2 6 case studies the entirely flat terrain case study fig 5 is a section within a large industrial city ahvaz in iran with an area of 500 ha 181 subcatchments 530 sewers and 10 outlet candidates in the proximity of the karun river the city has a relatively hot and dry climate and has been recently experiencing high intensity short duration rainfall events for two three instances per year as the city does not currently possess any stormwater management system this has created numerous problems for authorities and citizens such as prolonged urban flooding additional details regarding this case study can be found in bakhshipour et al 2019 it is important to note that the centralized and decentralized networks generated in this study with various numbers of redundant paths are published with open access on the github page https github com iut ibk benchmark casestudies ahvaz git they can serve as infrastructure benchmarks as semi real usns as the produced networks are free from the constraints and boundaries often imposed by real world systems this can also help when facing with limited availability of real world case studies for exploring and exploiting various models and analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 functional failure the optimal decentralized network as well as the best centralized one among all the centralized layout configurations were characterized as shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the dc for the optimal decentralized layout is found to be 69 7 outlet selected out of 10 outlet candidates as shown in fig 6 the decentralized network also achieved an approximately 22 lower lcc than the centralized network with dc 100 as detailed in hesarkazzazi et al 2022 this finding sheds light on the importance of topological decentralization during the design stage furthermore total system storage capacity i e the maximum capacity at which the system can accommodate volumetric flows of centralized solution is achieved 43 larger than that of the decentralized system the reason is correlated with the fact that components in centralized network are heavily interconnected enforcing larger diameters during the design optimization and therefore bigger storage capacity then these two networks were proceeded to the implementation of redundancy promoting strategies to showcase the implementation of redundancy scenarios in this study the first 25 redundant flow paths were allocated and shown for both centralized and decentralized networks of the case study in figs 8 and 9 respectively fig 8 a and b show that redundant paths were accurately in placed from upstream and downstream respectively however as discussed before scenario 3 centrality approach seeks to start targeting the nodes whose connections to their adjacent nodes interact with the primary pipelines of the network this can be seen in fig 8 c where the first 25 redundant paths were constructed mainly around the main central collector of the network the same illustration of the three redundancy scenarios outlined above has been also demonstrated for the decentralized network in fig 9 it is evident that the introduction of additional pipes was successfully undertaken at upstream and downstream sections of the network as shown in fig 9 a and b respectively further scenario 3 centrality approach has been able to successfully construct the redundant paths interacting with the large sewer diameters as shown in fig 9 c note that in this study the determination of upstream downstream and centrality based locations was performed globally in the decentralized networks this implies that we may have a situation where the redundant paths were disproportionally distributed in some specific branches subgraphs of the decentralized network than the other branches therefore in the future the proposed framework could also include the subgraphs of the decentralized network to investigate the effect of homogenously distributing the redundant paths in each branch subgraph of the network after the network characterization the impact of redundancy implementation on the two designed structures centralized with dc 100 vs decentralized with dc 69 is investigated via resilience assessment hpi measure subjected to two types of rainfall induced functional failure 5 and 25 year storm events with total rain amounts equal to 32 3 mm and 49 9 mm respectively these results are shown in fig 10 based on our case study total number of 181 redundant flow paths were introduced to the designed tree like centralized network while 131 redundant pathways after pre selection were subsequently added to the optimal tree like decentralized one to avoid compromising its decentralized structure then we normalize the number of redundant flow paths divide by the total number of redundant paths for each structure to yield 0 100 loop percentage for both structures see fig 10 b and d fig 10 a and b indicate the resilience performance of all networks i e from a fully branch network to fully looped one for two structures i e centralized and decentralized under the 5 year rainfall event fig 10 a shows the swarm plot as a type of scatter plot of hpi values on top of the violin plot depicting the distribution of hpi values hintze and nelson 1998 with respect to the two structures and their relationship with upstream blue colour and downstream orange colour approaches along with the results from the branch network each dot in fig 10 a represents a hpi value corresponding to a network with various numbers of redundant paths fig 10 b shows the hpi values plotted against the percentage of loops alongside the implication of centrality strategy as shown in fig 10 a the hpi values for the branch tree like structures were approximately 89 for both centralized and decentralized layouts the introduction of extra paths from upstream and downstream locations until the placement of the last one 100 loops enhanced resilience by 8 for the centralized layout and 4 for the decentralized layout it is also apparent from fig 10 b that introducing redundancy to the centralized layout gained more momentum for resilience growth than the decentralized layout this is because in decentralized networks volumetric flows can be discharged through several separated main collectors as opposed to centralized ones where there exist very limited primary collectors therefore the lack of effective flow distribution pertaining to centralized networks can to some extent be compensated via redundant path implementation combining this effect with a substantial storage capacity in the centralized system approximately 43 bigger than that of the decentralized system forms a recipe for more rapid resilience growth it is evident that except for the first 20 25 of loops for the centralized solutions the placement of additional loops at upstream outperformed those downstream for both structures this indicates that the placement of initial redundant pathways in this case up to the first 25 both at downstream and upstream performs quite similarly sometimes in favour of downstream further the performance of all three approaches tends to converge for decentralized scenarios when passing almost 80 loops it was also found that the centrality approach substantially outperformed the other two strategies by up to 60 loops for centralized and 70 loops for decentralized configurations thereafter the upstream approach performed slightly better than the centrality one this is because despite the improved performance by first targeting the nodes for connection to the main collectors by the centrality approach placing around 65 of the loops all at upstream could attenuate flood flows more effectively this attenuation is induced by increasing the time of concentration of the entire catchment and dispersing the increased discharges more homogenously through the network similarly fig 10 c and d represent the same implications as fig 10 a and b but when the networks are subject to high intensity rainfall event 25 year event as shown in these figures the significance of decentralization implemented during the design stage is more highlighted under such extreme storm condition similar to the 5 year event the resilience growth rate of centralized scenarios ranging by 8 was recorded to be greater than that of decentralized ones ranging by 5 however the decentralized branch tree solution recorded an hpi of 70 as opposed to 65 for the centralized one continuously outperforming the centralized solutions this finding indicates that despite imposing good flow redistribution via redundancy on centralized solutions alongside their substantial storage capacity topological decentralization executed at the design stage plays a more crucial role in achieving a higher resilience under heavy rain events in terms of different redundancy deployment strategies the patterns achieved are somewhat analogous to those obtained under the 5 year event this shows that the upstream approach outperformed the downstream one starting from 25 for centralized and 20 loops for decentralized solutions however the implementation of these three approaches tends to perform relatively similar for the decentralized network passing around 80 loops moreover centrality approach outperformed the other two approaches by up to 45 loops for the centralized solutions whereas its performance was relatively close to the upstream approach in decentralized networks these implications combined with those achieved under the 5 year rainfall event indicate that the more extreme the event the more significant the impact of redundant paths placement at upstream furthermore as this region entirely flat often faces a problematic inundation period we plotted below the flood duration in hours for both structures with no loops with 25 loops 50 loops 75 loops and 100 loops maximum as shown in fig 11 under 5 and 25 year rainfall events note that as the centrality approach generally outperformed the other two approaches i e upstream and downstream we only showed the flood duration results when redundant paths were constructed using the centrality approach fig 11 the implications of the other two approaches can be found in this manuscript s supplementary material fig 11 shows that as a general pattern when more redundancy is introduced to both structure types the observed flood duration is more reduced the flood duration was reduced from approximately 2 h for the branch network to approximately 1 25 h for the 100 looped system under the 5 year storm event for both structures likewise flood duration gradually waned under the 25 year event when redundancy was introduced with each step of implementation 25 loops 50 loops etc ranging from more than 4 h for the branch network to approximately 3 h for the fully looped structure in addition the decentralized layouts yielded a shorter flood duration than their centralized counterparts with the same loop percentage however there are two exceptions for the networks with 75 and 100 loops under the 5 year storm even where the centralized solutions exhibit lesser flood duration compared to their decentralized ones the reason is that when combining a big storage capacity pertaining to centralized solutions 43 larger with high level of redundancy around 75 loops and more centralized networks outperform decentralized in terms of flood duration however under heavier storm event 25 year event such trade offs turn in favour of flow redistribution imposed by redundancy rather than storage capacity and that is why decentralized structures outperform centralized ones under heavier events in terms of both flood magnitude and duration regardless of the big capacity in the centralized solutions these implications further support the effectiveness of redundant paths for reducing flooding duration as another major component of the resilience definition 3 2 structural failure with regard to structural failure we significantly reduced the relevant sewer diameters to 10 mm to replicate the sewer blockage in the system mugume et al 2014 nonetheless as opposed to the method introduced in mugume et al 2015 where sewer collapse is simulated randomly and cumulatively which can be more useful when the system experiences earthquake stress or random attacks we addressed sewer failure successively and only for large sewers in this study this is because the failure of upstream located sewers did not significantly deteriorate the system resilience as they often carried lower discharge volumes moreover the decentralized scenarios were disregarded herein for the purpose of structural failure because the centralized layout is more vulnerable due to the existence of unique and limited pathways major collectors to discharge the design peak runoff as a result to better showcase and support the implication of blockage consequences on resilience only the nine largest sewers downstream were investigated see fig 12 the results indicate that the blockage of sewer 0 directly connected to the outlet would completely fail the entire system even under the design rainfall event this highlights the vulnerability of centralized layouts since the design peak runoff cannot escape from the system the resilience results of the other eight largest sewer failures under design rainfall are depicted in fig 13 a c fig 13 a demonstrates the results corresponding to the upstream approach b demonstrates the results corresponding to the downstream approach and c demonstrates the results corresponding the centrality approach with a minor modification explained in section 2 4 as shown in fig 13 a cumulatively adding alternative water pathways at each step i e 10 loops 20 loops etc with upstream approach could not significantly enhance the structural resilience via hpi measure under the occurrence of sewer failures 1 4 these sewers had the largest diameter that is 2 m in other words resilience was just slightly improved after implementing each loop step when cumulatively introduced from the upstream locations such an implementation however is accompanied by a better improvement when considering the failure of sewers 5 to 8 thanks to their central locations in the network once the cumulative implementation of redundancy was initiated by downstream approach the resilience was enhanced more rapidly at each step under all sewer failure scenarios see fig 13 a and b this is associated with placing redundant paths in the same sections of failure locations i e both failure and redundancy locations are at downstream sections for effectively storing and dispersing the backwater coming from the blocked sewers this resilience enhancement is specifically more apparent for the failure of sewers 5 to 8 relative to the upstream approach this is again related to the position of the sewers located in the center middle portion of the network to place this into context as the backwater resulting from these blocked sewers travelled upstream alternative pathways were able to retrieve and exchange the discharges to the other parts of the network transferring them between the main large collectors for better and quicker dispersion of the flows in addition once the redundant paths were implemented using the centrality approach the resilience improvement rate received even more successful momentum compared to the downstream approach see fig 13 b and c centrality approach marginally outperformed the downstream one under the failure of sewers 1 4 again this is because the backwater effect occurring from these sewers does not pass main large collectors along their journey to the upstream areas upper left of the network to help them in retrieving a portion of this water in contrast a more significant resilience increase was observed after the collapse of sewers 4 8 specifically sewer 8 compared to the downstream approach for instance the failure of sewer 8 had a constant hpi value of 75 from the network without loop up to the first 10 loops via the downstream approach whereas hpi measure concluded the first 10 loops at approximately 87 using the centrality approach this is correlated with the initiation of constructing the extra pathways surrounding each blocked sewer via the modified centrality approach by leveraging the flow redistribution of backwater flows and thereby yielding a better and quicker flood attenuation from figs 12 and 13 c it is apparent that the backwater coming from the failure of sewer 8 would be more accessible to the major collectors pipelines surrounding its location thus placing alternative paths first around those critical locations using the centrality approach may further help in retrieving and exchanging the design flow volumes between such major pipelines 4 limitations advantages and future work as the implications of this study are based on one specific case study and the local precipitation properties the broad generalization of the results may not be always advisable however we believe that the patterns achieved for both centralized and decentralized layouts under functional and structural failure would still be relevant and applicable regardless of the storm and the case study characteristics it should also be noted that we did not change the major structural characteristics of centralized and decentralized networks via redundancy that is diameter slope length and total storage capacity remained constant for each structure before and after loops introduction however with this minor modification creating redundancy redundant flow paths we could push up resilience performance even by up to 8 under functional failure enlarging added sewers can also be considered at critical locations for further resilience enhancement note that depending on the phase of project e g design or rehabilitation stage introducing redundancy can change the costs related to the system e g lcc for instance during the planning stage introduction of redundant paths converts the existence of two manholes to one see fig 3 and thus could reduce the overall design costs however regardless of the project phase based on our previous experimentation and lcc formula used in this study expenses related to manholes are much smaller than piping process in the network hence although we did not discuss the implications of redundancy implementation for lcc variations redundancy in our context would have marginally affected the lcc in the future we aim to use cumulative runoff areas of each pipe as the edge weighting function instead of diameters for ranking the critical nodes determined by eigenvector centrality approach this allows identifying and ranking the influential nodes more accurately for the introduction of redundant flow pathways we will also present the transition towards an integrated framework by introducing limited alternative path flows to the most sensitive locations of de centralized networks this is achieved by optimizing the inlet offset of the added sewers while integrating the green blue infrastructures gbis this framework will be implemented based on the weak points of the network or even considering functional interdependency e g existing a hospital or school over the road network to successfully avoid or minimize any functional and structural failure surrounding these critical infrastructures 5 conclusion and final remarks there is an urgent need to transition towards resilient usns at all stages as climate change driven precipitations sewer blockages and aging elements are deteriorating the functional and structural operation of these systems therefore a redundancy promoting framework was developed in this study based on three approaches cumulatively introducing redundant water flow paths from upstream downstream and sensitive locations this framework seeks to enhance the usn resilience under functional and structural failure for optimal centralized and decentralized usns this was achieved by leveraging an efficient re distribution of water flows throughout the network the main findings of this study are as follows the importance of topological decentralization is highlighted during the design stage in terms of both capital savings and resilience enhancement using a tailored graph theory based topological measure i e eigenvector centrality the sensitive and critical locations for introducing redundant paths are identified by first interacting with the main collectors of the network constructing redundant paths forming loops initially at critical locations using eigenvector centrality approach outperforms the other two strategies experiencing functional failure however after exceeding a loop threshold the placement of redundant paths all at upstream performs marginally better especially under heavier storm events redundancy in centralized networks contributes more to resilience than that in decentralized networks this is because the lack of efficient flow distribution in centralized networks can be compensated to certain extent via redundant path implementation combining this effect with their substantial storage capacity compared to decentralized ones forms a recipe for more rapid resilience growth although the resilience growth of centralized networks with redundant flow paths forming loops progresses more rapidly than decentralized solutions the decentralized layout solutions with loops continuously outperform centralized ones during heavy rain events introducing redundant paths at downstream would be more promising for centralized layouts experiencing structural failure because the blockage in major pipelines located downstream with more discharge volumes would affect the system s resilience more than upstream blockages data availability all

15698,keeping water clean is of vital significance for human health and environmental protection in order to remove organic micro pollutants and natural organic substances in water bodies and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously this study synthesized a multifunctional porous β cyclodextrin polymer with a high specific surface area by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and rigid benzene rings respectively which was then polymerized with crosslinking agent 4 4 bis chloromethyl 1 1 biphenyl bcmbp in an ionic liquid system the grafting of quaternary ammonium groups was beneficial for the removal of negative charged humic acid ha and sterilization the introduction of numerous rigid structures during benzylation and friedel crafts alkylation reaction could significantly improve the porosity and specific surface area of the polymer conducive to the exposure of cyclodextrin binding sites and contaminant adsorption by changing the proportions of quaternization and benzylation the structure and surface properties of the polymer could be adjusted thus further regulating the adsorption performance compared with activated carbon the polymer named bqcd bp with a huge surface area of 1133 m2 g 1 prepared under optimized conditions showed outstanding adsorption performance and sterilization ability the pseudo second order kinetic constant of bqcd

water environment pose serious threats to human health and ecological security among them organic micro pollution a hot topic in water bodies brings hazards to the aquatic environment and risks to human health piai et al 2019 the ever increasing concentration of natural organic matter nom poses severe challenges to water treatment affecting the removal of nom as well as other organic and inorganic pollutants from water bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 in addition microbial contaminants are the major causes of waterborne disease outbreaks si et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to highlight and develop various technologies to remove the above pollutants adsorption is an efficient and economical method for water treatment genz et al 2008 activated carbon is a versatile and widely used adsorbent nath and bhakhar 2011 especially for the removal of hydrophobic and nonpolar organics however it is unsatisfying for negative charged humic acid ha scavenging using unmodified activated carbons dias et al 2007 to improve performance for some targeted pollutants special treatment to change the physical and chemical surface properties is needed feng et al 2019 maghsoodloo et

aquatic pathogenic microorganisms could mainly be eliminated by chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet disinfection dodd 2012 xu et al 2002 unavoidably generating detrimental disinfection byproducts dbps during water disinfection however the actual removal of organic pollutants and microorganisms requires a combination of two or more processes leading to a large cost of construction investment

improvement of specific surface area and adsorption performance it is worth noting that the study of material performance associated structure regulation is of great significance which is beneficial for the development of materials with desired properties although the correlation between material structure regulation and properties have been reported in other porous materials chen et al 2011 feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 it is rarely studied systematically in the preparation of cyclodextrin polymers in addition similar to miex most cyclodextrin based polymers are also synthesized in organic solvents in a volatile and harmful manner to humans and environment making it urgent to find a green system ionic liquid as a solvent and catalyst schoetz et al 2018 is non volatile non flammable adjustable well soluble and reusable blanchard et al 1999 zhou et al 2012 serving as an ideal alternative to traditional harmful organic solvents and heterogeneous catalysts this study aims to develop a multifunctional cd polymer with a large specific surface area in an ionic liquid system so as to eliminate micropollutants and nom and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously in order to

adsorbent and bpa and ha were selected as model pollutants to investigate the adsorption performance and mechanisms of the polymer in order to make the results more reliable the stability of bpa and ha solutions were studied before experiment after a week of placement the concentrations of bpa and ha in the solution were almost unchanged indicating that they were stable during the experiment more details in table s4 the adsorbents were ground into 60 80 mesh particles before use all samples were filtered by an agilent 0 45 µm ptfe q filter membrane the concentrations of bpa were detected by

is provided in the supporting information si 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics in the kinetics studies the initial concentrations of bpa and ha were both 20 mg l 1 specifically 15 mg of adsorbent was added to 15 ml of pollutant solution and stirred samples were taken from 30 s to 30 min the removal efficiency is calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 denotes the initial concentration of pollutants and ct mg l 1 is the concentration of the pollutant at time t the kinetic data were fitted with pseudo second order kinetics and the elovich model provided in text s4 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm in the isotherm studies 15 mg of adsorbent was added to 30 ml of different initial concentrations of pollutant solutions 20 40 60 80 100 150 200 and 300 mg l 1 under shaking at 150 rpm for 12 h to reach equilibrium the adsorption capacity is calculated by the following equation 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce mg l 1 represent the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively the isotherm data were fitted with freundlich and langmuir models to evaluate the adsorption capacity the formula can refer to the text s4 2 4 3 influencing factors of adsorption to understand the adsorption mechanism of polymer bqcd bp the influence of solution ph ionic strength and ethanol ratio on adsorption was investigated in the present paper in detail 30 mg of bqcd bp was added to 30 ml of pollutant solution 20 mg l 1 which was shaken for some time to reach equilibrium according to the kinetic experiment the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl and naoh aqueous solutions in the range of 2 12 the ionic strength was represented by nacl aqueous solution ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mol l 1 the ratio of ethanol was set to 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 in the competitive experiment bpa was selected as the main solute and ha was chosen as the competitor with a concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l 1 and the concentration of bpa was set to 200 mg l 1 to ensure incomplete adsorption by bqcd bp 1 mg l 1 2 4 4 regeneration experiment a total of 30 mg of bqcd bp was added to 30 ml of pollutant solution 20 mg l 1 to achieve equilibrium at room temperature methanol and a mixture of methanol and hydrochloric acid solution volume ratio 9 1 were selected as the elution solvents of the polymer adsorbed with bpa and ha respectively at room temperature six adsorption and desorption cycles were carried out 2 5 antibacterial performance e coli strain was chosen to evaluate the disinfection potential of bqcd bp and ac as a control in detail e coli strain was inoculated into fresh luria broth medium and then shaken in an incubator overnight at 200 rpm and 37 c for 16 h to reach the exponential growth then bacterial cells were obtained via centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and washed three times with sterile water lastly the bacterial cells were resuspended in sterile water to prepare a bacterial stock solution with the cell density of approximately 107 cfu ml 1 for the sterilization assay bacterial stock solution was diluted to 105 cfu ml 1 with sterile water in 40 ml of which different amounts of materials were added and then transformed in the incubator at 200 rpm for 1 h at 25 c then 100 µl supernatant was taken to quantify bacterial concentration by the heterotrophic plate count method lastly the petri dishes were incubated at 37 c for 20 h and the number of colonies was counted 2 6 application in realistic river water a sample of local river water was taken from jiuxiang river nanjing china to evaluate the performance of bqcd bp in practical application the water quality was analyzed by eems before and after the treatment the concentration of bpa was adjusted to 50 μg l 1 to explore the removal efficiency of the material specifically 5 mg of bqcd bp was put into 100 ml of river water and then enriched through solid phase extraction the culturable colonies of jiuxiang river water were obtained by the plate counting methods provided above to investigate the antibacterial property of bqcd bp it was put into 40 ml of river water and the number of colonies was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of synthesis conditions in this study β cd was first quaternized to various degrees of 3 5 10 and 15 and then benzylated to different degrees of 3 6 and 10 the pore structures and surface properties of the synthetic materials at different ratios are shown in table 1 and figs s6 s7 generally under the same degree of quaternization with the increase of bnbr the specific surface area of the polymer was improved nevertheless under the same degree of benzylation the amount of quaternary ammonium salt exerted little effect on the specific surface area and pore size of polymers the rigid structures in the polymer would cause an untightly stacked polymer molecular chain resulting in self porosity budd et al 2004 in this study bnbr not only act as a rigid structure but also provided reaction site for subsequent friedel crafts alkylation reaction to introduce new rigid structures the specific surface area of the cyclodextrin polymer prepared at the optimal ratio of cd q b 1 10 10 reached 1133 m2 g 1 the specific surface area of the polymer prepared with the ratio of cd q b 1 3 15 was lower than that of cd q b 1 3 10 which might be attributed to pore blockage yang et al 2022 because of the flexible molecular chain of quaternary ammonium salt the increased amount of the quaternary ammonium salt exerted no significant effect on the specific surface area of the polymer in order to clarify the relationship between the raw material ratio and the material structure and surface properties the correlation analysis of various parameters was carried out as can be ssen from table s5 the specific surface area was significantly correlated to the bnbr amount spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ 1 000 p 0 001 and the amount of quaternary ammonium salt was insignificantly correlated with the specific surface area and pore size the material hydrophilicity is closely related to the functional groups on the material surface as shown in table 1 the contact angles of cyclodextrin polymers prepared under different conditions represented significant differences indicating different hydrophilicity for the prepared cd polymers the hydroxyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups on the surface were hydrophilic özden et al 1997 while the long alkyl chains in the quaternary ammonium salt and benzene rings were hydrophobic the hydrophilicity of the polymer is the result of the combined effect of the above groups in conclusion the pore structure and the number of surface functional groups of the polymer could be easily adjusted by reasonable optimization of the ratio of quaternary ammonium salt and bnbr and polymers with high specific surface area and suitable surface hydrophilicity could be obtained in this study the cyclodextrin polymer prepared with cd q b 1 10 10 named bqcd bp was selected for subsequent characterization studies by comprehensively considering the specific surface area and surface hydrophilicity 3 2 characterization according to the infrared spectrum presented in fig 2 a the resonations at 1155 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 were the c o c and c oh stretching vibrations of β cd the adsorption peak at 1486 cm 1 of eta was attributed to the c n stretching vibrations loubaki et al 1991 which was still significant in qcd indicating the quaternization of cd the characteristic peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 of bqcd were relevant to the c c stretching vibration of aromatic rings suggesting the benzylation of qcd the crosslinking of bcmbp was evidenced by the disappearing adsorption peak corresponding to the chloromethyl at 720 cm 1 of the polymer schute and rose 2015 as shown in fig 2b zeta potentials on the polymer surface were all greater than zero within the ph range of 2 10 indicating the positively charged material surface it should be noted that the zeta potential of the polymer surface reached as high as 24 9 mv without adjusting the solution ph due to the introduction of numerous quaternary ammonium groups chen et al 2020 the elemental analysis is listed in table s6 the n content in bqcd bp was measured to be 0 46 based on which the eta content in the polymer was 4 98 the o content in the polymer was 8 83 according to which the β cyclodextrin content in bqcd bp could be calculated to be 28 3 after deducting the oxygen of eta the eta content was also analyzed to be 5 17 by the ion exchange method table s6 consistent with the results measured by elemental analysis the tga analysis fig 2c presented the excellent thermodynamic stability of bqcd bp with a weight loss of only 6 at 310 c due to the large introduction of rigid structures chen et al 2019 according to the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s6 bqcd bp contained abundant pores with a large specific surface area of 1133 m2 g 1 attributed to the abundant rigid structures in the polymer the pore size distribution fig 2d further revealed the abundance of micropores and mesopores in bqcd bp with an average pore diameter of 2 93 nm sem image fig 2e showed that bqcd bp had a fluffy micro structure and a rough surface with significant micron scale macro pores in addition numerous micropores in the polymer were identified by the tem image fig 2f on this basis bqcd bp contained many microporous and macroporous structures consistent with the results obtained in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 3 3 adsorption kinetics this section explored the adsorption kinetics of bpa and ha at the concentration of 20 mg l 1 of cd polymers prepared under different conditions as shown in fig s8 all the cd polymers presented an extremely high adsorption rate for bpa the adsorption equilibrium of bpa on other cd polymers could be reached in about 5 min except for cd polymer prepared with cd q b 1 3 15 which needs about 20 min at adsorption equilibrium the bpa removal rate on all cd polymers was close to 100 except for those polymers prepared with cd q b 1 3 3 owing to the relative poor specific surface area the adsorption capacity of different cd polymers for ha varied significantly with the removal efficiency surging from 9 6 to 99 at 30 min and the adsorption rate constants of bpa and ha varied greatly among different cd polymers with the results listed in table s7 in order to further analyze the correlations between material structure and adsorption performance at different synthesis ratios the relationship between specific surface area contact angle pore size and adsorption rate constant was analyzed when the contact angle of the material was less than 90 the material was relatively hydrophilic and the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic constant of bpa was significantly positively correlated with the specific surface area of the material ρ 0 900 p 0 05 table s8 however no such obvious correlation was observed when the material was hydrophobic possibly because the hydrophilicity of the material surface had a great influence on the adsorption rate constant and the adsorbent failed to be well distributed into the water to fully contact with pollutants despite the large effect of the specific surface area ha showed an insignificant correlation with the specific surface area this probably was because that ha was mainly adsorbed through macropores of polymers due to its large molecule and the diffusion process was limited by the pore size of materials in conclusion the structure especially the specific surface area and surface properties of polymers could significantly affect their adsorption capacity for pollutants therefore cd polymers with excellent adsorption properties for target pollutants could be obtained by the reasonable adjustment of the structure and surface properties of materials what should be noted is that although the regulation of material performance by structure modification has been studied by other researches for the preparation of porous polymers such as cofs and pims gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2011 tan et al 2021 yang et al 2019 it is rarely investigated for cd polymers to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the prepared cyclodextrin polymers in the following studies considering the adsorption effects of bpa and ha the polymer prepared with cd q b 1 10 10 named bqcd bp was selected for relevant experiments and ac was chosen for comparison as can be seen from fig 3 the removal efficiency of bqcd bp exceeded 90 within 60 s for bpa while that of ac was merely 45 bpa could be fully adsorbed within 2 5 min by bqcd bp which was faster than by ac and needed approximately 15 min to achieve a full removal fig 3 similarly bqcd bp exhibited excellent adsorption performance for ha achieving a removal efficiency of 87 8 much higher than the 25 of ac at 30 min the superior removal efficiency of ha by bqcd bp attributed to it is positive charge suitable for the removal of negatively charged molecules the water samples before and after adsorption were also analyzed using eems to estimate the removal efficiency of ha the eem plot of the simulated ha water sample before the adsorption represented abundant c3 component according to the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 table s12 and the water sample after adsorption by bqcd bp was almost blank fig s9 in order to better compare the experimental results the kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model and elovich model respectively as illustrated in fig s10 and table s9 both models fitted well for bqcd bp and ac r 2 0 97 the pseudo second order rate constant of bpa adsorption to bqcd bp was 1 2058 mg g 1 min 1 50 times higher than that of ac 0 0256 g mg 1 min 1 under identical experimental condition the ultrahigh adsorption rate of bpa by bqcd bp was attributed to the large specific surface area and sufficient adsorption sites for contaminant molecules the hydrophobic cavity of β cyclodextrin which could be applied by including organic contaminants with host guest interaction crini 2005 promoted the removal of hydrophobic bpa for ha adsorption to bqcd bp the elovich model fitted better than the pseudo second order kinetic model with a larger correlation coefficient revealing the decreasing adsorption rate with the enhanced adsorption amount or coverage in this experiment marques et al 2019 indicating that the adsorption of ha by bqcd bp was rapid at the first time and then turned slower due to internal diffusion the pseudo second order kinetic constant of ha to bqcd bp was twice more than that of ac abundant quaternary ammonium groups of the bqcd bp interacted with the negative charged ha through electrostatic interaction contributing to the rapid removal of ha from water moreover the rapid diffusion was supported by the external macropores in bqcd bp observed in tem and the high water wetting ability observed in the contact angle of fig s7 furthermore it could not be ignored that a strong hydrophobic interaction played a role in the removal of ha due to abundant functional groups schulten and schnitzer 1993 3 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacities of bqcd bp and ac for bpa and ha at different concentrations are shown in fig 4 and table s10 the adsorption isotherms of bqcd bp fitted well with the freundlich model r2 0 96 for both pollutants indicating heterogeneous and multi layer adsorption 1 n was less than 0 5 implying the potential preferential adsorption it could be seen that the adsorption capacity of polymer for bpa was 257 75 mg g 1 much greater than that of ac 100 31 mg g 1 at the bpa concentration of 300 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption of ha at the equilibrium of bqcd bp was 142 mg g 1 larger than that of most reported adsorbents mostly below 100 mg g 1 to our knowledge bouras et al 2015 dong et al 2014 tavengwa et al 2016 zulfikar et al 2016 3 5 influencing factors of adsorption this section investigated the factors influencing the adsorption process including solution ph nacl concentration and ethanol water ratio ph could change the charge property of adsorbent and the existing form of pollutants in an aqueous solution soni and padmaja 2014 ionic concentration could impact the solubility of pollutants and further influence the adsorbent contaminant interactions zhang et al 2010 in addition the ethanol water ratio was studied to further explicate the interaction type 3 5 1 effects of ph as depicted in fig 5 a the adsorption of bpa was almost independent of ph in the wide range of 2 12 and the removal efficiency at ph 12 remained superior to be 97 68 bpa was primarily removed from water by hydrophobic interaction with the cavities of β cyclodextrin and other hydrophobic structures of polymer yang et al 2016 in addition cation π interaction one intermolecular force kong et al 2020 and hydrogen bonds might occur between the bpa and adsorbents the pka of bpa was 10 3 and at a ph larger than pka bpa started to dissociate destructing the hydrogen bonds meanwhile the bqcd bp surface was negatively charged as illustrated in zeta potential which caused electrostatic repulsion between bpa and bqcd bp considering the high specific surface area of bqcd bp abundant β cyclodextrin cavities and other hydrophobic structures are easily accessible thus hydrophobic interaction dominated the bpa removal and the influence of ph is minimal only a decrease by 2 32 ha could be completely removed at the solution ph ranging from 2 to 8 ion exchange was the main force since the bqcd bp was positive at the ph of 2 10 the removal efficiency slightly declined by 0 5 at ph 10 because the positive charge of bqcd bp was reduced with the rising ph which weakened the electrostatic force the adsorption efficiency slumped to 75 at a ph of 12 several reasons could explain this phenomenon first the zeta potential of bqcd bp even decreased to negative resulting in a large reduction in the adsorption capacity of negatively charged ha second numerous hydroxide ions competed with ha for adsorption in aqueous solution at a ph of 12 3 5 2 effects of ionic strength in order to evaluate the applicability of the material prepared in this study the effect of ionic strength on adsorption was studied and nacl was selected to investigate the effect of ionic strength as shown in fig 5b nacl with a concentration changing from 0 to 0 5 mol l 1 had no significant influence on the adsorption of bpa and ha as we all know the presence of salt would reduce the solubility of substances which in turn promoted the hydrophobic interaction between target molecules and adsorbents liu et al 2019 on the other hand the salt out effect destroyed the hydrogen bonds which would weaken the adsorption the negligible impact of nacl on bpa adsorption indicating that the salt out effect and hydrophobic interaction ehanced by salt were not critical which was in consistent with most reported cd polymers obviously ion exchange between ha and the quaternary ammonium groups on bqcd bp played an important role in ha removal unpredictably ha removal efficiency remained 100 as the concentration of nacl increased to 0 5 mol l 1 this might be attributed to the strong ha bqcd bp interaction or the existence of multiple mechanisms considering the complex structure of ha which was composed of abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl group carboxyl group and benzene ring hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction might also play an important role during adsorption 3 5 3 effects of ethanol water ratio it is reported that the presence of ethanol can undermine the hydrophobic effect maeda et al 2019 therefore the effect of ethanol water ratio on bpa and ha removal was studied in this section as plotted in the bar chart fig 5c the removal efficiency of bpa significantly declined from 99 6 to 22 9 with the volume ratio of ethanol increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 the worst removal efficiency was merely 10 6 when ethanol occupied 90 in bulk solution the significant negative effect of ethanol again verifed that hydrophobic interaction was the primary force between bpa and bqcd bp although the effect on ha was not as significant as that on bpa the removal efficiency of ha also decreased by 23 2 when the proportion of ethanol increased to 80 indicating that in addition to ion exchange hydrophobic interaction also played an important role during adsorption consistent with the result discussed above 3 5 4 competitive adsorption of bpa and ha on polymer due to the coexistence of organic micropollutants and ha in actual water considering that the adsorption of ha and bpa involved hydrogen bond and hydrophobic effect as mentioned above we identified whether competitive adsorption existed between bpa and ha bpa was used as the target pollutant to investigate the effect of different concentrations of ha on its removal efficiency specifically 200 mg l 1 bpa was chosen since bpa at this concentration could not be fully removed by bqcd bp 1 mg ml 1 to make the consequence more evident the selected ha concentration ranged from 0 to 50 mg l 1 greater than the concentration in aquatic ecosystems philippe and schaumann 2014 results showed that fig 6 no influence of the bpa removal with the ha concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l 1 proving the varying main adsorption sites due to the different main adsorption mechanisms of the materials for bpa and ha as well as the sufficient adsorption sites the removal efficiency of bpa and ha would not reduce on account of competitive adsorption in actual application taken together the synthesized bqcd bp presented stable performance under various water chemistry conditions 3 6 recyclability the regeneration performance remains a critical factor in evaluating the property of adsorbents serving as a determinant of the application cost and environmental benefit as seen in fig 7 bpa could be easily eluted from bqcd bp with methanol at room temperature and bqcd bp still maintained a very high removal efficiency of bpa of nearly 100 after six adsorption desorption cycles it was challenging to completely elute ha from the polymer with nacl solution due to various interaction forces and thus a mixture of methanol and hydrochloric acid was used for elution during regeneration after six adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency was only slightly lessened still as high as 94 compared with the inconvenient and energy consuming regeneration of ac the bqcd bp represented excellent regeneration performance enabling it to be a promising adsorbent 3 7 antibacterial performance the present study selected e coli to evaluate the antibacterial performance of bqcd bp as shown in fig 8 a and b bqcd bp killed most of e coli reaching a 90 sterilization rate after 1 h contact when the dosage was 1 g l 1 much better than that of ac in addition bqcd bp also showed comparable bactericidal performance with these reported materials including quaternized modified graphene materials tu et al 2013 quaternized cyclodextrin materials liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 polyethylenimine derived polymer zhang et al 2016 and ag based antibacterial materials zhang et al 2013 the bactericidal property of bqcd bp increased from 81 6 to 95 7 as the bqcd bp concentration up from 0 5 to 5 g l 1 the sem photographs of e coli before and after the bqcd bp treatment are presented in fig 8 c d evidently the morphologies of e coli were greatly changed in particular the bacterial cell membrane was obviously destroyed after contact with bqcd bp the hydrophobic alkyl chains of the quaternary ammonium groups could scratch the cell membrane leading to the rupture of the membrane and the death of the bacteria carpio et al 2014 the introduction of numerous quaternary ammonium groups encoded the cd polymer with excellent disinfection performance making it possible to be applied during disinfection in sewage treatment 3 8 application in actual water bodies bqcd bp was applied to treat multiple contaminants containing natural river water the basic parameters of the river are listed in table s11 it can be seen that the cod of the river water after bqcd bp treatment could not be detected implying that the organic matter in the water body was almost removed moreover eem analyses of the river water before and after adsorption were carried out fig s11 abundant c4 component which was identified to correspond to protein like fluorophores tryptophan like substances and microbial delivered substances stedmon et al 2011 and few c1 component fulvic acid like organics and terrestrial derivative organics hambly et al 2015 existed in river water after 2 h treatment the fluorescent dom substances of the river water were almost completely removed the removal efficiency of uv254 was further measured and the removal rate reached 87 after adsorption equilibrium that is most of the organic matter absorbing at 254 nm wavelength in river water was removed in addition the removal of target pollutant bpa in actual water was investigated indicating the complete adsorption of bpa and the suitability of the material for removing micropollutants from actual complex environmental water bodies surprisingly the removal efficiency of tp reached as high as 92 meeting the ⅱ level standard of environmental quality standards for surface water there were two forms of phosphorus in water bodies i e dissolved phosphorus and particulate phosphorus which could be separated through a 0 45 µm filter jia et al 2022 orthophosphate ortho p was the majority of total dissolved p tdp mainly existing in various types of phosphate ions phosphates can be removed by bqcd bp through electrostatic interaction due to the introduction of quaternary ammonium groups moreover the protonated phosphate anions h2po4 and hpo4 2 can interact with h bond donors and acceptors on the surface of bqcd bp via hydrogen bonding wu et al 2020 and the high surface area would greatly enhance the adsorption of phosphate liu et al 2018 chemical reaction and precipitation might be other involved mechanisms during phosphate removal yang et al 2006 the specific mechanism of the material interaction with phosphorus still requires further investigation the sterilization experiment showed a reduced number of bacteria in the river water by 82 fig s12 and table s11 indicating that bqcd bp maintained stable disinfection performance towards river water containing about 4 105 cfu ml 1 culturable bacteria the above results showed that the synthetic material bqcd bp was effective in removing substances in the actual water body 4 conclusions in summary a novel multifunctional porous cyclodextrin polymer with a large specific surface area for rapid removal of multiple contaminants including bpa ha and pathogens was designed via the friedel crafts alkylation reaction between modified β cyclodextrin and bcmbp in the homogeneous bmim cl fecl3 ionic liquid system which is used both as solvent and lewis acid catalyst the following conclusions were drawn from our study the pore regulation and surface properties are adjusted by modifying the ratios of eta and bnbr in the first and second steps separately a series of experiments reveal the relevance of specific surface areas to the benzylation ratios generally the more benzene rings grafted the more porous and the larger the specific surface area of the polymer in addition the polymer hydrophilicity is affected by both the degrees of quaternization and benzylation the quaternary ammonium groups on the polymer are beneficial to ha removal and pathogen killing the porous structure and high specific surface area of the polymer greatly promote the removal of organic micropollutants polymer exhibits excellent adsorption performance which the process is almost unaffected by hydrochemical conditions and is very convenient to regenerate the polymer shows excellent sterilization properties with a bactericidal efficiency of 96 at a dosage of 2 g l 1 towards e coli multiple interactions are involved in the adsorption bpa adsorption is mainly through the host guest interaction and hydrophobic effect with the hydrophobic groups on the material while the ha removal is primarily through ion exchange in which hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effect get involved and make a difference the outstanding adsorption and antibacterial performance of the polymer are proven in actual water bodies bpa and fluorescent organics are almost completely eradicated polymer has a 82 antibacterial ability to viable bacteria in realistic river water in addition it has remarkable removal performance for cod which the value is below the detection limit after treatment and tp with a removal efficiency of 92 taken together the polymer as a multifunctional material is promising for application in actual complex water bodies we will focus on the systematic study of the removal mechanisms of conventional pollutants such as cod nh3 n and tp and their relationship with the comprehensive effect of multiple organic substances in actual water bodies and the secondary treated

15698,keeping water clean is of vital significance for human health and environmental protection in order to remove organic micro pollutants and natural organic substances in water bodies and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously this study synthesized a multifunctional porous β cyclodextrin polymer with a high specific surface area by introducing quaternary ammonium groups and rigid benzene rings respectively which was then polymerized with crosslinking agent 4 4 bis chloromethyl 1 1 biphenyl bcmbp in an ionic liquid system the grafting of quaternary ammonium groups was beneficial for the removal of negative charged humic acid ha and sterilization the introduction of numerous rigid structures during benzylation and friedel crafts alkylation reaction could significantly improve the porosity and specific surface area of the polymer conducive to the exposure of cyclodextrin binding sites and contaminant adsorption by changing the proportions of quaternization and benzylation the structure and surface properties of the polymer could be adjusted thus further regulating the adsorption performance compared with activated carbon the polymer named bqcd bp with a huge surface area of 1133 m2 g 1 prepared under optimized conditions showed outstanding adsorption performance and sterilization ability the pseudo second order kinetic constant of bqcd bp reached 1 2058 g mg 1 min 1 which was approximately 50 times greater than that of activated carbon 0 0256 g mg 1 min 1 under the same experimental condition the adsorption capacity of bqcd bp to ha was twice as high as that to ac and the antibacterial ability of bqcd bp was significant achieving 90 at the dosage of 1g l 1 moreover the adsorption process was hardly affected by the hydrochemical conditions and the polymer was easy to regenerate in addition the excellent adsorption and antibacterial performance of the polymer were also identified by natural water treatment cod was almost completely removed and the removal efficiency of tp reached 92 after contact with bqcd bp the sterilization rate of bqcd bp to viable bacteria in complex water bodies reached 82 undoubtedly bqcd bp is

water environment pose serious threats to human health and ecological security among them organic micro pollution a hot topic in water bodies brings hazards to the aquatic environment and risks to human health piai et al 2019 the ever increasing concentration of natural organic matter nom poses severe challenges to water treatment affecting the removal of nom as well as other organic and inorganic pollutants from water bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2017 in addition microbial contaminants are the major causes of waterborne disease outbreaks si et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to highlight and develop various technologies to remove the above pollutants adsorption is an efficient and economical method for water treatment genz et al 2008 activated carbon is a versatile and widely used adsorbent nath and bhakhar 2011 especially for the removal of hydrophobic and nonpolar organics however it is unsatisfying for negative charged humic acid ha scavenging using unmodified activated carbons dias et al 2007 to improve performance for some targeted pollutants special treatment to change the physical and chemical surface properties is needed feng et al 2019 maghsoodloo et al 2011 mohan et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 which increases the process complexity and production cost in addition the regeneration of activated carbon also requires high temperature ania et al 2004 aquatic pathogenic microorganisms could mainly be eliminated by chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet disinfection dodd 2012 xu et al 2002 unavoidably generating detrimental disinfection byproducts dbps during water disinfection however the actual removal of organic pollutants and microorganisms requires a combination of two or more processes leading to a large cost of construction investment and cumbersome procedures for this reason one process cleaning is in urgent demand especially the simultaneous removal of micropollutants nom and waterborne microbe by developing superior adsorbents different from conventional disinfection methods by chemical oxidation using chlorine ozone chlorine dioxide etc the physical contact based quaternary ammonium salt disinfection caused the bacteria death by piercing the hydrophobic cell membrane with hydrophobic alkyl chains asri et al 2014 reducing bacterial resistance and avoiding dbp formation jutaporn et al 2020 among which the application of quaternary ammonium resins qars have been reported for decades the most typical qars is miex a kind of polyacrylic acid resin extensively used for the removal of pollutants and nom drikas et al 2011 however miex is not applicable for organics with strong hydrophobicity and neutrality cation or amphotericity humbert et al 2005 2008 and its synthesis is often carried out in organic systems β cyclodextrin is non toxic biodegradable cheap and easy to obtain machut et al 2010 capable of encapsulating organic contaminants through a host guest interaction owing to its hydrophilic outer layers and hydrophobic cavity nowadays β cyclodextrin based materials as popular adsorbents have been widely studied alsbaiee et al 2016 li et al 2018 the majority of which nevertheless focused on the improvement of specific surface area and adsorption performance it is worth noting that the study of material performance associated structure regulation is of great significance which is beneficial for the development of materials with desired properties although the correlation between material structure regulation and properties have been reported in other porous materials chen et al 2011 feng et al 2021 yuan et al 2022 it is rarely studied systematically in the preparation of cyclodextrin polymers in addition similar to miex most cyclodextrin based polymers are also synthesized in organic solvents in a volatile and harmful manner to humans and environment making it urgent to find a green system ionic liquid as a solvent and catalyst schoetz et al 2018 is non volatile non flammable adjustable well soluble and reusable blanchard et al 1999 zhou et al 2012 serving as an ideal alternative to traditional harmful organic solvents and heterogeneous catalysts this study aims to develop a multifunctional cd polymer with a large specific surface area in an ionic liquid system so as to eliminate micropollutants and nom and kill pathogenic microorganisms simultaneously in order to remove nom and kill bacteria quaternary ammonium salts are grafted and rigid structures are introduced to create pores to remove organic contaminants in water a functionalized cd bqcd is synthesized then a novel multifunctional cd polymer bqcd bp is obtained by crossing with 4 4 bis chloromethyl 1 1 biphenyl bcmbp through friedel crafts alkylation reaction in 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride ferric chloride bmim cl fecl3 a kind of lewis acid ionic liquid functional groups can be reasonably regulated by adjusting the ratios of quaternization and rigid skeletons the underlying mechanism and the relationship between the structure regulation and adsorption effect are investigated for the first time the removal performance and mechanism are also discussed at last bqcd bp is used for multiple pollutant containing natural water treatment and its excellent water purification performance is proven in practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials β

to measure the water contact angle of the materials the eta content and the ζ potential of the polymer were also measured see details in text s3 2 4 adsorption experiments ac was used as a comparative adsorbent and bpa and ha were selected as model pollutants to investigate the adsorption performance and mechanisms of the polymer in order to make the results more reliable the stability of bpa and ha solutions were studied before experiment after a week of placement the concentrations of bpa and ha in the solution were almost unchanged indicating that they were stable during the experiment more details in table s4 the adsorbents were ground into 60 80 mesh particles before use all samples were filtered by an agilent 0 45 µm ptfe q filter membrane the concentrations of bpa were detected by

wavelength of 254 nm excitation emission matrix eem spectra of water samples of ha were also analyzed all experiments were carried out in triplicates to achieve average values the detailed information is provided in the supporting information si 2 4 1 adsorption kinetics in the kinetics studies the initial concentrations of bpa and ha were both 20 mg l 1 specifically 15 mg of adsorbent was added to 15 ml of pollutant solution and stirred samples were taken from 30 s to 30 min the removal efficiency is calculated as follows 1 removal efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 mg l 1 denotes the initial concentration of pollutants and ct mg l 1 is the concentration of the pollutant at time t the kinetic data were fitted with pseudo second order kinetics and the elovich model provided in text s4 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm in the isotherm studies 15 mg of adsorbent was added to 30 ml of different initial concentrations of pollutant solutions 20 40 60 80 100 150 200 and 300 mg l 1 under shaking at 150 rpm for 12 h to reach equilibrium the adsorption capacity is calculated by the following equation 2 q e c 0 c e m v where c0 and ce mg l 1 represent the initial and equilibrium concentrations respectively the isotherm data were fitted with freundlich and langmuir models to evaluate the adsorption capacity the formula can refer to the text s4 2 4 3 influencing factors of adsorption to understand the adsorption mechanism of polymer bqcd bp the influence of solution ph ionic strength and ethanol ratio on adsorption was investigated in the present paper in detail 30 mg of bqcd bp was added to 30 ml of pollutant solution 20 mg l 1 which was shaken for some time to reach equilibrium according to the kinetic experiment the solution ph was adjusted using 0 1 mol l 1 of hcl and naoh aqueous solutions in the range of 2 12 the ionic strength was represented by nacl aqueous solution ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mol l 1 the ratio of ethanol was set to 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 and 0 8 in the competitive experiment bpa was selected as the main solute and ha was chosen as the competitor with a concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l 1 and the concentration of bpa was set to 200 mg l 1 to ensure incomplete adsorption by bqcd bp 1 mg l 1 2 4 4 regeneration experiment a total of 30 mg of bqcd bp was added to 30 ml of pollutant solution 20 mg l 1 to achieve equilibrium at room temperature methanol and a mixture of methanol and hydrochloric acid solution volume ratio 9 1 were selected as the elution solvents of the polymer adsorbed with bpa and ha respectively at room temperature six adsorption and desorption cycles were carried out 2 5 antibacterial performance e coli strain was chosen to evaluate the disinfection potential of bqcd bp and ac as a control in detail e coli strain was inoculated into fresh luria broth medium and then shaken in an incubator overnight at 200 rpm and 37 c for 16 h to reach the exponential growth then bacterial cells were obtained via centrifugation 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 c and washed three times with sterile water lastly the bacterial cells were resuspended in sterile water to prepare a bacterial stock solution with the cell density of approximately 107 cfu ml 1 for the sterilization assay bacterial stock solution was diluted to 105 cfu ml 1 with sterile water in 40 ml of which different amounts of materials were added and then transformed in the incubator at 200 rpm for 1 h at 25 c then 100 µl supernatant was taken to quantify bacterial concentration by the heterotrophic plate count method lastly the petri dishes were incubated at 37 c for 20 h and the number of colonies was counted 2 6 application in realistic river water a sample of local river water was taken from jiuxiang river nanjing china to evaluate the performance of bqcd bp in practical application the water quality was analyzed by eems before and after the treatment the concentration of bpa was adjusted to 50 μg l 1 to explore the removal efficiency of the material specifically 5 mg of bqcd bp was put into 100 ml of river water and then enriched through solid phase extraction the culturable colonies of jiuxiang river water were obtained by the plate counting methods provided above to investigate the antibacterial property of bqcd bp it was put into 40 ml of river water and the number of colonies was calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of synthesis conditions in this study β cd was first quaternized to various degrees of 3 5 10 and 15 and then benzylated to different degrees of 3 6 and 10 the pore structures and surface properties of the synthetic materials at different ratios are shown in table 1 and figs s6 s7 generally under the same degree of quaternization with the increase of bnbr the specific surface area of the polymer was improved nevertheless under the same degree of benzylation the amount of quaternary ammonium salt exerted little effect on the specific surface area and pore size of polymers the rigid structures in the polymer would cause an untightly stacked polymer molecular chain resulting in self porosity budd et al 2004 in this study bnbr not only act as a rigid structure but also provided reaction site for subsequent friedel crafts alkylation reaction to introduce new rigid structures the specific surface area of the cyclodextrin polymer prepared at the optimal ratio of cd q b 1 10 10 reached 1133 m2 g 1 the specific surface area of the polymer prepared with the ratio of cd q b 1 3 15 was lower than that of cd q b 1 3 10 which might be attributed to pore blockage yang et al 2022 because of the flexible molecular chain of quaternary ammonium salt the increased amount of the quaternary ammonium salt exerted no significant effect on the specific surface area of the polymer in order to clarify the relationship between the raw material ratio and the material structure and surface properties the correlation analysis of various parameters was carried out as can be ssen from table s5 the specific surface area was significantly correlated to the bnbr amount spearman s rank correlation coefficients ρ 1 000 p 0 001 and the amount of quaternary ammonium salt was insignificantly correlated with the specific surface area and pore size the material hydrophilicity is closely related to the functional groups on the material surface as shown in table 1 the contact angles of cyclodextrin polymers prepared under different conditions represented significant differences indicating different hydrophilicity for the prepared cd polymers the hydroxyl groups and quaternary ammonium groups on the surface were hydrophilic özden et al 1997 while the long alkyl chains in the quaternary ammonium salt and benzene rings were hydrophobic the hydrophilicity of the polymer is the result of the combined effect of the above groups in conclusion the pore structure and the number of surface functional groups of the polymer could be easily adjusted by reasonable optimization of the ratio of quaternary ammonium salt and bnbr and polymers with high specific surface area and suitable surface hydrophilicity could be obtained in this study the cyclodextrin polymer prepared with cd q b 1 10 10 named bqcd bp was selected for subsequent characterization studies by comprehensively considering the specific surface area and surface hydrophilicity 3 2 characterization according to the infrared spectrum presented in fig 2 a the resonations at 1155 cm 1 and 1030 cm 1 were the c o c and c oh stretching vibrations of β cd the adsorption peak at 1486 cm 1 of eta was attributed to the c n stretching vibrations loubaki et al 1991 which was still significant in qcd indicating the quaternization of cd the characteristic peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1600 cm 1 of bqcd were relevant to the c c stretching vibration of aromatic rings suggesting the benzylation of qcd the crosslinking of bcmbp was evidenced by the disappearing adsorption peak corresponding to the chloromethyl at 720 cm 1 of the polymer schute and rose 2015 as shown in fig 2b zeta potentials on the polymer surface were all greater than zero within the ph range of 2 10 indicating the positively charged material surface it should be noted that the zeta potential of the polymer surface reached as high as 24 9 mv without adjusting the solution ph due to the introduction of numerous quaternary ammonium groups chen et al 2020 the elemental analysis is listed in table s6 the n content in bqcd bp was measured to be 0 46 based on which the eta content in the polymer was 4 98 the o content in the polymer was 8 83 according to which the β cyclodextrin content in bqcd bp could be calculated to be 28 3 after deducting the oxygen of eta the eta content was also analyzed to be 5 17 by the ion exchange method table s6 consistent with the results measured by elemental analysis the tga analysis fig 2c presented the excellent thermodynamic stability of bqcd bp with a weight loss of only 6 at 310 c due to the large introduction of rigid structures chen et al 2019 according to the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig s6 bqcd bp contained abundant pores with a large specific surface area of 1133 m2 g 1 attributed to the abundant rigid structures in the polymer the pore size distribution fig 2d further revealed the abundance of micropores and mesopores in bqcd bp with an average pore diameter of 2 93 nm sem image fig 2e showed that bqcd bp had a fluffy micro structure and a rough surface with significant micron scale macro pores in addition numerous micropores in the polymer were identified by the tem image fig 2f on this basis bqcd bp contained many microporous and macroporous structures consistent with the results obtained in the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm 3 3 adsorption kinetics this section explored the adsorption kinetics of bpa and ha at the concentration of 20 mg l 1 of cd polymers prepared under different conditions as shown in fig s8 all the cd polymers presented an extremely high adsorption rate for bpa the adsorption equilibrium of bpa on other cd polymers could be reached in about 5 min except for cd polymer prepared with cd q b 1 3 15 which needs about 20 min at adsorption equilibrium the bpa removal rate on all cd polymers was close to 100 except for those polymers prepared with cd q b 1 3 3 owing to the relative poor specific surface area the adsorption capacity of different cd polymers for ha varied significantly with the removal efficiency surging from 9 6 to 99 at 30 min and the adsorption rate constants of bpa and ha varied greatly among different cd polymers with the results listed in table s7 in order to further analyze the correlations between material structure and adsorption performance at different synthesis ratios the relationship between specific surface area contact angle pore size and adsorption rate constant was analyzed when the contact angle of the material was less than 90 the material was relatively hydrophilic and the pseudo second order adsorption kinetic constant of bpa was significantly positively correlated with the specific surface area of the material ρ 0 900 p 0 05 table s8 however no such obvious correlation was observed when the material was hydrophobic possibly because the hydrophilicity of the material surface had a great influence on the adsorption rate constant and the adsorbent failed to be well distributed into the water to fully contact with pollutants despite the large effect of the specific surface area ha showed an insignificant correlation with the specific surface area this probably was because that ha was mainly adsorbed through macropores of polymers due to its large molecule and the diffusion process was limited by the pore size of materials in conclusion the structure especially the specific surface area and surface properties of polymers could significantly affect their adsorption capacity for pollutants therefore cd polymers with excellent adsorption properties for target pollutants could be obtained by the reasonable adjustment of the structure and surface properties of materials what should be noted is that although the regulation of material performance by structure modification has been studied by other researches for the preparation of porous polymers such as cofs and pims gao et al 2017 jiang et al 2011 tan et al 2021 yang et al 2019 it is rarely investigated for cd polymers to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the prepared cyclodextrin polymers in the following studies considering the adsorption effects of bpa and ha the polymer prepared with cd q b 1 10 10 named bqcd bp was selected for relevant experiments and ac was chosen for comparison as can be seen from fig 3 the removal efficiency of bqcd bp exceeded 90 within 60 s for bpa while that of ac was merely 45 bpa could be fully adsorbed within 2 5 min by bqcd bp which was faster than by ac and needed approximately 15 min to achieve a full removal fig 3 similarly bqcd bp exhibited excellent adsorption performance for ha achieving a removal efficiency of 87 8 much higher than the 25 of ac at 30 min the superior removal efficiency of ha by bqcd bp attributed to it is positive charge suitable for the removal of negatively charged molecules the water samples before and after adsorption were also analyzed using eems to estimate the removal efficiency of ha the eem plot of the simulated ha water sample before the adsorption represented abundant c3 component according to the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 table s12 and the water sample after adsorption by bqcd bp was almost blank fig s9 in order to better compare the experimental results the kinetics data were fitted with the pseudo second order kinetic model and elovich model respectively as illustrated in fig s10 and table s9 both models fitted well for bqcd bp and ac r 2 0 97 the pseudo second order rate constant of bpa adsorption to bqcd bp was 1 2058 mg g 1 min 1 50 times higher than that of ac 0 0256 g mg 1 min 1 under identical experimental condition the ultrahigh adsorption rate of bpa by bqcd bp was attributed to the large specific surface area and sufficient adsorption sites for contaminant molecules the hydrophobic cavity of β cyclodextrin which could be applied by including organic contaminants with host guest interaction crini 2005 promoted the removal of hydrophobic bpa for ha adsorption to bqcd bp the elovich model fitted better than the pseudo second order kinetic model with a larger correlation coefficient revealing the decreasing adsorption rate with the enhanced adsorption amount or coverage in this experiment marques et al 2019 indicating that the adsorption of ha by bqcd bp was rapid at the first time and then turned slower due to internal diffusion the pseudo second order kinetic constant of ha to bqcd bp was twice more than that of ac abundant quaternary ammonium groups of the bqcd bp interacted with the negative charged ha through electrostatic interaction contributing to the rapid removal of ha from water moreover the rapid diffusion was supported by the external macropores in bqcd bp observed in tem and the high water wetting ability observed in the contact angle of fig s7 furthermore it could not be ignored that a strong hydrophobic interaction played a role in the removal of ha due to abundant functional groups schulten and schnitzer 1993 3 4 adsorption isotherms the adsorption capacities of bqcd bp and ac for bpa and ha at different concentrations are shown in fig 4 and table s10 the adsorption isotherms of bqcd bp fitted well with the freundlich model r2 0 96 for both pollutants indicating heterogeneous and multi layer adsorption 1 n was less than 0 5 implying the potential preferential adsorption it could be seen that the adsorption capacity of polymer for bpa was 257 75 mg g 1 much greater than that of ac 100 31 mg g 1 at the bpa concentration of 300 mg l 1 the maximum adsorption of ha at the equilibrium of bqcd bp was 142 mg g 1 larger than that of most reported adsorbents mostly below 100 mg g 1 to our knowledge bouras et al 2015 dong et al 2014 tavengwa et al 2016 zulfikar et al 2016 3 5 influencing factors of adsorption this section investigated the factors influencing the adsorption process including solution ph nacl concentration and ethanol water ratio ph could change the charge property of adsorbent and the existing form of pollutants in an aqueous solution soni and padmaja 2014 ionic concentration could impact the solubility of pollutants and further influence the adsorbent contaminant interactions zhang et al 2010 in addition the ethanol water ratio was studied to further explicate the interaction type 3 5 1 effects of ph as depicted in fig 5 a the adsorption of bpa was almost independent of ph in the wide range of 2 12 and the removal efficiency at ph 12 remained superior to be 97 68 bpa was primarily removed from water by hydrophobic interaction with the cavities of β cyclodextrin and other hydrophobic structures of polymer yang et al 2016 in addition cation π interaction one intermolecular force kong et al 2020 and hydrogen bonds might occur between the bpa and adsorbents the pka of bpa was 10 3 and at a ph larger than pka bpa started to dissociate destructing the hydrogen bonds meanwhile the bqcd bp surface was negatively charged as illustrated in zeta potential which caused electrostatic repulsion between bpa and bqcd bp considering the high specific surface area of bqcd bp abundant β cyclodextrin cavities and other hydrophobic structures are easily accessible thus hydrophobic interaction dominated the bpa removal and the influence of ph is minimal only a decrease by 2 32 ha could be completely removed at the solution ph ranging from 2 to 8 ion exchange was the main force since the bqcd bp was positive at the ph of 2 10 the removal efficiency slightly declined by 0 5 at ph 10 because the positive charge of bqcd bp was reduced with the rising ph which weakened the electrostatic force the adsorption efficiency slumped to 75 at a ph of 12 several reasons could explain this phenomenon first the zeta potential of bqcd bp even decreased to negative resulting in a large reduction in the adsorption capacity of negatively charged ha second numerous hydroxide ions competed with ha for adsorption in aqueous solution at a ph of 12 3 5 2 effects of ionic strength in order to evaluate the applicability of the material prepared in this study the effect of ionic strength on adsorption was studied and nacl was selected to investigate the effect of ionic strength as shown in fig 5b nacl with a concentration changing from 0 to 0 5 mol l 1 had no significant influence on the adsorption of bpa and ha as we all know the presence of salt would reduce the solubility of substances which in turn promoted the hydrophobic interaction between target molecules and adsorbents liu et al 2019 on the other hand the salt out effect destroyed the hydrogen bonds which would weaken the adsorption the negligible impact of nacl on bpa adsorption indicating that the salt out effect and hydrophobic interaction ehanced by salt were not critical which was in consistent with most reported cd polymers obviously ion exchange between ha and the quaternary ammonium groups on bqcd bp played an important role in ha removal unpredictably ha removal efficiency remained 100 as the concentration of nacl increased to 0 5 mol l 1 this might be attributed to the strong ha bqcd bp interaction or the existence of multiple mechanisms considering the complex structure of ha which was composed of abundant functional groups such as hydroxyl group carboxyl group and benzene ring hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interaction might also play an important role during adsorption 3 5 3 effects of ethanol water ratio it is reported that the presence of ethanol can undermine the hydrophobic effect maeda et al 2019 therefore the effect of ethanol water ratio on bpa and ha removal was studied in this section as plotted in the bar chart fig 5c the removal efficiency of bpa significantly declined from 99 6 to 22 9 with the volume ratio of ethanol increasing from 0 1 to 0 5 the worst removal efficiency was merely 10 6 when ethanol occupied 90 in bulk solution the significant negative effect of ethanol again verifed that hydrophobic interaction was the primary force between bpa and bqcd bp although the effect on ha was not as significant as that on bpa the removal efficiency of ha also decreased by 23 2 when the proportion of ethanol increased to 80 indicating that in addition to ion exchange hydrophobic interaction also played an important role during adsorption consistent with the result discussed above 3 5 4 competitive adsorption of bpa and ha on polymer due to the coexistence of organic micropollutants and ha in actual water considering that the adsorption of ha and bpa involved hydrogen bond and hydrophobic effect as mentioned above we identified whether competitive adsorption existed between bpa and ha bpa was used as the target pollutant to investigate the effect of different concentrations of ha on its removal efficiency specifically 200 mg l 1 bpa was chosen since bpa at this concentration could not be fully removed by bqcd bp 1 mg ml 1 to make the consequence more evident the selected ha concentration ranged from 0 to 50 mg l 1 greater than the concentration in aquatic ecosystems philippe and schaumann 2014 results showed that fig 6 no influence of the bpa removal with the ha concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l 1 proving the varying main adsorption sites due to the different main adsorption mechanisms of the materials for bpa and ha as well as the sufficient adsorption sites the removal efficiency of bpa and ha would not reduce on account of competitive adsorption in actual application taken together the synthesized bqcd bp presented stable performance under various water chemistry conditions 3 6 recyclability the regeneration performance remains a critical factor in evaluating the property of adsorbents serving as a determinant of the application cost and environmental benefit as seen in fig 7 bpa could be easily eluted from bqcd bp with methanol at room temperature and bqcd bp still maintained a very high removal efficiency of bpa of nearly 100 after six adsorption desorption cycles it was challenging to completely elute ha from the polymer with nacl solution due to various interaction forces and thus a mixture of methanol and hydrochloric acid was used for elution during regeneration after six adsorption desorption cycles the removal efficiency was only slightly lessened still as high as 94 compared with the inconvenient and energy consuming regeneration of ac the bqcd bp represented excellent regeneration performance enabling it to be a promising adsorbent 3 7 antibacterial performance the present study selected e coli to evaluate the antibacterial performance of bqcd bp as shown in fig 8 a and b bqcd bp killed most of e coli reaching a 90 sterilization rate after 1 h contact when the dosage was 1 g l 1 much better than that of ac in addition bqcd bp also showed comparable bactericidal performance with these reported materials including quaternized modified graphene materials tu et al 2013 quaternized cyclodextrin materials liu et al 2022 wang et al 2022 polyethylenimine derived polymer zhang et al 2016 and ag based antibacterial materials zhang et al 2013 the bactericidal property of bqcd bp increased from 81 6 to 95 7 as the bqcd bp concentration up from 0 5 to 5 g l 1 the sem photographs of e coli before and after the bqcd bp treatment are presented in fig 8 c d evidently the morphologies of e coli were greatly changed in particular the bacterial cell membrane was obviously destroyed after contact with bqcd bp the hydrophobic alkyl chains of the quaternary ammonium groups could scratch the cell membrane leading to the rupture of the membrane and the death of the bacteria carpio et al 2014 the introduction of numerous quaternary ammonium groups encoded the cd polymer with excellent disinfection performance making it possible to be applied during disinfection in sewage treatment 3 8 application in actual water bodies bqcd bp was applied to treat multiple contaminants containing natural river water the basic parameters of the river are listed in table s11 it can be seen that the cod of the river water after bqcd bp treatment could not be detected implying that the organic matter in the water body was almost removed moreover eem analyses of the river water before and after adsorption were carried out fig s11 abundant c4 component which was identified to correspond to protein like fluorophores tryptophan like substances and microbial delivered substances stedmon et al 2011 and few c1 component fulvic acid like organics and terrestrial derivative organics hambly et al 2015 existed in river water after 2 h treatment the fluorescent dom substances of the river water were almost completely removed the removal efficiency of uv254 was further measured and the removal rate reached 87 after adsorption equilibrium that is most of the organic matter absorbing at 254 nm wavelength in river water was removed in addition the removal of target pollutant bpa in actual water was investigated indicating the complete adsorption of bpa and the suitability of the material for removing micropollutants from actual complex environmental water bodies surprisingly the removal efficiency of tp reached as high as 92 meeting the ⅱ level standard of environmental quality standards for surface water there were two forms of phosphorus in water bodies i e dissolved phosphorus and particulate phosphorus which could be separated through a 0 45 µm filter jia et al 2022 orthophosphate ortho p was the majority of total dissolved p tdp mainly existing in various types of phosphate ions phosphates can be removed by bqcd bp through electrostatic interaction due to the introduction of quaternary ammonium groups moreover the protonated phosphate anions h2po4 and hpo4 2 can interact with h bond donors and acceptors on the surface of bqcd bp via hydrogen bonding wu et al 2020 and the high surface area would greatly enhance the adsorption of phosphate liu et al 2018 chemical reaction and precipitation might be other involved mechanisms during phosphate removal yang et al 2006 the specific mechanism of the material interaction with phosphorus still requires further investigation the sterilization experiment showed a reduced number of bacteria in the river water by 82 fig s12 and table s11 indicating that bqcd bp maintained stable disinfection performance towards river water containing about 4 105 cfu ml 1 culturable bacteria the above results showed that the synthetic material bqcd bp was effective in removing substances in the actual water body 4 conclusions in summary a novel multifunctional porous cyclodextrin polymer with a large specific surface area for rapid removal of multiple contaminants including bpa ha and pathogens was designed via the friedel crafts alkylation reaction between modified β cyclodextrin and bcmbp in the homogeneous bmim cl fecl3 ionic liquid system which is used both as solvent and lewis acid catalyst the following conclusions were drawn from our study the pore regulation and surface properties are adjusted by modifying the ratios of eta and bnbr in the first and second steps separately a series of experiments reveal the relevance of specific surface areas to the benzylation ratios generally the more benzene rings grafted the more porous and the larger the specific surface area of the polymer in addition the polymer hydrophilicity is affected by both the degrees of quaternization and benzylation the quaternary ammonium groups on the polymer are beneficial to ha removal and pathogen killing the porous structure and high specific surface area of the polymer greatly promote the removal of organic micropollutants polymer exhibits excellent adsorption performance which the process is almost unaffected by hydrochemical conditions and is very convenient to regenerate the polymer shows excellent sterilization properties with a bactericidal efficiency of 96 at a dosage of 2 g l 1 towards e coli multiple interactions are involved in the adsorption bpa adsorption is mainly through the host guest interaction and hydrophobic effect with the hydrophobic groups on the material while the ha removal is primarily through ion exchange in which hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effect get involved and make a difference the outstanding adsorption and antibacterial performance of the polymer are proven in actual water bodies bpa and fluorescent organics are almost completely eradicated polymer has a 82 antibacterial ability to viable bacteria in realistic river water in addition it has remarkable removal performance for cod which the value is below the detection limit after treatment and tp with a removal efficiency of 92 taken together the polymer as a multifunctional material is promising for application in actual complex water bodies we will focus on the systematic study of the removal mechanisms of conventional pollutants such as cod nh3 n and tp and their relationship with the comprehensive effect of multiple organic substances in actual water bodies and the secondary treated effluent our study is expected to inspire more research on the rational design of environmental functional water treatment materials eqs 1 2 credit authorship contribution statement lin sun

15699,benzophenone bp type uv filters are continuously released into various aquatic environments via the effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and recreational activities in coastal beaches in this study we developed a robust and reliable sampling approach diffusive gradients in thin films dgt for seasonal monitoring of six bp derivatives in coastal waters to investigate their occurrence and environmental risk the binding capacities of both xad 2 and hlb gels for test bps were over 252 μg with no significant deterioration in marine environment suggesting that theoretically dgt is capable of sampling for at least 3 months effectively the diffusion coefficients of bps in freshwater and seawater were determined for the first time the sampling performance showed no dependence on environmental conditions including ph 4 0 8 5 ionic strength 0 0001 0 5 m and dissolved organic matter 0 20 mg l 1 the developed dgt samplers were successfully applied in a river estuary linked to a wwtp and a bathing beach at different periods of one year results showed that the concentrations of bps in the coastal waters were dependent on seasonal variation the highest level in summer and the ecological risk should be considered based on the risk quotient values these results demonstrated that the present dgt method is suitable for measuring characterization and risk assessment of bps in freshwater and marine environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzophenone type uv filters bps diffusive gradients in thin films dgt coastal waters seasonal monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benzophenone compounds bps are uv filters which can intensively absorb a wide spectrum of uv radiation widely used in a variety of daily personal care products pcps such as sunscreen body lotions shampoos and cosmetics liao and kannan 2014 tsui et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a 2011b in europe japan and the u s a bps are permitted at levels of up to 10 as active ingredients in sunscreen by the actual legislation sanchez quiles and tovar sanchez 2015 they are also added in synthetic products including plastic bags coating and paints to reduce the damages of uv radiation wang et al 2013 bps enter the aquatic environments either by direct input of outdoor swimmers or by indirect input of the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps kim and choi 2014 the occurrences of bps are reported in varying levels depending on the intensities of daily use and discharge ranging from ng l 1 in surface water to μg l 1 in wastewater swimming pools and coastal water brausch and rand 2011 mao et al 2019 for example 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone 2oh 4meo bp one of the most popular bp type uv filters was reported to occur in songhua river in china at a concentration ranging from 2 3 to 122 ng l 1 zhang et al 2011a 2011b and in an outdoor swimming pool of south bohemia at a concentration around 620 ng l 1 grabicova et al 2013 a high concentration of 2oh 4meo bp up to 10 400 ng l 1 was detected in the wastewater influent of wwtps in the u s a loraine and pettigrove 2006 several in vitro and in vivo studies have documented the estrogenic activity of bps and thus they have been considered as potential endocrine disrupting chemicals kunz et al 2006 le fol et al 2015 for instance 2oh 4meo bp is associated with weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity bluethgen et al 2012 schlumpf et al 2001 in addition 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp which are metabolites of 2oh 4meo bp in both animals and humans possess even higher estrogenic activities than that of the precursor kim and choi 2014 other benzophenone derivatives such as 2 2 4 4 oh bp and 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp exhibit even greater estrogen receptor binding affinity than 2oh 4meo bp kunisue et al 2012 apart from their potential endocrine disrupting activity adverse acute and chronic effects on zooplankton and coral reefs are also associated with bps exposure he et al 2019 mao et al 2017 mitchelmore et al 2019 due to the potential ecological and health risks of bps constant monitoring of their concentrations in aquatic environment is required in water quality assessment in which sampling is a first crucial step traditionally grab sampling is accomplished by collecting a large volume of water sample usually above 500 ml followed by preconcentration and cleanup with solid phase extraction spe li et al 2007 rodil et al 2008 however such spot sampling can only provide instantaneous information at a certain sampling point and or time when the concentrations of pollutants greatly fluctuate in the sampling water body such as effluent dumping or rainfall collecting a large number of samples or increasing sampling frequencies are necessary to obtain the time weighted average twa concentration which is laborious and time consuming passive sampling is an alternative option to reduce the mentioned drawbacks and can provide the twa concentration several passive sampling techniques have been used for monitoring of organic uv filters in various waters including polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis fent et al 2010 zenker et al 2008 and semipermeable membrane devices spmds ahmadi et al 2017 balmer et al 2005 however a common limitation is that the thickness of the diffusive boundary layers dbl formed on the surface of these sampling devices highly depends on hydrodynamic conditions and thus affects the sampling rates bartelt hunt et al 2011 caban et al 2021 calibration carried out in laboratories cannot effectively represent real environmental conditions causing measurement errors diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is developed as a passive sampling technique that provides in situ sampling of trace analytes in aquatic environment without needing field calibration because the uptake of analytes is under the diffusion control through a well defined diffusive phase davison and zhang 1994 zhang and davison 1995 within nearly 30 years dgt has been widely applied for monitoring of inorganic substances including trace metal ions zhang and davison 1995 nutrients zhang et al 1998 and radioactive elements li et al 2006 and organic pollutants such as antibiotics chen et al 2013 pesticides fauvelle et al 2015 household and personal care products chen et al 2017 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 psychiatric pharmaceuticals fang et al 2019 perfluoroalkyl substances fang et al 2021 guan et al 2018 wang et al 2021 synthetic musks ren et al 2020 organophosphorus flame retardants zou et al 2018 and microcystins wang et al 2022b at present o dgt dgt to trace organic contaminants has measured over 200 organic chemicals with molecular weight ranging from 128 17 to 916 11 da and hydrophobicity octanol water partition coefficient log k ow ranging from 4 51 to 7 51 guibal et al 2019 however to our knowledge the application of dgt for monitoring bp uv filters has not been studied to date in addition most studies have tended to conduct o dgt sampling in the sewage of wwtps or surface fresh water to reveal the occurrence and source of pollutants chen et al 2017 fang et al 2019 guo et al 2017 few researches focus on the applications of o dgt in marine environment despite the relatively high frequency of these chemicals in coastal waters associated with bathing beaches and the effluents of wwtps the primary objective of this study is to develop a reliable dgt sampling method for accurate monitoring of bp type uv filters and apply it in two typical sampling sites with high incidence of these compounds six bps were selected to examine the performance of dgt under different experimental conditions their diffusion coefficients for fresh water and seawater were firstly reported and sampling characteristics such as deployment time effects of ph ionic strength and dom were investigated systematically the developed method was finally validated in field environment and it was used in monitoring the occurrence and seasonal variation of bps in a river estuary linked to a wwtp and a sea bathing beach in dalian china 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents six bp type uv filters with purity 97 namely 2oh 4meo bp 2 4oh bp 2 3 4oh bp 2 2 4 4 oh bp 2 2 oh 4meo bp and 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china benzophenone d10 macklin shanghai china and 13c12 pcb 209 j k scientific chemical china were used as surrogate and internal standard respectively the environmentally important physicochemical properties are provided in supporting materials stock solutions of the chemicals at 1000 μg l 1 were prepared in hplc grade methanol meoh and stored at 20 c in the dark organic solvents including meoh dichloromethane dcm of hplc grade were obtained from sigma aldrich all glass containers involved in the experiment were thoroughly washed by meoh and milli q water bedford usa 2 2 preparation of dgt samplers standard dgt moldings made of abs acetonitrile butadiene styrene plastic were provided by dgt research ltd nanjing china our previous work investigated the excellent performance of xad 2 resin binding gel for the measurement of moderate polar organic chemicals ren et al 2020 here xad 2 gel and hlb gel as binding phases were prepared according to previously published procedures fang et al 2019 ren et al 2020 briefly 0 2 g agarose powder was added into 10 ml milli q water and heated until the solution was transparent 2 g wet weight xad 2 or hlb powder was then added to the agarose solution mixed and quickly injected into the preheated glass mold with a ptfe spacer of 0 5 mm thickness agarose diffusive gel of 1 0 mm thickness was prepared by the cooling of the hot agarose solution 1 5 zhang and davison 1999 nuclepore track etched polycarbonate filter membrane pc 0 015 mm thick whatman was adopted as a filter membrane to prevent biofouling from destroying the structure of the sampler the information on the assessment of possible adsorption of bps onto dgt moldings agarose gels and different filter membranes were given in supporting materials 2 3 elution efficiencies and uptake kinetics xad 2 or hlb gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions containing 20 50 or 100 μg l 1 bps with 0 01 m nacl after 24 h of shaking the gel discs were transferred into 5 ml of meoh dcm 1 1 v v solution shaken for 12 h the elution procedure was conducted twice and 50 ng of the surrogate standards were added into the combined eluent then the eluent was concentrated and solvent exchanged into 1 ml dcm for gc ms analysis the elution efficiencies f e of bps were calculated by the difference between the eluted mass and adsorbed mass on the binding gel to determine the uptake kinetics for bps the binding gel discs were soaked in a 10 ml solution of 100 μg l 1 bps for different time 1 min to 24 h and the binding mass of bps was calculated by determining the extracted mass 2 4 binding capacity of dgt devices the standard dgt devices equipped with a xad 2 or hlb binding gel were deployed in 2 l of well stirred 0 01 m nacl solution or artificial seawater constituents listed in table s4 with different levels of bps 50 to 800 μg l 1 for 72 h at room temperature 25 1 c the sampling solutions were protected from light during dgt sampling to prevent the degradation of bps all the deployed solutions were pre equilibrated for 12 h prior to deployment and refreshed every 24 h to avoid possible reduction of bps concentration 2 5 measurement of diffusion coefficients diffusion coefficients of bps in fresh water and artificial seawater were measured using the dgt method ren et al 2020 briefly 2 l deployed solutions 0 01 m nacl solution or artificial seawater were spiked with 100 μg l 1 of six bps and equilibrated for 12 h the assembled dgt devices equipped with xad 2 gel agarose gel of 1 0 mm thickness and pc filter membrane of 0 015 mm thickness were deployed in the solutions which were well stirred for 12 h the dgt devices were taken at each 1 h interval for eluting the binding gel and at the same time 10 ml of the deployed solutions were collected to assess the concentration changes of bps the diffusion coefficients of bps in fresh water df and artificial seawater ds were calculated based on the slope of the linear plot of the accumulated mass of each bp on the binding gel versus time according to eq 1 1 d slope δ g c a a is the area of the exposure window of dgt device c is the solution concentration of bps and δg is the thicknesses of diffusive layer 2 6 calculation of dgt measured concentration m is mass ng of bps in binding gel and it is calculated by eq 2 2 m c e v e v g e l f e where c e μg l 1 is bps concentration in eluent v e ml is volume of eluent v gel ml is volume of binding gel and f e is elution efficiency of each bp the concentrations of bps measured by dgt c dgt are calculated by eq 3 3 c d g t m δ g δ d a t where δg cm is diffusive layer thickness d cm2 s 1 is diffusion coefficients of bps through the diffusive gel t s is deployment time and a cm2 is exposure area of dgt device δ cm is the thickness of diffusion boundary layer dbl which can be ignored in well flowing waters santner et al 2015 warnken et al 2006 2 7 performance of dgt sampling under different conditions xad 2 dgt devices were immersed in 2 l solutions spiked with 50 μg l 1 bps for 12 h to assess the effects of ph ionic strength is and dissolved organic matter dom on the dgt sampling performance the solutions were stirred well during deployment a bps solution containing 0 01 m nacl with ph ranging from 4 0 to 8 5 b bps solution at ph 6 2 and is ranging from 0 0001 to 0 5 m nacl c bps solution 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 with humic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 spiked 20 μg l 1 of bps for 7 d to test responses of dgt sampler to the deployment times the deployed solutions were refreshed every 24 h and covered with an aluminum foil to avoid possible concentration change the dgt devices were retrieved in different deployment time from 6 h to 7 d 2 8 field deployment dalian is a coastal city located in the northeast of china the distinguished scene and attractiveness of the bathing beach enable the annual tourists peak in june to september two sampling sites ling shui river estuary ls and xing hai bathing beach xh linked to indirect and direct pollution sources of organic uv filters were selected for this study ls is impacted by rainwater discharge and a main wwtp in the region which treats domestic sewage of 200 000 individuals fig 1 xh is within an urban park so it is influenced by beach tourism multiple dgt devices fixed on a special shelf were deployed at 0 45 m under the water surface of the sampling sites for 5 to 7 d together with an automatic continuous temperature recorder th4xw china the dgt devices in xh were deployed below the buoy 100 m away from the coast to avoid the impact of sea waves fig s1 both sites were sampled every season in 2021 by dgt table s12 during the dgt sampling period the water flow at the sampling sites maintained well turbulence the formed dbl layer on dgt device can be ignored challis et al 2016 after sampling the dgt devices with no obvious biofilms were retrieved and stored in clean plastic bags at 4 c till the binding gels were taken out in the lab for extraction for grab sampling the water samples were collected using ptfe bottles at 0 3rd 5th and 7th d during the 7 day dgt deployment and were immediately pretreated by solid phase extraction supporting materials all procedures were accomplished within 3 d after sampling 2 9 environmental risk assessment potential environmental risk of bps was evaluated by risk quotients rqs index guo et al 2020 tsui et al 2014 which were quantified by the ratio of environmental concentration mec of bps to the predicted no effect concentration pnec eq 4 the total rq rqtotal is defined as the sum of the rq of each bp eq 5 4 r q m e c p n e c 5 r q t o t a l i 1 n r q i i 1 n m e c i p n e c i mec represents the concentration of bps in the present study pnec was obtained from available ecotoxicological data with an assessment factor which was calculated according to european commission guidelines 2003 covering the acute and chronic toxicity species variations and laboratory field test moreover the ecotoxicological data of freshwater and marine organisms were considered to derive the corresponding pnec in different environments table s14 the highest mec mecmax and the lowest pnec values were used in risk assessment to reflect the worst case scenario the rq based evaluation is classified into four risk categories unlikely to pose risk rq 0 01 low risk 0 01 rq 0 1 medium risk 0 1 rq 1 and high risk rq 1 tsui et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of bps on dgt devices the adsorption of bps by dgt devices including filter membrane diffusive gel and dgt moldings should be minimized to avoid long lag phase of target analytes in initial deployment ren et al 2020 adsorption tests fig s2 showed that the retentions of all bps on agarose gel and dgt molding were negligible 6 there were varying degree adsorptions for bps on the seven types of filter membranes among which mce filter membrane had the maximum adsorption to bps 77 5 on average while bps were minimally adsorbed on pc membrane 15 4 the retentions of bps on pvdf pes pp nl and ptfe were considerable with the adsorption rates ranging from 19 5 to 57 0 therefore pc filter membrane and agarose diffusive gel were selected in dgt devices for bps measurement 3 2 elution efficiency reliable elution efficiency can precisely obtain the binding mass of target analytes and then ensure accurate quantitation for dgt measurements here meoh dcm 1 1 v v was applied as an eluent for xad 2 and hlb gels because the mixed solvent could efficiently elute the target bps with different polarity from the binding gels although the elution efficiencies of xad 2 gel for bps were higher than those of hlb gel fig s3 both of the binding gels generally provided a stable and effective elution efficiency more than 80 for each bp at three concentration levels high recoveries of xad 2 or hlb binding gels have also been confirmed for other organic chemicals such as synthetic musks ren et al 2020 household and personal care products chen et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting chemicals chen et al 2018 3 3 uptake kinetics and binding capacity the binding kinetics of bps on xad 2 and hlb gels fig 2 showed that the accumulated masses of bps by both gels increased rapidly with the deployment time within the first 1 h and the uptakes of four bps onto xad 2 gel were slightly faster than hlb gel in the initial stage for example xad 2 gel accumulated over 90 mass of 2oh 4meo bp in the exposure solution within 1 h while hlb gel adsorbed only 53 4 mass of 2oh 4meo bp in the first hour xad 2 is a nonionic resin more suitable for bps which mostly exist in neutral form with slight hydrophobicity the average binding rates of bps during the first 10 min were 14 6 and 8 7 ng cm 2 min 1 for xad 2 gel and hlb gel respectively the binding rates are much higher than the average fluxes of bps 0 49 ng cm 2 min 1 through a diffusive phase of 1 0 mm thickness assuming a solution concentration of 100 μg l 1 this result indicates that the rapid uptake of bps onto the binding gels can ensure the interface concentrations of bps between the binding gel and diffusive gel being zero during dgt deployment which is a crucial prerequisite for dgt measurement the binding capacities of target analytes are closely tied with the effectiveness of dgt in long term deployment in field aquatic environment especially in highly polluted or high saline waters the accumulated masses of bps in the dgt devices equipped with hlb and or xad 2 binding gels showed linear increase with the increase of bps concentration in deployed freshwater fig s4 the effective binding capacity of each bp ranged from 31 5 to 61 2 μg per device and the total capacity of each dgt device was over 252 μg of bps in freshwater if the dgt device is deployed in the solution with the concentration of bps up to 100 μg l 1 this capacity can guarantee effective sampling for at least 3 months in the conditions without biofouling and device damage correspondingly the good linear relationship between the dgt accumulated mass and the bps concentration in artificial seawater fig s5 indicated that the capacity was not significantly deteriorated under the high salinity condition there was no significant difference anova p 0 05 between the two types of binding gels when the dgt devices were deployed in the solutions at the same bps concentration considering that xad 2 provided a faster binding rate for target bps and a comparable binding capacity to that of hlb gel xad 2 gel was adopted as the binding phase of the dgt devices for subsequent experiments 3 4 measurement of diffusion coefficients the diffusion coefficients of bps were measured by a dgt method the time dependence of the accumulated bps mass in xad dgt devices in freshwater and artificial seawater is shown in fig s6 the mass of bps on the binding gel increased linearly with time in freshwater and artificial seawater when the concentration in the deployed solution was constant the measured diffusion coefficients of bps in freshwater df or seawater ds at 23 5 c were calculated from eq 1 based on the slope of the mass plot versus time table s7 the obtained df and ds values of bps were in the range of 4 21 8 17 and 4 04 6 57 respectively table 1 the ds values were slightly lower than the df and the ratio of ds df ranged from 0 77 to 0 96 the reduction of the diffusion coefficients in artificial seawater might be due to the increase of solution viscosity in high ionic strength zhang and davison 1999 0 8 0 9 times of df was usually used as the diffusion coefficients of analytes in seawater for measurements of most inorganic pollutants hutchins et al 2012 panther et al 2010 similar results were observed in previous studies for organic pollutants xie et al 2018a xie et al 2018b where the diffusion coefficients for antibiotics and endocrine disrupting chemicals in artificial seawater were in good agreement with those in freshwater with a difference of less than 30 the diffusion coefficients of bps in different temperature dt were calculated from eq 6 and listed in si 6 log d t 1 37023 t 25 8 36 10 4 t 25 2 109 t log d 25 273 t 298 3 5 effects of ph ion strength and dom ph is and dom are essential environmental parameters in aquatic environment which may affect the performance of dgt sampling via changing analyte species surface charges and competitive adsorption on binding phase here extent of the effect was evaluated based on the average ratios of the bps concentration cdgt measured by dgt to the solution concentration csoln of bps by direct measurement results showed that the cdgt csoln ratios of target bps were in the acceptable range of 0 9 1 1 when solution ph laid between 4 0 and 8 5 fig s7a indicating no significant ph effect on the dgt performance the structure of bps contains a benzophenone structure with different numbers of hydroxyl and methoxy groups and their pka values are 7 table s2 most bps are in the neutral form in the ph range which is conducive for the adsorption of bps on the binding phase these results demonstrate that the current dgt samplers have desirable tolerance to a wide ph range and are suitable for direct sampling of most natural waters when xad dgt samplers were deployed in the solutions containing 0 0001 0 5 m nacl the dgt measured concentrations of bps agreed well with their concentrations in the solutions with the ratios of cdgt csoln in the range of 0 9 1 1 fig s7b this indicates that the is do not significantly influence the performance of dgt in measuring bps concentration therefore xad 2 dgt samplers have potential for monitoring bps in a typical high salinity environment such as seawater dissolve organic matter is extensively found in surface waters in the range of 0 50 mg l 1 and an average concentration of 5 7 mg l 1 fang et al 2021 sobek et al 2007 the concentration of dom in natural seawater is much lower ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l 1 kye et al 2021 the present result fig s7c showed no significant dependence of dgt performance on dom concentration in the solution when the dom concentration varied from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the cdgt csoln ratios were within 0 9 1 1 in addition a current study investigated that no obvious impact of dom on capacity of binding gels for organics in natural waters wang et al 2022a therefore the current dgt device is competent to the measurement requirement of bps in most surface waters 3 6 deployment time according to eq 3 the detectable levels of dgt measurement can be reduced by extending developed time to achieve monitoring for trace organic pollutants in the environment the accumulated mass of bps in dgt devices increased linearly with the deployment time for 7 d and fitted well with the theoretical value fig 3 similar response to deployment time was observed when the device was deployed in artificial seawater for 7 d fig s8 the robustness of xad dgt for long term deployment was also verified when measuring synthetic musks using xad 2 dgt ren et al 2020 and perfluoroalkyl substances using xad 18 dgt guan et al 2018 3 7 blank and detection limits the dgt blank instrument quantitation limits iqls and dgt method quantitation limits mqls are given in table s1 no detectable bps were found in the eluent of the binding gels retrieved from the dgt devices that were deployed in the blank solution for 7 d the mqls calculated from eq 3 based on 7 d dgt deployment at 25 c were 0 6 9 1 and 0 6 10 4 ng l 1 in freshwater and seawater respectively the results showed that the present method could provide a sensitive and reliable measurement for bps in natural waters at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 in surface waters to μg l 1 in sewage of wwtps table s13 3 8 seasonal monitoring in coastal waters bath beaches and wwtps are considered to be the most likely sources of bps entering the aquatic environment here dgt samplers were deployed at the two sampling sites of ling shui river estuary ls and xing hai bathing beach xh in different periods of one year for monitoring of target bps ls is located near an urban sewage outlet while xh is located in a sea bathing beach 3 km away from ls fig 4 presents the cumulative concentrations of target bps by dgt and grab sampling in the two sampling sites generally the distribution patterns of bps obtained from the dgt were in good agreement with those from grab sampling with the concentration of each bp in the same order of magnitude there was an exception for spring in which the concentrations of bps in most grab samples were less than the dgt measured concentrations and even not detected figs s9 and s10 the most likely reason is that grab sampling was easily affected by dilution caused by rainfall in spring while dgt sampling were less affected by the irregular discharge of pollutants or dilution and provided twa concentrations at the two coastal sampling sites the concentration distributions of detected bps were similar while the total concentration cbps in ls 388 1 3817 2 ng l 1 was significantly higher than that of xh 165 1778 ng l 1 p 0 05 indicating that the effluent discharge of wwtps is the main source of bps in the coastal waters of dalian china in addition the distributions of bps in one year exhibited distinct seasonal characteristics the highest concentration occurring in summer and the lowest concentration occurring in spring similar seasonal release events of some uv filters were observed previously in sewage of wwtps ekpeghere et al 2016 wu et al 2018 and coastal waters pintado herrera et al 2020 sankoda et al 2015 the economy of dalian is highly dependent on tourism especially in coastal area where the population surge during the summer with over 100 000 tourists arriving in fig s11 hot weather promotes the frequency of daily bathing seaside leisure and sea swimming high bps level in wwtp effluent and bathing beach in tourism areas are expected bps in winter and autumn were characterized by a smaller concentration with the medium level for each compound was 67 71 lower than that in summer the lowest concentration of bps in spring is only 16 of that in summer as shown in fig 4 the concentration gap of bps in different seasons are affected by temperature changes as well as continuous rain episodes allow rainwater discharge into the ls estuary to dilute pollutants especially in spring in xh strong sea waves on rainy days also accelerated the migration of coastal pollutants to the open sea resulting in few species and low concentrations of bps being monitored in spring fig s10 the measured bps concentration in the present study were generally comparable with worldwide occurrence of various bps in surface waters table s13 2 4oh bp 25 8 58 8 and 2 2 4 4 oh bp 17 4 39 5 accounted for the largest proportions of the detected bps the high detected concentrations are attributed to the wide applications of these two bps in sunscreen products in summer 2 2 4 4 oh bp tended to occur in ls while 2 4oh bp was more detected in xh their predominance in different environmental substrates may be due to the characters in the formulations of commercial products table s11 for example 2 2 4 4 oh bp an additive commonly found in daily personal care products e g shampoos hair conditioners and skin care products may have higher possibility of discharge via domestic sewage than 2 4oh bp which is more likely to be added in fashion cosmetics e g fragrance nail polish and lipsticks nevertheless 2oh 4meo bp with the highest detection frequency worldwide accounted for a relatively low proportion 2 2 5 7 of the total bps in different seasons 10 6 193 8 ng l 1 in ls and 5 4 39 4 ng l 1 in xh a possible explanation is that 2oh 4meo bp was mostly released into the environment in its form of biological metabolites such as 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp kim and choi 2014 kunisue et al 2012 another bp derivative 2 3 4oh bp was rarely detected in environmental media because this compound has not been commercially used yang and ying 2013 and it was not detected in the study area 3 9 environmental risk assessment a preliminary risk assessment was carried out to establish potential ecotoxicological data of the bps for aquatic organisms in ls estuary 2 4oh bp had the largest contribution to the risks table 2 the rqs accounting for over 60 of rqtotal for bps showing medium and high risks to the organisms in winter and summer respectively 2 2 4 4 oh bp and 2oh 4meo bp posed a medium or low risk to the aquatic organisms throughout the year the remaining bps with rq 0 1 indicated low and even unlikely posed risk correspondingly the rqtotal of bps was 1 at three seasons during the year and the highest rqtotal was 3 29 in summer various studies have conducted ecotoxicological risk assessments of bps in fresh waters guo et al 2020 wu et al 2017 while risk data of bps in marine environment is limited the bps in xh including 2oh 4meo bp 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp their rq values were higher than 0 1 and even 1 demonstrating this type of uv filters in the coastal waters exhibited potential ecological risk to the marine organisms it is noteworthy that the obtained rq values of 2oh 4meo bp in xh significantly higher than those in ls because of the increased sensitivity of toxicity to the marine organisms such as algae paredes et al 2014 and coral downs et al 2016 due to the lack of ecotoxicological data for marine organisms the current risk quotients of 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp and 2 3 4oh bp are missing overall the results showed the bps in the sampling sites may pose a significant ecological risk to the aquatic organisms for most seasons of the year which is largely attributed to the locations closely linked to the primary emission sources of uv filters generally as contaminants are diluted with river runoff and ocean tidal forces the occurrence and corresponding risks of bps gradually decrease far away from the input sources although most studies have confirmed that the risk of bps in river water and marine environment is relatively low the potential ecological risks caused by continuous discharge still need to be monitored progressively 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the feasibility of in situ sampling based on dgt for seasonal measurement of bp type uv filters in coastal waters the dgt devices using xad 2 binding gel offer a promising performance for monitoring of bps the stability and reliability of the dgt samplers in freshwater and seawater was verified in laboratory tests and field deployments the implementation of dgt devices is beneficial for general monitoring of analytes with highly fluctuating concentrations compared to traditional grab sampling since the results of spot sampling is more likely affected by pollution discharge or rainfall the current dgt sampler showed relatively high detection limits for bps which may restrict large scale application of field deployment in less impacted regions however the sensitivity of dgt can be effectively improved by increasing longer deployment time expanding sampling area with several dgt devices and using less reconstituted solution application of the passive samplers for monitoring of seasonal occurrence of bps in coast waters showed its capability for risk assessment in typical sources of bp type uv filters to the best of our knowledge this is one of the first study using dgt method for the measurement of organic uv filters and conducting risk assessment in coastal environment the current study expands dgt applications in the measurement of organic pollutants in aquatic environment and demonstrates that dgt is an

15699,benzophenone bp type uv filters are continuously released into various aquatic environments via the effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps and recreational activities in coastal beaches in this study we developed a robust and reliable sampling approach diffusive gradients in thin films dgt for seasonal monitoring of six bp derivatives in coastal waters to investigate their occurrence and environmental risk the binding capacities of both xad 2 and hlb gels for test bps were over 252 μg with no significant deterioration in marine environment suggesting that theoretically dgt is capable of sampling for at least 3 months effectively the diffusion coefficients of bps in freshwater and seawater were determined for the first time the sampling performance showed no dependence on environmental conditions including ph 4 0 8 5 ionic strength 0 0001 0 5 m and dissolved organic matter 0 20 mg l 1 the developed dgt samplers were successfully applied in a river estuary linked to a wwtp and a bathing beach at different periods of one year results showed that the concentrations of bps in the coastal waters were dependent on seasonal variation the highest level in summer and the ecological risk should be considered based on the risk quotient values these results demonstrated that the present dgt method is suitable for measuring characterization and risk assessment of bps in freshwater and marine environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords benzophenone type uv filters bps diffusive gradients in thin films dgt coastal waters seasonal monitoring data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction benzophenone compounds bps are uv filters which can intensively absorb a wide spectrum of uv radiation widely used in a variety of daily personal care products pcps such as sunscreen body lotions shampoos and cosmetics liao and kannan 2014 tsui et al 2017 zhang et al 2011a 2011b in europe japan and the u s a bps are permitted at levels of up to 10 as active ingredients in sunscreen by the actual legislation sanchez quiles and tovar sanchez 2015 they are also added in synthetic products including plastic bags coating and paints to reduce the damages of uv radiation wang et al 2013 bps enter the aquatic environments either by direct input of outdoor swimmers or by indirect input of the effluent discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps kim and choi 2014 the occurrences of bps are reported in varying levels depending on the intensities of daily use and discharge ranging from ng l 1 in surface water to μg l 1 in wastewater swimming pools and coastal water brausch and rand 2011 mao et al 2019 for example 2 hydroxy 4 methoxybenzophenone 2oh 4meo bp one of the most popular bp type uv filters was reported to occur in songhua river in china at a concentration ranging from 2 3 to 122 ng l 1 zhang et al 2011a 2011b and in an outdoor swimming pool of south bohemia at a concentration around 620 ng l 1 grabicova et al 2013 a high concentration of 2oh 4meo bp up to 10 400 ng l 1 was detected in the wastewater influent of wwtps in the u s a loraine and pettigrove 2006 several in vitro and in vivo studies have documented the estrogenic activity of bps and thus they have been considered as potential endocrine disrupting chemicals kunz et al 2006 le fol et al 2015 for instance 2oh 4meo bp is associated with weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activity bluethgen et al 2012 schlumpf et al 2001 in addition 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp which are metabolites of 2oh 4meo bp in both animals and humans possess even higher estrogenic activities than that of the precursor kim and choi 2014 other benzophenone derivatives such as 2 2 4 4 oh bp and 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp exhibit even greater estrogen receptor binding affinity than 2oh 4meo bp kunisue et al 2012 apart from their potential endocrine disrupting activity adverse acute and chronic effects on zooplankton and coral reefs are also associated with bps exposure he et al 2019 mao et al 2017 mitchelmore et al 2019 due to the potential ecological and health risks of bps constant monitoring of their concentrations in aquatic environment is required in water quality assessment in which sampling is a first crucial step traditionally grab sampling is accomplished by collecting a large volume of water sample usually above 500 ml followed by preconcentration and cleanup with solid phase extraction spe li et al 2007 rodil et al 2008 however such spot sampling can only provide instantaneous information at a certain sampling point and or time when the concentrations of pollutants greatly fluctuate in the sampling water body such as effluent dumping or rainfall collecting a large number of samples or increasing sampling frequencies are necessary to obtain the time weighted average twa concentration which is laborious and time consuming passive sampling is an alternative option to reduce the mentioned drawbacks and can provide the twa concentration several passive sampling techniques have been used for monitoring of organic uv filters in various waters including polar organic chemical integrative sampler pocis fent et al 2010 zenker et al 2008 and semipermeable membrane devices spmds ahmadi et al 2017 balmer et al 2005 however a common limitation is that the thickness of the diffusive boundary layers dbl formed on the surface of these sampling devices highly depends on hydrodynamic conditions and thus affects the sampling rates bartelt hunt et al 2011 caban et al 2021 calibration carried out in laboratories cannot effectively represent real environmental conditions causing measurement errors diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is developed as a passive sampling technique that provides in situ sampling of trace analytes in aquatic environment without needing field calibration because the uptake of analytes is under the diffusion control through a well defined diffusive phase davison and zhang 1994 zhang and davison 1995 within nearly 30 years dgt has been widely applied for monitoring of inorganic substances including trace metal ions zhang and davison 1995 nutrients zhang et al 1998 and radioactive elements li et al 2006 and organic pollutants such as antibiotics chen et al 2013 pesticides fauvelle et al 2015 household and personal care products chen et al 2017 illicit drugs guo et al 2017 psychiatric pharmaceuticals fang et al 2019 perfluoroalkyl substances fang et al 2021 guan et al 2018 wang et al 2021 synthetic musks ren et al 2020 organophosphorus flame retardants zou et al 2018 and microcystins wang et al 2022b at present o dgt dgt to trace organic contaminants has measured over 200 organic chemicals with molecular weight ranging from 128 17 to 916 11 da and hydrophobicity octanol water partition coefficient log k ow ranging from 4 51 to 7 51 guibal et al 2019 however to our knowledge the application of dgt for monitoring bp uv filters has not been studied to date in addition most studies have tended to conduct o dgt sampling in the sewage of wwtps or surface fresh water to reveal the occurrence and source of pollutants chen et al 2017 fang et al 2019 guo et al 2017 few researches focus on the applications of o dgt in marine environment despite the relatively high frequency of these chemicals in coastal waters associated with bathing beaches and the effluents of wwtps the primary objective of this study is to develop a reliable dgt sampling method for accurate monitoring of bp type uv filters and apply it in two typical sampling sites with high incidence of these compounds six bps were selected to examine the performance of dgt under different experimental conditions their diffusion coefficients for fresh water and seawater were firstly reported and sampling characteristics such as deployment time effects of ph ionic strength and dom were investigated systematically the developed method was finally validated in field environment and it was used in monitoring the occurrence and seasonal variation of bps in a river estuary linked to a wwtp and a sea bathing beach in dalian china 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents six bp type uv filters with purity 97 namely 2oh 4meo bp 2 4oh bp 2 3 4oh bp 2 2 4 4 oh bp 2 2 oh 4meo bp and 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp were purchased from sigma aldrich shanghai china benzophenone d10 macklin shanghai china and 13c12 pcb 209 j k scientific chemical china were used as surrogate and internal standard respectively the environmentally important physicochemical properties are provided in supporting materials stock solutions of the chemicals at 1000 μg l 1 were prepared in hplc grade methanol meoh and stored at 20 c in the dark organic solvents including meoh dichloromethane dcm of hplc grade were obtained from sigma aldrich all glass containers involved in the experiment were thoroughly washed by meoh and milli q water bedford usa 2 2 preparation of dgt samplers standard dgt moldings made of abs acetonitrile butadiene styrene plastic were provided by dgt research ltd nanjing china our previous work investigated the excellent performance of xad 2 resin binding gel for the measurement of moderate polar organic chemicals ren et al 2020 here xad 2 gel and hlb gel as binding phases were prepared according to previously published procedures fang et al 2019 ren et al 2020 briefly 0 2 g agarose powder was added into 10 ml milli q water and heated until the solution was transparent 2 g wet weight xad 2 or hlb powder was then added to the agarose solution mixed and quickly injected into the preheated glass mold with a ptfe spacer of 0 5 mm thickness agarose diffusive gel of 1 0 mm thickness was prepared by the cooling of the hot agarose solution 1 5 zhang and davison 1999 nuclepore track etched polycarbonate filter membrane pc 0 015 mm thick whatman was adopted as a filter membrane to prevent biofouling from destroying the structure of the sampler the information on the assessment of possible adsorption of bps onto dgt moldings agarose gels and different filter membranes were given in supporting materials 2 3 elution efficiencies and uptake kinetics xad 2 or hlb gel discs were immersed in 10 ml solutions containing 20 50 or 100 μg l 1 bps with 0 01 m nacl after 24 h of shaking the gel discs were transferred into 5 ml of meoh dcm 1 1 v v solution shaken for 12 h the elution procedure was conducted twice and 50 ng of the surrogate standards were added into the combined eluent then the eluent was concentrated and solvent exchanged into 1 ml dcm for gc ms analysis the elution efficiencies f e of bps were calculated by the difference between the eluted mass and adsorbed mass on the binding gel to determine the uptake kinetics for bps the binding gel discs were soaked in a 10 ml solution of 100 μg l 1 bps for different time 1 min to 24 h and the binding mass of bps was calculated by determining the extracted mass 2 4 binding capacity of dgt devices the standard dgt devices equipped with a xad 2 or hlb binding gel were deployed in 2 l of well stirred 0 01 m nacl solution or artificial seawater constituents listed in table s4 with different levels of bps 50 to 800 μg l 1 for 72 h at room temperature 25 1 c the sampling solutions were protected from light during dgt sampling to prevent the degradation of bps all the deployed solutions were pre equilibrated for 12 h prior to deployment and refreshed every 24 h to avoid possible reduction of bps concentration 2 5 measurement of diffusion coefficients diffusion coefficients of bps in fresh water and artificial seawater were measured using the dgt method ren et al 2020 briefly 2 l deployed solutions 0 01 m nacl solution or artificial seawater were spiked with 100 μg l 1 of six bps and equilibrated for 12 h the assembled dgt devices equipped with xad 2 gel agarose gel of 1 0 mm thickness and pc filter membrane of 0 015 mm thickness were deployed in the solutions which were well stirred for 12 h the dgt devices were taken at each 1 h interval for eluting the binding gel and at the same time 10 ml of the deployed solutions were collected to assess the concentration changes of bps the diffusion coefficients of bps in fresh water df and artificial seawater ds were calculated based on the slope of the linear plot of the accumulated mass of each bp on the binding gel versus time according to eq 1 1 d slope δ g c a a is the area of the exposure window of dgt device c is the solution concentration of bps and δg is the thicknesses of diffusive layer 2 6 calculation of dgt measured concentration m is mass ng of bps in binding gel and it is calculated by eq 2 2 m c e v e v g e l f e where c e μg l 1 is bps concentration in eluent v e ml is volume of eluent v gel ml is volume of binding gel and f e is elution efficiency of each bp the concentrations of bps measured by dgt c dgt are calculated by eq 3 3 c d g t m δ g δ d a t where δg cm is diffusive layer thickness d cm2 s 1 is diffusion coefficients of bps through the diffusive gel t s is deployment time and a cm2 is exposure area of dgt device δ cm is the thickness of diffusion boundary layer dbl which can be ignored in well flowing waters santner et al 2015 warnken et al 2006 2 7 performance of dgt sampling under different conditions xad 2 dgt devices were immersed in 2 l solutions spiked with 50 μg l 1 bps for 12 h to assess the effects of ph ionic strength is and dissolved organic matter dom on the dgt sampling performance the solutions were stirred well during deployment a bps solution containing 0 01 m nacl with ph ranging from 4 0 to 8 5 b bps solution at ph 6 2 and is ranging from 0 0001 to 0 5 m nacl c bps solution 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 with humic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 mg l 1 dgt devices were deployed in 2 l solutions 0 01 m nacl ph 6 2 spiked 20 μg l 1 of bps for 7 d to test responses of dgt sampler to the deployment times the deployed solutions were refreshed every 24 h and covered with an aluminum foil to avoid possible concentration change the dgt devices were retrieved in different deployment time from 6 h to 7 d 2 8 field deployment dalian is a coastal city located in the northeast of china the distinguished scene and attractiveness of the bathing beach enable the annual tourists peak in june to september two sampling sites ling shui river estuary ls and xing hai bathing beach xh linked to indirect and direct pollution sources of organic uv filters were selected for this study ls is impacted by rainwater discharge and a main wwtp in the region which treats domestic sewage of 200 000 individuals fig 1 xh is within an urban park so it is influenced by beach tourism multiple dgt devices fixed on a special shelf were deployed at 0 45 m under the water surface of the sampling sites for 5 to 7 d together with an automatic continuous temperature recorder th4xw china the dgt devices in xh were deployed below the buoy 100 m away from the coast to avoid the impact of sea waves fig s1 both sites were sampled every season in 2021 by dgt table s12 during the dgt sampling period the water flow at the sampling sites maintained well turbulence the formed dbl layer on dgt device can be ignored challis et al 2016 after sampling the dgt devices with no obvious biofilms were retrieved and stored in clean plastic bags at 4 c till the binding gels were taken out in the lab for extraction for grab sampling the water samples were collected using ptfe bottles at 0 3rd 5th and 7th d during the 7 day dgt deployment and were immediately pretreated by solid phase extraction supporting materials all procedures were accomplished within 3 d after sampling 2 9 environmental risk assessment potential environmental risk of bps was evaluated by risk quotients rqs index guo et al 2020 tsui et al 2014 which were quantified by the ratio of environmental concentration mec of bps to the predicted no effect concentration pnec eq 4 the total rq rqtotal is defined as the sum of the rq of each bp eq 5 4 r q m e c p n e c 5 r q t o t a l i 1 n r q i i 1 n m e c i p n e c i mec represents the concentration of bps in the present study pnec was obtained from available ecotoxicological data with an assessment factor which was calculated according to european commission guidelines 2003 covering the acute and chronic toxicity species variations and laboratory field test moreover the ecotoxicological data of freshwater and marine organisms were considered to derive the corresponding pnec in different environments table s14 the highest mec mecmax and the lowest pnec values were used in risk assessment to reflect the worst case scenario the rq based evaluation is classified into four risk categories unlikely to pose risk rq 0 01 low risk 0 01 rq 0 1 medium risk 0 1 rq 1 and high risk rq 1 tsui et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of bps on dgt devices the adsorption of bps by dgt devices including filter membrane diffusive gel and dgt moldings should be minimized to avoid long lag phase of target analytes in initial deployment ren et al 2020 adsorption tests fig s2 showed that the retentions of all bps on agarose gel and dgt molding were negligible 6 there were varying degree adsorptions for bps on the seven types of filter membranes among which mce filter membrane had the maximum adsorption to bps 77 5 on average while bps were minimally adsorbed on pc membrane 15 4 the retentions of bps on pvdf pes pp nl and ptfe were considerable with the adsorption rates ranging from 19 5 to 57 0 therefore pc filter membrane and agarose diffusive gel were selected in dgt devices for bps measurement 3 2 elution efficiency reliable elution efficiency can precisely obtain the binding mass of target analytes and then ensure accurate quantitation for dgt measurements here meoh dcm 1 1 v v was applied as an eluent for xad 2 and hlb gels because the mixed solvent could efficiently elute the target bps with different polarity from the binding gels although the elution efficiencies of xad 2 gel for bps were higher than those of hlb gel fig s3 both of the binding gels generally provided a stable and effective elution efficiency more than 80 for each bp at three concentration levels high recoveries of xad 2 or hlb binding gels have also been confirmed for other organic chemicals such as synthetic musks ren et al 2020 household and personal care products chen et al 2017 and endocrine disrupting chemicals chen et al 2018 3 3 uptake kinetics and binding capacity the binding kinetics of bps on xad 2 and hlb gels fig 2 showed that the accumulated masses of bps by both gels increased rapidly with the deployment time within the first 1 h and the uptakes of four bps onto xad 2 gel were slightly faster than hlb gel in the initial stage for example xad 2 gel accumulated over 90 mass of 2oh 4meo bp in the exposure solution within 1 h while hlb gel adsorbed only 53 4 mass of 2oh 4meo bp in the first hour xad 2 is a nonionic resin more suitable for bps which mostly exist in neutral form with slight hydrophobicity the average binding rates of bps during the first 10 min were 14 6 and 8 7 ng cm 2 min 1 for xad 2 gel and hlb gel respectively the binding rates are much higher than the average fluxes of bps 0 49 ng cm 2 min 1 through a diffusive phase of 1 0 mm thickness assuming a solution concentration of 100 μg l 1 this result indicates that the rapid uptake of bps onto the binding gels can ensure the interface concentrations of bps between the binding gel and diffusive gel being zero during dgt deployment which is a crucial prerequisite for dgt measurement the binding capacities of target analytes are closely tied with the effectiveness of dgt in long term deployment in field aquatic environment especially in highly polluted or high saline waters the accumulated masses of bps in the dgt devices equipped with hlb and or xad 2 binding gels showed linear increase with the increase of bps concentration in deployed freshwater fig s4 the effective binding capacity of each bp ranged from 31 5 to 61 2 μg per device and the total capacity of each dgt device was over 252 μg of bps in freshwater if the dgt device is deployed in the solution with the concentration of bps up to 100 μg l 1 this capacity can guarantee effective sampling for at least 3 months in the conditions without biofouling and device damage correspondingly the good linear relationship between the dgt accumulated mass and the bps concentration in artificial seawater fig s5 indicated that the capacity was not significantly deteriorated under the high salinity condition there was no significant difference anova p 0 05 between the two types of binding gels when the dgt devices were deployed in the solutions at the same bps concentration considering that xad 2 provided a faster binding rate for target bps and a comparable binding capacity to that of hlb gel xad 2 gel was adopted as the binding phase of the dgt devices for subsequent experiments 3 4 measurement of diffusion coefficients the diffusion coefficients of bps were measured by a dgt method the time dependence of the accumulated bps mass in xad dgt devices in freshwater and artificial seawater is shown in fig s6 the mass of bps on the binding gel increased linearly with time in freshwater and artificial seawater when the concentration in the deployed solution was constant the measured diffusion coefficients of bps in freshwater df or seawater ds at 23 5 c were calculated from eq 1 based on the slope of the mass plot versus time table s7 the obtained df and ds values of bps were in the range of 4 21 8 17 and 4 04 6 57 respectively table 1 the ds values were slightly lower than the df and the ratio of ds df ranged from 0 77 to 0 96 the reduction of the diffusion coefficients in artificial seawater might be due to the increase of solution viscosity in high ionic strength zhang and davison 1999 0 8 0 9 times of df was usually used as the diffusion coefficients of analytes in seawater for measurements of most inorganic pollutants hutchins et al 2012 panther et al 2010 similar results were observed in previous studies for organic pollutants xie et al 2018a xie et al 2018b where the diffusion coefficients for antibiotics and endocrine disrupting chemicals in artificial seawater were in good agreement with those in freshwater with a difference of less than 30 the diffusion coefficients of bps in different temperature dt were calculated from eq 6 and listed in si 6 log d t 1 37023 t 25 8 36 10 4 t 25 2 109 t log d 25 273 t 298 3 5 effects of ph ion strength and dom ph is and dom are essential environmental parameters in aquatic environment which may affect the performance of dgt sampling via changing analyte species surface charges and competitive adsorption on binding phase here extent of the effect was evaluated based on the average ratios of the bps concentration cdgt measured by dgt to the solution concentration csoln of bps by direct measurement results showed that the cdgt csoln ratios of target bps were in the acceptable range of 0 9 1 1 when solution ph laid between 4 0 and 8 5 fig s7a indicating no significant ph effect on the dgt performance the structure of bps contains a benzophenone structure with different numbers of hydroxyl and methoxy groups and their pka values are 7 table s2 most bps are in the neutral form in the ph range which is conducive for the adsorption of bps on the binding phase these results demonstrate that the current dgt samplers have desirable tolerance to a wide ph range and are suitable for direct sampling of most natural waters when xad dgt samplers were deployed in the solutions containing 0 0001 0 5 m nacl the dgt measured concentrations of bps agreed well with their concentrations in the solutions with the ratios of cdgt csoln in the range of 0 9 1 1 fig s7b this indicates that the is do not significantly influence the performance of dgt in measuring bps concentration therefore xad 2 dgt samplers have potential for monitoring bps in a typical high salinity environment such as seawater dissolve organic matter is extensively found in surface waters in the range of 0 50 mg l 1 and an average concentration of 5 7 mg l 1 fang et al 2021 sobek et al 2007 the concentration of dom in natural seawater is much lower ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 mg l 1 kye et al 2021 the present result fig s7c showed no significant dependence of dgt performance on dom concentration in the solution when the dom concentration varied from 0 to 20 mg l 1 the cdgt csoln ratios were within 0 9 1 1 in addition a current study investigated that no obvious impact of dom on capacity of binding gels for organics in natural waters wang et al 2022a therefore the current dgt device is competent to the measurement requirement of bps in most surface waters 3 6 deployment time according to eq 3 the detectable levels of dgt measurement can be reduced by extending developed time to achieve monitoring for trace organic pollutants in the environment the accumulated mass of bps in dgt devices increased linearly with the deployment time for 7 d and fitted well with the theoretical value fig 3 similar response to deployment time was observed when the device was deployed in artificial seawater for 7 d fig s8 the robustness of xad dgt for long term deployment was also verified when measuring synthetic musks using xad 2 dgt ren et al 2020 and perfluoroalkyl substances using xad 18 dgt guan et al 2018 3 7 blank and detection limits the dgt blank instrument quantitation limits iqls and dgt method quantitation limits mqls are given in table s1 no detectable bps were found in the eluent of the binding gels retrieved from the dgt devices that were deployed in the blank solution for 7 d the mqls calculated from eq 3 based on 7 d dgt deployment at 25 c were 0 6 9 1 and 0 6 10 4 ng l 1 in freshwater and seawater respectively the results showed that the present method could provide a sensitive and reliable measurement for bps in natural waters at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 in surface waters to μg l 1 in sewage of wwtps table s13 3 8 seasonal monitoring in coastal waters bath beaches and wwtps are considered to be the most likely sources of bps entering the aquatic environment here dgt samplers were deployed at the two sampling sites of ling shui river estuary ls and xing hai bathing beach xh in different periods of one year for monitoring of target bps ls is located near an urban sewage outlet while xh is located in a sea bathing beach 3 km away from ls fig 4 presents the cumulative concentrations of target bps by dgt and grab sampling in the two sampling sites generally the distribution patterns of bps obtained from the dgt were in good agreement with those from grab sampling with the concentration of each bp in the same order of magnitude there was an exception for spring in which the concentrations of bps in most grab samples were less than the dgt measured concentrations and even not detected figs s9 and s10 the most likely reason is that grab sampling was easily affected by dilution caused by rainfall in spring while dgt sampling were less affected by the irregular discharge of pollutants or dilution and provided twa concentrations at the two coastal sampling sites the concentration distributions of detected bps were similar while the total concentration cbps in ls 388 1 3817 2 ng l 1 was significantly higher than that of xh 165 1778 ng l 1 p 0 05 indicating that the effluent discharge of wwtps is the main source of bps in the coastal waters of dalian china in addition the distributions of bps in one year exhibited distinct seasonal characteristics the highest concentration occurring in summer and the lowest concentration occurring in spring similar seasonal release events of some uv filters were observed previously in sewage of wwtps ekpeghere et al 2016 wu et al 2018 and coastal waters pintado herrera et al 2020 sankoda et al 2015 the economy of dalian is highly dependent on tourism especially in coastal area where the population surge during the summer with over 100 000 tourists arriving in fig s11 hot weather promotes the frequency of daily bathing seaside leisure and sea swimming high bps level in wwtp effluent and bathing beach in tourism areas are expected bps in winter and autumn were characterized by a smaller concentration with the medium level for each compound was 67 71 lower than that in summer the lowest concentration of bps in spring is only 16 of that in summer as shown in fig 4 the concentration gap of bps in different seasons are affected by temperature changes as well as continuous rain episodes allow rainwater discharge into the ls estuary to dilute pollutants especially in spring in xh strong sea waves on rainy days also accelerated the migration of coastal pollutants to the open sea resulting in few species and low concentrations of bps being monitored in spring fig s10 the measured bps concentration in the present study were generally comparable with worldwide occurrence of various bps in surface waters table s13 2 4oh bp 25 8 58 8 and 2 2 4 4 oh bp 17 4 39 5 accounted for the largest proportions of the detected bps the high detected concentrations are attributed to the wide applications of these two bps in sunscreen products in summer 2 2 4 4 oh bp tended to occur in ls while 2 4oh bp was more detected in xh their predominance in different environmental substrates may be due to the characters in the formulations of commercial products table s11 for example 2 2 4 4 oh bp an additive commonly found in daily personal care products e g shampoos hair conditioners and skin care products may have higher possibility of discharge via domestic sewage than 2 4oh bp which is more likely to be added in fashion cosmetics e g fragrance nail polish and lipsticks nevertheless 2oh 4meo bp with the highest detection frequency worldwide accounted for a relatively low proportion 2 2 5 7 of the total bps in different seasons 10 6 193 8 ng l 1 in ls and 5 4 39 4 ng l 1 in xh a possible explanation is that 2oh 4meo bp was mostly released into the environment in its form of biological metabolites such as 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp kim and choi 2014 kunisue et al 2012 another bp derivative 2 3 4oh bp was rarely detected in environmental media because this compound has not been commercially used yang and ying 2013 and it was not detected in the study area 3 9 environmental risk assessment a preliminary risk assessment was carried out to establish potential ecotoxicological data of the bps for aquatic organisms in ls estuary 2 4oh bp had the largest contribution to the risks table 2 the rqs accounting for over 60 of rqtotal for bps showing medium and high risks to the organisms in winter and summer respectively 2 2 4 4 oh bp and 2oh 4meo bp posed a medium or low risk to the aquatic organisms throughout the year the remaining bps with rq 0 1 indicated low and even unlikely posed risk correspondingly the rqtotal of bps was 1 at three seasons during the year and the highest rqtotal was 3 29 in summer various studies have conducted ecotoxicological risk assessments of bps in fresh waters guo et al 2020 wu et al 2017 while risk data of bps in marine environment is limited the bps in xh including 2oh 4meo bp 2 4oh bp and 2 2 oh 4meo bp their rq values were higher than 0 1 and even 1 demonstrating this type of uv filters in the coastal waters exhibited potential ecological risk to the marine organisms it is noteworthy that the obtained rq values of 2oh 4meo bp in xh significantly higher than those in ls because of the increased sensitivity of toxicity to the marine organisms such as algae paredes et al 2014 and coral downs et al 2016 due to the lack of ecotoxicological data for marine organisms the current risk quotients of 2 2 oh 4 4 meo bp and 2 3 4oh bp are missing overall the results showed the bps in the sampling sites may pose a significant ecological risk to the aquatic organisms for most seasons of the year which is largely attributed to the locations closely linked to the primary emission sources of uv filters generally as contaminants are diluted with river runoff and ocean tidal forces the occurrence and corresponding risks of bps gradually decrease far away from the input sources although most studies have confirmed that the risk of bps in river water and marine environment is relatively low the potential ecological risks caused by continuous discharge still need to be monitored progressively 4 conclusion this study demonstrated the feasibility of in situ sampling based on dgt for seasonal measurement of bp type uv filters in coastal waters the dgt devices using xad 2 binding gel offer a promising performance for monitoring of bps the stability and reliability of the dgt samplers in freshwater and seawater was verified in laboratory tests and field deployments the implementation of dgt devices is beneficial for general monitoring of analytes with highly fluctuating concentrations compared to traditional grab sampling since the results of spot sampling is more likely affected by pollution discharge or rainfall the current dgt sampler showed relatively high detection limits for bps which may restrict large scale application of field deployment in less impacted regions however the sensitivity of dgt can be effectively improved by increasing longer deployment time expanding sampling area with several dgt devices and using less reconstituted solution application of the passive samplers for monitoring of seasonal occurrence of bps in coast waters showed its capability for risk assessment in typical sources of bp type uv filters to the best of our knowledge this is one of the first study using dgt method for the measurement of organic uv filters and conducting risk assessment in coastal environment the current study expands dgt applications in the measurement of organic pollutants in aquatic environment and demonstrates that dgt is an efficient tool for in situ monitoring of bp type uv filters in coastal waters supporting materials detailed information on material and target chemicals instrumental and data analysis qa qc
