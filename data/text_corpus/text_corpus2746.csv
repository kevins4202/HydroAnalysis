physical parameters such as electron spin root mean square rms gradient adsorption energy mulliken charge density q and bond lengths bl before and after adsorption were computed it was concluded that langmuir adsorption isotherm was favorable for this study and interaction of hg was more favorable with mn than cu because of less adsorption energy 112 48 ev and stronger bond formation between them

has introduced toxic heavy metals into the natural water bodies which needs effective control for human welfare and healthy ecosystem heavy metals are considered as serious environmental and human health concern due to stable persistent toxic behavior and accumulation in food chain 1 among other toxic metals mercury hg is also listed one of the highly toxic metals which can be easily bio accumulated and threatening natural ecosystem and human health 2 4 mercury ii is highly reactive and most toxic form of hg which can be transformed into neurotoxic substance methyl mercury and can pose serious health risk to wild life and humans 5 6 therefore the consumption of hg contaminated water and food leads to damage in central nervous system affects kidney and liver and causes minamata disease 7 9 considering the toxicity of hg ii the maximum permissible limit of hg ii in drinking water proposed by usepa as 2 μg l 1 while the permissible limit set by who is 6 μg l 1 10 11 the major source of hg ii contamination in natural water bodies are waste from oil refineries batteries paints pulps and mining industries 12 13 once it is entered into water sources the hg ii ions become deposited into sediments and evaporate and contaminate other water bodies by transport through water cycle and are transformed into more toxic methyl mercury 14 15 for remediation of toxic hg ii many

several time with distilled water to remove cu residues and dried at 95 c for 30 min 2 3 adsorption experiment for hg ii removal to investigate the efficiency of mn cu bimetallic nps to capture hg ii ions from aqueous media batch experiment was designed the experiment was carried out in triplicate and average values were used to examine the adsorptive removal of hg ii ions prior to batch

was computed and removal efficiency for any adsorbent can be measured by equation 1 and 2 respectively 1 efficiency co ce co x 100 2 sorption capacity qe co ce w x v where co and ce mg l represent initial and equilibrium concentrations w and v are weight mass of nano particles and volume of working solution used two commonly used kinetic models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order reaction kinetics were calculated for hg ii sorption on mn cu nps isotherm is a mathematical function which describes equilibrium data between adsorbate in liquid and adsorbent in solid phase and is used to predict quantitative comparison between adsorption capacities of different solid adsorbents 36 to investigate adsorption isotherms for study three most commonly used isotherms were computed namely langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms 2 6 langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms langmuir isotherm is based on theory that maximum adsorption on surface occurs when saturated monolayers of adsorbate molecules are present on adsorbent surface and there is no any interaction between adsorbate molecules on surface plane langmuir isotherm can be defined by following linear equation 3 1 qe 1 qm kl 1 ce 1 qm the values of kl and qm can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the plotted graph here the qm mg g indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of hg ii ions per unit mass of sorbent to form a complete monolayer on the mn cu surface whereas frednlich isotherms expresses the theory of multilayer formation of adsorbate on heterogeneous systems it can be explained using equation 4 log qe n log ce log kf the constant values of kf and n can be measured by intercept and slope of graph plotted of log ce against log qe here 1 n indicates adsorption intensity constant and kf adsorption capacity constant sips isotherm expresses combined behaviors of both frendlich and langmuir isotherms it is included in three parameter isotherm when equilibrium concentration ce of adsorbate is at high level the sips isotherm predicts langmuir adsorption with monolayer while at low ce values it reduces to frendlich and multi layer formation the linear equation of sips isotherm can be expressed as 5 1 qe 1 q max ks 1 ce 1 n 1 q max ks 1 mg is known as sips equilibrium constant and q max mgg 1 is maximum adsorption capacity obtained by sips isotherm the values of both quantities are observed by intercept and slope of plotted graph 2 7 hg ii sorption in real drinking water sample two drinking water samples 1 l were collected separately from water supply tank available at university of sindh jamshoro pakistan one sample was preserved with 0 01 m hno3 pre concentrated and determined for hg contents using cv aas method in to laboratory another sample was spiked with 10 mgl 1 of hg ii and examined for batch experiments at optimized conditions total dissolved salts tds and ph of collected water samples were also measured using hach company ec tds meter and ph meter of wtw company germany 2 8 computational studies in this section the computational studies were carried out for various structures initially the structures were built using gauss view version 5 0 and optimization calculations were performed using gaussian 09 w version software calculations of all molecular structures were performed by pm6 level of semi empirical method of quantum model pm6 level of semi empirical quantum model computed important physical parameters such as spin total energy te root mean square rms gradient mulliken charge density bond lengths and bond angles 3 results and discussion 3 1 afm and eds characterization in order to study the morphology of mn cu bimetallic nps 2d and 3d afm images were measured at magnification of 5 μm shown in fig 1 a and b fig 1 a shows 2d and 1 b shows 3d afm images 2d image indicated nano particles were slightly separated from each other with shining surfaces afm measurements of nps revealed that the rms value observed was 90 2 nm average height of particles was 220 nm and mean grain size of 450 50 nm fig 1b eds data is used to interperate the elemental composition on nano particle surface so in order to check the hg ii sorption on mn cu nps surface eds technique was performed after adsorption experiment peak of hg on eds graph fig 1c represented successful adsorption of hg on mn cu surface 3 2 xrd characterization the xrd spectra of mn cu nps before and after hg ii sorption were recorded xrd graph of 4 1 mn cu bimetallic observed the same standard pattern as reported in literature 37 which indicated that nanoparticle sample had single phase spinel structure standard xrd patterns represented three major peaks at θ angle between 30 to 50 as same is represented in fig 2 a strong diffraction peak at 43 fig 2a originated due to single crystalline structure of cu present in bimetallic nanoparticles 38 while other peaks correspondent to mn structures whereas after hg sorption on mn cu bimetallic surface the slightly change in xrd pattern observed as fig 2 b slight shift in peaks angles and origination of small peaks fig 2b were possibly due to presence of hg impurities after hg adsorption 3 3 dls and zeta potential characterization in order to examine the particle size analysis dls was measured dls technique recorded the particle size distribution in a given volume of a solution the dls result of mn cu nps is shown in fig 3 a in which two peaks can be seen first smaller one observed at 56 nm while the second larger and major peak was observed at 110 nm the later one 110 nm indicates average particles size of nano particles present in solution zeta potential characterization indicates the stability of nanoparticles in a dispersed solution zeta potential value greater less than 30 mv and greater than 30 mv is indication of stable nature of nano particles in dispersion solution 39 the zeta potential value observed for mn cu bimetallic nps was 18 1 mv as shown in fig 3 b indicated moderate stability of mn cu nanopartilces negative charge on particles also favored attraction and sorption of positively charged hg ii ions 3 4 dependency of hg adsorption on ph the ph plays significant role in adsorption process the efficiency of hg ii adsorption on mn cu nano particles was studied at various ph values the ph values studied were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 the optimum ph for hg ii uptake by mn cu nps was observed at neutral ph 7 which is considered as very well for natural water the maximum removal efficiency of 95 was observed at this ph as shown in fig 4 a the decrease of hg uptake in acidic ph is due to corrosion of bimetallic mn cu nps surface in acidic as a result does not allow hg ii ions to adsorb on mn cu nps surface because of formation of hydroxide complexes of hg ii ions in alkaline ph value above 8 restricts the suitability for adsorption studies hence were not under consideration during this study 3 5 effect of adsorbent dose hg ii concentration and contact time the attempts were made in order to investigate variation in mn cu nps dose hg ii concentration and contact time were fixed at optimum the experimental conditions initially nano particles doses were optimized starting from 5 mg 10 mg 15 and 20 mg in 1 mg l 1 solution of hg ii having 50 ml volume and maximum removal efficiency was reported at 10 mg nps dose similarly hg ii concentration and contact time experiments were performed in triplicate for concentration studies two ranges were chosen the lowest concentration of hg ii studied was 10 μgl 1 and higher concentrations were 0 1 mg l 1 0 5 mg l 1 1 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 for sorption experiments hg ii 10 μgl 1 was taken for batch experiments triplicate n 3 and residual concentration measured after adsorption was below detection limit bdl which suggested more than 80 removal efficiency detection limit for cv aas techniques used was 2 μgl 1 while for higher concentrations the maximum adsorption equilibrium was achieved at 10 mg l 1 hg ii with average maximum 95 removal efficiency with rsd 3 1 n 3 the contact time effect was observed for 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min and 60 min at same rpm speed of 100 rpm the maximum efficiency was achieved at contact time of 15 min the removal efficiency achieved at optimized conditions was 95 with 2 89 rsd n 3 3 6 removal efficiency and adsorption capacity adsorption capacity and removal efficiency relation was measured and it was noted that with the increase in adsorbent dose mass the removal efficiency increased at certain point then became constant whereas adsorption capacity was decreased same type of relation was observed in previous study 40 the increase in removal efficiency is related to increase in active sites available at mn cu nps surface while the reason behind decrease in adsorption capacity can be described as in same volume the increase in mass resulted overcrowding in solution and hence created hindrance in active sites the relation is expressed in fig 4b 3 7 sorption equilibrium isotherms and reaction kinetics as discussed in earlier section three famous isotherms were computed namely langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms the constant values of isotherms are mentioned in table 1 sorption isotherms of hg ii sorption on mn cu bimetallic surface are represented in fig 5 linear graphs were plotted for all the isotherms this study revealed that langmuir isotherm model was most favorable for hg ii capture on nano particles surface with highest r2 value of 0 992 fig 5a langmuir suggested that the monolayer formation of hg ii on mn cu nps surface had occurred frendlich and sips isotherms indicated r2 values of 0 869 and 0 851 respectively fig 5 b and c the constant parameters such as kf 1 n and kl values were evaluated from intercepts and slopes of plotted graphs pseudo first order and second order reaction kinetics were evaluated for sorption reaction of hg ii on mn cu bimetallic surface current study favored pseudo second order kinetics with maximum r2 value of 0 999 as shown in fig 5d 3 8 leaching of cu from nano particle surface to examine leaching of cu concentration of cu was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas after each batch experiment leaching behavior of cu from nano particle surface in hg ii working solutions during batch experiment was investigated at optimized parameters such as ph dose concentration of hg ii and contact time small amount of cu leaching was observed in ph optimization study at highly acidic ph values 1 and 2 no leaching was observed at other ph values and all other optimization parameters maximum cu leaching 0 55 mg l was measured at ph 1 when maximum optimized dose of 10 mg was used 3 9 computational studies computational studies were carried out using gaussian 09 w version software to optimize the molecular structures the method of computation used was semi empirical with pm6 level of computation semi empirical model calculation uses schrödinger equation with some approximation to explain important physical properties electrons present in an atom or molecule 41 here semi empirical computational studies were carried out for molecular models to draw and optimize different structures before and after hg sorption on mn cu nps surface structural details are mentioned in experimental section physical properties computed after optimization of molecular structures are given in table 2 3 10 molecular models various molecular models showing hg ii adsorption mechanism on mn cu bimetallic nps were built and optimized fig 6 the molecular structures optimized before hg adsorption included mn crystal cu crystal manganese copper bimetallic surfaces mn cu surface and octahedral mercury surrounded by six water molecules hg octa whereas the molecular structures optimized after hg ii adsorption included hg adsorption on manganese surface hg mn surface hg adsorption on copper surface hg cu surface and finally a mixed structure showing hg adsorption on both manganese and copper surfaces hg mn cu mixed because this was study focused on hg ii sorption in aqueous media hence all the molecular structures were surrounded by water molecules while optimization calculations previous studies suggested that stable hydration structure or coordination number of hg ii ions in aqueous media is 6 fig 6 d 42 similarly molecular models after hg sorption were drawn and optimized mn atom 5 mn5 and cu atom 14 cu14 were chosen as sorption sites for hg interaction on mn cu bimetallic surface fig 7 a and b however adsorptions on individual and combined surfaces was also computed fig 7 c molecular structures after adsorption included hg adsorption on mn bimetallic surface hg mn surface cu bimetallic surface hg cu bimetallic surface and mixed structure showing both mn and cu bimetallic surface hg mn cu mixed as shown fig 7 3 11 optimized physical parameters spin of molecular structure represents the angular moment of all electrons present in molecule molecular spins are doublet singlet or triplate doublet spin shows the presence of electrons with half 1 2 spin whereas singlet spin state refers presence of paired electrons with no spin in this work the optimized structures of mn crystal and cu crystal showed doublet spin states only while singlet spin state was computed in all the other optimized structures table 2 total energy te measures entire energy owned by molecular geometry te of optimized structures varies dramatically table 2 highest value of te was observed for mn crystal 120 6 ev and lowest for hg octa 15 0 ev the te values for structures that indicate hg sorption on mn cu surface were lowest 6 276079 ev for hg cu surface and highest 25 57981 ev for hg mn cu mixed root mean square rms gradient is physical parameter that tells about the average root mean square motion velocity of all atoms in a molecular geometry it has strong correlation with energy of a molecule due to this correlation with energy values the rms gradient values for optimized structures followed same trend of variations as that of te values with highest values for mn crystal 0 43612678 a u and lowest for hg octa 0 00060788 a u 3 12 mulliken charge density q to investigate the bonding mechanism mulliken charge density q of optimized molecular models were computed mulliken charge density population provides mean partial charge density distribution in a molecule that can be calculated through computational chemistry methods 33 so higher the mulliken charge desnity q higher would be chances of bond formation q values calculated for molecular structures are shown in table 2 all the optimized structures possessed 0 001 negligible q values while the q value for octahedral mercury hg octa is highest that is 0 689 this high value of q for hg octa may be responsible for electrostatic attractions between for hg towards metallic surfaces of mn and cu 3 13 adsorption energy and bond lengths adsorption energy also called binding energy was computed for molecular structures after sorption of hg ii on mn cu bimetallic surface adsorption energy is applied to check the binding of hg ii on mn cu surface and stability finally obtained structures this was measured using formula 6 e adsorption e total adsorbent adsorbate e adsorbent e adsorbate in above formula e total represents the total energy of entire final structure obtained after sorption e adsorbent and e adsorbate are calculated optimized energies of mn or cu surface and hg octa molecules respectively highest negative values of adsorption energy suggest lower energy and greater stability of molecular geometries 43 consequently the highest negative value observed for hg mn surface structure was 112 48 ev while lowest negative value for hg cu surface was 13 5987 ev the hg mn cu mixed structure presented adsorption energy values of 37 12 it can be concluded from binding energy results that sorption of hg was most favorable on mn surface with more stable and lowest energy value model than both hg mn cu mixed and hg cu surface models this argument can be justified from previous studies in which higher negative values were measured for mn doped fe3o4 surface than fe3o4 surface alone 33 and supported that mn is favorable surface for hg adsorption the least favorable sorption was on cu surface due to least stable model bond length bl imposes significant effects on adsorption process stronger bonds possess smaller bond lengths than weaker bonds bl of optimized structures showing hg interactions with mn cu and mixed structures were included in table 2 it can be seen through table that bond formed between hg mn surface is strongest because it has lowest bond length 1 643 å from all other structures the bl in hg mn cu mixed structure was calculated as average bond lengths of hg mn and hg cu no any significance difference was observed between bond lengths of hg cu surface 2 650 å and hg mn cu mixed structure 2 781 å that leads to conclusion that there are almost equal chances of hg adsorption in both structures as hg interaction with mn5 and cu14 atoms on surfaces the effects of its interaction on surrounding nearby atoms was also evaluated mn5 is surrounded by mn 4 6 2 and 8 on other hand cu14 is surrounded by cu 11 17 13 and 15 atoms the change in bl values surrounding cu14 atoms were all negative table 2 which suggested increase in bond distance after hg adsorption hence more unstable geometry whereas change in bl distance values for mn5 surrounded atoms measured were almost positive except mn5 mn2 atoms that is 0 0300 å that means mn5 mn2 bond became weaker after hg interaction while other 3 bonds became stronger indicated more stability in hg mn bonding after adsorption 3 14 interference effect of major ions on hg ii sorption to investigate interference effect of major cations and anions present in real water on hg ii sorption each cation and anion was studied cations included na 1 k 1 ca 2 and mg 2 whereas anions included cl 1 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 1 hg ii solution 10 mg l was added with 100 mg l of each ion separately and studied for batch experiments no any significant decrease in removal efficiency of mn cu nps was measured by cations and anions during interference study the maximum removal efficiency computed for cations was 91 with 4 reduction while for anions maximum efficiency observed was 92 5 1 98 rsd with 2 5 reduction in removal efficiency fig 7 3 15 real water sample results the tds and ph measured for real water sample was 680 mg l and 7 5 respectively the hg content in real drinking water sample was measured below detection limit detection limit 4 μg l the sample was then spiked with 10 mg l of hg the removal efficiency measured in spiked real water sample was 89 0 95 rsd with 6 reduction fig 7 from synthetic hg water this decrease was because of presence of cation anions and other interfering species fig 8 3 16 comparative study comparative study with reported work was presented in table 3 the work was compared in terms of maximum adsorption capacity q max isotherms computational models and adsorption binding energy it was noted that this work indicated much better results than already reported work 4 conclusion it can be concluded that novel mn cu bimetallic nano particles were successfully prepared characterized for afm eds xrd dls and zeta potential and then applied for efficient sorption of hg ii ions from drinking water mn cu bimetallic nps were successfully prepared by using chemical reduction method afm images well separated morphology and mean grain size of 450 50 nm of particles while dls and zeta potential results revealed that nanoparticles possessed average particles size of 110 nm and 18 1 mv respectively it was fond that langmuir adsorption isotherm was favorable with max adsorption capacity q max of 400 mg g good hg ii removal efficiency 89 was computed for real drinking water sample spiked with hg ii semi empirical computational model with pm6 level was successfully implemented to optimize molecular structures before and after hg adsorption computational models suggested that hg ii interacted stronger with mn atoms than cu hence the sorption was more favorable on mn surface than cu 5 declaration of

experiment 10 mg of mn cu nano particles were added in to 50 ml of 10 mg l 1 hg ii solution and ph was adjusted to 7 using phosphate buffer approx2 ml the batch was performed using orbital shaker at 100 rpm for 15 min at room temperature 30 33 c the contents were removed and residual hg ii ions were measured using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer ai 1200 model aurora company vancouver canada at conditions recommended by manufacturer the quantitation was made from freshly prepared linear regression equation of external calibration curve within 6 to 20 μgl 1 for lower range

diffractometer characterization of mn cu nps was measured using bruker d8 diffractometer billerica massachusetts usa with high power cu kα radiation with analytical conditions of 10 90 degrees at 2θ

6380 l jeol ltd tokyo japan at center for pure and applied geology university of sindh jamshoro pakistan 2 5 sorption capacity and kinetics the adsorption capacity of mn cu bimetallic nps for hg ii was computed and removal efficiency for any adsorbent can be measured by equation 1 and 2 respectively 1 efficiency co ce co x 100 2 sorption capacity qe co ce w x v where co and ce mg l represent initial and equilibrium concentrations w and v are weight mass of nano particles and volume of working solution used two commonly used kinetic models namely pseudo first order and pseudo second order reaction kinetics were calculated for hg ii sorption on mn cu nps isotherm is a mathematical function which describes equilibrium data between adsorbate in liquid and adsorbent in solid phase and is used to predict quantitative comparison between adsorption capacities of different solid adsorbents 36 to investigate adsorption isotherms for study three most commonly used isotherms were computed namely langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms 2 6 langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms langmuir isotherm is based on theory that maximum adsorption on surface occurs when saturated monolayers of adsorbate molecules are present on adsorbent surface and there is no any interaction between adsorbate molecules on surface plane langmuir isotherm can be defined by following linear equation 3 1 qe 1 qm kl 1 ce 1 qm the values of kl and qm can be calculated from the intercept and slope of the plotted graph here the qm mg g indicates the maximum adsorption capacity of hg ii ions per unit mass of sorbent to form a complete monolayer on the mn cu surface whereas frednlich isotherms expresses the theory of multilayer formation of adsorbate on heterogeneous systems it can be explained using equation 4 log qe n log ce log kf the constant values of kf and n can be measured by intercept and slope of graph plotted of log ce against log qe here 1 n indicates adsorption intensity constant and kf adsorption capacity constant sips isotherm expresses combined behaviors of both frendlich and langmuir isotherms it is included in three parameter isotherm when equilibrium concentration ce of adsorbate is at high level the sips isotherm predicts langmuir adsorption with monolayer while at low ce values it reduces to frendlich and multi layer formation the linear equation of sips isotherm can be expressed as 5 1 qe 1 q max ks 1 ce 1 n 1 q max ks 1 mg is known as sips equilibrium constant and q max mgg 1 is maximum adsorption capacity obtained by sips isotherm the values of both quantities are observed by intercept and slope of plotted graph 2 7 hg ii sorption in real drinking water sample two drinking water samples 1 l were collected separately from water supply tank available at university of sindh jamshoro pakistan one sample was preserved with 0 01 m hno3 pre concentrated and determined for hg contents using cv aas method in to laboratory another sample was spiked with 10 mgl 1 of hg ii and examined for batch experiments at optimized conditions total dissolved salts tds and ph of collected water samples were also measured using hach company ec tds meter and ph meter of wtw company germany 2 8 computational studies in this section the computational studies were carried out for various structures initially the structures were built using gauss view version 5 0 and optimization calculations were performed using gaussian 09 w version software calculations of all molecular structures were performed by pm6 level of semi empirical method of quantum model pm6 level of semi empirical quantum model computed important physical parameters such as spin total energy te root mean square rms gradient mulliken charge density bond lengths and bond angles 3 results and discussion 3 1 afm and eds characterization in order to study the morphology of mn cu bimetallic nps 2d and 3d afm images were measured at magnification of 5 μm shown in fig 1 a and b fig 1 a shows 2d and 1 b shows 3d afm images 2d image indicated nano particles were slightly separated from each other with shining surfaces afm measurements of nps revealed that the rms value observed was 90 2 nm average height of particles was 220 nm and mean grain size of 450 50 nm fig 1b eds data is used to interperate the elemental composition on nano particle surface so in order to check the hg ii sorption on mn cu nps surface eds technique was performed after adsorption experiment peak of hg on eds graph fig 1c represented successful adsorption of hg on mn cu surface 3 2 xrd characterization the xrd spectra of mn cu nps before and after hg ii sorption were recorded xrd graph of 4 1 mn cu bimetallic observed the same standard pattern as reported in literature 37 which indicated that nanoparticle sample had single phase spinel structure standard xrd patterns represented three major peaks at θ angle between 30 to 50 as same is represented in fig 2 a strong diffraction peak at 43 fig 2a originated due to single crystalline structure of cu present in bimetallic nanoparticles 38 while other peaks correspondent to mn structures whereas after hg sorption on mn cu bimetallic surface the slightly change in xrd pattern observed as fig 2 b slight shift in peaks angles and origination of small peaks fig 2b were possibly due to presence of hg impurities after hg adsorption 3 3 dls and zeta potential characterization in order to examine the particle size analysis dls was measured dls technique recorded the particle size distribution in a given volume of a solution the dls result of mn cu nps is shown in fig 3 a in which two peaks can be seen first smaller one observed at 56 nm while the second larger and major peak was observed at 110 nm the later one 110 nm indicates average particles size of nano particles present in solution zeta potential characterization indicates the stability of nanoparticles in a dispersed solution zeta potential value greater less than 30 mv and greater than 30 mv is indication of stable nature of nano particles in dispersion solution 39 the zeta potential value observed for mn cu bimetallic nps was 18 1 mv as shown in fig 3 b indicated moderate stability of mn cu nanopartilces negative charge on particles also favored attraction and sorption of positively charged hg ii ions 3 4 dependency of hg adsorption on ph the ph plays significant role in adsorption process the efficiency of hg ii adsorption on mn cu nano particles was studied at various ph values the ph values studied were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 the optimum ph for hg ii uptake by mn cu nps was observed at neutral ph 7 which is considered as very well for natural water the maximum removal efficiency of 95 was observed at this ph as shown in fig 4 a the decrease of hg uptake in acidic ph is due to corrosion of bimetallic mn cu nps surface in acidic as a result does not allow hg ii ions to adsorb on mn cu nps surface because of formation of hydroxide complexes of hg ii ions in alkaline ph value above 8 restricts the suitability for adsorption studies hence were not under consideration during this study 3 5 effect of adsorbent dose hg ii concentration and contact time the attempts were made in order to investigate variation in mn cu nps dose hg ii concentration and contact time were fixed at optimum the experimental conditions initially nano particles doses were optimized starting from 5 mg 10 mg 15 and 20 mg in 1 mg l 1 solution of hg ii having 50 ml volume and maximum removal efficiency was reported at 10 mg nps dose similarly hg ii concentration and contact time experiments were performed in triplicate for concentration studies two ranges were chosen the lowest concentration of hg ii studied was 10 μgl 1 and higher concentrations were 0 1 mg l 1 0 5 mg l 1 1 mg l 1 10 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 for sorption experiments hg ii 10 μgl 1 was taken for batch experiments triplicate n 3 and residual concentration measured after adsorption was below detection limit bdl which suggested more than 80 removal efficiency detection limit for cv aas techniques used was 2 μgl 1 while for higher concentrations the maximum adsorption equilibrium was achieved at 10 mg l 1 hg ii with average maximum 95 removal efficiency with rsd 3 1 n 3 the contact time effect was observed for 5 min 10 min 15 min 30 min and 60 min at same rpm speed of 100 rpm the maximum efficiency was achieved at contact time of 15 min the removal efficiency achieved at optimized conditions was 95 with 2 89 rsd n 3 3 6 removal efficiency and adsorption capacity adsorption capacity and removal efficiency relation was measured and it was noted that with the increase in adsorbent dose mass the removal efficiency increased at certain point then became constant whereas adsorption capacity was decreased same type of relation was observed in previous study 40 the increase in removal efficiency is related to increase in active sites available at mn cu nps surface while the reason behind decrease in adsorption capacity can be described as in same volume the increase in mass resulted overcrowding in solution and hence created hindrance in active sites the relation is expressed in fig 4b 3 7 sorption equilibrium isotherms and reaction kinetics as discussed in earlier section three famous isotherms were computed namely langmuir frendlich and sips isotherms the constant values of isotherms are mentioned in table 1 sorption isotherms of hg ii sorption on mn cu bimetallic surface are represented in fig 5 linear graphs were plotted for all the isotherms this study revealed that langmuir isotherm model was most favorable for hg ii capture on nano particles surface with highest r2 value of 0 992 fig 5a langmuir suggested that the monolayer formation of hg ii on mn cu nps surface had occurred frendlich and sips isotherms indicated r2 values of 0 869 and 0 851 respectively fig 5 b and c the constant parameters such as kf 1 n and kl values were evaluated from intercepts and slopes of plotted graphs pseudo first order and second order reaction kinetics were evaluated for sorption reaction of hg ii on mn cu bimetallic surface current study favored pseudo second order kinetics with maximum r2 value of 0 999 as shown in fig 5d 3 8 leaching of cu from nano particle surface to examine leaching of cu concentration of cu was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrometer faas after each batch experiment leaching behavior of cu from nano particle surface in hg ii working solutions during batch experiment was investigated at optimized parameters such as ph dose concentration of hg ii and contact time small amount of cu leaching was observed in ph optimization study at highly acidic ph values 1 and 2 no leaching was observed at other ph values and all other optimization parameters maximum cu leaching 0 55 mg l was measured at ph 1 when maximum optimized dose of 10 mg was used 3 9 computational studies computational studies were carried out using gaussian 09 w version software to optimize the molecular structures the method of computation used was semi empirical with pm6 level of computation semi empirical model calculation uses schrödinger equation with some approximation to explain important physical properties electrons present in an atom or molecule 41 here semi empirical computational studies were carried out for molecular models to draw and optimize different structures before and after hg sorption on mn cu nps surface structural details are mentioned in experimental section physical properties computed after optimization of molecular structures are given in table 2 3 10 molecular models various molecular models showing hg ii adsorption mechanism on mn cu bimetallic nps were built and optimized fig 6 the molecular structures optimized before hg adsorption included mn crystal cu crystal manganese copper bimetallic surfaces mn cu surface and octahedral mercury surrounded by six water molecules hg octa whereas the molecular structures optimized after hg ii adsorption included hg adsorption on manganese surface hg mn surface hg adsorption on copper surface hg cu surface and finally a mixed structure showing hg adsorption on both manganese and copper surfaces hg mn cu mixed because this was study focused on hg ii sorption in aqueous media hence all the molecular structures were surrounded by water molecules while optimization calculations previous studies suggested that stable hydration structure or coordination number of hg ii ions in aqueous media is 6 fig 6 d 42 similarly molecular models after hg sorption were drawn and optimized mn atom 5 mn5 and cu atom 14 cu14 were chosen as sorption sites for hg interaction on mn cu bimetallic surface fig 7 a and b however adsorptions on individual and combined surfaces was also computed fig 7 c molecular structures after adsorption included hg adsorption on mn bimetallic surface hg mn surface cu bimetallic surface hg cu bimetallic surface and mixed structure showing both mn and cu bimetallic surface hg mn cu mixed as shown fig 7 3 11 optimized physical parameters spin of molecular structure represents the angular moment of all electrons present in molecule molecular spins are doublet singlet or triplate doublet spin shows the presence of electrons with half 1 2 spin whereas singlet spin state refers presence of paired electrons with no spin in this work the optimized structures of mn crystal and cu crystal showed doublet spin states only while singlet spin state was computed in all the other optimized structures table 2 total energy te measures entire energy owned by molecular geometry te of optimized structures varies dramatically table 2 highest value of te was observed for mn crystal 120 6 ev and lowest for hg octa 15 0 ev the te values for structures that indicate hg sorption on mn cu surface were lowest 6 276079 ev for hg cu surface and highest 25 57981 ev for hg mn cu mixed root mean square rms gradient is physical parameter that tells about the average root mean square motion velocity of all atoms in a molecular geometry it has strong correlation with energy of a molecule due to this correlation with energy values the rms gradient values for optimized structures followed same trend of variations as that of te values with highest values for mn crystal 0 43612678 a u and lowest for hg octa 0 00060788 a u 3 12 mulliken charge density q to investigate the bonding mechanism mulliken charge density q of optimized molecular models were computed mulliken charge density population provides mean partial charge density distribution in a molecule that can be calculated through computational chemistry methods 33 so higher the mulliken charge desnity q higher would be chances of bond formation q values calculated for molecular structures are shown in table 2 all the optimized structures possessed 0 001 negligible q values while the q value for octahedral mercury hg octa is highest that is 0 689 this high value of q for hg octa may be responsible for electrostatic attractions between for hg towards metallic surfaces of mn and cu 3 13 adsorption energy and bond lengths adsorption energy also called binding energy was computed for molecular structures after sorption of hg ii on mn cu bimetallic surface adsorption energy is applied to check the binding of hg ii on mn cu surface and stability finally obtained structures this was measured using formula 6 e adsorption e total adsorbent adsorbate e adsorbent e adsorbate in above formula e total represents the total energy of entire final structure obtained after sorption e adsorbent and e adsorbate are calculated optimized energies of mn or cu surface and hg octa molecules respectively highest negative values of adsorption energy suggest lower energy and greater stability of molecular geometries 43 consequently the highest negative value observed for hg mn surface structure was 112 48 ev while lowest negative value for hg cu surface was 13 5987 ev the hg mn cu mixed structure presented adsorption energy values of 37 12 it can be concluded from binding energy results that sorption of hg was most favorable on mn surface with more stable and lowest energy value model than both hg mn cu mixed and hg cu surface models this argument can be justified from previous studies in which higher negative values were measured for mn doped fe3o4 surface than fe3o4 surface alone 33 and supported that mn is favorable surface for hg adsorption the least favorable sorption was on cu surface due to least stable model bond length bl imposes significant effects on adsorption process stronger bonds possess smaller bond lengths than weaker bonds bl of optimized structures showing hg interactions with mn cu and mixed structures were included in table 2 it can be seen through table that bond formed between hg mn surface is strongest because it has lowest bond length 1 643 å from all other structures the bl in hg mn cu mixed structure was calculated as average bond lengths of hg mn and hg cu no any significance difference was observed between bond lengths of hg cu surface 2 650 å and hg mn cu mixed structure 2 781 å that leads to conclusion that there are almost equal chances of hg adsorption in both structures as hg interaction with mn5 and cu14 atoms on surfaces the effects of its interaction on surrounding nearby atoms was also evaluated mn5 is surrounded by mn 4 6 2 and 8 on other hand cu14 is surrounded by cu 11 17 13 and 15 atoms the change in bl values surrounding cu14 atoms were all negative table 2 which suggested increase in bond distance after hg adsorption hence more unstable geometry whereas change in bl distance values for mn5 surrounded atoms measured were almost positive except mn5 mn2 atoms that is 0 0300 å that means mn5 mn2 bond became weaker after hg interaction while other 3 bonds became stronger indicated more stability in hg mn bonding after adsorption 3 14 interference effect of major ions on hg ii sorption to investigate interference effect of major cations and anions present in real water on hg ii sorption each cation and anion was studied cations included na 1 k 1 ca 2 and mg 2 whereas anions included cl 1 so4 2 co3 2 and hco3 1 hg ii solution 10 mg l was added with 100 mg l of each ion separately and studied for batch experiments no any significant decrease in removal efficiency of mn cu nps was measured by cations and anions during interference study the maximum removal efficiency computed for cations was 91 with 4 reduction while for anions maximum efficiency observed was 92 5 1 98 rsd with 2 5 reduction in removal efficiency fig 7 3 15 real water sample results the tds and ph measured for real water sample was 680 mg l and 7 5 respectively the hg content in real drinking water sample was measured below detection limit detection limit 4 μg l the sample was then spiked with 10 mg l of hg the removal efficiency measured in spiked real water sample was 89 0 95 rsd with 6 reduction fig 7 from synthetic hg water this decrease was because of presence of cation anions and other interfering species fig 8 3 16 comparative study comparative study with reported work was presented in table 3 the work was compared in terms of maximum adsorption capacity q max isotherms computational models and adsorption binding energy it was noted that this work indicated much better results than already reported work 4 conclusion it can be concluded that novel mn cu bimetallic nano particles were successfully prepared characterized for afm eds xrd dls and zeta potential and then applied for efficient sorption of hg ii ions from drinking water mn cu bimetallic nps were successfully prepared by using chemical reduction method afm images well separated morphology and mean grain size of 450 50 nm of particles while dls and zeta potential results revealed that nanoparticles possessed average particles size of 110 nm and 18 1 mv respectively it was fond that langmuir adsorption isotherm was favorable with max adsorption capacity q max of 400 mg g good hg ii removal efficiency 89 was computed for real drinking water sample spiked with hg ii semi empirical computational model with pm6 level was successfully implemented to optimize molecular structures before and after hg adsorption computational models suggested that hg ii interacted stronger with mn atoms than cu hence the sorption was more favorable on mn surface than cu 5 declaration of

13731,this study used a sequencing batch reactor to investigate the nitrogen removal performance of marine anammox bacteria mab from nitrogen rich saline wastewater with addition of a transition element vanadium v v the findings showed that the performance of nitrogen removal by mab was enhanced by dosing proper amount of v v i e 0 25 20 mg l but the effectiveness deteriorated at higher doses 20 mg l vanadium v level at 1 mg l was found to be an optimal dose for complete removal of ammonia nh4 n within only 160 min substrate conversion rates were improved and stayed at high for longer periods with lower vanadium doses 0 25 10 mg l which indicates that the mab mediated anammox reaction rate was accelerated by adding v v moreover v v was more preferential than partial nitrite no2 to be used as the electron acceptor by mab thus the new marine anammox process is termed as vammox kinetic analysis using remodified logistic model modified boltzman and gompertz models on the nitrogen removal processes in typical operational conditions with v v addition revealed that none of the three models was appropriate at higher v v doses 20 mg l nevertheless the remodified logistic model was most suitable at lower v v doses 20 mg l keywords marine anammox bacteria nitrogen rich saline wastewater vanadium performance enhancement kinetics 1 introduction although six genera of anammox bacteria have been reported only one genus candidatus scalindua spp is classified as marine anammox bacteria mab 1 the diversity of mab communities was relatively low however it was ubiquitously discovered in the marine environments worldwide 2 and they are primarily responsible for significant loss of fixed nitrogen from the ocean environment 1 compared with freshwater derived anammox bacteria fab the physiological and ecological traits of mab have been little investigated 3 4 wastewaters from many industries e g sea food processing leather industry textiles and other chemical synthesis industry are rich in ammonium and salts 5 6 the saline wastewater can exert high osmotic pressure which would lead to cell plasmolysis or death 7 and further affect biochemical properties of activated sludge 8 thus treatment of saline wastewater with conventional biological methods is challenging exploiting anammox bacteria to treat saline wastewater has been investigated by many studies 5 9 nevertheless fab activity was strongly suppressed at low salinity and it took longer time 153 d to gradually adapt to changes in salinity level from 0 to 3 g l nacl 5 in contrast researchers have shown that nitrogen removal through mab was stable under broad range of salinity 0 50 g l nacl 10 therefore mab has a unique advantage for the treatment of saline wastewater vanadium v is the most abundant transition metal found in various water environments and it is widespread in the earth s crust with concentration up to 0 2 mg l 11 among the various forms of vanadium v v is highly toxic and mobile 12 v v in cells can accelerate the microbial growth by promoting transportation and oxidation of glucose 13 moreover gene expression cellular differentiation and the ability of some metabolic and biochemical would be affected by v v 14 to our knowledge the impact of v v on mab based nitrogen removal from saline wastewater has not been studied the principal aim of this work was to investigate the effect of v v addition on mab performance on nitrogen removal from nitrogen rich saline wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor sbr furthermore the changes of mab based nitrogen removal rate at different v v doses were analyzed moreover the changes of kinetic characteristics of mab with v v addition were assessed using three types of mathematical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the detailed information about the reactor setup and operation was given elsewhere 15 in brief a 7 0 l lab scale sbr with a biomass carrier a non woven fabric cylinder was used in this work fig s1 the anoxic stirring was kept at 4 h 2 2 sludge inoculum and synthetic wastewater inoculated anammox sludge candidatus scalindua spp mab as the dominant bacterial species was taken from a lab scale bioreactor with nitrogen loading rate of 0 56 kg m3 d 15 synthetic saline wastewater salinity 35 g l and composition of mineral medium and trace element solutions were similar to a previous study 15 v v was supplied using sodium metavanadate navo3 solution and its concentration in the reactor varied between 0 25 30 mg l 2 3 analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected from the sbr routinely for various chemical analysis the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were analyzed using the standard methods 16 ph was monitored with the ph probe mettler toledo 2 4 kinetic analysis three different models namely remodified logistic model eq 1 modified boltzmann model eq 2 and modified gompertz model eq 3 were employed to analyze effect of diverse v v concentrations on both the mab activity and nitrogen removal previous reports have suggested that these three models could well simulate the nitrogen removal in anammox process 17 19 the remodified logistic model 1 t n r e t n r e m a x 1 exp 4 r m a x λ t t n r e m a x 2 the modified boltzmann model 2 t n r e t n r e m a x t n r e m i n t n r e m a x 1 exp t t c t d

tnre respectively rmax denotes the maximum growth efficiency h λ and t represent the lag time and reaction time respectively h tc is the time of half tnremax h td is a time dependent constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance under the stress of different v v doses at 0 25 20 mg l v v dose ammonium removal efficiency are slightly decreased in first 3 cycles and then recovered to 100 fig 1 indicating that mab could quickly adapt to the environment and restore anammox activity under low concentration of v v meanwhile nitrite removal efficiency nre was 86 3 higher than that without v v 79 which was consistent with previous report that some metals such as mn ⅱ and ni ⅱ could enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of mab at low concentration 20 mab was tolerant to v v with a wide range i e 0 20 mg l and its nitrogen removal performance was improved with v v addition the results obtained in this work provided a new view on the expansion of mab application for nitrogen removal from vanadium containing industrial wastewater such as vanadium production industrial wastewater when v v was further increased mab nitrogen removal was sharply deteriorated possibly because of blockage of microbial cell divisions at higher vanadium concentration 13 therefore v v level should be below 20 mg l to keep a high mab bioactivity and achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency stoichiometric ratio was an indicator revealing activity and evolution of the anammox bacteria 20 according to fig 1d stoichiometric ratios in this work were lower than the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 which possibly was resulted from the configuration of reactor and potential electron acceptor in the reactor δno3 n δnh4 n was stable during 12 77 cycles while δno2 n δnh4 n increased in 12 40 cycles and then decreased implying the change of anammox process in addition both δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n dropped after v v concentration reached 25 mg l which may be because of other potential electron acceptor e g v v involved in anammox reaction in anammox system nh4 could be oxidized to no2 or no3 coupled with mn ⅳ and fe ⅲ reduction to mn ⅱ and fe ⅱ known as mnammox and feammox respectively 21 22 similarly vanadium one of first transition metal series elements with multiple valences can be possibly use as an electron acceptor a process refereed as vammox 3 2 nitrogen removal in a typical operating cycle nitrogen removal was studied in the last cycle under each v v level as shown in fig 2 a and c nh4 n was completely removed within a short time under 0 25 20 mg l v v while no2 n removal was less affected among the various doses tested 1 mg l v v was found to be an optimal dose for better mab performance acceleration of nh4 n removal was possibly due to the synergistic reaction between vammox and anammox however under 25 30 mg l v v stress both nh4 n and no2 n removal was inhibited the ratios of δno2 n δnh4 n at 25 30 mg l v v were significantly lower than that with no v v addition fig 2d which is possibly due to the competition between v v and no2 n in the reaction medium moreover nitrate production and the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n decreased when v v concentration increased from 20 to 30 mg l this phenomenon also provided evidence for existence of vanadium driven anammox vammox in the bioreactor the rate of anammox reaction which is represented by the substrate conversion rate scr was also enhanced by v v addition fig 2f with substrate consumption the scr decreased gradually and eventually stopped 23 when v v concentration increased to 20 mg l scr decreased slightly within first 40 min and then the pattern of rate change exhibited as m shaped this implied that anammox proceeding was delayed due to the inhibition of mab activity but it could be restored after adaptation period when v v level was further augmented inhibition resulting from v v on mab performance was more serious 3 3 kinetic analysis high r2 indicated that anammox process was fitted well by these three models fig 3 when v v concentration was no more than 20 mg l discrepancies between predicted tnremax of three models and experimental values were much lower than that at 25 and 30 mg l v v table s1 thus three models were suitable to describe the nitrogen removal at lower v v concentrations 20 mg l but not at elevated v v doses 25 mg l in addition tnremax predicted by the remodified logistic model with standard error of 0 0222 was more accurate than that achieved by the other two models i e modified boltzman and gompertz models with standard error of 0 0435 and 0 0513 hence the remodified logistic model was more appropriate to simulate nitrogen removal at lower v v concentrations than the other two there was a lag phase λ in saline wastewater treatment by mab 20 24 when v v level in the reactor was 0 25 20 mg l λ value considerably increased up to double i e 0 47 0 73 h meanwhile rmax achieved by the remodified logistic model increased after 0 25 mg l v v and then decreased with growing v v which is consistent with the experimental results table s1 therefore under lower v v doses 0 25 20 mg l the remodified logistic model not only predicted the tnremax accurately but also simulated other kinetic parameters accurately 4 conclusions under various v v concentrations nitrogen removal efficacy of mab was investigated in nitrogen rich saline wastewater nitrogen removal of mab was enhanced under 0 25 20 mg l v v and 1 mg l v v was the optimal concentration the anammox reaction rate was accelerated and maintained at higher level for longer period at 0 25 10 mg l v v nevertheless the higher v v concentration 20 mg l adversely impacts the mab activity this study suggested v v can be used as the electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 n by mab termed as marine vammox process the remodified logistic model was the most suitable to describe tnre at lower v v concentrations 20 mg l declaration of competing interest the

removal processes in typical operational conditions with v v addition revealed that none of the three models was appropriate at higher v v doses 20 mg l nevertheless the remodified logistic model was most suitable at lower v v doses 20 mg l keywords marine anammox bacteria nitrogen rich saline wastewater vanadium performance enhancement kinetics 1 introduction although six genera of anammox bacteria have been reported only one genus candidatus scalindua spp is classified as marine anammox bacteria mab 1 the diversity of mab communities was relatively low however it was ubiquitously discovered in the marine environments worldwide 2 and they are primarily responsible for significant loss of fixed nitrogen from the ocean environment 1 compared with freshwater derived anammox bacteria fab the physiological and ecological traits of mab have been little investigated 3 4 wastewaters from many industries e g sea food processing leather industry textiles and other chemical synthesis industry are rich in ammonium and salts 5 6 the saline wastewater can exert high osmotic pressure which would lead to cell plasmolysis or death 7 and further affect biochemical properties of activated sludge 8 thus treatment of saline wastewater with conventional biological methods is challenging exploiting anammox bacteria to treat saline wastewater has been investigated by many studies 5 9 nevertheless fab activity was strongly suppressed at low salinity and it took longer time 153 d to gradually adapt to changes in salinity level from 0 to 3 g l nacl 5 in contrast researchers have shown that nitrogen removal through mab was stable under broad range of salinity 0 50 g l nacl 10 therefore mab has a unique advantage for the treatment of saline wastewater vanadium v is the most abundant transition metal found in various water environments and it is widespread in the earth s crust with concentration up to 0 2 mg l 11 among the various forms of vanadium v v is highly toxic and mobile 12 v v in cells can accelerate the microbial growth by promoting transportation and oxidation of glucose 13 moreover gene expression cellular differentiation and the ability of some metabolic and biochemical would be affected by v v 14 to our knowledge the impact of v v on mab based nitrogen removal from saline wastewater has not been studied the principal aim of this work was to investigate the effect of v v addition on mab performance on nitrogen removal from nitrogen rich saline wastewater in a sequencing batch reactor sbr furthermore the changes of mab based nitrogen removal rate at different v v doses were analyzed moreover the changes of kinetic characteristics of mab with v v addition were assessed using three types of mathematical models 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and operation the detailed information about the reactor setup and operation was given elsewhere 15 in brief a 7 0 l lab scale sbr with a biomass carrier a non woven fabric cylinder was used in this work fig s1 the anoxic stirring was kept at 4 h 2 2 sludge inoculum and synthetic wastewater inoculated anammox sludge candidatus scalindua spp mab as the dominant bacterial species was taken from a lab scale bioreactor with nitrogen loading rate of 0 56 kg m3 d 15 synthetic saline wastewater salinity 35 g l and composition of mineral medium and trace element solutions were similar to a previous study 15 v v was supplied using sodium metavanadate navo3 solution and its concentration in the reactor varied between 0 25 30 mg l 2 3 analytical methods influent and effluent samples were collected from the sbr routinely for various chemical analysis the concentrations of ammonium nitrite and nitrate were analyzed using the standard methods 16 ph was monitored with the ph probe mettler toledo 2 4 kinetic analysis three different models namely remodified logistic model eq 1 modified boltzmann model eq 2 and modified gompertz model eq 3 were employed to analyze effect of diverse v v concentrations on both the mab activity and nitrogen removal previous reports have suggested that these three models could well simulate the nitrogen removal in anammox process 17 19 the remodified logistic model 1 t n r e t n r e m a x 1 exp 4 r m a x λ t t n r e m a x 2 the modified boltzmann model 2 t n r e t n r e m a x t n r e m i n t n r e m a x 1 exp t t c t d

tnre respectively rmax denotes the maximum growth efficiency h λ and t represent the lag time and reaction time respectively h tc is the time of half tnremax h td is a time dependent constant 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance under the stress of different v v doses at 0 25 20 mg l v v dose ammonium removal efficiency are slightly decreased in first 3 cycles and then recovered to 100 fig 1 indicating that mab could quickly adapt to the environment and restore anammox activity under low concentration of v v meanwhile nitrite removal efficiency nre was 86 3 higher than that without v v 79 which was consistent with previous report that some metals such as mn ⅱ and ni ⅱ could enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of mab at low concentration 20 mab was tolerant to v v with a wide range i e 0 20 mg l and its nitrogen removal performance was improved with v v addition the results obtained in this work provided a new view on the expansion of mab application for nitrogen removal from vanadium containing industrial wastewater such as vanadium production industrial wastewater when v v was further increased mab nitrogen removal was sharply deteriorated possibly because of blockage of microbial cell divisions at higher vanadium concentration 13 therefore v v level should be below 20 mg l to keep a high mab bioactivity and achieve high nitrogen removal efficiency stoichiometric ratio was an indicator revealing activity and evolution of the anammox bacteria 20 according to fig 1d stoichiometric ratios in this work were lower than the theoretical values 1 32 and 0 26 which possibly was resulted from the configuration of reactor and potential electron acceptor in the reactor δno3 n δnh4 n was stable during 12 77 cycles while δno2 n δnh4 n increased in 12 40 cycles and then decreased implying the change of anammox process in addition both δno2 n δnh4 n and δno3 n δnh4 n dropped after v v concentration reached 25 mg l which may be because of other potential electron acceptor e g v v involved in anammox reaction in anammox system nh4 could be oxidized to no2 or no3 coupled with mn ⅳ and fe ⅲ reduction to mn ⅱ and fe ⅱ known as mnammox and feammox respectively 21 22 similarly vanadium one of first transition metal series elements with multiple valences can be possibly use as an electron acceptor a process refereed as vammox 3 2 nitrogen removal in a typical operating cycle nitrogen removal was studied in the last cycle under each v v level as shown in fig 2 a and c nh4 n was completely removed within a short time under 0 25 20 mg l v v while no2 n removal was less affected among the various doses tested 1 mg l v v was found to be an optimal dose for better mab performance acceleration of nh4 n removal was possibly due to the synergistic reaction between vammox and anammox however under 25 30 mg l v v stress both nh4 n and no2 n removal was inhibited the ratios of δno2 n δnh4 n at 25 30 mg l v v were significantly lower than that with no v v addition fig 2d which is possibly due to the competition between v v and no2 n in the reaction medium moreover nitrate production and the ratio of δno3 n δnh4 n decreased when v v concentration increased from 20 to 30 mg l this phenomenon also provided evidence for existence of vanadium driven anammox vammox in the bioreactor the rate of anammox reaction which is represented by the substrate conversion rate scr was also enhanced by v v addition fig 2f with substrate consumption the scr decreased gradually and eventually stopped 23 when v v concentration increased to 20 mg l scr decreased slightly within first 40 min and then the pattern of rate change exhibited as m shaped this implied that anammox proceeding was delayed due to the inhibition of mab activity but it could be restored after adaptation period when v v level was further augmented inhibition resulting from v v on mab performance was more serious 3 3 kinetic analysis high r2 indicated that anammox process was fitted well by these three models fig 3 when v v concentration was no more than 20 mg l discrepancies between predicted tnremax of three models and experimental values were much lower than that at 25 and 30 mg l v v table s1 thus three models were suitable to describe the nitrogen removal at lower v v concentrations 20 mg l but not at elevated v v doses 25 mg l in addition tnremax predicted by the remodified logistic model with standard error of 0 0222 was more accurate than that achieved by the other two models i e modified boltzman and gompertz models with standard error of 0 0435 and 0 0513 hence the remodified logistic model was more appropriate to simulate nitrogen removal at lower v v concentrations than the other two there was a lag phase λ in saline wastewater treatment by mab 20 24 when v v level in the reactor was 0 25 20 mg l λ value considerably increased up to double i e 0 47 0 73 h meanwhile rmax achieved by the remodified logistic model increased after 0 25 mg l v v and then decreased with growing v v which is consistent with the experimental results table s1 therefore under lower v v doses 0 25 20 mg l the remodified logistic model not only predicted the tnremax accurately but also simulated other kinetic parameters accurately 4 conclusions under various v v concentrations nitrogen removal efficacy of mab was investigated in nitrogen rich saline wastewater nitrogen removal of mab was enhanced under 0 25 20 mg l v v and 1 mg l v v was the optimal concentration the anammox reaction rate was accelerated and maintained at higher level for longer period at 0 25 10 mg l v v nevertheless the higher v v concentration 20 mg l adversely impacts the mab activity this study suggested v v can be used as the electron acceptor to oxidize nh4 n by mab termed as marine vammox process the remodified logistic model was the most suitable to describe tnre at lower v v concentrations 20 mg l declaration of competing interest the

technology rolla mo usa emulsion liquid membrane elm is an emerging technology to remove the hydrocarbons from industrial wastewater and water for the first time the effects of the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and ionic liquid in elm water organic water on the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol as an example of hydrocarbons from synthetic wastewater was investigated the 4 nitrophenol removal efficiency of 99 in 1 min was achieved and the emulsion stability was improved significantly to 81 for 6 hours with the use of combination of surface modified 0 05 w w magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and 0 05 v v ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in elm demulsifying emulsifier particles from the interfaces of the droplets can be enhanced by using a magnetic force without causing a change in the oil phase chemistry the outcomes of this study can be extended to the removal of other hydrocarbons and polar pollutants from industrial wastewater and water keywords emulsion liquid membrane 4 nitrophenol elm stability magnetic fe2o3nanoparticles ionic liquid 1 introduction various industrial and manufacturing processes produce multiple types of wastewater that introduce toxic contaminants into water and groundwater most of these contaminants are sources of pollution to the environment this causes serious environmental concern primarily because these industrial waste contaminants are known to be hazardous hydrocarbons such as phenolic compounds of 4 nitrophenol and other derivatives are often found in wastewater of many industrial processes such as dyes pesticides petroleum refinery and petrochemical pharmaceuticals and mineral and mining processes 1 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has labeled the 4 nitrophenol among others as toxic aqueous chemicals due to their ability to extinguish the important issues such as kidneys central nervous system liver and blood cells in the human and animal body 2 therefore the wastewater generated from these industries needs efficient treatment before it is discharged to the environment many studies and technologies have been reported in the literature for hydrocarbons removal from water and industrial wastewater 1 and 3 among these treatment methods are coagulation flocculation chemical precipitation ion exchange electro oxidation flotation adsorption and advanced oxidation kurniwan et al 2006 and 4 membrane method has also been introduced to treat the wastewater which exploits either porous or nonporous polymeric and ceramic membranes to provide a selective barrier between the wastewater and the internal receiving phase 5 instead of using a solid barrier as the membrane material liquid also has been used as a membrane barrier between phases 6 this liquid membrane method has been further advanced to introduce a new technology of emulsion liquid membrane elm to further enhance the removal of the pollutants from the wastewater or waste organic phases li n 1968 which is the focus of this work the emulsion liquid membrane elm consists of either water oil emulsion mixed w1 o in the treated aqueous water w2 phase w1 o w2 or oil water emulsion mixed o1 w in the treated organic oil o phase o1 w o2 7 elm started when li n 1968 proposed a single process of extraction or stripping known as a liquid surfactant or emulsion liquid membrane elm of w1 o w2 featured with high removal rate high selectivity at a low cost and the removal is enhanced by a reaction to form precipitate 8 9 10 an emulsion liquid membrane elm for the w1 o w2 system is first formed by mixing two immiscible phases and dispersing the resulting emulsion w1 o in another batch reactor containing aqueous feed wastewater phase w2 the emulsion consists of tiny aqueous droplets w1 distributed in the organic membrane phase o forming globules of w1 o when it is mixed with the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 containing hydrocarbons of 4 nitrophenol the 4 nitrophenol that is in the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 soluble in the oil membrane phase o it can diffuse through the membrane phase of the globules and reacts with a stripping agent reactant naoh in the internal receiving phase w1 the 4 nitrophenol transported is converted into solid precipitate which is not soluble in the membrane phase consequently it was trapped in the stripping agent reactant in internal receiving phase w1 and be removed easily through filtration or sedimentation this means that the driving force of the concentration gradient of the pollutants transport from w2 phase to w1 phase through o membrane phase remains at its maximum and hence the transport of the pollutants continue until about the completion of the removal 11 during a particular duration of time fig 1 shows the schematic of the transport in elm despite the promising results of elm as reported in the literature it has not been advanced toward industrial applications because elm is still suffering from critical technical issues that are related to 1 swelling and breakage that decrease the emulsion stability which affects negatively the removal efficiency 2 not a high percentage of removal in a longer duration of time and 3 inefficient way of demulsification to separate the solids waste and to recycle the organic phase 12 13 hence emulsion stability extraction efficiency and duration of elm have been studied to understand the relationship between the properties of the emulsion membrane and the operating factors h weingrtner 14 in the literature the surfactant has been used in the organic phase to improve emulsion stability recently to further improve on stabilization of elm ionic liquid as a stabilizer has been demonstrated goyal et al 15 showed that the stability of w1 o emulsion was improved by incorporating an ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide bmim ntf2 in the organic phase o as a stabilizer sawsan et al 2016 studied the elm method with ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in combination with the surfactant of span 80 to remove benzoic acid from wastewater the results indicated that the increase in the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 2 v v in the organic phase o yields an improvement in stability which also leads to enhanced removal efficiency of benzoic acid of 99 7 after 5 min in a batch operation sawsan et al 16 also studied the removal of phenol compounds phenol 2 chlorophenol and 4 nitrophenol from wastewater the results indicated that the increase in the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 3 v v in the organic phase o yields an improvement in stability which also leads to enhanced removal efficiency of phenol of 78 after 30 min and 2 chlorophenol and 4 nitrophenol of 95 and 98 5 respectively after 30 min in a batch operation in a different approach the addition of nanoparticles in the organic phase o rather than ionic liquid was also found to enhance the stabilization of the elm 17 and 18 the effects of the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles in the organic phase o on the emulsion stability were studied by lin et al 19 for the removal of the 4 methoxyphenol from wastewater the results showed that the 0 5 wt fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles have a strong effect on the percentage reduction of the emulsion leakage emulsion stability giving 86 removal for 4 methoxyphenol in 2 min in a batch operation the effects of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles in the organic phase o on the emulsion stability were also studied by al obaidi and al dahhan 20 for the removal of the 4 nirtophenol from synthetic wastewater the results also showed that the 0 1 w w of magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles have a strong effect on the percentage reduction of the emulsion leakage emulsion stability giving 93 4 removal for the 4 nirtophenol after 15 min in a batch operation currently no studies have been reported in the literature about the effects of the combination of ionic liquid and nanoparticles in the organic phase o for the emulsion stabilization removal efficiency and the time duration for the removal of pollutants using elm therefore the present study focuses on investigating the emulsion stability the enhancement removal and the duration of the batch operation of the removal of 4 nitrophenol from the synthesis wastewater using combined magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and bmim ntf2 ionic liquid in the organic phase o in the emulsion liquid membrane elm 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the materials that are used in this study were kerosene boiling point 175 325 c as the organic phase o span 80 sorbitan monooleate as the surfactant sodium hydroxide naoh as the stripping agent to react with the hydrocarbon pollutants to form a solid precipitate hydrochloric acid hcl to adjust for the ph of w2 4 nitrophenol and ionic liquid of 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bis triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl imide bmim ntf2 which obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo 63103 usa the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles with a size range of 30 60 nm were acquired from alfa aesar ward hill ma 01835 usa this size of nanoparticles has a noticeable lower cost than the smaller size where the cost is an important factor for large scale applications the magnetic characteristic of the nanoparticles has been selected to be easily removed and recycled by a magnetic field in addition this will facilitate the step of the demulsification and separation of the formed solids and aqueous and organic phases where the organic phase can be recycled 2 2 experimental work in this work the elm of w1 o w2 phases has been implemented since the pollutants 300 ppm of 4 nitrophenol are in the aqueous feed phase w2 the organic phase o represents the membrane that is part of the emulsion formed by mixing the organic phase o with the aqueous phase w1 internal phase that contains the stripping agent as the reactant of 0 5 n naoh solution at a high agitation speed of rotation per minutes rpm of the mixer to form an emulsion of small aqueous droplets in the organic phase the organic phase o consists of surfactant span 80 and kerosene the emulsion w1 o is then dispersed in the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 the 4 nitrophenol transfers from w2 phase through o phase to w1 phase where it reacts with the stripping agent naoh to form a solute precipitate which makes a reaction product incapable of diffusing back through the membrane phase where presence in fig 1 consequently the 4 nitrophenol concentration in the internal stripping phase is also maintained at zero by the reaction the equations exhibiting removal and stripping agent process of 4 nirophenol occurring in liquid emulsion membrane technology was given below 1 c6 h4no2oh naoh c6 h4no2o na h2o 1 seseveral factors affect the removal of the pollutant using elm such as the volume ratio of aqueous phase w1 to organic phase o w1 o ratio v v a surfactant concentration of w v agitation intensity to form an emulsion rpm emulsion agitation volume treatment ratio of w1 o to the aqueous feed phase w2 elm w2 ratio v v agitation intensity of the treatment and globules formation rpm treatment agitation concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles and ionic liquid and ph of the aqueous feed phase w2 for each range of a variable studied the other variables were fixed as based on the best value of that variable for the removal of a hydrocarbon reported in litterers 10 fig 2 illustrates the steps of the experimental work of the elm employed in this work therefore the first step is to identity the best combination values of these variables to remove 4 nitrophenol before study the effects of nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the elm stability removal efficiency and duration of the removal if needed the following evaluation of the variation of the values has been performed as the table 1 below samples from the agitated solution were taken at different time periods using a micropipette and then separated from the emulsion phase using a nylon syringe filter of 0 2 μm simsii inc usa the 4 nitrophenol was analyzed using a 96 well uv microplate at a wavelength band of 400 nm the second step of experimental work the effects addition of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticle alone in the organic phase o of 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 w w and the separately of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 alone in the organic phase o of 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 v v will be investigated on the stability of the elm percentage removal of the 4 nitrophenol and the time duration of the batch removal then the identified best values of nanoparticles and ionic liquid will be used when both are combined to examine the effect of such combination on the mentioned parameters of the elm performance as the table 2 below since the key goal is to identify the lowest possible amount of nanoparticles and ionic liquid with the best performance of the elm as illustrated in table 1 for all the conditions studied each experiment was repeated three times where the error bars were estimated at the end of the removal of 4 nitrophenol the mixture is placed in a funnel to separate the upper emulsion phase w1 o and the lower aqueous feed phase w2 then a magnetic field 1 t magnet is applied on the upper phase which pulled the nanoparticles from the emulsion phase w1 o by the magnetic field and with this demulsification occurs where both nanoparticles and organic phase will be reuse after the solid precipitate is filtered and separated the accumulated fe2o3 was washed with acetone and distilled water then dried under a vacuum at 50 c for 10 hours to be reused again the recycled nanoparticles and organic phase will be used for preparing a new experiment of elm as shown in fig 3 2 3 calculation of the elm stability to measure the elm stability volume ratio 0 5 1 v v of red dye to the internal phase w1 as a leakage indicator which has no interaction with both organic and aqueous molecules 21 the percentage of leakage is determined using the following equation 2 l e a k a g e d y e c o n c e n t r a t i o n w 2 d y e c o n c e n t r a t i o n w i t h m a x t i m e w 2 x 100 where the red dye concentration in w2 is the concentration of the dye in the external phase w2 received from w1 and the concentration with maximum time in w2 is the maximum concentration of the dye that is reached in the external aqueous phase w2 when all the red dye leaked from the internal aqueous phase w1 to the external aqueous phase w2 the percentage of the pollutant remaining in w2 phase is defined by the following equation 3 e x t r a c t i o n e i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n f i n a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n x 100 percentage extraction remaining 100 e 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 defining the best values of the variables for 4 nitrophenol removal using elm without nanoparticles and ionic liquid the following experiments have been performed to define the best values possible of the variables to be used to examine the effects of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol and its duration and the stability of the emulsion for all these experiments the emulsion stability was examined as outlined earlier using dye technique and the emulsion stability of 27 for 6 hours 1 the volume ratio of w1 o phase the w1 o volume ratio has a significant role in emulsion stability and the removal because of its usefulness in trapping the droplets of w1 in the organic phase o in reacting the 4 nitrophenol to the stripping agent naoh in w1 the increase in the volume ratio will lead to emulsion instability 22 w1 o volume ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 v v as proposed by ng et al 23 were used to assess its effects on emulsion stability and the removal of the 4 nitrophenol fig 4 a shows the results of the removal of 4 nitrophenol the volume ratio of 1 1 v v forms large emulsion globules with a thin thickness of organic phase o between w1 droplets of the globules which causes an increase in the leakage and lowers the removal efficiency 24 while the volume ratio of 1 3 v v forms tiny droplets with an increase in thickness organic membrane that causes a reduction in the leakage with high removal efficiency increasing the volume ratio to more than 1 3 v v leads to a reduction in the stability of the emulsion with poor removal efficiency because of the promotion of the resistance for diffusion through the membrane large thickness of organic between droplets hence the value of 1 3 v v volume ratio of w1 phase to o phase has been selected 25 2 the surfactant concentration of span 80 in the organic phase span 80 has been used as the surfactant added to the organic phase o surfactant has a significant effect on the emulsion stability and the reduction of the emulsion leakage because it works as a protective barrier between the external feed phase w2 and the stripping agent w1 26 as shown in fig 2 the surfactant concentrations span 80 of 2 w v 3 w v and 4 w v were used it was distinguished that a surfactant concentration of 2 w v caused the highest percentage removal of 4 nitrophenol and the lowest emulsion leakage as shown in fig 4 b increasing the concentration of span 80 can affect negatively the removal of pollutants due to lowering the surface tension of the emulsion causing the formation of a small globules containing small number of droplets of w1 in addition adding more of span 80 would lead to an increase in the leakage a reduction in the emulsion stability and a decrease in the removal efficiency due to the formation of small emulsion globules 25 3 the agitation intensity rpm to create emulsification emulsion agitation the agitation rpm to create proper emulsion is essential as the formation of designable emulsion that can increase the removal efficiency 23 and 27 the agitation of 5000 7000 and 8000 rpm were used to form the emulsion and to study the removal of the 4 nitrophenol emulsion stability increases by increasing the agitation the emulsion agitation of 8000 rpm was found suitable by forming a mayonnaise like emulsion due to the generation of more droplets increasing the droplet formation results in a highly viscous emulsion and droplets merge with each there due to rapid mixing emulsification agitation of 8000 rpm gives the better removal of the pollutants 28 as shown in fig 4 c 4 the volume ratio of w1 o globules to w2 phase elm w1 o globules to the w2 volume ratio plays a significant role in the performance of the elm the volume ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 v v were selected to examine the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol the volume ratio of 1 2 was found to be desirable as shown in fig 4 d this ratio provides an increase in the overall surface area for mass transfer and removal capacity the stability of emulsion increases by reducing the volume fraction of the internal phase as stated by m djenouhat et al 29 the other volume ratios decrease the removal efficiency which can be attributed to the increase in the membrane o thickness around the droplets in addition the mechanical resistance of the membrane increases at a higher organic fraction thus preventing coalescence of the dispersed droplets and maintaining the size of the droplets to be within the range of the size of the standard droplets of 0 1 2 mm in general larger droplet sizes increase the emulsion instability because the droplets easily coalesce ng et al 23 5 the agitation intensity rpm of the mixing of w1 o globules and w2 phase treatment agitation the effect of the agitation intensity rpm of 250 300 and 400 rpm was studied on the removal of the pollutants as shown in fig 4 e the 300 rpm was found to be the desire for increasing the emulsion stability as it displays the lowest amount of emulsion leakage producing a greater shear force on the droplets significantly reduces the emulsion globules size and increases the contact area for mass transfer 30 at a low mixing intensity the emulsion globules size increases which causes a decrease in the mass transfer rate of 4 nitrophenol increasing the agitation intensity of rpm can lead to reducing the emulsion stability because high intensity produces globules rupture causing leakage of the w1 into the w2 phases 22 31 6 the ph of the w2 phase the ph values used 1 5 6 5 and are presented in fig 4 f is observed that when the value of the ph of the external feed synthetic wastewater phase was 1 5 improved the removal efficiency and the emulsion stability 32 removal of the 4 nitrophenol from synthetic wastewater w2 precipitate in alkaline solutions zhaoyun 2016 the removal efficiency enhances at a lower ph due to an increase in the hydrogen ion h concentration of the external feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 which reacts with naoh w1 to form a precipitate of complex acid base the increase of the ph decreases the hydrogen ion h which reduces the removal efficiency 32 3 2 the effect of nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol the effects of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid in the organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol at the selected best values of the variable studied above have been investigated using the values of the w1 o volume ratio of 1 3 v v span 80 concentration of 2 w v emulsion agitation of 8000 rpm elm w1 o w2 volume ratio of w2 of 1 2 v v treatment agitation of w2 of 300 rpm and ph of 1 5 for all the experiments performed here the emulsion stability was examined as outlined earlier 3 2 1 the effect of the fe2o3 nanoparticles on the removal of 4 nitrophenol fig 5 shows the results of the removal of 4 nitrophenol using 0 05 w w 0 1 w w 0 15 w w of magnetic nanoparticles of fe2o3 in the o phase the results illustrate that the ratio of 0 1 w w of magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles alone in the o phase elevates the 4 nitrophenol removal to higher level of 93 4 during 15 min and 54 of the emulsion stability during 6 hours as compared to the ratios of 0 05 w w and 0 15 w w the presence of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles in the organic phase o enhances the stability of the elm and the mass transfer of 4 nitrophenol from w2 to w1 through the o phase 33 this improves the solute removal due to forming film of the particles at w1 o interface and increasing the binding sites on the surface of the solute 31 the findings are in agreement with the results obtained by sawsan et al 31 which indicate that the increase in magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 concentration beyond full coverage of the w1 droplets in o phase as extra magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles concentrations will be dispersed in the w2 phase and some of the magnetic nanoparticles might form aggregates on w1 o interface which affect the stability of the emulsion and slow the transfer process 34 hence the removal efficiency decreases qusay al obaidi muthanna al dahhan 2020 3 2 2 the effect of ionic liquid in the organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol regarding the use of ionic liquid in the organic phase o as another method to improve the stability of the elm the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 was chosen to be used in this study because it has been shown to be extracted and striped more efficiently as shown in a schematic fig 6 of the packed ionic liquid molecules between the span 80 molecules 35 the relation between the concentration 0 05 v v to 0 25 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 and emulsion stability time is shown in fig 7 increasing the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 2 v v of bmim ntf2 will increase the stability time hence at 0 2 v v ionic liquid concentration a removal of 83 9 of 15 min of 4 nitrophenol was achieved and 49 of emulsion stability during 6 h at a higher ionic liquid concentration the stability time decreased due to increased emulsion sedimentation by considering the high density of the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 the emulsion liquid membrane elm stability was increased due to the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 which could be caused by coulombic interactions of the charges on the naoh and ions of the ionic liquids bmim ntf2 this strong interaction enhances the emulsion stability by lowering the coalescence of the internal droplets 27 there is probability of hydrogen bonding between oh group of naoh and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 the hydrogen bonding may cause a strong protection surrounding the internal droplets to avoid coalescence the increase of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 can further reduce the interfacial tension also through adsorbing in the w1 o interface and thereby minimizing the repulsion of the hydrophilic head groups of the span 80 which contributes to a more efficient packing of the span 80 at the interface and reduces the droplet size of w1 35 3 2 3 the effect of combining nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol as per the previous results of 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 sections above the 0 1 w w of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 alone and 0 2 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 alone provide better removal of 4 nitrophenol here we combine both of these concentrations to examine the effects of the combination of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 added in organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol also to examine the effects of the variation of ionic liquid concentration 0 05 v v to 0 25 v v while maintaining the concentration of nanoparticles at 0 05 w w 0 1 w w and 0 15 w w have been investigated as per fig 8 and table 3 the results of the leakage test were used as indicator for assessing stability as shown in fig 9 the stability of the prepared elm was assessed before performing the 4 nitrophenol removal experiments the breakage of the emulsion globules when the elm is instable causes decreasing in the removal efficiency the elm stability highly affects the removal rate in the receiving phase w1 the stability of elm process was detected as indicated before via trace of the loaded dye in the receiving phase w1 in a period of the elm preparation and detected it in the external feed phase w2 36 the lowest leakage and higher stability time were obtained with the combination of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 after 1 hour which sustain during the experiments this confirms that the combination improves the stability of elm as compared with elm alone elm nanoparticles and elm ionic liquid hence the combination enhances the stability and forms droplets that are particularly stable in the emulsion removal time is considered as the target to determine the elm effectiveness which represents the period of time for the concentration of 4 nitrophenol to real close to zero the ratio of 0 05 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 and 0 05 w w of fe2o3 gives higher removal efficiency for the 4 nitrophenol 99 in 1 min and the emulsion stability was improved significantly to 81 for 6 h in addition it gives least amount of nanoparticles and ionic liquid to be used the results illustrate that the combination of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 increase the emulsion stability and the removal efficiency with less duration of time 4 conclusion the experimental results viewed that the best operational conditions achieving for 4 nitrophenol removal were concentration of surfactant 2 w v the volume ratio of internal phase to organic phase 1 3 v v agitation intensity 8000 rpm volume ratio elm w2 1 2 v v the agitation mixing speed 300 rpm and ph of the w2 was 1 5 at the best conditions the removal of 4 nitrophenol was achieved with an efficiency of 63 from aqueous solutions within 15 min the removal efficiency with the concentration of 0 1 w w magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles was 93 4 at 15 min while the removal efficiency with the concentration of 0 2 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 was 83 9 at 15 min the long term of emulsion stability was greatly improved by the combination of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in organic phase o by the formation of a three dimensional network among the droplets and particles that give the higher removal efficiency at a shorter time of 1 min with the lowest leakage and higher stability of the elm process time starting after 1 h and sustains during the experiments time the best combination in organic phase o was of 0 05 w w fe2o3 nanoparticle and 0 05 v v ionic liquid bmim ntf2 which gives higher removal efficiency for 4 nitrophenol of 99 for 1 min of batch separation and the emulsion stability of 81 for 6 hours this confirms the ability of such combination in increasing the emulsion stability and removal declaration of competing interest there is potential of using such technology for recycling water reuse water after treating industrial aqueous effluents and produce water waste water and other water resource all industrial sectors and wastewater and water resources and or treatment sectors we used nanoparticles alone to enhance separation also ionic liquid alone was used however no work has been published that use combine both nanoparticles and ionic liquid to enhance the removal and separation of hydrocarbons in shorter process time declaration

technology rolla mo usa emulsion liquid membrane elm is an emerging technology to remove the hydrocarbons from industrial wastewater and water for the first time the effects of the combination of magnetic nanoparticles and ionic liquid in elm water organic water on the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol as an example of hydrocarbons from synthetic wastewater was investigated the 4 nitrophenol removal efficiency of 99 in 1 min was achieved and the emulsion stability was improved significantly to 81 for 6 hours with the use of combination of surface modified 0 05 w w magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and 0 05 v v ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in elm demulsifying emulsifier particles from the interfaces of the droplets can be enhanced by using a magnetic force without causing a change in the oil phase chemistry the outcomes of this study can be extended to the removal of other hydrocarbons and polar pollutants from industrial wastewater and water keywords emulsion liquid membrane 4 nitrophenol elm stability magnetic fe2o3nanoparticles ionic liquid 1 introduction various industrial and manufacturing processes produce multiple types of wastewater that introduce toxic contaminants into water and groundwater most of these contaminants are sources of pollution to the environment this causes serious environmental concern primarily because these industrial waste contaminants are known to be hazardous hydrocarbons such as phenolic compounds of 4 nitrophenol and other derivatives are often found in wastewater of many industrial processes such as dyes pesticides petroleum refinery and petrochemical pharmaceuticals and mineral and mining processes 1 the united states environmental protection agency usepa has labeled the 4 nitrophenol among others as toxic aqueous chemicals due to their ability to extinguish the important issues such as kidneys central nervous system liver and blood cells in the human and animal body 2 therefore the wastewater generated from these industries needs efficient treatment before it is discharged to the environment many studies and technologies have been reported in the literature for hydrocarbons removal from water and industrial wastewater 1 and 3 among these treatment methods are coagulation flocculation chemical precipitation ion exchange electro oxidation flotation adsorption and advanced oxidation kurniwan et al 2006 and 4 membrane method has also been introduced to treat the wastewater which exploits either porous or nonporous polymeric and ceramic membranes to provide a selective barrier between the wastewater and the internal receiving phase 5 instead of using a solid barrier as the membrane material liquid also has been used as a membrane barrier between phases 6 this liquid membrane method has been further advanced to introduce a new technology of emulsion liquid membrane elm to further enhance the removal of the pollutants from the wastewater or waste organic phases li n 1968 which is the focus of this work the emulsion liquid membrane elm consists of either water oil emulsion mixed w1 o in the treated aqueous water w2 phase w1 o w2 or oil water emulsion mixed o1 w in the treated organic oil o phase o1 w o2 7 elm started when li n 1968 proposed a single process of extraction or stripping known as a liquid surfactant or emulsion liquid membrane elm of w1 o w2 featured with high removal rate high selectivity at a low cost and the removal is enhanced by a reaction to form precipitate 8 9 10 an emulsion liquid membrane elm for the w1 o w2 system is first formed by mixing two immiscible phases and dispersing the resulting emulsion w1 o in another batch reactor containing aqueous feed wastewater phase w2 the emulsion consists of tiny aqueous droplets w1 distributed in the organic membrane phase o forming globules of w1 o when it is mixed with the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 containing hydrocarbons of 4 nitrophenol the 4 nitrophenol that is in the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 soluble in the oil membrane phase o it can diffuse through the membrane phase of the globules and reacts with a stripping agent reactant naoh in the internal receiving phase w1 the 4 nitrophenol transported is converted into solid precipitate which is not soluble in the membrane phase consequently it was trapped in the stripping agent reactant in internal receiving phase w1 and be removed easily through filtration or sedimentation this means that the driving force of the concentration gradient of the pollutants transport from w2 phase to w1 phase through o membrane phase remains at its maximum and hence the transport of the pollutants continue until about the completion of the removal 11 during a particular duration of time fig 1 shows the schematic of the transport in elm despite the promising results of elm as reported in the literature it has not been advanced toward industrial applications because elm is still suffering from critical technical issues that are related to 1 swelling and breakage that decrease the emulsion stability which affects negatively the removal efficiency 2 not a high percentage of removal in a longer duration of time and 3 inefficient way of demulsification to separate the solids waste and to recycle the organic phase 12 13 hence emulsion stability extraction efficiency and duration of elm have been studied to understand the relationship between the properties of the emulsion membrane and the operating factors h weingrtner 14 in the literature the surfactant has been used in the organic phase to improve emulsion stability recently to further improve on stabilization of elm ionic liquid as a stabilizer has been demonstrated goyal et al 15 showed that the stability of w1 o emulsion was improved by incorporating an ionic liquid 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide bmim ntf2 in the organic phase o as a stabilizer sawsan et al 2016 studied the elm method with ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in combination with the surfactant of span 80 to remove benzoic acid from wastewater the results indicated that the increase in the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 2 v v in the organic phase o yields an improvement in stability which also leads to enhanced removal efficiency of benzoic acid of 99 7 after 5 min in a batch operation sawsan et al 16 also studied the removal of phenol compounds phenol 2 chlorophenol and 4 nitrophenol from wastewater the results indicated that the increase in the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 3 v v in the organic phase o yields an improvement in stability which also leads to enhanced removal efficiency of phenol of 78 after 30 min and 2 chlorophenol and 4 nitrophenol of 95 and 98 5 respectively after 30 min in a batch operation in a different approach the addition of nanoparticles in the organic phase o rather than ionic liquid was also found to enhance the stabilization of the elm 17 and 18 the effects of the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles in the organic phase o on the emulsion stability were studied by lin et al 19 for the removal of the 4 methoxyphenol from wastewater the results showed that the 0 5 wt fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles have a strong effect on the percentage reduction of the emulsion leakage emulsion stability giving 86 removal for 4 methoxyphenol in 2 min in a batch operation the effects of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles in the organic phase o on the emulsion stability were also studied by al obaidi and al dahhan 20 for the removal of the 4 nirtophenol from synthetic wastewater the results also showed that the 0 1 w w of magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles have a strong effect on the percentage reduction of the emulsion leakage emulsion stability giving 93 4 removal for the 4 nirtophenol after 15 min in a batch operation currently no studies have been reported in the literature about the effects of the combination of ionic liquid and nanoparticles in the organic phase o for the emulsion stabilization removal efficiency and the time duration for the removal of pollutants using elm therefore the present study focuses on investigating the emulsion stability the enhancement removal and the duration of the batch operation of the removal of 4 nitrophenol from the synthesis wastewater using combined magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and bmim ntf2 ionic liquid in the organic phase o in the emulsion liquid membrane elm 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the materials that are used in this study were kerosene boiling point 175 325 c as the organic phase o span 80 sorbitan monooleate as the surfactant sodium hydroxide naoh as the stripping agent to react with the hydrocarbon pollutants to form a solid precipitate hydrochloric acid hcl to adjust for the ph of w2 4 nitrophenol and ionic liquid of 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium bis triﬂuoromethylsulfonyl imide bmim ntf2 which obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo 63103 usa the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles with a size range of 30 60 nm were acquired from alfa aesar ward hill ma 01835 usa this size of nanoparticles has a noticeable lower cost than the smaller size where the cost is an important factor for large scale applications the magnetic characteristic of the nanoparticles has been selected to be easily removed and recycled by a magnetic field in addition this will facilitate the step of the demulsification and separation of the formed solids and aqueous and organic phases where the organic phase can be recycled 2 2 experimental work in this work the elm of w1 o w2 phases has been implemented since the pollutants 300 ppm of 4 nitrophenol are in the aqueous feed phase w2 the organic phase o represents the membrane that is part of the emulsion formed by mixing the organic phase o with the aqueous phase w1 internal phase that contains the stripping agent as the reactant of 0 5 n naoh solution at a high agitation speed of rotation per minutes rpm of the mixer to form an emulsion of small aqueous droplets in the organic phase the organic phase o consists of surfactant span 80 and kerosene the emulsion w1 o is then dispersed in the aqueous feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 the 4 nitrophenol transfers from w2 phase through o phase to w1 phase where it reacts with the stripping agent naoh to form a solute precipitate which makes a reaction product incapable of diffusing back through the membrane phase where presence in fig 1 consequently the 4 nitrophenol concentration in the internal stripping phase is also maintained at zero by the reaction the equations exhibiting removal and stripping agent process of 4 nirophenol occurring in liquid emulsion membrane technology was given below 1 c6 h4no2oh naoh c6 h4no2o na h2o 1 seseveral factors affect the removal of the

volume treatment ratio of w1 o to the aqueous feed phase w2 elm w2 ratio v v agitation intensity of the treatment and globules formation rpm treatment agitation concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles and ionic liquid and ph of the aqueous feed phase w2 for each range of a variable studied the other variables were fixed as based on the best value of that variable for the removal of a hydrocarbon reported in litterers 10 fig 2 illustrates the steps of the experimental work of the elm employed in this work therefore the first step is to identity the best combination values of these variables to remove 4 nitrophenol before study the effects of nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the elm stability removal efficiency and duration of the removal if needed the following evaluation of the variation of the values has been performed as the table 1 below samples from the agitated solution were taken at different time periods using a micropipette and then separated from the emulsion phase using a nylon syringe filter of 0 2 μm simsii inc usa the 4 nitrophenol was analyzed using a 96 well uv microplate at a wavelength band of 400 nm the second step of experimental work the effects addition of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticle alone in the organic phase o of 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 w w and the separately of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 alone in the organic phase o of 0 05 0 1 0 15 and 0 2 v v will be investigated on the stability of the elm percentage removal of the 4 nitrophenol and the time duration of the batch removal then the identified best values of nanoparticles and ionic liquid will be used when both are combined to examine the effect of such combination on the mentioned parameters of the elm performance as the table 2 below since the key goal is to identify the lowest possible amount of nanoparticles and ionic liquid with the best performance of the elm as illustrated in table 1 for all the conditions studied each experiment was repeated three times where the error bars were estimated at the end of the removal of 4 nitrophenol the mixture is placed in a funnel to separate the upper emulsion phase w1 o and the lower aqueous feed phase w2 then a magnetic field 1 t magnet is applied on the upper phase which pulled the nanoparticles from the emulsion phase w1 o by the magnetic field and with this demulsification occurs where both nanoparticles and organic phase will be reuse after the solid precipitate is filtered and separated the accumulated fe2o3 was washed with acetone and distilled water then dried under a vacuum at 50 c for 10 hours to be reused again the recycled nanoparticles and organic phase will be used for preparing a new experiment of elm as shown in fig 3 2 3 calculation of the elm stability to measure the elm stability volume ratio 0 5 1 v v of red dye to the internal phase w1 as a leakage indicator which has no interaction with both organic and aqueous molecules 21 the percentage of leakage is determined using the following equation 2 l e a k a g e d y e c o n c e n t r a t i o n w 2 d y e c o n c e n t r a t i o n w i t h m a x t i m e w 2 x 100 where the red dye concentration in w2 is the concentration of the dye in the external phase w2 received from w1 and the concentration with maximum time in w2 is the maximum concentration of the dye that is reached in the external aqueous phase w2 when all the red dye leaked from the internal aqueous phase w1 to the external aqueous phase w2 the percentage of the pollutant remaining in w2 phase is defined by the following equation 3 e x t r a c t i o n e i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n f i n a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n i t i a l c o n c e n t r a t i o n x 100 percentage extraction remaining 100 e 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 defining the best values of the variables for 4 nitrophenol removal using elm without nanoparticles and ionic liquid the following experiments have been performed to define the best values possible of the variables to be used to examine the effects of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol and its duration and the stability of the emulsion for all these experiments the emulsion stability was examined as outlined earlier using dye technique and the emulsion stability of 27 for 6 hours 1 the volume ratio of w1 o phase the w1 o volume ratio has a significant role in emulsion stability and the removal because of its usefulness in trapping the droplets of w1 in the organic phase o in reacting the 4 nitrophenol to the stripping agent naoh in w1 the increase in the volume ratio will lead to emulsion instability 22 w1 o volume ratios of 1 1 1 3 and 1 5 v v as proposed by ng et al 23 were used to assess its effects on emulsion stability and the removal of the 4 nitrophenol fig 4 a shows the results of the removal of 4 nitrophenol the volume ratio of 1 1 v v forms large emulsion globules with a thin thickness of organic phase o between w1 droplets of the globules which causes an increase in the leakage and lowers the removal efficiency 24 while the volume ratio of 1 3 v v forms tiny droplets with an increase in thickness organic membrane that causes a reduction in the leakage with high removal efficiency increasing the volume ratio to more than 1 3 v v leads to a reduction in the stability of the emulsion with poor removal efficiency because of the promotion of the resistance for diffusion through the membrane large thickness of organic between droplets hence the value of 1 3 v v volume ratio of w1 phase to o phase has been selected 25 2 the surfactant concentration of span 80 in the organic phase span 80 has been used as the surfactant added to the organic phase o surfactant has a significant effect on the emulsion stability and the reduction of the emulsion leakage because it works as a protective barrier between the external feed phase w2 and the stripping agent w1 26 as shown in fig 2 the surfactant concentrations span 80 of 2 w v 3 w v and 4 w v were used it was distinguished that a surfactant concentration of 2 w v caused the highest percentage removal of 4 nitrophenol and the lowest emulsion leakage as shown in fig 4 b increasing the concentration of span 80 can affect negatively the removal of pollutants due to lowering the surface tension of the emulsion causing the formation of a small globules containing small number of droplets of w1 in addition adding more of span 80 would lead to an increase in the leakage a reduction in the emulsion stability and a decrease in the removal efficiency due to the formation of small emulsion globules 25 3 the agitation intensity rpm to create emulsification emulsion agitation the agitation rpm to create proper emulsion is essential as the formation of designable emulsion that can increase the removal efficiency 23 and 27 the agitation of 5000 7000 and 8000 rpm were used to form the emulsion and to study the removal of the 4 nitrophenol emulsion stability increases by increasing the agitation the emulsion agitation of 8000 rpm was found suitable by forming a mayonnaise like emulsion due to the generation of more droplets increasing the droplet formation results in a highly viscous emulsion and droplets merge with each there due to rapid mixing emulsification agitation of 8000 rpm gives the better removal of the pollutants 28 as shown in fig 4 c 4 the volume ratio of w1 o globules to w2 phase elm w1 o globules to the w2 volume ratio plays a significant role in the performance of the elm the volume ratios of 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 5 and 1 8 v v were selected to examine the removal efficiency of 4 nitrophenol the volume ratio of 1 2 was found to be desirable as shown in fig 4 d this ratio provides an increase in the overall surface area for mass transfer and removal capacity the stability of emulsion increases by reducing the volume fraction of the internal phase as stated by m djenouhat et al 29 the other volume ratios decrease the removal efficiency which can be attributed to the increase in the membrane o thickness around the droplets in addition the mechanical resistance of the membrane increases at a higher organic fraction thus preventing coalescence of the dispersed droplets and maintaining the size of the droplets to be within the range of the size of the standard droplets of 0 1 2 mm in general larger droplet sizes increase the emulsion instability because the droplets easily coalesce ng et al 23 5 the agitation intensity rpm of the mixing of w1 o globules and w2 phase treatment agitation the effect of the agitation intensity rpm of 250 300 and 400 rpm was studied on the removal of the pollutants as shown in fig 4 e the 300 rpm was found to be the desire for increasing the emulsion stability as it displays the lowest amount of emulsion leakage producing a greater shear force on the droplets significantly reduces the emulsion globules size and increases the contact area for mass transfer 30 at a low mixing intensity the emulsion globules size increases which causes a decrease in the mass transfer rate of 4 nitrophenol increasing the agitation intensity of rpm can lead to reducing the emulsion stability because high intensity produces globules rupture causing leakage of the w1 into the w2 phases 22 31 6 the ph of the w2 phase the ph values used 1 5 6 5 and are presented in fig 4 f is observed that when the value of the ph of the external feed synthetic wastewater phase was 1 5 improved the removal efficiency and the emulsion stability 32 removal of the 4 nitrophenol from synthetic wastewater w2 precipitate in alkaline solutions zhaoyun 2016 the removal efficiency enhances at a lower ph due to an increase in the hydrogen ion h concentration of the external feed synthetic wastewater phase w2 which reacts with naoh w1 to form a precipitate of complex acid base the increase of the ph decreases the hydrogen ion h which reduces the removal efficiency 32 3 2 the effect of nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol the effects of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid in the organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol at the selected best values of the variable studied above have been investigated using the values of the w1 o volume ratio of 1 3 v v span 80 concentration of 2 w v emulsion agitation of 8000 rpm elm w1 o w2 volume ratio of w2 of 1 2 v v treatment agitation of w2 of 300 rpm and ph of 1 5 for all the experiments performed here the emulsion stability was examined as outlined earlier 3 2 1 the effect of the fe2o3 nanoparticles on the removal of 4 nitrophenol fig 5 shows the results of the removal of 4 nitrophenol using 0 05 w w 0 1 w w 0 15 w w of magnetic nanoparticles of fe2o3 in the o phase the results illustrate that the ratio of 0 1 w w of magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles alone in the o phase elevates the 4 nitrophenol removal to higher level of 93 4 during 15 min and 54 of the emulsion stability during 6 hours as compared to the ratios of 0 05 w w and 0 15 w w the presence of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles in the organic phase o enhances the stability of the elm and the mass transfer of 4 nitrophenol from w2 to w1 through the o phase 33 this improves the solute removal due to forming film of the particles at w1 o interface and increasing the binding sites on the surface of the solute 31 the findings are in agreement with the results obtained by sawsan et al 31 which indicate that the increase in magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 concentration beyond full coverage of the w1 droplets in o phase as extra magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles concentrations will be dispersed in the w2 phase and some of the magnetic nanoparticles might form aggregates on w1 o interface which affect the stability of the emulsion and slow the transfer process 34 hence the removal efficiency decreases qusay al obaidi muthanna al dahhan 2020 3 2 2 the effect of ionic liquid in the organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol regarding the use of ionic liquid in the organic phase o as another method to improve the stability of the elm the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 was chosen to be used in this study because it has been shown to be extracted and striped more efficiently as shown in a schematic fig 6 of the packed ionic liquid molecules between the span 80 molecules 35 the relation between the concentration 0 05 v v to 0 25 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 and emulsion stability time is shown in fig 7 increasing the concentration of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 up to 0 2 v v of bmim ntf2 will increase the stability time hence at 0 2 v v ionic liquid concentration a removal of 83 9 of 15 min of 4 nitrophenol was achieved and 49 of emulsion stability during 6 h at a higher ionic liquid concentration the stability time decreased due to increased emulsion sedimentation by considering the high density of the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 the emulsion liquid membrane elm stability was increased due to the ionic liquid bmim ntf2 which could be caused by coulombic interactions of the charges on the naoh and ions of the ionic liquids bmim ntf2 this strong interaction enhances the emulsion stability by lowering the coalescence of the internal droplets 27 there is probability of hydrogen bonding between oh group of naoh and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 the hydrogen bonding may cause a strong protection surrounding the internal droplets to avoid coalescence the increase of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 can further reduce the interfacial tension also through adsorbing in the w1 o interface and thereby minimizing the repulsion of the hydrophilic head groups of the span 80 which contributes to a more efficient packing of the span 80 at the interface and reduces the droplet size of w1 35 3 2 3 the effect of combining nanoparticles and ionic liquid on the removal of 4 nitrophenol as per the previous results of 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 sections above the 0 1 w w of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 alone and 0 2 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 alone provide better removal of 4 nitrophenol here we combine both of these concentrations to examine the effects of the combination of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 added in organic phase o on the removal of 4 nitrophenol also to examine the effects of the variation of ionic liquid concentration 0 05 v v to 0 25 v v while maintaining the concentration of nanoparticles at 0 05 w w 0 1 w w and 0 15 w w have been investigated as per fig 8 and table 3 the results of the leakage test were used as indicator for assessing stability as shown in fig 9 the stability of the prepared elm was assessed before performing the 4 nitrophenol removal experiments the breakage of the emulsion globules when the elm is instable causes decreasing in the removal efficiency the elm stability highly affects the removal rate in the receiving phase w1 the stability of elm process was detected as indicated before via trace of the loaded dye in the receiving phase w1 in a period of the elm preparation and detected it in the external feed phase w2 36 the lowest leakage and higher stability time were obtained with the combination of the magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 after 1 hour which sustain during the experiments this confirms that the combination improves the stability of elm as compared with elm alone elm nanoparticles and elm ionic liquid hence the combination enhances the stability and forms droplets that are particularly stable in the emulsion removal time is considered as the target to determine the elm effectiveness which represents the period of time for the concentration of 4 nitrophenol to real close to zero the ratio of 0 05 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 and 0 05 w w of fe2o3 gives higher removal efficiency for the 4 nitrophenol 99 in 1 min and the emulsion stability was improved significantly to 81 for 6 h in addition it gives least amount of nanoparticles and ionic liquid to be used the results illustrate that the combination of magnetic nanoparticles fe2o3 and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 increase the emulsion stability and the removal efficiency with less duration of time 4 conclusion the experimental results viewed that the best operational conditions achieving for 4 nitrophenol removal were concentration of surfactant 2 w v the volume ratio of internal phase to organic phase 1 3 v v agitation intensity 8000 rpm volume ratio elm w2 1 2 v v the agitation mixing speed 300 rpm and ph of the w2 was 1 5 at the best conditions the removal of 4 nitrophenol was achieved with an efficiency of 63 from aqueous solutions within 15 min the removal efficiency with the concentration of 0 1 w w magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles was 93 4 at 15 min while the removal efficiency with the concentration of 0 2 v v of ionic liquid bmim ntf2 was 83 9 at 15 min the long term of emulsion stability was greatly improved by the combination of the magnetic fe2o3 nanoparticles and ionic liquid bmim ntf2 in organic phase o by the formation of a three dimensional network among the droplets and particles that give the higher removal efficiency at a shorter time of 1 min with the lowest leakage and higher stability of the elm process time starting after 1 h and sustains during the experiments time the best combination in organic phase o was of 0 05 w w fe2o3 nanoparticle and 0 05 v v ionic liquid bmim ntf2 which gives higher removal efficiency for 4 nitrophenol of 99 for 1 min of batch separation and the emulsion stability of 81 for 6 hours this confirms the ability of such combination in increasing the emulsion stability and removal declaration of competing interest there is potential of using such technology for recycling water reuse water after treating industrial aqueous effluents and produce water waste water and other water resource all industrial sectors and wastewater and water resources and or treatment sectors we used nanoparticles alone to enhance separation also ionic liquid alone was used however no work has been published that use combine both nanoparticles and ionic liquid to enhance the removal and separation of hydrocarbons in shorter process time declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements i would like to thanks my sponsor iraqi cultural office mosher and the university of technology for provide me a funding for this project work also i would like to thank my family for supporting me in this difficult time 
13733,the study investigates low temperature attached growth rates and nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome responses down to 1 c two moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr were acclimatized from 10 c to 1 c by incremental decreases in temperatures a non linear decline in nitrification with decreasing temperatures was recorded with a kinetic threshold temperature delineated between 4 c and 2 c at which a significant decline in efficiency of 22 47 occurred an increase in biofilm thickness of 25 47 occurs between 10 c and 4 c followed by lesser increases of 6 55 and 9 60 at 2 c and 1 c biofilm density decreases between 10 c and 1 c an increase in embedded viable cells of 24 01 occurs between 10 c and 4 c followed by lesser non statistically relevant increases at 2 c and 1 c no statistically significant change in the number of estimated species is observed however β diversity analysis indicates greater microbial community shifts above the kinetic threshold followed by lesser shifts between 2 c and 1 c nitrosomanadacea and nitrosopira are the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob families in the biofilm with relative abundances of 3 43 0 51 and 0 94 0 44 respectively at 10 c a change in nob relative abundance occurred between the temperatures of 10 c and 1 c decreasing to 0 19 0 10 above the kinetic threshold the estimation of nitrifiers per carrier in the bioreactors based on biofilm thickness biomass viability and relative abundances shows an increase of 30 2 in aob carrier above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c followed by lesser increases down to 1 c keywords nitrification cold temperatures biofilm technology wastewater bioinformatics 1 introduction the elevated ammonia concentrations recorded in surface waters in north america and around the world are mainly due to the anthropogenic release from point source polluters such as water resources recovery facilities wrrf 1 3 the severe environmental and economic impacts of water toxicity and eutrophication caused by the ammonia discharged into receiving water bodies are well understood which has led to a trend towards stringent effluent regulations in numerous countries to mitigate the adverse effects of deleterious substances from wrrf 4 7 the biologically mediated two step process of nitrification remains the most common solution for ammonia removal from wastewater 8 9 that being said the temperature sensitive process of nitrification remains hindered at low temperatures in conventional suspended growth technologies to eventually cease below 4 c with no nitrification recorded at 1 c however nitrifying attached growth systems such as the moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr have been shown capable of maintaining nitrification down to 1 c 10 17 in addition nitrifying biofilm technologies have been presented as a potential upgrade solution for ammonia removal for the numerous passive treatment systems in operation in northern countries due to their efficiency and their low operational intensity 18 20 nitrifying attached growth systems possess advantages inherent to biofilm technologies such as the resiliency to environmental stressors and the ability to retain slow growing organisms such as the nitrifiers responsible for the nitrification process 21 23 the nitrifying biofilm in these bioreactors has been shown to be composed of phylogenetically diverse organisms in addition to the autotrophic communities responsible for the two step process of nitrification commonly referred to as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 24 27 studies have identified the dominant nitrifying genera in wrrfs as nitrosomonas as the dominant aob and nitrospira as the dominant nob 28 30 the effects of low temperatures on nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome in attached growth systems were investigated at temperatures as low as 1 c 11 14 17 31 34 previous findings indicate that increases in nitrifying biofilms thickness are observed at low temperatures down to 1 c along with decreases in biofilm densities linked to limited increases in biofilm mass despite the observed increased thickness 12 14 a recent study on 1 c nitrifying attached growth systems was unable to achieve incremental precise and stable decreases in temperatures while using real wastewater to accurately isolate the kinetic change of attached growth nitrification across incremental temperature change 16 in particular this study confirmed the non linear relationship between declining temperatures and attached growth nitrification kinetics with a first significant decrease in kinetics delineated between the temperatures of 2 c and 4 c however no characterization of the changes occurring within the nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome at this kinetic threshold temperature was reported therefore signifying that the effects of low temperature on nitrifying biofilms down to the cellular level have yet to be accurately defined by incremental decreases in temperatures using a temperature controlled setting with the system being fed with real wastewater this study aims to delineate the response of nitrifying biofilms and the embedded microbiome of low temperature attached growth systems during the transition to lower temperatures and the onset of low temperatures in particular this study investigates the nitrifying biofilm response with respect to thickness mass density biomass viability and as well as the response of the embedded microbial communities during the transition and onset of low temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experimental setup of this study consists of two laboratory scale mbbr reactors that are identical in design and were operated in parallel to ensure repeatability of reactor performance in a temperature controlled chamber throughout the experiment fig 1 the two attached growth reactors mbbr1 and mbbr2 have the same volume of 2 2 l and housed anoxkaldness k5 carriers lund sweden with diameters of 25 mm heights of 4 mm and surface area to volume ratios of 800 m2 m3 collected from a partially nitrifying integrated fixed active sludge ifas system located in hawkesbury ontario canada the mbbr reactors were operated at fill percentages below the maximum recommended 67 fill for mbbr systems 32 aeration was supplied to the reactors with an air pump and air diffusers to provide dissolved oxygen do for the aerobic reaction of nitrification and allow adequate mixing of the carriers in the reactors the biofilm system comprised of two identical mbbr reactors was operated in parallel with temperatures decreasing from 10 c to 1 c in the temperature controlled chamber in decrements of 2 c to ensure a slow acclimatization to each temperature specifically the operational temperatures were 10 c 8 c 6 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c the mbbr reactors were operated at each incremental decrease in temperature until steady state removal efficiency was achieved with the steady state operation being defined as removal efficiency fluctuations below 10 the reactors were operated for a minimum of 20 hydraulic retention times at each temperature value in addition to demonstrating steady operation at each temperature investigated in this study the mbbr reactors were fed with real wastewater collected from a full scale partially aerated continuous flow multi pond lagoon facility with a hydraulic retention time of 20 3 days the wastewater constituents of the full scale facility effluent used to feed the

low temperature attached growth nitrification efficiency to determine the effects of low temperatures down to 1 c on attached growth nitrification efficiency two nitrifying mbbr systems performance were measured at 10 c 8 c 6 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c fig 2 the measured total ammonia nitrogen tan removal efficiencies remained above 85 with efficiencies of 96 13 0 44 97 23 0 67 88 74 2 73 95 98 3 21 at 10 c 8 c 6 c and 4 c respectively although there was no statistically relevant change in tan removal efficiency between 10 c and 4 c a significant decrease in efficiency is observed between 10 c and 6 c at the temperature of 6 c not only does the tan removal efficiency decreased but also the rates of nitritation and nitratation diverged nitritation at 6 c showed lower rates compared to nitratation and hence a slight accumulation of nitrite is observed at this temperature this decline in tan removal efficiency and nitritation are shown to be a temporary decrease in the system at 6 c as both the tan removal and nitritation rates increase at 4 c this temporary observed decrease likely shows the first effects of temperature on the performance of the system with these effects being overcome with extended time of operation a significant decrease in attached growth nitrification performance is also recorded below 4 c more specifically between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c as the removal efficiencies decreased from 95 98 3 21 at 4 c to 73 51 3 51 at 2 c representing a decline in efficiency of 22 47 this pattern of change in efficiency demonstrates a non linear relationship between decreasing temperatures and declining attached growth nitrification efficiency as such the data indicates the existence of a kinetic threshold temperature for attached growth nitrification between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c this threshold temperature previously delineated to be below the temperature of 5 c in low temperature nitrifying biofilm systems by hoang et al 12 and below 4 c by ahmed et al 16 in temperature controlled studies this first threshold is followed by a second significant decline in efficiency between the temperatures of 2 c and 1 c characterized by a decrease in removal efficiency of 14 63 measurements of tan nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the reactors show a nitrogen mass balance with an error of less than 4 fig 2b this nitrogen mass balance confirms nitrification as the pathway for ammonia removal and also confirms a lack of significant denitrification in the reactors nitrite percentage as nox nox above the kinetic threshold temperature was measured at 0 40 0 02 0 08 0 02 9 42 0 96 and 3 98 0 01 at 10 c 8 c 6 c and 4 c while nitrite as nox below the threshold temperate was 5 04 0 51 and 1 45 0 15 at 2 c and 1 c therefore the first increase in nitrite is recorded at 6 c or above the kinetic threshold temperature as such nitrite accumulation across temperatures in the reactors indicates that the significant decline in removal efficiency occurring between 4 c and 2 c is preceded by a decline in nitritation the first reaction and rate limiting step of nitrification 3 2 biofilm response at low temperature as no significant changes occur between 10 c and 4 c with respect to the efficiency the biofilm biomass and microbiome responses of the nitrifying biofilm were assessed at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c as such the changes in these responses are assessed above the kinetic threshold temperature at 10 c and 4 c between the temperature range at which the kinetic threshold temperature was delineated at 4 c and 2 c and below the kinetic threshold temperature at 2 c and 1 c the biofilm response was characterized as the biofilm mass the biofilm thickness and the biofilm densities a function of the biofilm mass and thickness fig 3 differences in nitrifying biofilm mass at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c were not statistically relevant with initial biofilm masses at 10 c of 32 05 2 06 mg the biofilm thickness measurements indicate an increase in thickness with decreasing temperatures at the initial stage of 10 c the nitrifying biofilm was measured at 229 92 6 10 μm and increased to 308 50 8 56 μm at 4 c which represents an increase of 25 47 in biofilm thickness at 2 c the biofilm thickness increased by 6 54 with a measured thickness of 330 12 13 62 μm followed by another increase of 9 60 at 1 c with a measured thickness of 365 19 9 60 μm increases in biofilm thickness with decreasing temperatures were also observed in nitrifying biofilms operating at low temperatures with increases of 54 in biofilm thickness between 20 c and 1 c 12 14 previous studies have stated that the overall lower metabolic activity of the biofilm allows for an increased substrate availability at lower biofilms depths and thus biofilm growth especially of filamentous bacteria and carbohydrate producers associated with increases in biofilm thickness 12 14 45 the nitrifying biofilm density is shown to decrease with exposure time at 1 c as a result of increasing biofilm thickness with no statistically significant change in biofilm mass being measured the lower biofilm densities with increased biofilm thicknesses are typical of filamentous and porous biofilm morphologies and a higher polysaccharides content within the biofilm as previously described in low temperature nitrifying mbbr systems 13 46 47 as mentioned above the biofilm responses in terms of density and decreasing temperatures support the biofilm response observed in low temperature nitrifying mbbr systems 12 14 48 49 3 3 biomass viability at low temperature the biomass viability as viable cells percentage of the total cells was assessed again at the temperatures of 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c fig 4 the biomass viability measured at 61 66 5 79 at 10 c increased to 85 67 4 96 at 4 c thus signifying an increase of 24 01 in viable cells above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c below 4 c lesser and non statistically significant increases in viable cells are recorded with the percentages of viable cells of 90 13 4 47 and 94 01 1 40 at 2 c and 1 c respectively the increase in biomass viability in the nitrifying biofilm at low temperatures correlate to the reported biomass response to low temperatures in nitrifying mbbr systems 12 14 an increase in cell viability at lower temperatures was previously attributed to an increase in substrate availability throughout the biofilm especially at lower levels of the biofilm as metabolic activities and thus the rate of substrate consummation of embedded cells decreases moreover the decrease in biofilm density also allows for an increase in substrate diffusion and an associated increase in substrate availability 12 14 50 3 4 microbiome response at low temperature the microbiome response was assessed the same as the biofilm and biomass at the temperatures of 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c the total number of estimated species measured as the α diversity at the initial stage of 10 c was 2532 78 61 with no statistically relevant changes recorded in the number of estimated species at 4 c 2 c at 1 c fig 5 a in particular no loss of diversity due to low temperatures occurred to justify the decline in nitrification efficiency between 4 c and 2 c interestingly the β diversity and principal coordinate analysis pcoa analysis demonstrate shifts in microbial communities with decreasing temperatures in the nitrifying biofilms fig 5b pcoa results indicate greater community shifts at temperatures occurring above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c while lesser microbial shifts occurred between 4 c and 2 c and below the kinetic threshold temperature between 2 c and 1 c as such these results suggest that the bulk of the nitrifying microbiome adaptions to low temperature is occurring above the kinetic threshold temperature correlating with the observed increases in biofilm thickness and biomass viability in the nitrifying biofilm above 4 c taxonomy assessment of the nitrifying biofilms indicates that the embedded bacteria of the nitrifying biofilms were predominantly mesophiles suggesting that little to no bacterial growth occurred between the low temperatures of 10 c and 1 c at the phylum level actinobacteria proteobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi represented the major phylum groups at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c with respect to statistically relevant trends with decreasing temperatures the bulk of the microbiome shifts occur again above the kinetic threshold temperature or between 10 c and 4 c at which chloroflexi s relative abundance decreased while an increase of actinobacteria and proteobacteria was recorded at the family level roseiflexaceae caldilineaceae pirellulaceae rhodobacteracea planctomycetacea and an unidentified proteobacteria were identified as the major families while the minor families 5 were grouped under low abundance otus group fig 5c as such the 16 s sequencing results demonstrate that the dominant bacteria identified in the nitrifying biofilm between 10 c and 1 c are involved in the metabolism of polysaccharides and more importantly of amino acids crucial for the maintenance of the biofilm s structure and extracellular polymeric substances eps production thus indicating the capacity of the phylogenetically diverse nitrifying biofilm to mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stressors such as low temperatures on the biofilm integrity 49 51 56 for the statistically relevant changes with decreasing temperature the fraction of filamentous bacteria such as roseiflexaceae decreased by 17 25 above the kinetic threshold temperature with a percent abundance of 31 72 8 55 at 10 c and 14 47 1 92 at 4 c 57 58 despite this initial significant decrease in the fraction of filamentous bacteria roseiflexaceae remains unchanged below 4 c down to 1 c and remains one of the dominant bacteria in the biofilm which correlates with the thicker and less dense nitrifying biofilm observed above the nitrosomonas and nitrosovibrio genera from the nitrosomonadaceae family and the nitrospira genus from the nitrospiraceae family were the only aob and nob identified with relative abundances of 3 43 0 51 and 0 94 0 44 respectively at 10 c 14 30 59 60 although performing the metabolic process of interest aob and nob represent only a small fraction of the microbiome often demonstrated to be less than 12 of the species identified in low temperature nitrifying biofilms 12 14 the dna sequencing data indicates no statistically relevant changes in the relative abundance of aob between 10 c and 1 c while nob s percent abundance decreased above the kinetic threshold 4 c from 0 94 0 44 to 0 19 0 10 with no further statistically relevant changes below 4 c thus no changes in aob s percent abundance was recorded to justify the decline in nitrification efficiency between the kinetic threshold temperature moreover taking into account the observed increases in biofilm thickness increases in biomass viability and the relative abundance of nitrifiers in the biofilm the estimated aob per carrier aob carrier increases by 30 2 above the kinetic threshold temperature between 10 c and 4 c followed by a lesser increase 7 below the 2 c 12 14 as such these results identify the increase in estimated aob carrier within the nitrifying mbbr systems as a factor for the significant nitrification rates attained at low temperatures such as 1 c on the other hand the nob carrier decreases by 45 3 above the kinetic threshold temperature between 10 c and 4 c then increase by 5 9 between 4 c and 2 c and finally increased again by 7 1 between 2 c and 1 c a decrease in nob carrier above the kinetic threshold temperature is associated with the 66 decrease of the nitrospiraceae family s relative abundance between 10 c and 4 c in addition the decrease in the estimated nob carrier above 4 c correlates with the slight increase in nitrite accumulation in the bioreactors within the same temperature range recorded more specifically at 6 c the picrust metabolic pathway and genes function predictions of the biofilm with kegg indicate an upregulation of crucial functions above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c as displayed in fig 6 metabolic pathways and functional genes potential linked to eps production increased above 4 c such pathways are characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of predicted functional genes linked to biofilm formation such as rema associated with eps synthesis and carbohydrate binding along with several other metabolic pathways linked to carbohydrate and amino acids metabolisms 61 the predicted upregulation of idh and ccpa genes are also notable and essential to biofilms the ccpa gene encoding for the catabolite control protein a increases the gene expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase a crucial enzyme for polysaccharides intercellular adhesion pia and eps formation pathways 62 63 however it is worth noting the limitations of metabolic pathway predictions as the suppression of the relative functional potential of the citric acid cycle tca pathways linked to an upregulation of the ccpa gene was not observed above 4 c overall the functional genes potential changes above 4 c associated with the biofilm formation correlates with the observed increase in biofilm thickness and the large fraction of polysaccharides producing families such as the roseiflexaceae identified in the taxonomy results of the biofilms cell communication pathways in the biofilm associated with the quorum sensing are up regulated in the biofilm above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c characterized by the upregulation of relative potentials of genes such rpfb luxs and yajc 64 these genes are integral parts of the biofilm responses and adaptation mechanisms to environmental stressors such as temperatures that correlate with the greater microbial shifts measured observed only above 4 c by β diversity and pcoa analysis energy metabolism within the biofilm also increases above 4 c namely nitrogen metabolism pathways characterized by the two step nitrification process which correlates with the increase in estimated aob carriers within the reactors between 10 c and 4 c the observed nitrite accumulation above the kinetic threshold temperature at 6 c is linked according to picrust analysis to a down regulation of the nora and norb genes in the biofilm above 4 c this decrease in the functional potential of these genes encoding for the two subunits of the nitrite oxidoreductase is the only pathway down regulated and associated with the nitratation reaction above 4 c 65 in addition a similar pattern is observed for the carbon fixation potential within the biofilm or the co2 utilization mediated by autotroph such as the nitrifiers within the biofilm metabolic activities linked to genetic information processing demonstrate an upregulation above 4 c correlating with the observed increase in cell viability between 10 c and 4 c within the biofilm also correlating with the increase in viable cells in the biofilm is the increases of mechanisms linked to biofilm growth mechanisms stress response pathways protecting the dna characterized by genes such as dps shielding the dna from dnase activities btue and trxa mitigating oxidative stress 66 67 other notable functional characteristics in the biofilm are the cell motility mechanisms characterized for instance by the mtor pathways did not increase suggesting that biofilm remains stable above 4 c amino acids lipids and carbohydrates biosynthesis linked to biofilm and eps integrity 68 71 4 conclusion the biofilms biomass and microbiome of attached growth systems were investigated between the temperatures of 10 c and 1 c in nitrifying mbbr systems fed with real wastewater and operated at decreasing temperatures in a temperature controlled chamber the kinetic threshold temperature characterized by a significant decline of 22 47 in attached growth nitrification efficiency was delineated between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c above which the bulk of the biofilm biomass and microbiome acclimatization to low temperature occurred taxonomy assessment indicated no statistically relevant changes in the relative abundance of aob mediating the rate limiting step of the nitrification process between 10 c and 1 c as such the decline of 22 47 in nitrification efficiency between 4 c and 2 c is associated with a decrease in aob s metabolic activities due to low temperatures in contrast nob s relative abundance decreased above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c which correlates with a recorded increase in nitrite accumulation in the bioreactors at 6 c the nitrifying biofilm increased in thickness and decreased in density above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c correlating with the dominant filamentous bacteria identified in the biofilm and the predicted upregulation of metabolic pathways associated with biofilm and eps formation similarly the biofilm displayed a greater increase in biomass viability above 4 c an increase in cell viability may be linked to an increase in substrate availability and diffusion throughout the biofilm linked to the lower cellular activity of the embedded bacteria and an increase in membrane rigidity at low temperatures moreover in predicted metabolic pathways apoptosis was down regulated while cell growth transcription and translation were up regulated in the biofilm above 4 c the β diversity analysis indicates that the biofilm undergoes greater microbial shifts above 4 c as well correlating with the predicted upregulation of key metabolic pathways such as those associated with quorum sensing the estimate of nitrifiers carrier accounting for the increases in biofilm thickness and biomass viability increases significantly above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c followed by lesser increases down to 1 c the sum of these observations indicates that the adaptation of nitrifying biofilms to low temperatures occurs above 4 c preceding the low temperature induced non linear decline in nitrification efficiency these responses to low temperatures in nitrifying mbbr systems along with their capacity to retain slow growing bacteria inherent to biofilm technologies allow these systems to maintain significant nitrification rates at temperatures as low as 1 c

13733,the study investigates low temperature attached growth rates and nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome responses down to 1 c two moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr were acclimatized from 10 c to 1 c by incremental decreases in temperatures a non linear decline in nitrification with decreasing temperatures was recorded with a kinetic threshold temperature delineated between 4 c and 2 c at which a significant decline in efficiency of 22 47 occurred an increase in biofilm thickness of 25 47 occurs between 10 c and 4 c followed by lesser increases of 6 55 and 9 60 at 2 c and 1 c biofilm density decreases between 10 c and 1 c an increase in embedded viable cells of 24 01 occurs between 10 c and 4 c followed by lesser non statistically relevant increases at 2 c and 1 c no statistically significant change in the number of estimated species is observed however β diversity analysis indicates greater microbial community shifts above the kinetic threshold followed by lesser shifts between 2 c and 1 c nitrosomanadacea and nitrosopira are the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob families in the biofilm with relative abundances of 3 43 0 51 and 0 94 0 44 respectively at 10 c a change in nob relative abundance occurred between the temperatures of 10 c and 1 c decreasing to 0 19 0 10 above the kinetic threshold the estimation of nitrifiers per carrier in the bioreactors based on biofilm thickness biomass viability and relative abundances shows an increase of 30 2 in aob carrier above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c followed by lesser increases down to 1 c keywords nitrification cold temperatures biofilm technology wastewater bioinformatics 1 introduction the elevated ammonia concentrations recorded in surface waters in north america and around the world are mainly due to the anthropogenic release from point source polluters such as water resources recovery facilities wrrf 1 3 the severe environmental and economic impacts of water toxicity and eutrophication caused by the ammonia discharged into receiving water bodies are well understood which has led to a trend towards stringent effluent regulations in numerous countries to mitigate the adverse effects of deleterious substances from wrrf 4 7 the biologically mediated two step process of nitrification remains the most common solution for ammonia removal from wastewater 8 9 that being said the temperature sensitive process of nitrification remains hindered at low temperatures in conventional suspended growth technologies to eventually cease below 4 c with no nitrification recorded at 1 c however nitrifying attached growth systems such as the moving bed biofilm reactors mbbr have been shown capable of maintaining nitrification down to 1 c 10 17 in addition nitrifying biofilm technologies have been presented as a potential upgrade solution for ammonia removal for the numerous passive treatment systems in operation in northern countries due to their efficiency and their low operational intensity 18 20 nitrifying attached growth systems possess advantages inherent to biofilm technologies such as the resiliency to environmental stressors and the ability to retain slow growing organisms such as the nitrifiers responsible for the nitrification process 21 23 the nitrifying biofilm in these bioreactors has been shown to be composed of phylogenetically diverse organisms in addition to the autotrophic communities responsible for the two step process of nitrification commonly referred to as ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob 24 27 studies have identified the dominant nitrifying genera in wrrfs as nitrosomonas as the dominant aob and nitrospira as the dominant nob 28 30 the effects of low temperatures on nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome in attached growth systems were investigated at temperatures as low as 1 c 11 14 17 31 34 previous findings indicate that increases in nitrifying biofilms thickness are observed at low temperatures down to 1 c along with decreases in biofilm densities linked to limited increases in biofilm mass despite the observed increased thickness 12 14 a recent study on 1 c nitrifying attached growth systems was unable to achieve incremental precise and stable decreases in temperatures while using real wastewater to accurately isolate the kinetic change of attached growth nitrification across incremental temperature change 16 in particular this study confirmed the non linear relationship between declining temperatures and attached growth nitrification kinetics with a first significant decrease in kinetics delineated between the temperatures of 2 c and 4 c however no characterization of the changes occurring within the nitrifying biofilm biomass and microbiome at this kinetic threshold temperature was reported therefore signifying that the effects of low temperature on nitrifying biofilms down to the cellular level have yet to be accurately defined by incremental decreases in temperatures using a temperature controlled setting with the system being fed with real wastewater this study aims to delineate the response of nitrifying biofilms and the embedded microbiome of low temperature attached growth systems during the transition to lower temperatures and the onset of low temperatures in particular this study investigates the nitrifying biofilm response with respect to thickness mass density biomass viability and as well as the response of the embedded microbial communities during the transition and onset of low temperatures 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operation the experimental setup of this study consists of two laboratory scale mbbr reactors that are identical in design and were operated in parallel to ensure repeatability of reactor performance in a temperature controlled chamber throughout the experiment fig 1 the two attached growth reactors mbbr1 and mbbr2 have the same volume of 2 2 l and housed anoxkaldness k5 carriers lund sweden with diameters of 25 mm heights of 4 mm and surface area to volume ratios of 800 m2 m3 collected from a partially nitrifying integrated fixed active sludge ifas system located in hawkesbury ontario canada the mbbr reactors were operated at fill percentages below the maximum recommended 67 fill for mbbr systems 32 aeration was supplied to the reactors with an air pump and air diffusers to provide dissolved oxygen do for the aerobic reaction of nitrification and allow adequate mixing of the carriers in the reactors the biofilm system comprised of two identical mbbr reactors was operated in parallel with temperatures decreasing from 10 c to 1 c in the temperature controlled chamber in decrements of 2 c to ensure a slow acclimatization to each temperature specifically the operational temperatures were 10 c 8 c 6 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c the mbbr reactors were operated at each incremental decrease in temperature until steady state removal efficiency was achieved with the steady state operation being defined as removal efficiency fluctuations below 10 the reactors were operated for a minimum of 20 hydraulic retention times at each temperature value in addition to demonstrating steady operation at each temperature investigated in this study the mbbr reactors were fed with real wastewater collected from a

low temperature attached growth nitrification efficiency to determine the effects of low temperatures down to 1 c on attached growth nitrification efficiency two nitrifying mbbr systems performance were measured at 10 c 8 c 6 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c fig 2 the measured total ammonia nitrogen tan removal efficiencies remained above 85 with efficiencies of 96 13 0 44 97 23 0 67 88 74 2 73 95 98 3 21 at 10 c 8 c 6 c and 4 c respectively although there was no statistically relevant change in tan removal efficiency between 10 c and 4 c a significant decrease in efficiency is observed between 10 c and 6 c at the temperature of 6 c not only does the tan removal efficiency decreased but also the rates of nitritation and nitratation diverged nitritation at 6 c showed lower rates compared to nitratation and hence a slight accumulation of nitrite is observed at this temperature this decline in tan removal efficiency and nitritation are shown to be a temporary decrease in the system at 6 c as both the tan removal and nitritation rates increase at 4 c this temporary observed decrease likely shows the first effects of temperature on the performance of the system with these effects being overcome with extended time of operation a significant decrease in attached growth nitrification performance is also recorded below 4 c more specifically between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c as the removal efficiencies decreased from 95 98 3 21 at 4 c to 73 51 3 51 at 2 c representing a decline in efficiency of 22 47 this pattern of change in efficiency demonstrates a non linear relationship between decreasing temperatures and declining attached growth nitrification efficiency as such the data indicates the existence of a kinetic threshold temperature for attached growth nitrification between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c this threshold temperature previously delineated to be below the temperature of 5 c in low temperature nitrifying biofilm systems by hoang et al 12 and below 4 c by ahmed et al 16 in temperature controlled studies this first threshold is followed by a second significant decline in efficiency between the temperatures of 2 c and 1 c characterized by a decrease in removal efficiency of 14 63 measurements of tan nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the reactors show a nitrogen mass balance with an error of less than 4 fig 2b this nitrogen mass balance confirms nitrification as the pathway for ammonia removal and also confirms a lack of significant denitrification in the reactors nitrite percentage as nox nox above the kinetic threshold temperature was measured at 0 40 0 02 0 08 0 02 9 42 0 96 and 3 98 0 01 at 10 c 8 c 6 c and 4 c while nitrite as nox below the threshold temperate was 5 04 0 51 and 1 45 0 15 at 2 c and 1 c therefore the first increase in nitrite is recorded at 6 c or above the kinetic threshold temperature as such nitrite accumulation across temperatures in the reactors indicates that the significant decline in removal efficiency occurring between 4 c and 2 c is preceded by a decline in nitritation the first reaction and rate limiting step of nitrification 3 2 biofilm response at low temperature as no significant changes occur between 10 c and 4 c with respect to the efficiency the biofilm biomass and microbiome responses of the nitrifying biofilm were assessed at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c as such the changes in these responses are assessed above the kinetic threshold temperature at 10 c and 4 c between the temperature range at which the kinetic threshold temperature was delineated at 4 c and 2 c and below the kinetic threshold temperature at 2 c and 1 c the biofilm response was characterized as the biofilm mass the biofilm thickness and the biofilm densities a function of the biofilm mass and thickness fig 3 differences in nitrifying biofilm mass at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c were not statistically relevant with initial biofilm masses at 10 c of 32 05 2 06 mg the biofilm thickness measurements indicate an increase in thickness with decreasing temperatures at the initial stage of 10 c the nitrifying biofilm was measured at 229 92 6 10 μm and increased to 308 50 8 56 μm at 4 c which represents an increase of 25 47 in biofilm thickness at 2 c the biofilm thickness increased by 6 54 with a measured thickness of 330 12 13 62 μm followed by another increase of 9 60 at 1 c with a measured thickness of 365 19 9 60 μm increases in biofilm thickness with decreasing temperatures were also observed in nitrifying biofilms operating at low temperatures with increases of 54 in biofilm thickness between 20 c and 1 c 12 14 previous studies have stated that the overall lower metabolic activity of the biofilm allows for an increased substrate availability at lower biofilms depths and thus biofilm growth especially of filamentous bacteria and carbohydrate producers associated with increases in biofilm thickness 12 14 45 the nitrifying biofilm density is shown to decrease with exposure time at 1 c as a result of increasing biofilm thickness with no statistically significant change in biofilm mass being measured the lower biofilm densities with increased biofilm thicknesses are typical of filamentous and porous biofilm morphologies and a higher polysaccharides content within the biofilm as previously described in low temperature nitrifying mbbr systems 13 46 47 as mentioned above the biofilm responses in terms of density and decreasing temperatures support the biofilm response observed in low temperature nitrifying mbbr systems 12 14 48 49 3 3 biomass viability at low temperature the biomass viability as viable cells percentage of the total cells was assessed again at the temperatures of 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c fig 4 the biomass viability measured at 61 66 5 79 at 10 c increased to 85 67 4 96 at 4 c thus signifying an increase of 24 01 in viable cells above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c below 4 c lesser and non statistically significant increases in viable cells are recorded with the percentages of viable cells of 90 13 4 47 and 94 01 1 40 at 2 c and 1 c respectively the increase in biomass viability in the nitrifying biofilm at low temperatures correlate to the reported biomass response to low temperatures in nitrifying mbbr systems 12 14 an increase in cell viability at lower temperatures was previously attributed to an increase in substrate availability throughout the biofilm especially at lower levels of the biofilm as metabolic activities and thus the rate of substrate consummation of embedded cells decreases moreover the decrease in biofilm density also allows for an increase in substrate diffusion and an associated increase in substrate availability 12 14 50 3 4 microbiome response at low temperature the microbiome response was assessed the same as the biofilm and biomass at the temperatures of 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c the total number of estimated species measured as the α diversity at the initial stage of 10 c was 2532 78 61 with no statistically relevant changes recorded in the number of estimated species at 4 c 2 c at 1 c fig 5 a in particular no loss of diversity due to low temperatures occurred to justify the decline in nitrification efficiency between 4 c and 2 c interestingly the β diversity and principal coordinate analysis pcoa analysis demonstrate shifts in microbial communities with decreasing temperatures in the nitrifying biofilms fig 5b pcoa results indicate greater community shifts at temperatures occurring above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c while lesser microbial shifts occurred between 4 c and 2 c and below the kinetic threshold temperature between 2 c and 1 c as such these results suggest that the bulk of the nitrifying microbiome adaptions to low temperature is occurring above the kinetic threshold temperature correlating with the observed increases in biofilm thickness and biomass viability in the nitrifying biofilm above 4 c taxonomy assessment of the nitrifying biofilms indicates that the embedded bacteria of the nitrifying biofilms were predominantly mesophiles suggesting that little to no bacterial growth occurred between the low temperatures of 10 c and 1 c at the phylum level actinobacteria proteobacteria planctomycetes acidobacteria and chloroflexi represented the major phylum groups at 10 c 4 c 2 c and 1 c with respect to statistically relevant trends with decreasing temperatures the bulk of the microbiome shifts occur again above the kinetic threshold temperature or between 10 c and 4 c at which chloroflexi s relative abundance decreased while an increase of actinobacteria and proteobacteria was recorded at the family level roseiflexaceae caldilineaceae pirellulaceae rhodobacteracea planctomycetacea and an unidentified proteobacteria were identified as the major families while the minor families 5 were grouped under low abundance otus group fig 5c as such the 16 s sequencing results demonstrate that the dominant bacteria identified in the nitrifying biofilm between 10 c and 1 c are involved in the metabolism of polysaccharides and more importantly of amino acids crucial for the maintenance of the biofilm s structure and extracellular polymeric substances eps production thus indicating the capacity of the phylogenetically diverse nitrifying biofilm to mitigate the adverse effects of environmental stressors such as low temperatures on the biofilm integrity 49 51 56 for the statistically relevant changes with decreasing temperature the fraction of filamentous bacteria such as roseiflexaceae decreased by 17 25 above the kinetic threshold temperature with a percent abundance of 31 72 8 55 at 10 c and 14 47 1 92 at 4 c 57 58 despite this initial significant decrease in the fraction of filamentous bacteria roseiflexaceae remains unchanged below 4 c down to 1 c and remains one of the dominant bacteria in the biofilm which correlates with the thicker and less dense nitrifying biofilm observed above the nitrosomonas and nitrosovibrio genera from the nitrosomonadaceae family and the nitrospira genus from the nitrospiraceae family were the only aob and nob identified with relative abundances of 3 43 0 51 and 0 94 0 44 respectively at 10 c 14 30 59 60 although performing the metabolic process of interest aob and nob represent only a small fraction of the microbiome often demonstrated to be less than 12 of the species identified in low temperature nitrifying biofilms 12 14 the dna sequencing data indicates no statistically relevant changes in the relative abundance of aob between 10 c and 1 c while nob s percent abundance decreased above the kinetic threshold 4 c from 0 94 0 44 to 0 19 0 10 with no further statistically relevant changes below 4 c thus no changes in aob s percent abundance was recorded to justify the decline in nitrification efficiency between the kinetic threshold temperature moreover taking into account the observed increases in biofilm thickness increases in biomass viability and the relative abundance of nitrifiers in the biofilm the estimated aob per carrier aob carrier increases by 30 2 above the kinetic threshold temperature between 10 c and 4 c followed by a lesser increase 7 below the 2 c 12 14 as such these results identify the increase in estimated aob carrier within the nitrifying mbbr systems as a factor for the significant nitrification rates attained at low temperatures such as 1 c on the other hand the nob carrier decreases by 45 3 above the kinetic threshold temperature between 10 c and 4 c then increase by 5 9 between 4 c and 2 c and finally increased again by 7 1 between 2 c and 1 c a decrease in nob carrier above the kinetic threshold temperature is associated with the 66 decrease of the nitrospiraceae family s relative abundance between 10 c and 4 c in addition the decrease in the estimated nob carrier above 4 c correlates with the slight increase in nitrite accumulation in the bioreactors within the same temperature range recorded more specifically at 6 c the picrust metabolic pathway and genes function predictions of the biofilm with kegg indicate an upregulation of crucial functions above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c as displayed in fig 6 metabolic pathways and functional genes potential linked to eps production increased above 4 c such pathways are characterized by an increase in the relative abundance of predicted functional genes linked to biofilm formation such as rema associated with eps synthesis and carbohydrate binding along with several other metabolic pathways linked to carbohydrate and amino acids metabolisms 61 the predicted upregulation of idh and ccpa genes are also notable and essential to biofilms the ccpa gene encoding for the catabolite control protein a increases the gene expression of isocitrate dehydrogenase a crucial enzyme for polysaccharides intercellular adhesion pia and eps formation pathways 62 63 however it is worth noting the limitations of metabolic pathway predictions as the suppression of the relative functional potential of the citric acid cycle tca pathways linked to an upregulation of the ccpa gene was not observed above 4 c overall the functional genes potential changes above 4 c associated with the biofilm formation correlates with the observed increase in biofilm thickness and the large fraction of polysaccharides producing families such as the roseiflexaceae identified in the taxonomy results of the biofilms cell communication pathways in the biofilm associated with the quorum sensing are up regulated in the biofilm above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c characterized by the upregulation of relative potentials of genes such rpfb luxs and yajc 64 these genes are integral parts of the biofilm responses and adaptation mechanisms to environmental stressors such as temperatures that correlate with the greater microbial shifts measured observed only above 4 c by β diversity and pcoa analysis energy metabolism within the biofilm also increases above 4 c namely nitrogen metabolism pathways characterized by the two step nitrification process which correlates with the increase in estimated aob carriers within the reactors between 10 c and 4 c the observed nitrite accumulation above the kinetic threshold temperature at 6 c is linked according to picrust analysis to a down regulation of the nora and norb genes in the biofilm above 4 c this decrease in the functional potential of these genes encoding for the two subunits of the nitrite oxidoreductase is the only pathway down regulated and associated with the nitratation reaction above 4 c 65 in addition a similar pattern is observed for the carbon fixation potential within the biofilm or the co2 utilization mediated by autotroph such as the nitrifiers within the biofilm metabolic activities linked to genetic information processing demonstrate an upregulation above 4 c correlating with the observed increase in cell viability between 10 c and 4 c within the biofilm also correlating with the increase in viable cells in the biofilm is the increases of mechanisms linked to biofilm growth mechanisms stress response pathways protecting the dna characterized by genes such as dps shielding the dna from dnase activities btue and trxa mitigating oxidative stress 66 67 other notable functional characteristics in the biofilm are the cell motility mechanisms characterized for instance by the mtor pathways did not increase suggesting that biofilm remains stable above 4 c amino acids lipids and carbohydrates biosynthesis linked to biofilm and eps integrity 68 71 4 conclusion the biofilms biomass and microbiome of attached growth systems were investigated between the temperatures of 10 c and 1 c in nitrifying mbbr systems fed with real wastewater and operated at decreasing temperatures in a temperature controlled chamber the kinetic threshold temperature characterized by a significant decline of 22 47 in attached growth nitrification efficiency was delineated between the temperatures of 4 c and 2 c above which the bulk of the biofilm biomass and microbiome acclimatization to low temperature occurred taxonomy assessment indicated no statistically relevant changes in the relative abundance of aob mediating the rate limiting step of the nitrification process between 10 c and 1 c as such the decline of 22 47 in nitrification efficiency between 4 c and 2 c is associated with a decrease in aob s metabolic activities due to low temperatures in contrast nob s relative abundance decreased above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c which correlates with a recorded increase in nitrite accumulation in the bioreactors at 6 c the nitrifying biofilm increased in thickness and decreased in density above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c correlating with the dominant filamentous bacteria identified in the biofilm and the predicted upregulation of metabolic pathways associated with biofilm and eps formation similarly the biofilm displayed a greater increase in biomass viability above 4 c an increase in cell viability may be linked to an increase in substrate availability and diffusion throughout the biofilm linked to the lower cellular activity of the embedded bacteria and an increase in membrane rigidity at low temperatures moreover in predicted metabolic pathways apoptosis was down regulated while cell growth transcription and translation were up regulated in the biofilm above 4 c the β diversity analysis indicates that the biofilm undergoes greater microbial shifts above 4 c as well correlating with the predicted upregulation of key metabolic pathways such as those associated with quorum sensing the estimate of nitrifiers carrier accounting for the increases in biofilm thickness and biomass viability increases significantly above the kinetic threshold temperature 4 c followed by lesser increases down to 1 c the sum of these observations indicates that the adaptation of nitrifying biofilms to low temperatures occurs above 4 c preceding the low temperature induced non linear decline in nitrification efficiency these responses to low temperatures in nitrifying mbbr systems along with their capacity to retain slow growing bacteria inherent to biofilm technologies allow these systems to maintain significant nitrification rates at temperatures as low as 1 c

13734,dye pollution in the aquatic environment is one of the main environmental and public health issue nowadays biosorptive removal of such dyes by biocomposite materials have recently emerged a good potential for this purpose a novel microbial cell immobilized platanus orientalis leaf tissue nspol was prepared through a passive immobilization in this study its bioremoval potential was

media possible mechanism for biosorptive dye removal may be h bonding π π and electrostatic interactions keywords biosorption breakthrough immobilization platanus orientalis reactive red 198 reactive yellow 2 1 introduction dyes are common constituents of wastewaters originating from various industrial processes including textile dyeing paper pulp tannery paint and dye manufacturing dye contaminated effluents can lead to significant impact in the aquatic environment because they prevents the sunlight penetration and oxygen solubility in addition these recalcitrant organic pollutants are usually considered to be toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic in nature hence treatment of the colored effluents and recycling of water can play an important role in reducing environmental pollution and providing reusable processing water different approaches have been made by researchers to develop effective and economic treatment methods 1 5 in this context the use of biomaterial based technology named as biosorption is noteworthy due to its low cost effectiveness and applicability biosorption is a physicochemical process based on the interaction of pollutant and functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl phosphoryl and amine present on the biomaterial surface biomaterials obtained from different sources provide a discrepancy to the physicochemical properties 6 7 besides as the biomass surface plays an important role in the biosorptive purification process physical and chemical surface modifications can greatly alter the biosorption potential in the case of large scale application of biosorption process immobilization of the biosorbent materials is a better choice than the free biosorbents because the immobilized biosorbents have some potential advanteges such as good mechanical strength appropriate size easier separation and regeneration for dynamic flow mode treatment process 8 9 in recent years many different natural and synthetic materials including carboxylmethylcellulose 10 alginate 11 14 sol gel silica 15 amberlite 16 loofa sponge 17 brewer s spent grain 8 and so on have been tested as immobilization matrix hovewer an economic efficient regenerable and environmentally friendly matrix is still to be found 17 in the current study the green waste platanus orientalis leaves was chosen as biomatrix for the microbial immobilization process platanus orientalis is a deciduous perennial tree widely grown in different regions of the world 18 there is a number of literature reports on the use of platanus leaves in traditional medicine 19 23 furthermore it has been reported that biomass obtained from p orientalis was used for removal of metyhlene blue 24 copper 25 lantanium cerium 26 cadmium 27 zirconium and hafnium 28 ions from water however no research article found in the literature concerning the use of waste biomass of p orientalis as a biomatrix for the immobilization of microbial cells in the present investigation an environmentally friendly new biocomposite material was developed by immobilization of the neurospora sitophila n sitophilia ns cells on the biomatix of p orientalis leaves pol for the first time and employed to decolorization of dye contaminated solutions reactive yellow 2 ry2 and reactive red 198 rr198 were chosen as target dyestuffs from the azo dyes commonly used in industry to the best of our knowledge up to date there are no studies available in the literature regarding the biodecolorization potential of this biomaterial biocecolorization characteristics of the new immobilized biomaterial nspol were thoroughly examined through batch and dynamic flow experiments the impacts of operational conditions were determined for batch and continuous mode removal processes analyze and modeling of the kinetic data is important to explain the relationship between each dye component and the biosorbent and to determine the kinetic transport mechanism that controls the biosorption mechanism the isotherm study and modeling provides information on the biosorbent amount required to remove a unit of pollutant mass and how dyes interact with biosorbents isotherms and kinetics of the ry2 and rr198 biosorption were analyzed for immobilized biomaterial in addiditon to breakthrough curve analysis regeneration and reusability properties of immobilized biomaterial and biosorption mechanisms were analyzed ultimately the applicability of the suggested biomaterial to remove target dyes from compex matrices was affirmed by the real wastewater treatment studies in batch

colleced from the garden of the meşelik campus of eskişehir osmangazi university eskişehir turkey in december 2018 pols were washed with tap water followed by deionized water to remove impurities and dust clean leaves were oven dried at 60oc for 12 h then they were crushed and ground to prepare powder form by laboratory grinder sieved to select particle size of 200 μm and used as biomatrix material without any modification the sterilized liquid growth media 29 at 121 c was used for the biomass production of n sitophila at 120 rpm and 26oc in order to prepare immobilized biosorbent 1 g

cells and kept in temperature controlled orbital shaker gerhardt thermoshake incubator shaker for 1 week for the production of immobilized biomass nspol this biomass production procedure but without matrix material pol was followed for the production of free form of biomass ns after the biomass production period biomasses were harvested from the growth medium by filtration the aforementioned drying milling and sieving steps were applied separately to free ns and immobilized biomass nspol 2 2 biosorption trials in batch and continuous modes the biomaterials were exposed to 25 ml of specified dye solution at 25 c in the batch mode biosorptive decolorization trials the stirring speed was fixed at 200 rpm using a multipoint magnetic stirrer thermo variomag poly 15 in the first stage of the experiments the biosorptive decolorization potentials of matrix material free and immobilized forms of biomaterials were measured at different biomaterial amounts from 0 4 to 4 8 g l 1 and initial ph values from 2 0 9 0 to compare their biosorption potentials decolorization kinetics of the immobilized biomaterial was examined in the time range of 5 90 min concentration of 100 mg l 1 using optimum ph values and biosorbent amounts for both dyes in the isotherm studies initial rr198 and ry2 concentrations were changed from 2 6 10 6 to 3 5 10 4 mol l 1 50 500 mg l 1 and 5 1 10 6 to 2 3 10 4mol l 1 100 400 mg l 1 respectively real wastewater applications were carried out using optimum ph values and biosorbent amount on batch mode systems for two dyes the concentrations of dyes in the supernatant were measured in a polyethylene cuvette by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 at maximum absorbance of dyes at specied wavelenghts λmax 404 nm for ry2 and λmax 512 nm for rr198 concentration range of calibration curve was 1 50 mg l 1 1 15 10 6 to 5 73 10 5 mol l 1 and 1 35 mg l 1 1 02 10 6 to 3 56 10 5 mol l 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively spectral slit width was fixed to 2 0 nm the amount of ry2 and rr198 biosorbed onto imobilized biosorbent at equilibrium q e mg g 1 was calculated by eq 1 1 q e c o c e m v and to determine the percent dye removal eq 2 was

columns packed with the optimum amount of biosorbent regeneration of immobilized sorbent and recovery of dye was investigated by using naoh 0 01 mol l 1 solutions as eluent the regenerated material was washed with distilled water and reused the cycle of decolorization desorption was repeated five times to confirm the reusability for decolorization all the dynamic flow studies were performed under the down flow mode effluents were collected periodically from the exit of the biosorption column and analyzed for final dye concentrations a constant flow of dye solutions in the columns was provided by peristaltic pump ismatec ip 8 2 3 biosorption kinetics in order to reveal the possible kinetic mechanism of ry2 and rr198 two well known kinetic models namely lagergren s first order 30

loading per unit mass of nspol at time t min and equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are biosorption rate constant for lagergren s first order and pseudo second order models respectively 2 4 biosorption isotherms in order to analyze the correlation between the concentrations of dye molecules on the biosorbent surface and in the liquid phase langmuir eq 5 32 freundlich eq

mol g 1 mol l 1 1 n is freundlich isotherm constant and 1 n dimensionless is heterogenity factor qm is the biosorption capacity mol g 1 and β mol2 kj 2 is the d r model constant related to the biosorption energy the mean biosorption free energy e kj mol 1 of the d r model can be determined using eq 8 langmuir isotherm model assumes that sorption reaction occurs at specific homogeneous binding sites the energy of these sites is equal to each other in relation to the sorption process and there is no interaction between sorbate molecules 32 freundlich isotherm is an earliest known empirical model which assumes heterogeneous sorption surface and energetically different binding sites 33 the d r isotherm model is generally used to predict the type of sorption mechanism physical or chemical by means of mean sorption energy 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 biosorbent amount ph effect and wastewater application on the decolorization the results of the influence of sorbent amount on the decolarization obtained in this study are shown in fig 1 the biosorption yield sorbent amount profile of free and immobilized material and immobilization support was investigated by changing the biomass amount from 0 4 to 4 0 g l 1 under the conditions of ph 2 0 and contact time 60 min as shown in fig 1 it is indicated that biosorption yield of these materials significantly depend on biomass amount the dye removal efficiencies of all studied biomaterials firstly increased with increasing amount of biomass and then remained constant after certain values this observations are consistent with the findings of kara et al 35 akar et al 36 daneshvarand et al 37 and rangabhashiyam et al 38 free form of biomass had a biosorption yield of 96 33 and 95 33 for ry2 and rr198 respectively the respective values for immobilized biosorbent were 93 79 and 96 15 and for the support material were only 12 00 and 29 07 for both dyes free and immobilized biomasses exhibited similar biosorption yields the free biosorbent reached the highest biosorption yields with 0 8 g l 1 sorbent amount for ry2 and 0 6 g l 1 sorbent amount for rr198 the respective values for immobilized biosorbent were 3 2 g l 1 and 4 0 g l 1 the maximum biosorption yield of n sitophila biomass in free form is slightly higher than that of the immobilized biosorbent however this difference is not statistically significant p 0 05 on the other hand the use of an immobilized material in the biosorption process offers significant advantages such as process economy and effective regeneration therefore a dose of 3 2 and 4 0 g l 1 of immobilized biosorbent was selected for subsequent treatment of ry2 and rr198 contaminations respectively immobilized cells exhibited their maximum biosorptive decolorization yields at ph 2 0 and for higher ph values biosorption yields significantly decreases p 0 05 for both dyes fig 2 similar changes in the biosorption yield as a function of initial ph values have been reported on the biosorption of different textile dyes onto to biosorbent materials 3 39 the observation of maximum biosorption efficiency under acidic conditions ph 2 0 could be attributed to the electrostatic attractive forces between anionic molecular structure of dyes ry2 and rr198 and protonated active sites present on the immobilized biosorbent surface with increasing ph the number of protonated binding sites on immobilized biomaterial surface decreased while that of negatively charged binding sites increased this change can be explained by deprotonation occur on the biomaterial surface with increasing ph it should be noted that no color change of the rr198 and ry2 dyes was observed when the ph value of solutions adjusted between ph 2 0 and 9 0 also no difference was observed when the uv spectra of the dye solutions recorded in this ph range were compared individually fig 3 zeta potential analysis of the nspol was also confirmed the optimum ph value for the biosorption of these dyes the isoelectric point of nspol was recorded as 2 4 fig 4 at a ph lower than the isoelectric point the high concentration of protons in the medium creates an intense positive surface charge on the nspol surface therefore anionic dye molecules can easily interact with positively charged biomaterial surface when compared the zeta potential values of nspol fig 4 recorded in water and dye solutions more negative surface charges are clearly seen after ry2 and rr198 biosorption for nspol surface at all ph values studied shifting surface charge of nspol to lower values in dye solutions is a notable marker for the interaction between these reactive dyes and nspol real wastewater treatment performance of suggested biomaterial was also tested in this study chemical composition of this real wastewater sample provided from the organized industrial area of eskişehir turkey was given in table 1 the biosorption yield of nspol in real wastewater spiked with 100 mg l 1 of dye at optimised batch biosorption conditions was 91 52 and 89 90 for ry2 and rr198 respectively this result demonstrates the potential of suggested biosorbent in real application 3 2 decolorization kinetics and equilibrium isotherms kinetic parameters are essential to obtain information on modeling of the biosorptive decolorization process and estimate the decolorization rate fig 5 shows the decolorization kinetics of ry2 and rr198 by nspol it can be seen that at the begining of the process the decolorization was very fast for both dye and it proceeds at a relatively slower rate and reached an equilibrium approxiamtely at 60 min the initial rapid decolorization phase may be explained by the abundance of the vacant biosorption sites at the initial stage the decrease in the rate of biosorption over the time and the equilibrium of the decolorization process are related to the occupying of these sites with dye molecules in order to evaluate the mechanisms of the biosorption of ry2 and rr198 dyes onto nspol the lagergren s first order 30 and the pseudo second order 31 kinetic models were considered and the results obtained from these models at various contact times 5 90 min was given in table 2 compared to the case with the coefficient of determination values r 2 of the investigated models the experimental data for the ry2 and rr198 biosorption by nspol were better fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model the biosorption capacity values q e calculated by this model were also close to those acquired by experiments 27 74 and 23 65 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively thus these findings suggest that the rate limiting step of the decoloriazation might be chemical sorption which involves exchanging or sharing of electrons between nspol and dye molecules the general experimental isotherms for the biosorption of ry2 and rr198 onto nspol are presentes in fig 6 isotherm model parameters and the quality of fitting in terms of coefficient of determination values are presented on table 3 non linear regression analysis was used to estimation of these parameters according to coeefficient of determination values given in this table the isotherms appeared to follow the langmuir model more closely than the other models for both dyes this finding indicating the monolayer coveage of nspol surface by ry2 and rr198 molecules in this model the maximum biosorption capacity values of ry2 and rr198 were corresponding to 51 12 and 37 59 mg g 1 respectively these values are consistent with the investigational experimental values among the studied isotherm models the d r model has a relatively high r 2 and f value after the langmuir model the calculated average energy e values of the biosorption for both dyes were in the 8 16 kj mol 1 range indicating that chemical ion exchange may also be involved in the decolorization of the dyes 34 reactive dye biosorption capacities of different types of materials biomaterials reported in the literature are summarized in table 4 because of the differences in experimental conditions it is generally difficult to directly compare the decolorization capacities of biomaterials however in order to provide an idea about the biosorption potential of nspol this comparison was made table 4 shows that the data of ry2 and rr198 biosorption per unit mass of nspol were comparable to the reported values those of many corresponding sorbents so nspol can be evaluated as a valuable biomaterial for the effective treatment of reactive dye contamination 3 3 continuous mode decolorization studies although the findings of the batch biosorption tests are provided basic information about the sorbent behavior and biosorption performance dynamic flow mode water treatment studies have a special role in evaluating the technical feasibility of process for large scale industrial treatment applications in this context packed bed columns have been established as an economical effective and most convenient for biosorptive treatment it allows more efficiently sorption capacity of a biomaterial also packed bed sorption is simple to operate attains a high yield and it can be easily scaled up from laboratory scale procedure 49 50 to further show the potentiality of this new immobilized biomaterial with relatively high biosorption capacity column biosorption experiments were undertaken to explore the biosorption performance under dynamic flow conditions according to the results of batch mode experiments continuous mode biosorption in fixed bed columns packed with immobilized biosorbent was conducted at ph 2 0 and 100 mg l 1 dye concentrations fig 7 a illustrates the decolorization yields of nspol for varying biomass dosages the biosorption yields of nspol were increased for both dyes with increasing amounts of biomass packed into columns up to a certain value due to increased bed depth and binding sites subsequently no significant change in the biosorption yield of nspol was observed for both dyes due to the saturation of dye binding sites present on the nspol surface p 0 05 therefore 0 1 and 0 25 g of nspol were regarded as the optimum immobilized biomaterial amount for the maximum ry2 and rr198 removal in dynamic flow mode treatment studies this biosorption tendency is also consistent with that in batch mode experiments fig 7b illustrates the flow rate dependent behavior of the decolarization process increasing flow rate from 0 5 6 0 ml min 1 did not cause a significant change in the percentage dye biosorption yield of nspol 98 0 for both dyes column studies have shown that the proposed biosorbent material as column filler has a very high decolorization yields even in relatively low amounts these findings can be considered as important advantages for the use of nspol in practical applications 3 4 breakthrough curve analysis in order to further verify that the prepared biosorbent is effective in the continuous system as well as in the batch system breakthrough curve obtained by c t c o plotting against flow time t fig 8 the amount of biosorbent bed depth influent dye concentration and flow rate was 0 25 g 1 0 cm 100 mg l 1 and 1 ml min 1 in this study when the plot is examined effective biosorption observed till the breakthrough time t b 35 and 51 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively and slope of the curve was decreased after the exhaustion time t e 227 and 264 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively calculated column parameters was given in table 5 the volume of treated dye v eff can be calculated via eq 9 51 9 v e f f f t e where f and t e represents the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and exhaustion time min respectively the area under the breakthrough curve attained by integrating biosorbed dye concentration c o c e plotted against dye volume v to calculate ry2 and rr198 biosorption capacity at breakthrough point q b and exhaustion time q e by eq 10 and 11 respectively adsorbed dye uptake m ad total dye uptake m total

100 where c o and c t are influent and effluent concentration mg l 1 v b and v e are dye volume passed until breakthrough and exhaustion volume l and m is mass of biosorbent g respectively mass transfer zone lenght z m can be calculated from eq 15 15 z m l 1 t b t e where l is bed depth cm t b and t e represent breakthrough and exhaustion time min respectively bohart adams 54 thomas 55 and yoon nelson 56 models were common models for kinetic studies of column modeling however these three models are similar and may be regarded as mathematically equivalent and expressed by a following simplistic equation eq 16 57 16 c t c o 1 1 e x p a b t where a equals to k ba n o l u k t q t m f and k ynτ b equals to k ba c o k t c o and k yn for bohart adams b a thomas and yoon nelson y n

coefficients from simplistic equation are presented in table 5 the adjusted correlation coefficient r 2 adj close to 1 low reduced chi squared χ2 value and high f value indicates a good fit of the experimental breakthrough data to the model high exhaustion capacity values from breakthrough curve 41 94 and 50 09 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively and thomas model 46 45 and 50 92 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively indicates nspol may be used effectively in the continuous system the maximum capacity values obtained in the batch system 51 12 and 37 59 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively were also compatible with the continuous system experimental findings on the curve 114 0 and 120 0 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively were compatible with τ 121 6 and 125 3 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively these results indicate nspol may be useful in both batch and continuous system and suitable for large scale studies aimed at removing reactive dye contamination from aquatic media 3 5 regeneration and reuse of biosorption columns adaptation of a sorbent material to real water treatment systems may require its high regeneration potential in order to recover the dyes and reuse the biomaterial also the reutilization of a biomaterial in consecutive sorption cycles reduces the cost of the treatment process and minimizes the waste generation related to the disposal of biomaterial 58 the variation of the recovery yields of ry2 and rr198 from nspol using 0 01 m naoh as eluent within 5 cycles in continuous mode are shown in fig 9 the findings indicateded that nspol could be used for 5 cycles of rr198 biosorption with around 78 decrease in its sorption yield on the other hand even at the end of the 5th cycle nspol showed a desorption efficiency higher than 50 in case of the ry2 dye over 98 of the biosorption yield of nspol remained after 5 biosorption desorption cycles moreover its desorption yields were higher than 98 during 5 cycles which suggests a good reusability of nspol the recovery of the dyes using naoh after adsorption by nspol may be explained by exchange of the counterions and deprotonation of the protonated groups on the surface and then dissolving in naoh the recycle decolorization potential of nspol to be used repeatedly for 5 rounds without losing too much of its biosoption ability especially for ry2 is a very important advantage in terms of usability in large scale industrial treatment studies and economic value of the biosorbent 3 6 characterization studies sem images showing the nspol a ry2 loaded nspol b and rr198 loaded nspol c morphology are illustrated in fig 10 the images revealed that nspol has a heteregenous surface structure composed of several cavities bumps and grooves this surface characteristics of the developed immobilized biomaterial might allow the easily impregnation of the dye molecules into biomaterial surface and and interact therein with the dye binding sites the sem micrographs of nspol loaded with ry2 and rr198 were rather a tighter and smooth surface this finding has been confirmed the coverage of the immobilized biomaterial surface by dyes like a molecular cloud the ir spectra of nspol before and after decolorization process are presented in fig 11 the bands at 3420 corresponds to oh and nh stretching vibrations on nspol powder the absorption bands at 1628 1518 cm 1 were assigned to co amid and cn stretching vibrations respectively the stretching vibration of co were located at 1315 and 1244 cm 1 the absorption bands at 2922 and 2852 cm 1 are attributed to ch3 and ch2 stretching vibrations bending vibrations of ch3 and ch2 groups are observed about 1448 and 1378 cm 1 the bands at 1244 and 1039 cm 1 denoted the po and po stretching vibrations respectively ir spectral analysis after rr198 and ry2 biosorption showed that there was a slight decrease in the intensity of the stretching of the oh and nh bond from 3420 cm 1 for unloaded nspol to 3425 cm 1 for ry2 loaded nspol also the intensities of the bands at 1628 and 1315 cm 1 on the nspol surface slightly decreased after ry2 and rr198 biosorption a new peak at 1550 cm 1 appeared after ry2 biosorption which could be ascribed to the aromatic cc stretching vibration of the ry2 dyestuff that covers the surface of the biomass the band at 1244 cm 1 was shifted to 1233 cm 1 for ry2 loaded nspol and was not changed for rr198 loaded nspol similar change was observed for the peak at 1146 cm 1 it was shifted to 1157 and 1155 cm 1 respectively for ry2 and rr198 loaded nspol finally the intensity of peak at 1039 cm 1 was found to decrease after the rr198 biosorption these observations indicates that the mentioned functional were likely responsible for the decolorization of these target reactive dyes according to characterization analysis along with the biosorption experiments it was possible to identify the target dyes immobilized biosorbent interactions as well as the mechanisms involved in the decolorization process the possible mechanisms as well as the molecular interactions involved in the biosorption of rr198 and ry2 dyes onto nspol were presented in fig 12 depending on the on the chemical structures of the biomaterial surface rr198 and ry2 dyes and the studied ph condition that leads to a positively charged biomaterial surface it was thought that monolayer biosorption could occur synergistically based on electrostatic π π and hydrogen bond interactions similar dye biosorbent interaction mechanisms were also reported by scheufele et al 59 3 7 cost estimation of nspol production the commercial implementation of removing pollutants from the contaminated waters with the sorption technique is highly dependent on the sorbent production cost this study of the biosorptive removal of ry2 and rr198 dyes focuses on the use of a new biosorbent nspol the lack of procurement cost for pol an immobilization martix material and the utilization of this waste are two important factors that govern the sorbent selection in our study parameters such as biosorbent preparation and reusability play a decisive role in the total cost of biosorbent the overall expenditure per unit amount of biosorbent therefore affects its use on a commercial level the cost of preparing 100 g nspol including raw material electricity and all chemical costs was estimated at 7 062 the regeneration cost of the produced sorbate was also similarly estimated as 0 0041 considering the current commercial activated carbon prices the cost estimate of nspol production shows that the proposed adsorbent preparation is a cost effective process furthermore the good decolorization yields of nspol for ry2 and rr198 dyes and its regenerationability make it more efficient economical and feasible for practical application 4 conclusions in this study n sitophilia cells were pasively immobilized on p oreantalis leaf tissue exhibited a good potential to removal of ry2 and rr198 based on the biosorption decolarization the biodecolarization yield attained over 90 both of batch and continuous modes for target dyes biosorption data comformed to pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm model nspol dye bioremoval mechanism was explicated by sem ir and zeta potential analysis regeneration experiments showed that nspol was kept on reusability performance during five cycles overall because the immobilized biodecolarization agent can be prepared from using p orentalis leaves as lignocellulosic matrix that are abundant it can be used as a promising low cost and ecofriendly

13734,dye pollution in the aquatic environment is one of the main environmental and public health issue nowadays biosorptive removal of such dyes by biocomposite materials have recently emerged a good potential for this purpose a novel microbial cell immobilized platanus orientalis leaf tissue nspol was prepared through a passive immobilization in this study its bioremoval potential was investigated for reactive red 198 rr198 and reactive yellow 2 ry2 dyes at different conditions including ph biomaterial dosage contact time and flow rate biosorption of rr198 and ry2 by nspol was found to be a fast process biosorption data were well predicted with the pseudo second order kinetic model for both dyes decolorization patterns fitted well with langmuir isotherm model maximum monolayer biosorption capacities were recorded as 51 12 and 37 59 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively ir and sem analysis revealed the biosorption of dyes onto biocomposite regeneration experiments showed that the biosorption performance of nspol was consistent towards rr198 and ry2 removal upto 5 recycles after 5 biosorption desorption cycles the regeneration efficiency of nspol was still higher than 98 for ry2 dye overall batch and column studies indicated that suggested biocomposite may be a good and economic alternative for the removal of reactive azo dye contamination from aquatic media possible mechanism for biosorptive dye removal may be h bonding π π and electrostatic interactions keywords biosorption breakthrough immobilization platanus orientalis reactive red 198 reactive yellow 2 1 introduction dyes are common constituents of wastewaters originating from various industrial processes including textile dyeing paper pulp tannery paint and dye manufacturing dye contaminated effluents can lead to significant impact in the aquatic environment because they prevents the sunlight penetration and oxygen solubility in addition these recalcitrant organic pollutants are usually considered to be toxic mutagenic and carcinogenic in nature hence treatment of the colored effluents and recycling of water can play an important role in reducing environmental pollution and providing reusable processing water different approaches have been made by researchers to develop effective and economic treatment methods 1 5 in this context the use of biomaterial based technology named as biosorption is noteworthy due to its low cost effectiveness and applicability biosorption is a physicochemical process based on the interaction of pollutant and functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl phosphoryl and amine present on the biomaterial surface biomaterials obtained from different sources provide a discrepancy to the physicochemical properties 6 7 besides as the biomass surface plays an important role in the biosorptive purification process physical and chemical surface modifications can greatly alter the biosorption potential in the case of large scale application of biosorption process immobilization of the biosorbent materials is a better choice than the free biosorbents because the immobilized biosorbents have some potential advanteges such as good mechanical strength appropriate size easier separation and regeneration for dynamic flow mode treatment process 8 9 in recent years many different natural and synthetic materials including carboxylmethylcellulose 10 alginate 11 14 sol gel silica 15 amberlite 16 loofa sponge 17 brewer s spent grain 8 and so on have been tested as immobilization matrix hovewer an economic efficient regenerable and environmentally friendly matrix is still to be found 17 in the current study the green waste platanus orientalis leaves was chosen as biomatrix for the microbial immobilization process platanus orientalis is a deciduous perennial tree widely grown in different regions of the world 18 there is a number of literature reports on the use of platanus leaves in traditional medicine 19 23 furthermore it has been reported that biomass obtained from p orientalis was used for removal of metyhlene blue 24 copper 25 lantanium cerium 26 cadmium 27 zirconium and hafnium 28 ions from water however no research article found in the literature concerning the use of waste biomass of p orientalis as a biomatrix for the immobilization of microbial cells in the present investigation an environmentally friendly new biocomposite material was developed by immobilization of the neurospora sitophila n sitophilia ns cells on the biomatix of p orientalis leaves pol for the first time and employed to decolorization of dye contaminated solutions reactive yellow 2 ry2 and reactive red 198 rr198 were chosen as target dyestuffs from the azo dyes commonly used in industry to the best of our knowledge up to date there are no studies available in the literature regarding the biodecolorization potential of this biomaterial biocecolorization characteristics of the new immobilized biomaterial nspol were thoroughly examined through batch and dynamic flow experiments the impacts of operational conditions were determined for batch and continuous mode removal processes analyze and modeling of the kinetic data is important to explain the relationship between each dye component and the biosorbent and to determine the kinetic transport mechanism that controls the biosorption mechanism the isotherm study and modeling provides information on the biosorbent amount required to remove a unit of pollutant mass and how dyes interact with biosorbents isotherms and kinetics of the ry2 and rr198 biosorption were analyzed for immobilized biomaterial in addiditon to breakthrough curve analysis regeneration and reusability properties of immobilized biomaterial and biosorption mechanisms were analyzed ultimately the applicability of the suggested biomaterial to remove target dyes from compex matrices was affirmed by the real wastewater treatment studies in batch mode 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactive dye solutions and biomaterial preparation reactive yellow 2 ry2 fw 872 97 g mol 1 and reactive red 198 rr198 fw 984 2 g mol 1 used in this study were of

colleced from the garden of the meşelik campus of eskişehir osmangazi university eskişehir turkey in december 2018 pols were washed with tap water followed by deionized water to remove impurities and dust clean leaves were oven dried at 60oc for 12 h then they were crushed and ground to prepare powder form by laboratory grinder sieved to select particle size of 200 μm and used as biomatrix material without any modification the sterilized liquid growth media 29 at 121 c was used for the biomass production of n sitophila at 120 rpm and 26oc in order to prepare immobilized biosorbent 1 g of pol was added to the growth medium in the flasks prior to sterilization step each growth medium 100 ml in erlenmeyer flasks 250 ml was inoculated with the 1 ml of the spor suspension of n sitophila cells and kept in temperature controlled orbital shaker gerhardt thermoshake incubator shaker for 1 week for the production of immobilized biomass nspol this biomass production procedure but without matrix material pol was followed for the production of free form of biomass ns after the biomass production period biomasses were harvested from the growth medium by filtration the aforementioned drying milling and sieving steps were applied separately to free ns and immobilized biomass nspol 2 2 biosorption trials in batch and continuous modes the biomaterials were exposed to 25 ml of specified dye solution at 25 c in the batch mode biosorptive decolorization trials the stirring speed was fixed at 200 rpm using a multipoint magnetic stirrer thermo variomag poly 15 in the first stage of the experiments the biosorptive decolorization potentials of matrix material free and immobilized forms of biomaterials were measured at different biomaterial amounts from 0 4 to 4 8 g l 1 and initial ph values from 2 0 9 0 to compare their biosorption potentials decolorization kinetics of the immobilized biomaterial was examined in the time range of 5 90 min concentration of 100 mg l 1 using optimum ph values and biosorbent amounts for both dyes in the isotherm studies initial rr198 and ry2 concentrations were changed from 2 6 10 6 to 3 5 10 4 mol l 1 50 500 mg l 1 and 5 1 10 6 to 2 3 10 4mol l 1 100 400 mg l 1 respectively real wastewater applications were carried out using optimum ph values and biosorbent amount on batch mode systems for two dyes the concentrations of dyes in the supernatant were measured in a polyethylene cuvette by a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2550 at maximum absorbance of dyes at specied wavelenghts λmax 404 nm for ry2 and λmax 512 nm for rr198 concentration range of calibration curve was 1 50 mg l 1 1 15 10 6 to 5 73 10 5 mol l 1 and 1 35 mg l 1 1 02 10 6 to 3 56 10 5 mol l 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively spectral slit width was fixed to 2 0 nm the amount of ry2 and rr198 biosorbed onto imobilized biosorbent at equilibrium q e mg g 1 was calculated by eq 1 1 q e c o c e m v and to determine the percent dye removal eq 2 was used 2 removal c o c e c o 100 where q e biosorbed dye amount mg by immobilized sorbent mass g c e dye concentration at equilibrium mg l 1 c 0 initial dye concentration mg l 1 v volume of the dye solutions l m biosorbent dry weight g used in the decolorization column decolorization tests were conducted using cylindrical glass columns 1 0 cm inside diameter the columns were packed with 0 05 0 08 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 25 and 0 3 g of immobilized biomass to determine the optimum biosorbent amount in continuous mode then the flow rate parameter was examined between 0 5 and 6 0 ml min 1 in fixed bed columns packed with the optimum amount of biosorbent regeneration of immobilized sorbent and recovery of dye was investigated by using naoh 0 01 mol l 1 solutions as eluent the regenerated material was washed with distilled water and reused the cycle of decolorization desorption was repeated five times to confirm the reusability for decolorization all the dynamic flow studies were performed under the down flow mode effluents were collected periodically from the exit of the biosorption column and analyzed for final dye concentrations a constant flow of dye solutions in the columns was provided by peristaltic pump ismatec ip 8 2 3 biosorption kinetics in order to reveal the possible kinetic mechanism of ry2 and rr198 two well known kinetic models namely lagergren s first order 30 and pseudo second order models 31 were fitted to experimental biosorption data by eq 3 and 4 respectively 3 q t q e e k 1 t 4 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e 2 t where q t mg g 1 and q e mg g 1 are is dye loading per unit mass of nspol at time t min and equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 are biosorption rate constant for lagergren s first order and pseudo second order models respectively 2 4 biosorption isotherms in order to analyze the correlation between the concentrations of dye molecules on the biosorbent surface and in the liquid phase langmuir eq 5 32 freundlich eq 6 33 and dubinin raduhkevich d r eq 7 34 models were applied to experimental data 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n 7 q e q m exp β ε 2 8 e 1 2 β 1 2 where c e mol l 1 q e mol g 1 and q

mol g 1 mol l 1 1 n is freundlich isotherm constant and 1 n dimensionless is heterogenity factor qm is the biosorption capacity mol g 1 and β mol2 kj 2 is the d r model constant related to the biosorption energy the mean biosorption free energy e kj mol 1 of the d r model can be determined using eq 8 langmuir isotherm model assumes that sorption reaction occurs at specific homogeneous binding sites the energy of these sites is equal to each other in relation to the sorption process and there is no interaction between sorbate molecules 32 freundlich isotherm is an earliest known empirical model which assumes heterogeneous sorption surface and energetically different binding sites 33 the d r isotherm model is generally used to predict the type of sorption mechanism physical or chemical by means of mean sorption energy 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 biosorbent amount ph effect and wastewater application on the decolorization the results of the influence of sorbent amount on the decolarization obtained in this study are shown in fig 1 the biosorption yield sorbent amount profile of free and immobilized material and immobilization support was investigated by changing the biomass amount from 0 4 to 4 0 g l 1 under the conditions of ph 2 0 and contact time 60 min as shown in fig 1 it is indicated that biosorption yield of these materials significantly depend on biomass amount the dye removal efficiencies of all studied biomaterials firstly increased with increasing amount of biomass and then remained constant after certain values this observations are consistent with the findings of kara et al 35 akar et al 36 daneshvarand et al 37 and rangabhashiyam et al 38 free form of biomass had a biosorption yield of 96 33 and 95 33 for ry2 and rr198 respectively the respective values for immobilized biosorbent were 93 79 and 96 15 and for the support material were only 12 00 and 29 07 for both dyes free and immobilized biomasses exhibited similar biosorption yields the free biosorbent reached the highest biosorption yields with 0 8 g l 1 sorbent amount for ry2 and 0 6 g l 1 sorbent amount for rr198 the respective values for immobilized biosorbent were 3 2 g l 1 and 4 0 g l 1 the maximum biosorption yield of n sitophila biomass in free form is slightly higher than that of the immobilized biosorbent however this difference is not statistically significant p 0 05 on the other hand the use of an immobilized material in the biosorption process offers significant advantages such as process economy and effective regeneration therefore a dose of 3 2 and 4 0 g l 1 of immobilized biosorbent was selected for subsequent treatment of ry2 and rr198 contaminations respectively immobilized cells exhibited their maximum biosorptive decolorization yields at ph 2 0 and for higher ph values biosorption yields significantly decreases p 0 05 for both dyes fig 2 similar changes in the biosorption yield as a function of initial ph values have been reported on the biosorption of different textile dyes onto to biosorbent materials 3 39 the observation of maximum biosorption efficiency under acidic conditions ph 2 0 could be attributed to the electrostatic attractive forces between anionic molecular structure of dyes ry2 and rr198 and protonated active sites present on the immobilized biosorbent surface with increasing ph the number of protonated binding sites on immobilized biomaterial surface decreased while that of negatively charged binding sites increased this change can be explained by deprotonation occur on the biomaterial surface with increasing ph it should be noted that no color change of the rr198 and ry2 dyes was observed when the ph value of solutions adjusted between ph 2 0 and 9 0 also no difference was observed when the uv spectra of the dye solutions recorded in this ph range were compared individually fig 3 zeta potential analysis of the nspol was also confirmed the optimum ph value for the biosorption of these dyes the isoelectric point of nspol was recorded as 2 4 fig 4 at a ph lower than the isoelectric point the high concentration of protons in the medium creates an intense positive surface charge on the nspol surface therefore anionic dye molecules can easily interact with positively charged biomaterial surface when compared the zeta potential values of nspol fig 4 recorded in water and dye solutions more negative surface charges are clearly seen after ry2 and rr198 biosorption for nspol surface at all ph values studied shifting surface charge of nspol to lower values in dye solutions is a notable marker for the interaction between these reactive dyes and nspol real wastewater treatment performance of suggested biomaterial was also tested in this study chemical composition of this real wastewater sample provided from the organized industrial area of eskişehir turkey was given in table 1 the biosorption yield of nspol in real wastewater spiked with 100 mg l 1 of dye at optimised batch biosorption conditions was 91 52 and 89 90 for ry2 and rr198 respectively this result demonstrates the potential of suggested biosorbent in real application 3 2 decolorization kinetics and equilibrium isotherms kinetic parameters are essential to obtain information on modeling of the biosorptive decolorization process and estimate the decolorization rate fig 5 shows the decolorization kinetics of ry2 and rr198 by nspol it can be seen that at the begining of the process the decolorization was very fast for both dye and it proceeds at a relatively slower rate and reached an equilibrium approxiamtely at 60 min the initial rapid decolorization phase may be explained by the abundance of the vacant biosorption sites at the initial stage the decrease in the rate of biosorption over the time and the equilibrium of the decolorization process are related to the occupying of these sites with dye molecules in order to evaluate the mechanisms of the biosorption of ry2 and rr198 dyes onto nspol the lagergren s first order 30 and the pseudo second order 31 kinetic models were considered and the results obtained from these models at various contact times 5 90 min was given in table 2 compared to the case with the coefficient of determination values r 2 of the investigated models the experimental data for the ry2 and rr198 biosorption by nspol were better fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model the biosorption capacity values q e calculated by this model were also close to those acquired by experiments 27 74 and 23 65 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively thus these findings suggest that the rate limiting step of the decoloriazation might be chemical sorption which involves exchanging or sharing of electrons between nspol and dye molecules the general experimental isotherms for the biosorption of ry2 and rr198 onto nspol are presentes in fig 6 isotherm model parameters and the quality of fitting in terms of coefficient of determination values are presented on table 3 non linear regression analysis was used to estimation of these parameters according to coeefficient of determination values given in this table the isotherms appeared to follow the langmuir model more closely than the other models for both dyes this finding indicating the monolayer coveage of nspol surface by ry2 and rr198 molecules in this model the maximum biosorption capacity values of ry2 and rr198 were corresponding to 51 12 and 37 59 mg g 1 respectively these values are consistent with the investigational experimental values among the studied isotherm models the d r model has a relatively high r 2 and f value after the langmuir model the calculated average energy e values of the biosorption for both dyes were in the 8 16 kj mol 1 range indicating that chemical ion exchange may also be involved in the decolorization of the dyes 34 reactive dye biosorption capacities of different types of materials biomaterials reported in the literature are summarized in table 4 because of the differences in experimental conditions it is generally difficult to directly compare the decolorization capacities of biomaterials however in order to provide an idea about the biosorption potential of nspol this comparison was made table 4 shows that the data of ry2 and rr198 biosorption per unit mass of nspol were comparable to the reported values those of many corresponding sorbents so nspol can be evaluated as a valuable biomaterial for the effective treatment of reactive dye contamination 3 3 continuous mode decolorization studies although the findings of the batch biosorption tests are provided basic information about the sorbent behavior and biosorption performance dynamic flow mode water treatment studies have a special role in evaluating the technical feasibility of process for large scale industrial treatment applications in this context packed bed columns have been established as an economical effective and most convenient for biosorptive treatment it allows more efficiently sorption capacity of a biomaterial also packed bed sorption is simple to operate attains a high yield and it can be easily scaled up from laboratory scale procedure 49 50 to further show the potentiality of this new immobilized biomaterial with relatively high biosorption capacity column biosorption experiments were undertaken to explore the biosorption performance under dynamic flow conditions according to the results of batch mode experiments continuous mode biosorption in fixed bed columns packed with immobilized biosorbent was conducted at ph 2 0 and 100 mg l 1 dye concentrations fig 7 a illustrates the decolorization yields of nspol for varying biomass dosages the biosorption yields of nspol were increased for both dyes with increasing amounts of biomass packed into columns up to a certain value due to increased bed depth and binding sites subsequently no significant change in the biosorption yield of nspol was observed for both dyes due to the saturation of dye binding sites present on the nspol surface p 0 05 therefore 0 1 and 0 25 g of nspol were regarded as the optimum immobilized biomaterial amount for the maximum ry2 and rr198 removal in dynamic flow mode treatment studies this biosorption tendency is also consistent with that in batch mode experiments fig 7b illustrates the flow rate dependent behavior of the decolarization process increasing flow rate from 0 5 6 0 ml min 1 did not cause a significant change in the percentage dye biosorption yield of nspol 98 0 for both dyes column studies have shown that the proposed biosorbent material as column filler has a very high decolorization yields even in relatively low amounts these findings can be considered as important advantages for the use of nspol in practical applications 3 4 breakthrough curve analysis in order to further verify that the prepared biosorbent is effective in the continuous system as well as in the batch system breakthrough curve obtained by c t c o plotting against flow time t fig 8 the amount of biosorbent bed depth influent dye concentration and flow rate was 0 25 g 1 0 cm 100 mg l 1 and 1 ml min 1 in this study when the plot is examined effective biosorption observed till the breakthrough time t b 35 and 51 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively and slope of the curve was decreased after the exhaustion time t e 227 and 264 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively calculated column parameters was given in table 5 the volume of treated dye v eff can be calculated via eq 9 51 9 v e f f f t e where f and t e represents the volumetric flow rate ml min 1 and exhaustion time min respectively the area under the breakthrough curve attained by integrating biosorbed dye concentration c o c e plotted against dye volume v to calculate ry2 and rr198 biosorption capacity at breakthrough point q b and exhaustion time q e by eq 10 and 11 respectively adsorbed dye uptake m ad total dye uptake m total

100 where c o and c t are influent and effluent concentration mg l 1 v b and v e are dye volume passed until breakthrough and exhaustion volume l and m is mass of biosorbent g respectively mass transfer zone lenght z m can be calculated from eq 15 15 z m l 1 t b t e where l is bed depth cm t b and t e represent breakthrough and exhaustion time min respectively bohart adams 54 thomas 55 and yoon nelson 56 models were common models for kinetic studies of column modeling however these three models are similar and may be regarded as mathematically equivalent and expressed by a following simplistic equation eq 16 57 16 c t c o 1 1 e x p a b t where a equals to k ba n o l u k t q t m f and k ynτ b equals to k ba c o k t c o and k yn for bohart adams b a thomas and yoon nelson y n

coefficients from simplistic equation are presented in table 5 the adjusted correlation coefficient r 2 adj close to 1 low reduced chi squared χ2 value and high f value indicates a good fit of the experimental breakthrough data to the model high exhaustion capacity values from breakthrough curve 41 94 and 50 09 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively and thomas model 46 45 and 50 92 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively indicates nspol may be used effectively in the continuous system the maximum capacity values obtained in the batch system 51 12 and 37 59 mg g 1 for ry2 and rr198 respectively were also compatible with the continuous system experimental findings on the curve 114 0 and 120 0 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively were compatible with τ 121 6 and 125 3 min for ry2 and rr198 respectively these results indicate nspol may be useful in both batch and continuous system and suitable for large scale studies aimed at removing reactive dye contamination from aquatic media 3 5 regeneration and reuse of biosorption columns adaptation of a sorbent material to real water treatment systems may require its high regeneration potential in order to recover the dyes and reuse the biomaterial also the reutilization of a biomaterial in consecutive sorption cycles reduces the cost of the treatment process and minimizes the waste generation related to the disposal of biomaterial 58 the variation of the recovery yields of ry2 and rr198 from nspol using 0 01 m naoh as eluent within 5 cycles in continuous mode are shown in fig 9 the findings indicateded that nspol could be used for 5 cycles of rr198 biosorption with around 78 decrease in its sorption yield on the other hand even at the end of the 5th cycle nspol showed a desorption efficiency higher than 50 in case of the ry2 dye over 98 of the biosorption yield of nspol remained after 5 biosorption desorption cycles moreover its desorption yields were higher than 98 during 5 cycles which suggests a good reusability of nspol the recovery of the dyes using naoh after adsorption by nspol may be explained by exchange of the counterions and deprotonation of the protonated groups on the surface and then dissolving in naoh the recycle decolorization potential of nspol to be used repeatedly for 5 rounds without losing too much of its biosoption ability especially for ry2 is a very important advantage in terms of usability in large scale industrial treatment studies and economic value of the biosorbent 3 6 characterization studies sem images showing the nspol a ry2 loaded nspol b and rr198 loaded nspol c morphology are illustrated in fig 10 the images revealed that nspol has a heteregenous surface structure composed of several cavities bumps and grooves this surface characteristics of the developed immobilized biomaterial might allow the easily impregnation of the dye molecules into biomaterial surface and and interact therein with the dye binding sites the sem micrographs of nspol loaded with ry2 and rr198 were rather a tighter and smooth surface this finding has been confirmed the coverage of the immobilized biomaterial surface by dyes like a molecular cloud the ir spectra of nspol before and after decolorization process are presented in fig 11 the bands at 3420 corresponds to oh and nh stretching vibrations on nspol powder the absorption bands at 1628 1518 cm 1 were assigned to co amid and cn stretching vibrations respectively the stretching vibration of co were located at 1315 and 1244 cm 1 the absorption bands at 2922 and 2852 cm 1 are attributed to ch3 and ch2 stretching vibrations bending vibrations of ch3 and ch2 groups are observed about 1448 and 1378 cm 1 the bands at 1244 and 1039 cm 1 denoted the po and po stretching vibrations respectively ir spectral analysis after rr198 and ry2 biosorption showed that there was a slight decrease in the intensity of the stretching of the oh and nh bond from 3420 cm 1 for unloaded nspol to 3425 cm 1 for ry2 loaded nspol also the intensities of the bands at 1628 and 1315 cm 1 on the nspol surface slightly decreased after ry2 and rr198 biosorption a new peak at 1550 cm 1 appeared after ry2 biosorption which could be ascribed to the aromatic cc stretching vibration of the ry2 dyestuff that covers the surface of the biomass the band at 1244 cm 1 was shifted to 1233 cm 1 for ry2 loaded nspol and was not changed for rr198 loaded nspol similar change was observed for the peak at 1146 cm 1 it was shifted to 1157 and 1155 cm 1 respectively for ry2 and rr198 loaded nspol finally the intensity of peak at 1039 cm 1 was found to decrease after the rr198 biosorption these observations indicates that the mentioned functional were likely responsible for the decolorization of these target reactive dyes according to characterization analysis along with the biosorption experiments it was possible to identify the target dyes immobilized biosorbent interactions as well as the mechanisms involved in the decolorization process the possible mechanisms as well as the molecular interactions involved in the biosorption of rr198 and ry2 dyes onto nspol were presented in fig 12 depending on the on the chemical structures of the biomaterial surface rr198 and ry2 dyes and the studied ph condition that leads to a positively charged biomaterial surface it was thought that monolayer biosorption could occur synergistically based on electrostatic π π and hydrogen bond interactions similar dye biosorbent interaction mechanisms were also reported by scheufele et al 59 3 7 cost estimation of nspol production the commercial implementation of removing pollutants from the contaminated waters with the sorption technique is highly dependent on the sorbent production cost this study of the biosorptive removal of ry2 and rr198 dyes focuses on the use of a new biosorbent nspol the lack of procurement cost for pol an immobilization martix material and the utilization of this waste are two important factors that govern the sorbent selection in our study parameters such as biosorbent preparation and reusability play a decisive role in the total cost of biosorbent the overall expenditure per unit amount of biosorbent therefore affects its use on a commercial level the cost of preparing 100 g nspol including raw material electricity and all chemical costs was estimated at 7 062 the regeneration cost of the produced sorbate was also similarly estimated as 0 0041 considering the current commercial activated carbon prices the cost estimate of nspol production shows that the proposed adsorbent preparation is a cost effective process furthermore the good decolorization yields of nspol for ry2 and rr198 dyes and its regenerationability make it more efficient economical and feasible for practical application 4 conclusions in this study n sitophilia cells were pasively immobilized on p oreantalis leaf tissue exhibited a good potential to removal of ry2 and rr198 based on the biosorption decolarization the biodecolarization yield attained over 90 both of batch and continuous modes for target dyes biosorption data comformed to pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm model nspol dye bioremoval mechanism was explicated by sem ir and zeta potential analysis regeneration experiments showed that nspol was kept on reusability performance during five cycles overall because the immobilized biodecolarization agent can be prepared from using p orentalis leaves as lignocellulosic matrix that are abundant it can be used as a promising low cost and ecofriendly
