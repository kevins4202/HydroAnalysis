16995,glacier fed aquatic ecosystems provide habitats for diverse and active bacterial communities however the environmental vulnerabilities of co existing water and sediment bacterial communities in these ecosystems remain unclear here 16s rrna gene sequencing was used to investigate co existing bacterial communities in paired water and sediment samples from multiple rivers and lakes that are mainly fed by glaciers from the southeast tibetan plateau overall the bacterial communities were dissimilar between the water and sediment which indicated that there were limited interactions between them bacterial diversity was greatest in the sediments where it was mainly driven by changes in nitrogen compounds and ph meanwhile water bacterial diversity was more susceptible to evapotranspiration elevation and mean annual temperature water samples contained higher proportions of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes while sediment harbored higher proportions of acidobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes planctomycetes cyanobacteria and gemmatimonadetes bacterial community composition was significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation in water but with nitrogen compounds in sediment the co occurrence network of water included more keystone species e g cl500 29 marine group nocardioides spp and bacillus spp than the sediment network these keystone species showed stronger phylogenetic signals than the species in the modular structures further ecological clusters within the networks suggested that there were contrasting environmental vulnerabilities and preferences between water and sediment communities these findings demonstrated that co existing water and sediment bacterial communities and ecological clusters were shaped by contrasting environmental factors this work provides a basis for understanding the importance of bacterial communities in maintaining glacier fed aquatic ecosystems further the results provide new perspectives

ecological services baron et al 2002 rivers and lakes are fundamental components of aquatic ecosystems and are essential for coupling biogeochemical cycles between continents and oceans aufdenkampe et al 2011 flowing water acts as a carrier of biotic and abiotic substances while the sediments serve as sinks or sources for nutrient cycling battin et al 2009 previous studies on bacterial communities in aquatic systems have mainly focused on specific taxa e g fecal indicator bacteria and antibiotic resistance bacteria cloutier et al 2015 huerta et al 2013 nevers et al 2020 dam effects liu et al 2018 and contaminant degradation bai et al 2020 bacteria play key roles in driving multiple ecosystem processes in aquatic ecosystems such as nutrient cycling and waste decomposition fitamo et al 2017 madsen 2011 water bacteria arise as the sum of bacteria from rainfall groundwater and soil and sometimes have short resident times in a given location nelson 2009 sloan et al 2006 in addition bacterial communities in the water are expected to strongly differ across water streams as a consequence of local changes in hydrologic conditions associated with surrounding heterogeneous landscapes water quality land uses and geomorphology altermatt 2013 mari et al 2014 whitehead et al 2013 meanwhile bacterial communities in the sediment develop via long term sediment accumulation deposition and erosion during sedimentary processes du et al 2020 the diversity composition and environmental driving factors of bacterial communities co existing in the water and sediments may differ cloutier et al 2015 nevers et al 2020 xia et al 2014 for example a study conducted in the yellow river found that ph dissolved organic carbon and suspended particulate sediment were the main factors controlling the water bacterial community meanwhile the ph nitrate nitrogen and water content were the main factors influencing the sediment bacterial community xia et al 2014 lying at the interface between the cryosphere hydrosphere and pedosphere glacier fed aquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change milner et al 2017 global warming has increased both the rate and extent of glacier melting in high altitude environments lee et al 2017 these changes can potentially affect the biodiversity of specialized glacier fed river communities brown et al 2007 jacobsen et al 2012 these glacier fed systems are generally considered to be harsh habitats characterized by low temperature low nutrient availability and high levels of disturbance e g substrate removal and sedimentation clitherow et al 2013 milner et al 2017 although several studies have reported on the biodiversity communities and specialist taxa in such ecosystems giersch et al 2017 jacobsen et al 2012 wilhelm et al 2013 there is still a lack of information on bacterial communities and their environmental vulnerabilities and preferences cauvy fraunie and dangles 2019 furthermore most studies on glacier influenced biota have focused on a single system brown et al 2007 peter and sommaruga 2016 studies on bacterial communities in multiple glacier fed aquatic environments have not been systematically investigated so far microorganisms usually form ecological clusters or modules olesen et al 2007 such ecological clusters are expected to have multiple implications for community persistence contaminant removal and ecological services in aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 chun et al 2020 lin et al 2019 this may be due to the distinct phylogenetic relationships and environmental preferences within the clusters lurgi et al 2019 and the keystone species that maintain the interactions within the food webs banerjee et al 2018 for example in a soil study researchers found that temperature was the main driver of ecological clusters that contained multiple taxa with low temperature preferences e g pedobacter spp delgado baquerizo et al 2018 despite the importance of these ecological clusters the environmental factors driving co existing water and sediment bacteria are largely unpredictable especially in glacier fed aquatic ecosystems investigating ecological networks of bacterial communities co existing in water and sediments in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems is also essential to better understand the biodiversity of these habitats further such investigations will help to determine whether the diversity of different components of aquatic systems are vulnerable to the same changes in climate and ecosystem properties such as ph and nutrient content to address these gaps in the present study the bacterial diversity communities and environmental drivers were investigated and the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities were explored in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems three questions were addressed 1 do co existing water and sediment bacteria differ in diversity and community structure among multiple glacier fed aquatic systems 2 are co existing water and sediment bacteria driven by similar environmental factors and 3 do co occurrence patterns and the associated environmental preferences of bacterial communities differ between water and sediment to this end water and sediment samples were collected from multiple aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau the rivers and lakes in this region originate from himalayan rivers with glaciers being the major water source immerzeel et al 2010 in these areas the waters have created incisions of up to 2 3 km in depth yang et al 2015 and have formed elevation gradients ranging from 800 to 4600 m above sea level royden et al 2008 topographically these areas can be grouped into five distinct landform types bedrock gorge deep valley glacier alpine gorge and high mountain glacier korup and montgomery 2008 schoenbohm et al 2006 zhang 1998 thus these aquatic ecosystems are ideal for studying the environmental vulnerabilities and preferences of bacterial communities nevertheless there is still a severe lack of exhaustively sampled data available for investigations into paired water and sediment bacterial communities in these ecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection paired water and surface sediment samples were collected synchronously from july 11 to 23 2019 from 12 glacier fed rivers and lakes of the southeastern

majorbio company in shanghai all raw sequences obtained in this study have been submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the bioproject number prjna608087 2 4 sequence analysis the bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences were processed using qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 according to the following criteria 1 the 300 bp reads were truncated at any site with an average quality score of 20 over a 50 bp sliding window and truncated reads that were shorter than 50 bp were discarded 2 exact barcode matching two nucleotide mismatch in primer matching and reads containing ambiguous characters were removed and 3 sequences that overlapped by more than 10 bp were merged into a single sequence operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using a 97 similarity threshold using uparse v7 1 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2013 chimeras were removed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 singletons and doubletons were not considered high quality sequences were identified via rdp classifier using the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 2 5 climatic data and statistical analyses at each sampling site data were collected for the latitude longitude elevation and seven climatic variables in situ briefly the latitude longitude and elevation were measured using a gps unit the climatic variables namely the mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat aridity solar radiation sr water evaporation we wind speed ws and evapotranspiration et were acquired from worldclim https www worldclim org with a spatial resolution of 30 arc second approximately 1 km for each site bacterial alpha diversity indices including the otu richness faith s phylogenetic diversity pd shannon index and rarefaction curves based on the identified otus were calculated for each sample in the r package vegan pairwise geographic distances between samples were calculated from the latitude and longitude coordinates using the geosphere r package non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to visualize the community composition dissimilarities in the vegan r package the principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm analysis was used to calculate a set of spatial variables based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of each sampling station subsequently variance inflation factors vifs were calculated to check the collinearities among environmental and pcnm variables using the vegan r package the forward selection procedure was used to select environmental and spatial factors and variables with vif 10 were removed to avoid the impact of collinearity variation partitioning analysis vpa combined with partial mantel tests were employed to refine the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in shaping the bacterial community gilbert and bennett 2010 all statistical analyses were performed in r3 6 3 http www r project org 2 6 co occurrence networks a correlation network that included all samples was constructed so that the identified ecological clusters would be directly comparable across sample types then subnetworks were extracted from the entire network and analyzed individually the dominant otus were those that occupied at least 30 of the samples and accounted for more than 80 relative abundance of the total metacommunity all pairwise spearman correlations were calculated the correlations with a significant false discovery rate fdr adjusted p value 0 01 and strong coefficient ρ 0 75 between those dominant otus were considered the co occurrence networks were visualized using gephi v0 9 2 node level topological properties were calculated using gephi v0 9 2 statistical differences in node level attributes between the matrices were determined using nonparametric mann whitney u tests to assess the extent to which observed patterns in the networks were driven by microbial phylogeny phylogenetic trees were constructed using fasttree price et al 2010 and were visualized using itol https itol embl de unweighted unifrac distances were used to determine the extent phylogenetic distance to which any of the groups modules containing the different otus in the phylogenetic tree had a significant phylogenetic signal with respect to the other groups permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test for significant differences between groups a phylogenetic sampling theory was analytically employed which involved assuming random sampling from the phylogenetic tree as the predicted pd in a local community and then comparing the observed pd with those predictions o dwyer et al 2012 the aim of this comparison was to determine the degree to which ecological clusters appear random with respect to phylogeny as opposed to over dispersed or clustered phylogenetic sampling theory was performed using the picante r package the differences between observed and expected pd values were determined by calculating and comparing z scores for each module if the observed pd was greater than the expected diversity 2 the community was considered to be phylogenetically over dispersed meaning that distantly related taxa were more likely to be sampled than closely related taxa horner devine and bohannan 2006 2 7 defining keystone species the roles of nodes were estimated using two topological parameters the within module connectivity zi which quantified to what extent a node was connected to other nodes in its own module and the among module connectivity pi which quantified how well the node was connected to different modules guimerà and nunes amaral 2005 nodes with a high value of either zi or pi were defined as keystone taxa and included module hubs zi 0 25 pi 0 62 connectors zi 0 25 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 0 25 pi 0 62 olesen et al 2007 3 results 3 1 the diversity and community composition of co existing water and sediment bacteria are different overall the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes yielded 9746 223 high quality sequences and 77 398 otus the total number of otus in all samples was equivalent to a sequencing depth of 23 338 with a mean otu richness of 3102 pd of 285 and shannon index of 7 7 the rarefaction curves for the bacterial otus obtained using this sequencing depth were sufficient to represent the metacommunity after fitting the metacommunity to the truncated preston log normal predictions the sampling covered 81 7 84 1 of all otus fig s1 these results demonstrated that the majority of bacterial diversity was recovered by deep sequencing the alpha diversity of bacterial communities in the water and sediment samples are presented in table s2 in water the otu richness was between 2020 and 4956 the pd ranged from 161 to 453 and the shannon index ranged between 6 0 and 9 2 in sediment the otu richness ranged from 946 to 5227 the pd ranged from 93 to 535 and the shannon index ranged between 5 7 and 9 9 most bacterial phylotypes otus were found in sediments 75 85 of the total otus were found in sediments with 41 43 being unique to sediment and 34 42 being shared between the matrices meanwhile 58 57 of the total otus were found in the water subgroup with only 24 15 of the otus being unique to water the samples were divided into five distinct landform types bedrock gorge sr lcr1 lcr2 nj1 and nj2 deep valley gdq and rsq glacier pg and sq alpine gorge lq and byc and high mountain glacier rw1 rw6 in total 3440 and 1971 otus were shared among the five landform types in water and sediment respectively most of the otus were unique to each landform type rather than being shared between landforms fig s2 nmds ordinations and analysis of similarities anosim showed that the bacterial community compositions differed significantly between the water and sediment samples r 0 672 p 0 001 fig 2 a the beta diversity among the five landforms showed significant heterogeneity regardless of whether the sample was from water or sediment fig 2b 2c the relative abundances of the phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were higher in water 45 4 88 5 and 4 1 40 2 respectively than in sediment 36 1 64 6 and 3 6 23 2 respectively on the contrary the relative abundances of acidobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes planctomycetes cyanobacteria and gemmatimonadetes were higher in sediment 2 9 16 4 9 0 40 1 2 0 11 7 0 4 18 5 0 8 4 5 0 1 5 8 and 0 2 5 8 respectively than in water 0 4 5 9 2 4 20 0 0 4 3 6 0 1 6 4 0 4 3 0 0 1 4 0 and 0 2 1 6 respectively fig 3 taxonomic differences which were identified using linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse analysis indicated that there were 80 and 94 biomarkers p 0 05 lda 2 0 in water and sediment respectively among the five landforms fig 4 most of these biomarkers were abundant in deep valley and alpine gorge samples the classes thermoanaerobaculia thermoleophilia and bacilli were the main biomarkers in deep valley water samples meanwhile species belonging to bacteroidia sericytochromatia verrucomicrobiae alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominated in alpine gorge water samples yet in sediment acidobacteriia coriobacteriia and alphaproteobacteria species prevailed in deep valley samples species affiliated with aminicenantia acidobacteria actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were abundant in bedrock gorge sediment samples fig 4 3 2 co existing water and sediment bacteria are driven by contrasting environmental factors for water samples among the environmental factors the otu richness and pd showed the most significant positive correlations with et mat and water temperature and the most significant negative correlations with elevation and ws fig 2d however for sediment samples the bacterial alpha diversity otu richness pd and shannon index was most significantly positively correlated with tn r 0 53 p 0 001 r 0 72 p 0 001 r 0 29 p 0 01 respectively and most negatively correlated with ph r 0 49 and p 0 001 r 0 59 and p 0 001 r 0 26 and p 0 001 respectively fig 2d mantel tests indicated that the bacterial communities were more significantly correlated with map r 0 367 p 0 001 in water but with nitrogen sources don nh4 n and tn and ph in sediment table s3 by combining environmental and spatial variables the vpa results table s4 showed that environmental drivers explained more 16 6 and 29 7 in water and sediment respectively of the bacterial community variance than the spatial scale 10 3 and 1 1 in water and sediment respectively 3 3 co existing water and sediment bacteria show different ecological network patterns a meta network was built containing all samples the bacterial meta network consisted of 299 nodes linked by 699 edges the water bacteria supported more connected links 437 of the 699 edges than the sediment bacteria 9 of the 699 edges fig s3 the meta network represented taxa from proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes which together accounted for 83 6 of the total nodes the network density was 0 016 and the average clustering coefficient was 0 288 fig s3 the co occurrence networks for the different sample types fig 5 a varied in the number of nodes and edges there were more nodes and edges in the water network than in the sediment network both networks exhibited scale free characteristics power law r2 0 928 and 0 983 for the water and sediment networks respectively table 1 which indicated that the organization of the ecological networks in both water and sediment was non random the topological properties in the empirical networks were higher than those in the respective erdös réyni random networks which suggested that the networks had small world properties and modular structure table 1 the ecological networks were clearly parsed into six major modules fig 5a the water network had a higher clustering coefficient lower average path length and higher small world coefficient than the sediment network table 1 this suggested that the water ecosystem had more closely associated microbial food webs than the sediment the degree and betweenness centrality were significantly higher in water than in sediment meanwhile the closeness and eigenvector centrality were significantly higher in sediment than in water fig 5b according to the definition of olesen et al 2007 keystone species were identified using the following thresholds zi 0 25 and pi 0 62 and zi 0 25 and pi 0 62 finally 22 connectors and 1 module hub were detected which were mainly from the phyla actinobacteria firmicutes proteobacteria and cyanobacteria in water meanwhile only 11 connectors were identified in sediment with most of them from the phylum proteobacteria table s5 seven pairs of keystone species displayed a greater and more significant phylogenetic signal than the pairwise comparisons of all otus in the water network modules whereas only one pair module 1 vs 2 of keystone species was detected in the sediment table 2 phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the co occurrence networks were mainly governed by the taxonomic relatedness of species across the five landforms fig 6 a further random sampling was observed for most of the modules except for module 1 in water which tended to be phylogenetically over dispersed especially at the deep valley sites fig 6b after linking modules to environmental factors in water the relative abundances of module 1 module 3 and module 4 were significantly and positively correlated with tp aridity and don respectively the relative abundance of water module 5 was significantly and negatively associated with ws however in sediment the relative abundances of module 2 and module 4 significantly decreased with increasing sm and ph respectively further the relative abundances of sediment module 5 and module 6 significantly increased with increasing ph and no3 n respectively fig 7 the details of the bacterial phylotypes in these modules are available in table s6 4 discussion bacterial communities in glacier fed aquatic systems are indicators of global climate change and hydrological cycles brown et al 2007 in this study we systematically compared the diversity community composition and co occurrence patterns of bacteria co existing in the water and sediment of multiple aquatic systems that were mainly fed by glaciers the water and sediment bacterial communities exhibited different and complex environmental vulnerabilities and preferences therefore elucidating the mechanisms underlying bacterial community assembly in glacier fed aquatic ecosystems under changing environmental conditions is crucial for understanding the resilience of hydrological regimes to disturbance events such as climate warming in this study the bacterial communities in the sediment provided the main contribution 75 to the bacterial diversity in the aquatic systems sediments act as a reservoir which recruit and subsequently deposit microbes from surrounding areas e g soils sands and plant debris crump et al 2012 moreover sediments share some properties with soils and develop over long time periods via soil deposition and erosion soil erosion breaks down aggregates and fine or light particles and labile organic fractions are selectively transported mueller nedebock et al 2016 this process deteriorates soil structure and results in soil organic carbon loss meanwhile soil deposition increases nutrient contents and wetness and potentially alters the ph berhe and kleber 2013 these variations in sediment conditions can profoundly increase microbial biomass and finally increase bacterial diversity du et al 2020 llobet brossa et al 1998 van horn et al 2013 these processes may potentially explain the relationship between sediment bacterial diversity and sediment properties i e the ph and nitrogen tn don and nh4 n nevertheless water bacterial diversity depended on the elevation via the intertwined and opposing effects of increased et mat and water temperature with increased elevation zeng et al 2021 this supported the lower diversity of microorganisms in the water although elevation and mat respectively displayed negative and positive correlations that were not statistically significant with the shannon index fig 2d these results suggested that water bacterial diversity was more susceptible to climate effects while sediment bacterial diversity was more affected by local physicochemical conditions the bacterial communities showed clear separation between the matrices which indicated that the habitat type water and sediment was the main reason for the differences in community structure regardless of landform type proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which were dominant in water are typical of freshwater ecosystems tamames et al 2010 the regular occurrence of these groups in other ice ecosystems simon et al 2009 wilhelm et al 2013 suggested that they may comprise cryophilic taxa as supported by cultivation dependent approaches loveland curtze et al 2009 lefse analysis demonstrated that sphingobacteriaceae acetobacteraceae and chitinophagaceae prevailed in alpine gorge samples fig 4 species in these groups have also been detected in a glacier fed stream of the austrian alps wilhelm et al 2013 in sediment some biomarkers such as candidatus accumulibacter have been reported to show versatile metabolic activities e g phosphorus removal indicating the functional diversity of these taxa in water quality purification roles lu et al 2006 in this study don nh4 n and tn were key factors not only for bacterial diversity but also for bacterial community structure in the sediment this demonstrated that nitrogen compounds were a major shaper of the sediment bacterial community in contrast the water bacterial communities were more controlled by map the map increases remarkably downstream and is lower in upstream areas zhang 1998 zhang et al 2015 thus regional climate changes may shift the water bacterial communities microbial networks have been suggested to be important tools for investigating potential interactions within microbial food webs albert and barabasi 2002 in this study for the first time co occurrence network analysis was applied to explore the associations between bacterial communities across multiple glacier fed aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau the resulting aquatic bacterial networks had similar statistical and structural properties to wetland sediment bacterial networks zhang et al 2019 these similar properties included small world organization power law distribution and modular structure therefore these properties likely comprise the basic building blocks of aquatic microbial networks network topology can reflect interactions between microorganisms for example the degree value describes the level of connectedness between otus and the betweenness centrality represents the importance of the control potential that an otu exerts over the interactions of other otus in the network otus with high betweenness centrality represent organisms that are located in the core of the network greenblum et al 2012 the present study showed that water bacterial otus have significantly higher degree and betweenness centrality values than sediment otus this suggests that there are stronger and more complex webs of interaction in water ecosystems than in sediment fig 5 microbial communities are organized into tightly linked modules the number and composition of these modules are nevertheless dependent on the scale of ecological organization being considered modules in the ecological network are constituted by microbes that are more phylogenetically similar than would be expected by chance phylogenetic relatedness in microbial communities is expected to be selected against due to similarities in metabolic needs in other words phylogenetically related microbes would be more likely to compete than non related ones due to niche similarities ghoul and mitri 2016 most of modules in the present networks followed random sampling however species in module 1 of the water network tended to be phylogenetically over dispersed especially in deep valley sites this indicates that these communities are primarily structured via competitive exclusion and are less closely related than would be expected by chance barberan and casamayor 2010 the bacterial networks were more intricate more nodes and potential edges in water than in sediment keystone species are the drivers of community structure and ecosystem stability banerjee et al 2018 for instance the keystone species cl500 29 marine group has been shown to play a dominant role in water quality purification chen et al 2017 and nocardioides spp play key roles in the degradation of contamination such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs leigh et al 2007 and phenanthrene saito et al 2000 in addition bacillus spp have been shown to exhibit high energy metabolism in nutrient limited conditions taennler et al 2008 these keystone taxa may impact the bacterial metabolic network of the overall communities in aquifers despite their low abundance rafrafi et al 2013 the disappearance of keystone taxa could cause network breakdown in water module 3 and module 4 showed strong linear regressions with aridity and don respectively certain biofilm taxa in module 3 such as acidimicrobiia seem to adapted to hyper arid conditions idris et al 2017 similarly species in module 4 dominated by alphaproteobacteria such as sphingorhabdus have been found to prefer don deposition conditions garcia et al 2015 in sediment the relative abundances of module 4 and module 5 dominated by proteobacteria and actinobacteria were significantly correlated with ph these results were in line with a previous study on soil fierer and jackson 2006 suggesting that ph altered the diversity of this ecological cluster the sediment ph may directly impose a physiological constraint on bacteria altering competitive outcomes or reducing the net growth of individual taxa in addition ph may indirectly alter ecological clusters by changing a number of sediment properties e g nutrient availability moisture and organic carbon that are often directly or indirectly related to ph lauber et al 2009 these factors may filter for clusters according to their preferences and vulnerabilities sediment concentration can be influenced by moisture content defersha and melesse 2012 which changes microbial physiochemical traits this may explain the relationships between the relative abundance of module 2 and moisture our results suggest that the relative abundance of particular modules can be predicted using common environmental factors 5 concluding remarks in this study 16s rrna gene sequencing linear discriminant analysis multivariate statistical analyses and ecological networks were used to synchronously investigate water and sediment bacterial communities in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau bacterial communities clearly differed between water and sediment suggesting a limited overlap of interactions water bacterial diversity was more sensitive to climate changes while sediment bacterial diversity may arise from the long term accumulation of sedimentation processes which was susceptible to nitrogen compounds the differences in bacterial communities were greater between water and sediment than among the five landform types six major ecological clusters of co occurring taxa were identified in each matrix with some of these clusters exhibiting distinct vulnerabilities and preferences according to their relative abundances for different environmental factors ecological networks were more intricate and were linked by more keystone species in water than in sediment this suggested that phyla in water ecosystems may have more versatile functional diversity these results reveal a lower diversity and more complicated co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in water than in sediment of southeast tibetan plateau and expand our knowledge of microbes in glacier fed hydrosphere under changing environments declaration of competing

2018 and contaminant degradation bai et al 2020 bacteria play key roles in driving multiple ecosystem processes in aquatic ecosystems such as nutrient cycling and waste decomposition fitamo et al 2017 madsen 2011 water bacteria arise as the sum of bacteria from rainfall groundwater and soil and sometimes have short resident times in a given location nelson 2009 sloan et al 2006 in addition bacterial communities in the water are expected to strongly differ across water streams as a consequence of local changes in hydrologic conditions associated with surrounding heterogeneous landscapes water quality land uses and geomorphology altermatt 2013 mari et al 2014 whitehead et al 2013 meanwhile bacterial communities in the sediment develop via long term sediment accumulation deposition and erosion during sedimentary processes du et al 2020 the diversity composition and environmental driving factors of bacterial communities co existing in the water and sediments may differ cloutier et al 2015 nevers et al 2020 xia et al 2014 for example a study conducted in the yellow river found that ph dissolved organic carbon and suspended particulate sediment were the main factors controlling the water bacterial community meanwhile the ph nitrate nitrogen and water content were the main factors influencing the sediment bacterial community xia et al 2014 lying at the interface between the cryosphere hydrosphere and pedosphere glacier fed aquatic ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change milner et al 2017 global warming has increased both the rate and extent of glacier melting in high altitude environments lee et al 2017 these changes can potentially affect the biodiversity of specialized glacier fed river communities brown et al 2007 jacobsen et

sedimentation clitherow et al 2013 milner et al 2017 although several studies have reported on the biodiversity communities and specialist taxa in such ecosystems giersch et al 2017 jacobsen et al 2012 wilhelm et al 2013 there is still a lack of information on bacterial communities and their environmental vulnerabilities and preferences cauvy fraunie and dangles 2019 furthermore most studies on glacier influenced biota have focused on a single system brown et al 2007 peter and sommaruga 2016 studies on bacterial communities in multiple glacier fed aquatic environments have not been systematically investigated so far microorganisms usually form ecological clusters or modules olesen et al 2007 such ecological clusters are expected to have multiple implications for community persistence contaminant removal and ecological services in aquatic ecosystems banerjee et al 2018 chun et al 2020 lin et al 2019 this may be due to the distinct phylogenetic relationships and environmental preferences within the clusters lurgi et al 2019 and the keystone species that maintain the interactions within the food webs banerjee et al 2018 for example in a soil study researchers found that temperature was the main driver of ecological clusters that contained multiple taxa with low temperature preferences e g pedobacter spp delgado baquerizo et al 2018 despite the importance of these ecological clusters the environmental factors driving co existing water and sediment bacteria are largely unpredictable especially in glacier fed aquatic ecosystems investigating ecological networks of bacterial communities co existing in water and sediments in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems is also essential to better understand the biodiversity of these habitats further such investigations will help to determine whether the diversity of different components of aquatic systems are vulnerable to the same changes in climate and ecosystem properties such as ph and nutrient content to address these gaps in the present study the bacterial diversity communities and environmental drivers were investigated and the co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities were explored in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems three questions were addressed 1 do co existing water and sediment bacteria differ in diversity and community structure among multiple glacier fed aquatic systems 2 are co existing water and sediment bacteria driven by similar environmental factors and 3 do co occurrence patterns and the associated environmental preferences of bacterial communities differ between water and sediment to this end water and sediment samples were collected from multiple aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau the rivers and lakes in this region originate from himalayan rivers with glaciers being the major water source immerzeel et al 2010 in these areas the waters have created incisions of up to 2 3 km in depth yang et al 2015 and have formed elevation gradients ranging from 800 to 4600 m above sea level royden et al 2008 topographically these areas can be grouped into five distinct landform types bedrock gorge deep valley glacier alpine gorge and high mountain glacier korup and montgomery 2008 schoenbohm et al 2006 zhang 1998 thus these aquatic ecosystems are ideal for studying the environmental vulnerabilities and preferences of bacterial communities nevertheless there is still a severe lack of exhaustively sampled data available for investigations into paired water and sediment bacterial communities in these ecosystems 2

majorbio company in shanghai all raw sequences obtained in this study have been submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the bioproject number prjna608087 2 4 sequence analysis the bacterial 16s rrna gene amplicon sequences were processed using qiime v1 9 0 caporaso et al 2010 according to the following criteria 1 the 300 bp reads were truncated at any site with an average quality score of 20 over a 50 bp sliding window and truncated reads that were shorter than 50 bp were discarded 2 exact barcode matching two nucleotide mismatch in primer matching and reads containing ambiguous characters were removed and 3 sequences that overlapped by more than 10 bp were merged into a single sequence operational taxonomic units otus were clustered using a 97 similarity threshold using uparse v7 1 http drive5 com uparse edgar 2013 chimeras were removed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 singletons and doubletons were not considered high quality sequences were identified via rdp classifier using the silva 132 database quast et al 2013 2 5 climatic data and statistical analyses at each sampling site data were collected for the latitude longitude elevation and seven climatic variables in situ briefly the latitude longitude and elevation were measured using a gps unit the climatic variables namely the mean annual precipitation map mean annual temperature mat aridity solar radiation sr water evaporation we wind speed ws and evapotranspiration et were acquired from worldclim https www worldclim org with a spatial resolution of 30 arc second approximately 1 km for each site bacterial alpha diversity indices including the otu richness faith s phylogenetic diversity pd shannon index and rarefaction curves based on the identified otus were calculated for each sample in the r package vegan pairwise geographic distances between samples were calculated from the latitude and longitude coordinates using the geosphere r package non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to visualize the community composition dissimilarities in the vegan r package the principal coordinates of neighbor matrices pcnm analysis was used to calculate a set of spatial variables based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of each sampling station subsequently variance inflation factors vifs were calculated to check the collinearities among environmental and pcnm variables using the vegan r package the forward selection procedure was used to select environmental and spatial factors and variables with vif 10 were removed to avoid the impact of collinearity variation partitioning analysis vpa combined with partial mantel tests were employed to refine the relative roles of environmental and spatial factors in shaping the bacterial community gilbert and bennett 2010 all statistical analyses were performed in r3 6 3 http www r project org 2 6 co occurrence networks a correlation network that included all samples was constructed so that the identified ecological clusters would be directly comparable across sample types then subnetworks were extracted from the entire network and analyzed individually the dominant otus were those that occupied at least 30 of the samples and accounted for more than 80 relative abundance of the total metacommunity all pairwise spearman correlations were calculated the correlations with a significant false discovery rate fdr adjusted p value 0 01 and strong coefficient ρ 0 75 between those dominant otus were considered the co occurrence networks were visualized using gephi v0 9 2 node level topological properties were calculated using gephi v0 9 2 statistical differences in node level attributes between the matrices were determined using nonparametric mann whitney u tests to assess the extent to which observed patterns in the networks were driven by microbial phylogeny phylogenetic trees were constructed using fasttree price et al 2010 and were visualized using itol https itol embl de unweighted unifrac distances were used to determine the extent phylogenetic distance to which any of the groups modules containing the different otus in the phylogenetic tree had a significant phylogenetic signal with respect to the other groups permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test for significant differences between groups a phylogenetic sampling theory was analytically employed which involved assuming random sampling from the phylogenetic tree as the predicted pd in a local community and then comparing the observed pd with those predictions o dwyer et al 2012 the aim of this comparison was to determine the degree to which ecological clusters appear random with respect to phylogeny as opposed to over dispersed or clustered phylogenetic sampling theory was performed using the picante r package the differences between observed and expected pd values were determined by calculating and comparing z scores for each module if the observed pd was greater than the expected diversity 2 the community was considered to be phylogenetically over dispersed meaning that distantly related taxa were more likely to be sampled than closely related taxa horner devine and bohannan 2006 2 7 defining keystone species the roles of nodes were estimated using two topological parameters the within module connectivity zi which quantified to what extent a node was connected to other nodes in its own module and the among module connectivity pi which quantified how well the node was connected to different modules guimerà and nunes amaral 2005 nodes with a high value of either zi or pi were defined as keystone taxa and included module hubs zi 0 25 pi 0 62 connectors zi 0 25 pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 0 25 pi 0 62 olesen et al 2007 3 results 3 1 the diversity and community composition of co existing water and sediment bacteria are different overall the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna genes yielded 9746 223 high quality sequences and 77 398 otus the total number of otus in all samples was equivalent to a sequencing depth of 23 338 with a mean otu richness of 3102 pd of 285 and shannon index of 7 7 the rarefaction curves for the bacterial otus obtained using this sequencing depth were sufficient to represent the metacommunity after fitting the metacommunity to the truncated preston log normal predictions the sampling covered 81 7 84 1 of all otus fig s1 these results demonstrated that the majority of bacterial diversity was recovered by deep sequencing the alpha diversity of bacterial communities in the water and sediment samples are presented in table s2 in water the otu richness was between 2020 and 4956 the pd ranged from 161 to 453 and the shannon index ranged between 6 0 and 9 2 in sediment the otu richness ranged from 946 to 5227 the pd ranged from 93 to 535 and the shannon index ranged between 5 7 and 9 9 most bacterial phylotypes otus were found in sediments 75 85 of the total otus were found in sediments with 41 43 being unique to sediment and 34 42 being shared between the matrices meanwhile 58 57 of the total otus were found in the water subgroup with only 24 15 of the otus being unique to water the samples were divided into five distinct landform types bedrock gorge sr lcr1 lcr2 nj1 and nj2 deep valley gdq and rsq glacier pg and sq alpine gorge lq and byc and high mountain glacier rw1 rw6 in total 3440 and 1971 otus were shared among the five landform types in water and sediment respectively most of the otus were unique to each landform type rather than being shared between landforms fig s2 nmds ordinations and analysis of similarities anosim showed that the bacterial community compositions differed significantly between the water and sediment samples r 0 672 p 0 001 fig 2 a the beta diversity among the five landforms showed significant heterogeneity regardless of whether the sample was from water or sediment fig 2b 2c the relative abundances of the phyla proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were higher in water 45 4 88 5 and 4 1 40 2 respectively than in sediment 36 1 64 6 and 3 6 23 2 respectively on the contrary the relative abundances of acidobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes planctomycetes cyanobacteria and gemmatimonadetes were higher in sediment 2 9 16 4 9 0 40 1 2 0 11 7 0 4 18 5 0 8 4 5 0 1 5 8 and 0 2 5 8 respectively than in water 0 4 5 9 2 4 20 0 0 4 3 6 0 1 6 4 0 4 3 0 0 1 4 0 and 0 2 1 6 respectively fig 3 taxonomic differences which were identified using linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse analysis indicated that there were 80 and 94 biomarkers p 0 05 lda 2 0 in water and sediment respectively among the five landforms fig 4 most of these biomarkers were abundant in deep valley and alpine gorge samples the classes thermoanaerobaculia thermoleophilia and bacilli were the main biomarkers in deep valley water samples meanwhile species belonging to bacteroidia sericytochromatia verrucomicrobiae alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominated in alpine gorge water samples yet in sediment acidobacteriia coriobacteriia and alphaproteobacteria species prevailed in deep valley samples species affiliated with aminicenantia acidobacteria actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria were abundant in bedrock gorge sediment samples fig 4 3 2 co existing water and sediment bacteria are driven by contrasting environmental factors for water samples among the environmental factors the otu richness and pd showed the most significant positive correlations with et mat and water temperature and the most significant negative correlations with elevation and ws fig 2d however for sediment samples the bacterial alpha diversity otu richness pd and shannon index was most significantly positively correlated with tn r 0 53 p 0 001 r 0 72 p 0 001 r 0 29 p 0 01 respectively and most negatively correlated with ph r 0 49 and p 0 001 r 0 59 and p 0 001 r 0 26 and p 0 001 respectively fig 2d mantel tests indicated that the bacterial communities were more significantly correlated with map r 0 367 p 0 001 in water but with nitrogen sources don nh4 n and tn and ph in sediment table s3 by combining environmental and spatial variables the vpa results table s4 showed that environmental drivers explained more 16 6 and 29 7 in water and sediment respectively of the bacterial community variance than the spatial scale 10 3 and 1 1 in water and sediment respectively 3 3 co existing water and sediment bacteria show different ecological network patterns a meta network was built containing all samples the bacterial meta network consisted of 299 nodes linked by 699 edges the water bacteria supported more connected links 437 of the 699 edges than the sediment bacteria 9 of the 699 edges fig s3 the meta network represented taxa from proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes which together accounted for 83 6 of the total nodes the network density was 0 016 and the average clustering coefficient was 0 288 fig s3 the co occurrence networks for the different sample types fig 5 a varied in the number of nodes and edges there were more nodes and edges in the water network than in the sediment network both networks exhibited scale free characteristics power law r2 0 928 and 0 983 for the water and sediment networks respectively table 1 which indicated that the organization of the ecological networks in both water and sediment was non random the topological properties in the empirical networks were higher than those in the respective erdös réyni random networks which suggested that the networks had small world properties and modular structure table 1 the ecological networks were clearly parsed into six major modules fig 5a the water network had a higher clustering coefficient lower average path length and higher small world coefficient than the sediment network table 1 this suggested that the water ecosystem had more closely associated microbial food webs than the sediment the degree and betweenness centrality were significantly higher in water than in sediment meanwhile the closeness and eigenvector centrality were significantly higher in sediment than in water fig 5b according to the definition of olesen et al 2007 keystone species were identified using the following thresholds zi 0 25 and pi 0 62 and zi 0 25 and pi 0 62 finally 22 connectors and 1 module hub were detected which were mainly from the phyla actinobacteria firmicutes proteobacteria and cyanobacteria in water meanwhile only 11 connectors were identified in sediment with most of them from the phylum proteobacteria table s5 seven pairs of keystone species displayed a greater and more significant phylogenetic signal than the pairwise comparisons of all otus in the water network modules whereas only one pair module 1 vs 2 of keystone species was detected in the sediment table 2 phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the co occurrence networks were mainly governed by the taxonomic relatedness of species across the five landforms fig 6 a further random sampling was observed for most of the modules except for module 1 in water which tended to be phylogenetically over dispersed especially at the deep valley sites fig 6b after linking modules to environmental factors in water the relative abundances of module 1 module 3 and module 4 were significantly and positively correlated with tp aridity and don respectively the relative abundance of water module 5 was significantly and negatively associated with ws however in sediment the relative abundances of module 2 and module 4 significantly decreased with increasing sm and ph respectively further the relative abundances of sediment module 5 and module 6 significantly increased with increasing ph and no3 n respectively fig 7 the details of the bacterial phylotypes in these modules are available in table s6 4 discussion bacterial communities in glacier fed aquatic systems are indicators of global climate change and hydrological cycles brown et al 2007 in this study we systematically compared the diversity community composition and co occurrence patterns of bacteria co existing in the water and sediment of multiple aquatic systems that were mainly fed by glaciers the water and sediment bacterial communities exhibited different and complex environmental vulnerabilities and preferences therefore elucidating the mechanisms underlying bacterial community assembly in glacier fed aquatic ecosystems under changing environmental conditions is crucial for understanding the resilience of hydrological regimes to disturbance events such as climate warming in this study the bacterial communities in the sediment provided the main contribution 75 to the bacterial diversity in the aquatic systems sediments act as a reservoir which recruit and subsequently deposit microbes from surrounding areas e g soils sands and plant debris crump et al 2012 moreover sediments share some properties with soils and develop over long time periods via soil deposition and erosion soil erosion breaks down aggregates and fine or light particles and labile organic fractions are selectively transported mueller nedebock et al 2016 this process deteriorates soil structure and results in soil organic carbon loss meanwhile soil deposition increases nutrient contents and wetness and potentially alters the ph berhe and kleber 2013 these variations in sediment conditions can profoundly increase microbial biomass and finally increase bacterial diversity du et al 2020 llobet brossa et al 1998 van horn et al 2013 these processes may potentially explain the relationship between sediment bacterial diversity and sediment properties i e the ph and nitrogen tn don and nh4 n nevertheless water bacterial diversity depended on the elevation via the intertwined and opposing effects of increased et mat and water temperature with increased elevation zeng et al 2021 this supported the lower diversity of microorganisms in the water although elevation and mat respectively displayed negative and positive correlations that were not statistically significant with the shannon index fig 2d these results suggested that water bacterial diversity was more susceptible to climate effects while sediment bacterial diversity was more affected by local physicochemical conditions the bacterial communities showed clear separation between the matrices which indicated that the habitat type water and sediment was the main reason for the differences in community structure regardless of landform type proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which were dominant in water are typical of freshwater ecosystems tamames et al 2010 the regular occurrence of these groups in other ice ecosystems simon et al 2009 wilhelm et al 2013 suggested that they may comprise cryophilic taxa as supported by cultivation dependent approaches loveland curtze et al 2009 lefse analysis demonstrated that sphingobacteriaceae acetobacteraceae and chitinophagaceae prevailed in alpine gorge samples fig 4 species in these groups have also been detected in a glacier fed stream of the austrian alps wilhelm et al 2013 in sediment some biomarkers such as candidatus accumulibacter have been reported to show versatile metabolic activities e g phosphorus removal indicating the functional diversity of these taxa in water quality purification roles lu et al 2006 in this study don nh4 n and tn were key factors not only for bacterial diversity but also for bacterial community structure in the sediment this demonstrated that nitrogen compounds were a major shaper of the sediment bacterial community in contrast the water bacterial communities were more controlled by map the map increases remarkably downstream and is lower in upstream areas zhang 1998 zhang et al 2015 thus regional climate changes may shift the water bacterial communities microbial networks have been suggested to be important tools for investigating potential interactions within microbial food webs albert and barabasi 2002 in this study for the first time co occurrence network analysis was applied to explore the associations between bacterial communities across multiple glacier fed aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau the resulting aquatic bacterial networks had similar statistical and structural properties to wetland sediment bacterial networks zhang et al 2019 these similar properties included small world organization power law distribution and modular structure therefore these properties likely comprise the basic building blocks of aquatic microbial networks network topology can reflect interactions between microorganisms for example the degree value describes the level of connectedness between otus and the betweenness centrality represents the importance of the control potential that an otu exerts over the interactions of other otus in the network otus with high betweenness centrality represent organisms that are located in the core of the network greenblum et al 2012 the present study showed that water bacterial otus have significantly higher degree and betweenness centrality values than sediment otus this suggests that there are stronger and more complex webs of interaction in water ecosystems than in sediment fig 5 microbial communities are organized into tightly linked modules the number and composition of these modules are nevertheless dependent on the scale of ecological organization being considered modules in the ecological network are constituted by microbes that are more phylogenetically similar than would be expected by chance phylogenetic relatedness in microbial communities is expected to be selected against due to similarities in metabolic needs in other words phylogenetically related microbes would be more likely to compete than non related ones due to niche similarities ghoul and mitri 2016 most of modules in the present networks followed random sampling however species in module 1 of the water network tended to be phylogenetically over dispersed especially in deep valley sites this indicates that these communities are primarily structured via competitive exclusion and are less closely related than would be expected by chance barberan and casamayor 2010 the bacterial networks were more intricate more nodes and potential edges in water than in sediment keystone species are the drivers of community structure and ecosystem stability banerjee et al 2018 for instance the keystone species cl500 29 marine group has been shown to play a dominant role in water quality purification chen et al 2017 and nocardioides spp play key roles in the degradation of contamination such as polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs leigh et al 2007 and phenanthrene saito et al 2000 in addition bacillus spp have been shown to exhibit high energy metabolism in nutrient limited conditions taennler et al 2008 these keystone taxa may impact the bacterial metabolic network of the overall communities in aquifers despite their low abundance rafrafi et al 2013 the disappearance of keystone taxa could cause network breakdown in water module 3 and module 4 showed strong linear regressions with aridity and don respectively certain biofilm taxa in module 3 such as acidimicrobiia seem to adapted to hyper arid conditions idris et al 2017 similarly species in module 4 dominated by alphaproteobacteria such as sphingorhabdus have been found to prefer don deposition conditions garcia et al 2015 in sediment the relative abundances of module 4 and module 5 dominated by proteobacteria and actinobacteria were significantly correlated with ph these results were in line with a previous study on soil fierer and jackson 2006 suggesting that ph altered the diversity of this ecological cluster the sediment ph may directly impose a physiological constraint on bacteria altering competitive outcomes or reducing the net growth of individual taxa in addition ph may indirectly alter ecological clusters by changing a number of sediment properties e g nutrient availability moisture and organic carbon that are often directly or indirectly related to ph lauber et al 2009 these factors may filter for clusters according to their preferences and vulnerabilities sediment concentration can be influenced by moisture content defersha and melesse 2012 which changes microbial physiochemical traits this may explain the relationships between the relative abundance of module 2 and moisture our results suggest that the relative abundance of particular modules can be predicted using common environmental factors 5 concluding remarks in this study 16s rrna gene sequencing linear discriminant analysis multivariate statistical analyses and ecological networks were used to synchronously investigate water and sediment bacterial communities in multiple glacier fed aquatic systems in the southeast tibetan plateau bacterial communities clearly differed between water and sediment suggesting a limited overlap of interactions water bacterial diversity was more sensitive to climate changes while sediment bacterial diversity may arise from the long term accumulation of sedimentation processes which was susceptible to nitrogen compounds the differences in bacterial communities were greater between water and sediment than among the five landform types six major ecological clusters of co occurring taxa were identified in each matrix with some of these clusters exhibiting distinct vulnerabilities and preferences according to their relative abundances for different environmental factors ecological networks were more intricate and were linked by more keystone species in water than in sediment this suggested that phyla in water ecosystems may have more versatile functional diversity these results reveal a lower diversity and more complicated co occurrence patterns of bacterial communities in water than in sediment of southeast tibetan plateau and expand our knowledge of microbes in glacier fed hydrosphere under changing environments declaration of competing

arsenic mobility in the pliocene aquifer are unclear to fill this gap groundwaters from a confined pliocene aquifer cg and an unconfined holocene aquifer ug were sampled in the guide basin china to monitor evolutions of groundwater geochemistry and om molecular signatures along the groundwater flow path the outcomes showed that groundwater ph temperature and arsenic concentrations in the cg samples generally increased along the groundwater flow path which were much higher than those in the ug samples the numbers and intensities of recalcitrant molecules polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples remarkably increased along the path but relatively labile molecules highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds showed the opposite trends the arsenic poor 10 μg l ug samples contained more labile molecules than the arsenic rich cg samples high groundwater ph temperature and sediment age in the confined aquifers may be responsible for the selective mobilization of the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols the mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules may enhance arsenic release via electron shuttling complexation and competition

acting as electron donors guo et al 2019 glodowska et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the recalcitrant om may also be involved in as enrichment via electron shuttling competition with as for surface sites and complexation with as mladenov et al 2015 groundwater from the pliocene and older aquifers is typically considered as safe water sources where low as groundwater generally prevailed hasan et al 2009 hoque et al 2017 however high as groundwater is found at depths of 200 m in the pliocene aquifer in the mekong delta basin erban et al 2013 2014 the bengal basin micheal et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2011 the pannonian basin of hungary and romania rowland et al 2011 varsányi et al 2017 and the guide basin of china wang et al 2018b in the mekong delta basin they attribute the pervasive occurrence of as hazard in the pliocene aquifer to compaction of overlaying clay caused by extensive pumping which expels high as groundwater or as mobilizing solutes e g organic matter into deep aquifers erban et al 2013 2014 it is still unclear how the mobilized om facilitated as release in the pliocene aquifers although it is believed that organic matter should be rather refractory and the native labile om should be near completely depleted due to the decrease in the bioreactivity of om with sediment age and burial depth middelburg 1989 postma et al 2016 in this case the om degradation rates and fe iii oxide reduction rates should be extremely low gao et al 2020a therefore it still remains open how om is involved in as release processes in the pliocene aquifer identification of om molecules by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms provides important information on their elemental compositions and relevant reactivity towards bio geochemical processes in aquifers valle et al 2018 mcdonough et al 2020a 2020b by using ft icr ms we have firstly delineated om molecular signatures and their linkages to as mobility in the hetao basin qiao et al 2020 2021 in the typical late pleistocene aquifer the labile pools of water soluble sedimentary organic matter som qiao et al 2020 and the recalcitrant pools of dissolved organic matter dom qiao et al 2021 are found to be responsible for as mobility by acting as electron donors and electron shuttles respectively geothermal groundwater typically contained toxic level as concentrations grassi et al 2014 especially in the western latin america the usa japan turkey and new zealand guo et al 2012 wang et al 2018a knappett et al 2020 the temperature induced as mobility includes dissolutions of silicate minerals desorption som degradation and the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides schwenzer et al 2001 bonte et al 2013 the hydrolysis of silicate minerals may generate alkaline ph groundwater and thus facilitate as release in terms of desorption knappett et al 2020 furthermore om is inclined to be mobilized under high groundwater temperature and ph kleber et al 2015 chen et al 2018 although molecular compositions of the mobilized om are unclear since high temperature and ph could facilitate the enrichment of both dom and as in geothermal groundwater we may speculate that the enrichment of the two kinds of species is concurrent because of the thermal quenching effect on fluorescence intensity of dom baker 2005 carstea et al 2014 the ft icr ms technique may provide more reliable information on the intrinsic dom properties of the geothermal groundwater nevertheless few studies have investigated molecular characteristics of dom in geothermal high as groundwater kovács et al 2010 2012 the guide basin is a special inland basin hosting high as groundwater where as enrichment in the deep confined pliocene aquifer has been reported liao et al 2013 wang et al 2018b the deep confined groundwater has been used for drinking water in the guide basin since 1978 where more than 59 000 people were being at risk shi et al 2010 in the guide basin as is not believed to be directly sourced from geothermal water in the studied groundwater from the confined aquifer since hot springs contain low as concentrations there zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018b geochemical processes may be conducive to as mobility in this aquifer therefore investigation of the evolution of dom and its roles in as mobility in geothermal groundwater from deep pliocene aquifer at the molecular scale can be done in the guide basin the study aims to 1 delineate the differences in molecular level compositions of dom between the unconfined and confined groundwater samples 2 identify geochemical processes controlling dom molecular evolutions along a groundwater flow path and 3 evaluate roles of dom molecules in as mobility in the confined aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the guide basin is situated between the longyang and songba gorges in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the qinghai province of china fig 1 a the basin is bordered by mountains to the north and the south with an average elevation of around 3100 m elevation of the basin ranges from around 2200 to 2500 m above the sea level the yellow river traverses through the basin which drains the basin together with its tributaries yan et al 2005 the guide basin is a typical cenozoic basin filled with neozoic clasts with a thickness of 1000 m yan et al 2005 borehole drilling data show that stratigraphy is generally characterized as holocene and pliocene strata along the hydrological section i ii figs 1b and c the holocene strata are mainly composed of loamy sand and well rounded gravel sand with a thickness of 32 m wang et al 2018b which host shallow unconfined groundwater at depth 32 m below the land surface bls fig 1c the pliocene strata lying beneath the holocene aquifer consist of grey brown grey and maroon mudstone sandy mudstone and sandstone with a thickness of 200 m pores and fractures widely occur in the sandstone layers where deep confined groundwater is mainly distributed at depths between 100 and 310 m bls fig 1c the hydraulic connections between the unconfined and confined aquifer are poor since thick mudstone layers act as aquitards between the unconfined and confined aquifers the hydrogeological profile is generally along the groundwater flow path of confined groundwater section i ii fig 1b being approximately perpendicular to the contour of the water head wang et al 2018b groundwater levels of the confined aquifer are from around 9 5 to 33 m above the land surface shi et al 2010 and gradually decline from the south to the north close to the yellow river with hydraulic gradients of around 1 wang et al 2018b both unconfined and confined groundwaters flow from the south near the mountain to the yellow river in the north fig 1b unconfined groundwater is mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and river water confined groundwater is mainly recharged from the bordered mountains around the guide basin and discharged via upward leakage in a compressional reverse fault near the yellow river fig 1c the confined groundwater temperature ranges from around 15 to 45 c within the depths of 100 to 450 m bls showing an average temperature gradient of around 1 c 15 m depth shi et al 2010 which is twice of the empirical geothermal gradient of 1 c 30 m lowell et al 2014 therefore the confined groundwater in the guide basin may be heated by both the geothermal gradient and geothermal fluid shi et al 2010 lowell et al 2014 2 2 water sampling and analysis according to our previous investigation of groundwater geochemistry in the study area wang et al 2018b fourteen representative groundwater samples including nine deep confined groundwater cg and five shallow unconfined groundwater ug samples were taken fig 1b to monitor the evolutions of groundwater geochemistry and dom molecular composition approximately along a groundwater flow path the whole distance of the groundwater flow path is close to 12 km fig 1c the cg samples were collected at depths of around 150 to 230 m bls except that the one at the beginning of the section cg0 had a depth of 30 m bls however the ug samples were taken from depths between 11 and 15 m bls groundwater was sampled after being pumped for more than 20 min until water temperature ph total dissolved solid tds electrical conductively ec and redox potential eh stabilized these parameters

filters in the fields except for samples for dissolved organic carbon doc detection and ft icr ms analysis through 0 45 μm poly tetra fluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters qiao et al 2020 for major cation and trace element analyses samples were collected in 100 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles and preserved with 6 m ultrapure hno3 at ph 2 0 however non acidified samples were collected in 10 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for anion analysis sub samples for analysis of as species were collected in 2 ml amber glass bottles being preserved with 0 25 mol l edta 10 samples for doc and ft icr ms analyses were acidified with hydrochloric acid hcl p a grade merck germany ph 2 0 and stored in 40 and 150 ml acid washed amber glass bottles respectively for fluorescence spectroscopy detections samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles unacidified the amber glass bottles were all burned at 500 c for 6 h in a muffle furnace prior to use concentrations of major cations and trace elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6300 thermo and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms 7500c agilent respectively with an analytical precision of 2 and a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 concentrations of anions including f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were measured by an ion chromatography dx 120 dionex the ion charge imbalance of sample analysis was less than 5 concentration of as species was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan with detection limits of 2 and 4 μg l for as iii and as v respectively and a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 doc concentration was detected by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer 2 3 optical indices and parafac modeling optical properties of dom were measured by a 10 nm path length uv visible spectrophotometer uv8100 labtech ltd and a fluromax 4 spectrofluorometer jobin yvon horiba the datasets from fluorescence measurements were used to calculate biological index bix humification index hix and fluorescence index fi of groundwater dom we use the bix to monitor biological properties and sources of dom hix to reflect humification and sources of dom huguet et al 2009 and fi to discriminate sources of humic substances in dom mcknight et al 2001 details on calculations of bix hix and fi can be found in guo et al 2019 the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of groundwater samples were collected for parallel factor analysis parafac the method of parafac modeling was analogous to that in guo et al 2019 and can be found in the supporting information in general four parafac components were obtained from the analyses fig s1 table s1 relative abundances of the four components were calculated from dividing the intensity of each component by the sum of absolute intensities of all components which are expressed as c1 c2 c3 and c4 2 4 ft icr ms analysis and data processing after pretreated with solid phase extraction groundwater dom was measured for molecular composition by a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr ms equipment he et al 2020 details of the detecting procedures were described in qiao et al 2020 and are provided in the supporting information the identified peaks primarily contained c h o n and s atoms with p atom showing much lower abundances 0 5 therefore molecules containing c h o n and s atoms were included for calculating dom molecular signatures in the study in the study each dom molecular formula refers to specific mass peak identified by the ft icr ms technique qiao et al 2020 the dom molecular composition can be divided into cho containing c h and o chon containing c h o and n chos containing c h o and s and chons containing c h o n and s double bond equivalent dbe koch and dittmar 2006 modified aromaticity index aimod koch and dittmar 2016 nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc values larowe and van cappellen 2011 and intensity weighted average values of these indices qiao et al 2021 were calculated details on calculations of dbe aimod nosc and intensity weighted average parameters are provided in the supporting information here the intensity weighted average double bond equivalent dbewa represents the sum of π bonds and rings in a molecule of dom with higher values showing wider diversities of compounds and more complex

and the intensity weighted average modified aromaticity index aimod wa reflects the aromaticity of dom molecule based on the h c ratios and aimod values of organic formulas dom molecules can be classified into five organic groups in the van krevelen diagram seidel et al 2014 lv et al 2016 polycyclic aromatics aimod 0 66 polyphenols 0 5 aimod 0 66 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds

3 results 3 1 groundwater geochemistry geochemical characteristics of the cg and ug samples are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 the total dissolved solid tds concentrations ranged between 272 and 835 mg l median 503 mg l in the cg samples which were slightly lower than those in the ug samples 272 719 mg l median 675 mg l table 1 sodium and hco3 were the major cation and anion in the cg samples while ca2 and hco3 predominated in the ug samples respectively the cg samples had temperatures from 12 2 to 20 3 c median 17 4 c significantly higher than the ug samples from 10 1 to 15 0 c median 11 3 c p 0 002 fig 2 groundwater samples in the cg group were weakly alkaline with ph from 7 4 to 8 9 median 8 53 while in the ug group were near neutral with ph from 6 89 to 7 77 median 7 01 the eh values in the cg samples median 121 mv were remarkably lower than those in the ug samples median 350 mv the hco3 concentrations in the cg samples median 287 mg l were significantly lower than those in the ug samples median 470 mg l p 0 019 fig 2 the cg samples had co3 2 concentrations between 0 3 and 36 mg l median 16 5 mg l due to high ph while they were below the detection limit 0 3 mg l in the ug samples the median nh4 concentration in the cg samples 0 3 mg l was one order of magnitude higher than that in the ug samples 0 03 mg l although fe ii concentrations were remarkably low in both the cg median 0 01 mg l and the ug samples median 0 06 mg l groundwater as concentrations had a wide range from 3 81 to 356 μg l median 15 8 μg l high dissolved as concentration 10 μg l was generally observed in the cg samples with more than 85 of the total as being as iii species however all the ug samples had as concentrations lower than 10 μg l fig 2 the cg samples had a wider range but lower concentrations of doc median 0 92 mg l than the ug samples median 1 52 mg l table 1 fig 2 in total groundwater temperature ph nh4 and as concentrations in the cg samples were significantly higher than those in the ug samples while hco3 concentrations are significantly lower in the cg than in the ug samples p 0 05 fig 2 3 2 dom optical properties the cg samples had a much wider range 1 15 10 6 and higher median value of hix 6 24 than the ug samples 1 69 4 05 median 3 19 fig s2 on the contrary bix values of groundwater dom in the cg samples median 0 705 were lower than those of the ug samples median 0 874 it indicates that dom had higher humification degree in the cg samples while that in the ug samples was of higher bioreactivity four different fluorescent components were obtained for all groundwater samples by parafac modeling fig s1 which were comparable to other studies table s1 among them c1 and c4 were characterized as terrestrial humic like components and c3 as a microbial humic like component while c2 was a protein like component as shown in fig s2 the relative intensity of c1 in the cg samples was significantly higher p 0 019 with c2 c3 and c4 components were less abundant relative to the ug samples this indicates that the cg samples had more terrestrial humic like organic components with higher aromaticity however the ug samples had higher relative intensities of c2 c3 and c4 components which are in line with the results of uv visible spectrophotometer 3 3 dom molecular signatures molecular compositions of dom in the cg and ug samples from the ft icr ms are shown in figs 3 and s3 there were 2759 to 4309 formulas identified in the cg samples which were comparable to those in the ug samples with 1950 to 4415 formulas p 1 0 fig s3 for these dom formulas the intensity weighted average h c h cwa intensity weighted average o c o cwa and intensity weighted average nosc noscwa in the cg samples showed wider ranges but lower median values than those in the ug samples fig s3 however the intensity weighted average dbe values dbewa and intensity weighted average values of aimod aimod wa in the cg samples were higher relative to those in the ug samples fig s3 the identified aliphatic compounds showed similar abundances in the cg median 254 and ug samples median 243 p 0 898 although they exhibited broader ranges in the ug samples fig s3 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were significantly enriched in the ug median 2545 than those in the cg samples median 2138 p 0 002 while the cg samples contained more polycyclic aromatics median 338 vs 54 in the ug samples p 0 042 and polyphenols median 467 vs 335 in the ug samples fig s3 the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenol compounds in dom of the cg samples accounted for 6 38 43 2 median 24 4 of the total identified peak numbers which was around two times as high as that in the ug samples median 12 9 the richness of the cho and chontot compounds in cg samples was similar to that in ug samples table 1 the sum of cho and chontot compounds were the most abundant formulas in the dom of both cg and ug samples accounting for 78 93 of the total identified organic molecules table 1 among the chontot compounds the chon1 compounds showed much higher richness than the chon2 and chon3 compounds which accounted for around 48 62 of the peak numbers of chontot formulas the dom in the cg and ug samples had similar abundances of chos formulas median 250 in the cg vs 231 in the ug samples and chons formulas median 89 in the cg vs 92 in the ug samples table 1 overall little differences in dom elemental compositions were observed between the cg and the ug samples 3 4 variations of dom molecular composition in confined aquifer along the flow path nine cg samples approximately along the profile fig 1 were monitored to illustrate the evolutions of groundwater geochemistry fig 4 and dom optical and molecular compositions figs s4 s5 along the groundwater flow path groundwater ph increased from around 7 4 to 8 8 and then slightly decreased to around 8 4 however groundwater temperature exhibited an ascending trend from around 12 to 20 c fig 4a dissolved nh4 increased from 0 01 mg l to a plateau of around 0 4 mg l along the flow path which peaked up to 0 7 mg l at around 10 5 km fig 4b however dissolved fe ii concentrations were quite low along the flow path with the highest concentration of 0 07 mg l at around 6 km fig 4b dissolved as concentrations continuously increased from 4 91 μg l to a peak of 352 μg l at around 10 km and then decreased sharply to 86 3 μg l at around 10 5 km which subsequently returned to around 300 μg l fig 4b although doc concentrations decreased significantly from 1 5 to 0 65 mg l in the first 6 5 km they gradually increased to around 2 2 mg l at the end of the flow path fig s4a similarly the hix of dom slightly decreased from around 3 to 1 at around 6 5 km and then greatly increased to around 10 at around 10 km fig s4b however the bix kept relatively constant of around 0 9 from 0 to 6 5 km and then decreased sharply to around 0 7 from around 6 5 to 11 5 km fig s4b the relative intensity of c1 component had a similar trend to the hix showing a steady level and then a sharply increasing trend fig s4c being different from the c1 component evolutions of the relative intensity of c2 showed a spoon like changing trend along the groundwater flow path fig s4c for the dom molecular signatures the aimod wa and dbewa values presented continuously increasing trends along the flow path while the h c wa showed the opposite trend fig s5a the numbers of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols also remarkably increased fig s5b analogous to as concentration fig 4b however the numbers of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds which mainly contained the labile organic components showed decreasing trends along the flow path fig s5c 4 discussion 4 1 dom molecules mobilized along the flow path the dom molecular compositions of the cg0 and ug0 samples were considered as the background dom characteristics of the confined and unconfined aquifers respectively each of the remaining eight cg samples and four ug samples was compared with their relevant background samples in terms of molecular compositions based on this molecular peaks that were commonly observed in the sample and the background sample were regarded as common compounds whereas the unique molecules relative to the background sample were regarded as mobilized compounds during water rock interactions the total number of the mobilized compounds in the ug samples increased from 1179 in the ug1 to 2571 in the ug4 along the flow path fig s6a among them highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds were the most abundant compounds that were mobilized during groundwater flushing which accounted for 80 2 to 88 5 of the total mobilized compounds fig s6a these compounds were generally considered as labile organic matter which can be as carbon sources and electron donors for microbial growth mladenov et al 2010 2015 qiao et al 2021 although abundant organic compounds with varied o c ratios were mobilized in the ug samples along the flow path the numbers of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds among them were typically low fig s7a the relative abundance of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds ranged from 11 5 to 19 8 furthermore there was no obviously changing trend in the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds along the flow path in the unconfined aquifer although their abundances in the ug4 were relatively higher fig s7a in the cg samples the total number of the mobilized compounds increased from 767 in the cg1 to 2068 in the cg8 along the flow path fig s6b in addition the average intensity of these mobilized compounds increased from 5 52 106 in the cg1 to 1 07 107 in the cg8 fig 5 b molecules with low h c ratio typically lower than 1 0 and o c ratio typically lower than 0 67 covered the majority of these mobilized organic compounds typically as polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds fig s6b being different from highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds in the ug samples fig s6a the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds accounted for 31 7 58 9 of the total number of the mobilized compounds in the cg samples in addition these mobilized molecules mostly had o c ratio 0 67 which were consistently peaked at o c ratio of around 0 3 fig s7b organic molecules with o c ratio 0 67 were considered to be readily adsorbed onto fe iii oxides lv et al 2018 the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols with o c ratio 0 67 was thus calculated both the number and intensity of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds with o c ratio 0 67 generally increased along the flow path fig 6 the results indicate that the cg samples are gradually enriched in more complex structures and higher aromaticity organic compounds with relatively low o c ratio and high dbe values which are resistant to microbial biodegradation kim et al 2004 2006 baldock and smernik 2002 chen et al 2018 4 2 processes mobilizing unique dom molecules along the flow path the differences in groundwater temperature ph and sediment age may explain the discrepancies of the mobilized dom molecules between the ug and the cg samples the cg samples had much higher temperature and ph values than the ug samples fig 2 which are likely conducive to mobilizing the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples significantly positive correlations between temperature and the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics r 0 79 p 0 001 fig 7 a and polyphenols with o c ratio 0 67 r 0 79 p 0 001 fig 7b were observed in the studied samples similarly groundwater ph values also showed good positive correlations with the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics r 0 71 p 0 005 fig 7c and polyphenols r 0 59 p 0 025 fig 7d with o c ratio 0 67 in the ug samples the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols accounted for less than around 20 of the unique organic compounds that were mobilized along the flow path fig s6a however they occupied up to around 60 of the total mobilized organic compounds in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph actually both groundwater temperature and ph showed increasing trends in the confined aquifers along the flow path fig 4a analogous to the evolutions of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols fig 6 roth et al 2015 indicate that dom molecular compositions are universally influenced by temperature and ph previous studies have found that the aromaticity of om increases with the increased temperature li et al 2013 chen et al 2018 and the abundances of polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics increase with increased ph roth et al 2015 li et al 2018 ding et al 2020 being highly analogous to the higher hix fig s2 and abundances of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols fig s3 in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph geothermal groundwater was reported to be associated with higher aromaticity than low temperature groundwater kovács et al 2012 more specifically the o c ratios of dom in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph were lower than those in the ug samples fig s3 the possible reason may be that the o containing functional groups are destroyed with increased groundwater temperature kovács et al 2012 and ph roth et al 2015 by using the ft icr ms technique chen et al 2018 showed that the o c ratio and the abundances of amino sugars peptides and carbohydrates of incubated dom decreased but the proportions of lignin condensed aromatics and tannins increased to a larger extent in the warmer incubation system relative to the colder one chen et al 2018 two mechanisms may explain these phenomena 1 microbial decomposition of labile dom and 2 release of recalcitrant som under elevated temperature and ph numerous studies suggest that organic carbon mineralization rates are significantly increased with the increased temperature benbi et al 2014 moinet et al 2018 and ph andersson and nilsson 2001 ye et al 2012 roth et al 2015 temperature has been implicated as an important factor controlling the biogeochemical reaction rate in deeply buried aquifers burdige 2011 according to the van t hoff equation an increase in temperature by around 10 c may increase the reaction rate by a factor of around 2 3 dunalska et al 2012 westermann 1996 even found that microbial activities may increase by 6 5 times when groundwater temperature increased by 10 c furthermore higher ph values may induce higher level of diversity and richness of microbes in sediments fierer and jackson 2006 seward et al 2020 which facilitate a variety of microorganisms being delivered into groundwater and consuming the labile organic pools preferential consumption of the labile dom may lead to the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols as observed in the hetao basin qiao et al 2021 however this may not be the case in the confined aquifer of guide basin supported by variations of doc concentrations and molecular properties doc concentrations increased by a factor of around three from 0 65 mg l at 6 5 km to 2 2 mg l at the end of the flow path fig s4a with the number of recalcitrant molecules increasing by around eight times from 177 to 1598 fig s5b in comparison the number of the relatively labile dom molecules only decreased by around 12 from 2593 to around 2278 along the flow path fig s5c the less extent of labile dom consumption cannot account for the higher doc concentrations and largely enriched recalcitrant dom molecules in the confined aquifer therefore relative enrichment of the recalcitrant molecules may not be due to labile dom consumption in the confined aquifer the som could be the potential source of those recalcitrant dom release of som into groundwater can be enhanced by elevated temperature kaiser et al 2001 and ph kleber et al 2015 typically polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols that are resistant to microbial consumption kim et al 2006 in extraction experiments higher temperature and ph may not extract more om than the control ones but aromaticity of extracted om generally increases with the extraction temperature and ph li et al 2013 this reason may be that more aromatic containing compounds are released during the extraction similarly the recalcitrant dom is readily to be adsorbed on the sediment surface in unconfined aquifers with lower temperature and ph while elevated temperature and ph in confined aquifers facilitate the release of recalcitrant om into groundwater xu and saiers 2010 grybos et al 2009 showed that ph elevation contributes to more than 60 of total released om via desorption whereas the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides contributes to much lesser of around 18 with the released om mostly as aromatic containing molecules the sediment age may be another important factor responsible for the different dom molecular compositions between the ug and cg samples a lot of labile organic molecules were found in the mobilized dom of the ug samples hosted in the holocene aquifer while the mobilized recalcitrant organic compounds were enriched in the cg samples hosted in the pliocene aquifer fig 5 lower h cwa qiao et al 2021 o cwa ohno et al 2014 and noscwa larowe and van cappellen et al 2011 of dom in the cg samples relative to those in the ug samples fig s3 also indicate that dom in the cg samples was less labile such patterns of generous recalcitrant organic compounds observed in the confined aquifers may be attributed to release of recalcitrant som into groundwater and the lack of the external inputs it is believed that the majority of the labile som has been consumed after millions of geological period gao et al 2020a such as in an anoxic pliocene aquifer hence recalcitrant som compounds are left in the confined aquifers which are subsequently mobilized during groundwater flushing especially at elevated temperature and ph conditions therefore the second mechanism was more plausible to explain evolution of organic molecules along the flow path in the confined aquifer the ug samples had near neutral ph and relatively low temperature fig 2 with highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds covering 80 of the total mobilized organic compounds fig s6a these may be due to low microbial activity under low groundwater temperature and ph andersson and nilsson 2001 or infiltration of surface water dom enriched in these labile molecules kellerman et al 2015 4 3 factors controlling arsenic concentrations groundwater geochemistry dom optical properties and dom molecular signatures were used in the pca as environmental factors four principle components influencing as enrichment were identified table s2 among them the first two pcs explain 70 of the variance of these samples suggesting linear relationships among the variables sleighter et al 2010 results show that high and low as groundwater 50 μg l is clearly separated into two groups fig 8 low as groundwaters including five ug samples and two cg samples are mainly plotted in the negative end of pca1 while high as groundwater typically spread to its positive end fig 8 these environmental factors are clearly differentiated into two groups one scatters to the low as groundwater group mainly including eh values hco3 concentrations bix c2 c3 h c wa o c wa and the numbers of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds the other points to the high as groundwater group including ph temperature nh4 concentrations hix c1 dbe wa aimod wa and the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols the latter one shows significantly positive correlations with groundwater as concentrations table s3 high ph should be conducive to as desorption in the confined aquifers this could be evidenced by the good positive correlation between as concentrations and groundwater ph r 0 94 p 0 0001 table s3 and the similar increasing trends of as concentration and groundwater ph in the cg samples along the groundwater flow path fig 4 it is consistent with our previous investigation showing as enrichment in groundwater with high ph in the guide basin wang et al 2018b generally both as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments gao et al 2020b natural fe iii oxides giménez et al 2007 and synthesized fe iii oxides dixit and hering 2003 decreases with increasing alkaline ph at alkaline ph the electrostatic repulsion between the surface of fe iii oxides and as is due to the fact that the surface of fe iii oxide could carry more negative charges which greatly promotes as desorption into groundwater raven et al 1998 biswas et al 2014 a plenty of studies have suggested that high groundwater ph especially above 8 5 is responsible for as mobility smedley and kinniburgh 2002 naseem and mcarthur 2018 podgorski et al 2017 deng et al 2018 the good positive correlation between as concentration and groundwater temperature r 0 89 p 0 0001 table s3 and the similar increasing trends of groundwater temperature and as concentrations in the cg samples along the flow path fig 4b support that high temperature promoted as mobility in the guide basin high groundwater temperature decreases as adsorption and increases reaction kinetics and microbial activities jesußek et al 2012 arsenic adsorption on sediment surfaces is reported to be temperature dependent el batouti et al 2003 when groundwater temperature increases from 11 to 25 c as concentration increases significantly due to desorption under higher temperature kersten and vlasova 2009 bonte et al 2013 groundwater temperatures in the cg samples are higher than those of high as groundwaters in the hetao basin guo et al 2016 the datong basin xie et al 2013 and india and bangladesh chakraborti et al 2016 relatively high temperature in the cg samples significantly promoted as desorption from reservoir host rocks guo et al 2020 although microbial activities would be more active with increased temperature andersson and nilsson 2001 labile dom degradation may not be an important trigger for as enrichment in the confined aquifer this is supported by 1 the relatively constant abundances of the labile dom molecules fig s5c and 2 the low dissolved fe ii and hco3 concentrations fig 2 and limited secondary fe ii mineral precipitation observed in the high as cg samples which may be indicative of less extent of om degradation in the cg aquifer the saturation indices of siderite and mackinawite were calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 which turned out to be far from saturation sisiderite 0 4 simackinawite 1 in the cg samples therefore no siderite and mackinawite precipitation are favored in the confined aquifer these may suggest that fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by labile om degradation should be insignificant in relative to the hot spring water dissolved as concentrations in the cg samples are rather higher but concentrations of li and b are around thousand times lower wang et al 2018b therefore groundwater as in the cg samples should be not directly sourced from geothermal water wang et al 2018b recently lone et al 2020 indicate that high groundwater as concentrations in a high altitude bedrock aquifer are not affected by hot springs by utilizing δ7li rowland et al 2011 evidenced that geothermal groundwater as in the pannonian basin is not from external input but is released from internal geochemical processes the evolutions of optical properties and molecular signatures of groundwater dom in the cg samples support that the recalcitrant organic compounds are linked to as mobilization good positive correlations between as concentrations and hix dbe wa aimod wa and the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols as shown in table s3 suggest that the recalcitrant and humic like compounds may contribute to as mobilization via electron shuttling complexation and competition for surface sites schittich et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 along the groundwater flow path groundwater as concentration gradually increased fig 4 accompanied by increases in hix and proportions of c1 component of dom in the cg samples fig s4 the dbe wa and aimod wa values and the numbers of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples also increased along the flow path fig s5 especially the number of these recalcitrant compounds with o c ratio 0 67 fig s7b this concurs with the result by lv et al 2018 showing that phenols and polyphenol compounds with 0 4 o c 0 67 made major contribution to the electron donating capacity of humic substances recently both tan et al 2017 and lacroix et al 2020 have found that increasing temperature may increase the electron accepting capacities eac of soil humic substances even under long term warming conditions i e 5 c higher for 15 years lacroix et al 2020 the eac values are found to be positively correlated with the aromaticity of dom kulkarni et al 2018 the quinone functional groups are reported to contribute primarily to the eac values which are also the functional groups shuttling electrons during fe iii oxide reduction stern et al 2018 higher eac values are associated with higher fe iii oxide reduction rates bai et al 2020 therefore the electron shuttling ability of dom in the cg samples may be further enhanced by the elevated temperature which thus promotes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and as mobility mladenov et al 2010 2015 chen et al 2017 many studies have suggested that humic substances presenting in reducing groundwater may greatly promote as mobilization chen et al 2017 gillispie et al 2016 li et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 schittich et al 2018 furthermore the complexation ability of humus with dissolved as is related to aromatic contents of groundwater dom fujii et al 2014 especially polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols with high dbe value lv et al 2016 huang et al 2019 these mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules may also compete for adsorption sites with as bauer and blodau 2006 coward et al 2018 kothawala et al 2012 mcdonough et al 2020a further promoting as mobility the high abundances of polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in high as cg samples highlight the importance of these recalcitrant compounds as electron shuttling complexing and competitive agents in as mobilization in aquifers 5 conclusion the cg samples tapping the pliocene strata had much higher groundwater temperature ph and as concentration than the ug samples from the holocene strata by comparison the unique highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds were inclined to be mobilized in the as poor unconfined aquifer however the confined aquifer with much older sediment age tended to mobilize the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols along the groundwater flow path in the pliocene confined aquifer labile organic molecules were near completely depleted high groundwater ph and temperature may facilitate mobilization of both as and polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols these mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules are conducive to as mobility via electron shuttling complexation and competition the low fe ii concentrations and the limited secondary fe ii mineral precipitation suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides should play a minor role on as mobility this study provides molecular level evidences that polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols and as may be co mobilized under high temperature and ph

16996,organic matter om has been accepted as an important trigger fueling fe iii oxide reduction and arsenic release in the late pleistocene holocene anoxic aquifers whereas its fates and roles on arsenic mobility in the pliocene aquifer are unclear to fill this gap groundwaters from a confined pliocene aquifer cg and an unconfined holocene aquifer ug were sampled in the guide basin china to monitor evolutions of groundwater geochemistry and om molecular signatures along the groundwater flow path the outcomes showed that groundwater ph temperature and arsenic concentrations in the cg samples generally increased along the groundwater flow path which were much higher than those in the ug samples the numbers and intensities of recalcitrant molecules polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples remarkably increased along the path but relatively labile molecules highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds showed the opposite trends the arsenic poor 10 μg l ug samples contained more labile molecules than the arsenic rich cg samples high groundwater ph temperature and sediment age in the confined aquifers may be responsible for the selective mobilization of the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols the mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules may enhance arsenic release via electron shuttling complexation and competition furthermore high temperature and ph may also facilitate arsenic desorption the study provides molecular scale evidences that the mobilization of recalcitrant organic molecules and arsenic were concurrent in the geothermal confined groundwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pliocene aquifer geothermal arsenic recalcitrant organic molecules ft icr ms 1 introduction elevated arsenic as groundwaters have been world widely observed in river deltas and low lying inland basins guo et al 2014 typically in the late pleistocene holocene anoxic aquifers wang et al 2019 long term drinking high as groundwater 10 μg l may pose severe health consequences with an estimation of 94 to 220 million people being at the risk around the world podgorski and berg 2020 understanding as enrichment mechanisms meets the emergent demands for effective solution of this global threat zheng 2020 in the late pleistocene holocene anoxic aquifers microbially mediated reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides has been accepted as the primary mechanism of as mobility fendorf et al 2010 wang et al 2019 labile organic matter plays important roles in this process by acting as electron donors guo et al 2019 glodowska et al 2020 qiao et al 2020 the recalcitrant om may also be involved in as enrichment via electron shuttling competition with as for surface sites and complexation with as mladenov et al 2015 groundwater from the pliocene and older aquifers is typically considered as safe water sources where low as groundwater generally prevailed hasan et al 2009 hoque et al 2017 however high as groundwater is found at depths of 200 m in the pliocene aquifer in the mekong delta basin erban et al 2013 2014 the bengal basin micheal et al 2008 mukherjee et al 2011 the pannonian basin of hungary and romania rowland et al 2011 varsányi et al 2017 and the guide basin of china wang et al 2018b in the mekong delta basin they attribute the pervasive occurrence of as hazard in the pliocene aquifer to compaction of overlaying clay caused by extensive pumping which expels high as groundwater or as mobilizing solutes e g organic matter into deep aquifers erban et al 2013 2014 it is still unclear how the mobilized om facilitated as release in the pliocene aquifers although it is believed that organic matter should be rather refractory and the native labile om should be near completely depleted due to the decrease in the bioreactivity of om with sediment age and burial depth middelburg 1989 postma et al 2016 in this case the om degradation rates and fe iii oxide reduction rates should be extremely low gao et al 2020a therefore it still remains open how om is involved in as release processes in the pliocene aquifer identification of om molecules by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms provides important information on their elemental compositions and relevant reactivity towards bio geochemical processes in aquifers valle et al 2018 mcdonough et al 2020a 2020b by using ft icr ms we have firstly delineated om molecular signatures and their linkages to as mobility in the hetao basin qiao et al 2020 2021 in the typical late pleistocene aquifer the labile pools of water soluble sedimentary organic matter som qiao et al 2020 and the recalcitrant pools of dissolved organic matter dom qiao et al 2021 are found to be responsible for as mobility by acting as electron donors and electron shuttles respectively geothermal groundwater typically contained toxic level as concentrations grassi et al 2014 especially in the western latin america the usa japan turkey and new zealand guo et al 2012 wang et al 2018a knappett et al 2020 the temperature induced as mobility includes dissolutions of silicate minerals desorption som degradation and the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides schwenzer et al 2001 bonte et al 2013 the hydrolysis of silicate minerals may generate alkaline ph groundwater and thus facilitate as release in terms of desorption knappett et al 2020 furthermore om is inclined to be mobilized under high groundwater temperature and ph kleber et al 2015 chen et al 2018 although molecular compositions of the mobilized om are unclear since high temperature and ph could facilitate the enrichment of both dom and as in geothermal groundwater we may speculate that the enrichment of the two kinds of species is concurrent because of the thermal quenching effect on fluorescence intensity of dom baker 2005 carstea et al 2014 the ft icr ms technique may provide more reliable information on the intrinsic dom properties of the geothermal groundwater nevertheless few studies have investigated molecular characteristics of dom in geothermal high as groundwater kovács et al 2010 2012 the guide basin is a special inland basin hosting high as groundwater where as enrichment in the deep confined pliocene aquifer has been reported liao et al 2013 wang et al 2018b the deep confined groundwater has been used for drinking water in the guide basin since 1978 where more than 59 000 people were being at risk shi et al 2010 in the guide basin as is not believed to be directly sourced from geothermal water in the studied groundwater from the confined aquifer since hot springs contain low as concentrations there zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2018b geochemical processes may be conducive to as mobility in this aquifer therefore investigation of the evolution of dom and its roles in as mobility in geothermal groundwater from deep pliocene aquifer at the molecular scale can be done in the guide basin the study aims to 1 delineate the differences in molecular level compositions of dom between the unconfined and confined groundwater samples 2 identify geochemical processes controlling dom molecular evolutions along a groundwater flow path and 3 evaluate roles of dom molecules in as mobility in the confined aquifer 2 materials and methods 2 1 the study area the guide basin is situated between the longyang and songba gorges in the upper reaches of the yellow river in the qinghai province of china fig 1 a the basin is bordered by mountains to the north and the south with an average elevation of around 3100 m elevation of the basin ranges from around 2200 to 2500 m above the sea level the yellow river traverses through the basin which drains the basin together with its tributaries yan et al 2005 the guide basin is a typical cenozoic basin filled with neozoic clasts with a thickness of 1000 m yan et al 2005 borehole drilling data show that stratigraphy is generally characterized as holocene and pliocene strata along the hydrological section i ii figs 1b and c the holocene strata are mainly composed of loamy sand and well rounded gravel sand with a thickness of 32 m wang et al 2018b which host shallow unconfined groundwater at depth 32 m below the land surface bls fig 1c the pliocene strata lying beneath the holocene aquifer consist of grey brown grey and maroon mudstone sandy mudstone and sandstone with a thickness of 200 m pores and fractures widely occur in the sandstone layers where deep confined groundwater is mainly distributed at depths between 100 and 310 m bls fig 1c the hydraulic connections between the unconfined and confined aquifer are poor since thick mudstone layers act as aquitards between the unconfined and confined aquifers the hydrogeological profile is generally along the groundwater flow path of confined groundwater section i ii fig 1b being approximately perpendicular to the contour of the water head wang et al 2018b groundwater levels of the confined aquifer are from around 9 5 to 33 m above the land surface shi et al 2010 and gradually decline from the south to the north close to the yellow river with hydraulic gradients of around 1 wang et al 2018b both unconfined and confined groundwaters flow from the south near the mountain to the yellow river in the north fig 1b unconfined groundwater is mainly recharged by atmospheric precipitation and river water confined groundwater is mainly recharged from the bordered mountains around the guide basin and discharged via upward leakage in a compressional reverse fault near the yellow river fig 1c the confined groundwater temperature ranges from around 15 to 45 c within the depths of 100 to 450 m bls showing an average temperature gradient of around 1 c 15 m depth shi et al 2010 which is twice of the empirical geothermal gradient of 1 c 30 m lowell et al 2014 therefore the confined groundwater in the guide basin may be heated by both the geothermal gradient and geothermal fluid shi et al 2010 lowell et al 2014 2 2 water sampling and analysis according to our previous investigation of groundwater geochemistry in the study area wang et al 2018b fourteen representative groundwater samples including nine deep confined groundwater cg and five shallow unconfined groundwater ug samples were taken fig 1b to monitor the evolutions of groundwater geochemistry and dom molecular composition approximately along a groundwater flow path the whole distance of the groundwater flow path is close to 12 km fig 1c the cg samples were collected at depths of around 150 to 230 m bls except that the one at the beginning of the section cg0 had a depth of 30 m bls however the ug samples were taken from depths between 11 and 15 m bls groundwater was sampled after being pumped for more than 20 min until water temperature ph total dissolved solid tds electrical conductively ec and redox potential eh stabilized these parameters were monitored by a multi parameter portable instrument hanna hi 9828 in an in line flow cell concentrations of h2s nh4 and fe ii were determined in situ using a portable spectrophotometer hach dr2800 alkalinity was monitored with a model 16 900 digital titrator hach using a bromocresol green methyl red indicator all groundwater samples were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters in the fields except for samples for dissolved organic carbon doc detection and ft icr ms analysis through 0 45 μm poly tetra fluoroethylene ptfe syringe filters qiao et al 2020 for major cation and trace element analyses samples were collected in 100 ml acid washed polyethylene bottles and preserved with 6 m ultrapure hno3 at ph 2 0 however non acidified samples were collected in 10 ml high density polyethylene hdpe bottles for anion analysis sub samples for analysis of as species were collected in 2 ml amber glass bottles being preserved with 0 25 mol l edta 10 samples for doc and ft icr ms analyses were acidified with hydrochloric acid hcl p a grade merck germany ph 2 0 and stored in 40 and 150 ml acid washed amber glass bottles respectively for fluorescence spectroscopy detections samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass bottles unacidified the amber glass bottles were all burned at 500 c for 6 h in a muffle furnace prior to use concentrations of major cations and trace elements were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icap6300 thermo and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms 7500c agilent respectively with an analytical precision of 2 and a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 concentrations of anions including f cl no3 so4 2 and po4 3 were measured by an ion chromatography dx 120 dionex the ion charge imbalance of sample analysis was less than 5 concentration of as species was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometry hplc hg afs afs 9130 titan with detection limits of 2 and 4 μg l for as iii and as v respectively and a relative standard deviation rsd of 5 doc concentration was detected by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer 2 3 optical indices and parafac modeling optical properties of dom were measured by a 10 nm path length uv visible spectrophotometer uv8100 labtech ltd and a fluromax 4 spectrofluorometer jobin yvon horiba the datasets from fluorescence measurements were used to calculate biological index bix humification index hix and fluorescence index fi of groundwater dom we use the bix to monitor biological properties and sources of dom hix to reflect humification and sources of dom huguet et al 2009 and fi to discriminate sources of humic substances in dom mcknight et al 2001 details on calculations of bix hix and fi can be found in guo et al 2019 the excitation emission matrix eem spectra of groundwater samples were collected for parallel factor analysis parafac the method of parafac modeling was analogous to that in guo et al 2019 and can be found in the supporting information in general four parafac components were obtained from the analyses fig s1 table s1 relative abundances of the four components were calculated from dividing the intensity of each component by the sum of absolute intensities of all components which are expressed as c1 c2 c3 and c4 2 4 ft icr ms analysis and data processing after pretreated with solid phase extraction groundwater dom was measured for molecular composition by a 9 4 t apex ultra ft icr ms equipment he et al 2020 details of the detecting procedures were described in qiao et al 2020 and are provided in the supporting information the identified peaks primarily contained c h o n and s atoms with p atom showing much lower abundances 0 5 therefore molecules containing c h o n and s atoms were included for calculating dom molecular signatures in the study in the study each dom molecular formula refers to specific mass peak identified by the ft icr ms technique qiao et al 2020 the dom molecular composition can be divided into cho containing c h and o chon containing c h o and n chos containing c h o and s and chons containing c h o n and s double bond equivalent dbe koch and dittmar 2006 modified aromaticity index aimod koch and dittmar 2016 nominal oxidation state of carbon nosc values larowe and van cappellen 2011 and intensity weighted average values of these indices qiao et al 2021 were calculated details on calculations of dbe aimod nosc and intensity weighted average parameters are provided in the supporting information here the intensity weighted average double bond equivalent dbewa represents the sum of π bonds and rings in a molecule of dom with higher values showing wider diversities of compounds and more complex structure of dom molecules koch and dittmar 2006 the intensity weighted average nominal oxidation state of carbon noscwa represents the energy potential of the molecular complexes schmidt et al 2017 and the intensity weighted average modified aromaticity index aimod wa reflects the aromaticity of dom molecule based on the h c ratios and aimod values of organic formulas dom molecules can be classified into five organic groups in the van krevelen diagram seidel et al 2014 lv et al 2016 polycyclic aromatics aimod 0 66 polyphenols 0 5 aimod 0 66 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 1 5 aliphatic compounds 1 5 h c 2 and saturated compounds aimod 0 5 and h c 2 2 5 statistical analysis principal component analysis pca was performed to explore the linkage between

other studies sleighter et al 2010 xue et al 2011 he et al 2016 schittich et al 2018 the pca analysis was done using correlation matrix for decomposition in spss v20 the component matrix and relevant correlations of factors by the pca analysis are provided in tables s2 and s3 respectively a relationship with p value 0 05 indicates a significant correlation and r 0 represents a positive correlation 3 results 3 1 groundwater geochemistry geochemical characteristics of the cg and ug samples are summarized in table 1 and fig 2 the total dissolved solid tds concentrations ranged between 272 and 835 mg l median 503 mg l in the cg samples which were slightly lower than those in the ug samples 272 719 mg l median 675 mg l table 1 sodium and hco3 were the major cation and anion in the cg samples while ca2 and hco3 predominated in the ug samples respectively the cg samples had temperatures from 12 2 to 20 3 c median 17 4 c significantly higher than the ug samples from 10 1 to 15 0 c median 11 3 c p 0 002 fig 2 groundwater samples in the cg group were weakly alkaline with ph from 7 4 to 8 9 median 8 53 while in the ug group were near neutral with ph from 6 89 to 7 77 median 7 01 the eh values in the cg samples median 121 mv were remarkably lower than those in the ug samples median 350 mv the hco3 concentrations in the cg samples median 287 mg l were significantly lower than those in the ug samples median 470 mg l p 0 019 fig 2 the cg samples had co3 2 concentrations between 0 3 and 36 mg l median 16 5 mg l due to high ph while they were below the detection limit 0 3 mg l in the ug samples the median nh4 concentration in the cg samples 0 3 mg l was one order of magnitude higher than that in the ug samples 0 03 mg l although fe ii concentrations were remarkably low in both the cg median 0 01 mg l and the ug samples median 0 06 mg l groundwater as concentrations had a wide range from 3 81 to 356 μg l median 15 8 μg l high dissolved as concentration 10 μg l was generally observed in the cg samples with more than 85 of the total as being as iii species however all the ug samples had as concentrations lower than 10 μg l fig 2 the cg samples had a wider range but lower concentrations of doc median 0 92 mg l than the ug samples median 1 52 mg l table 1 fig 2 in total groundwater temperature ph nh4 and as concentrations in the cg samples were significantly higher than those in the ug samples while hco3 concentrations are significantly lower in the cg than in the ug samples p 0 05 fig 2 3 2 dom optical properties the cg samples had a much wider range 1 15 10 6 and higher median value of hix 6 24 than the ug samples 1 69 4 05 median 3 19 fig s2 on the contrary bix values of groundwater dom in the cg samples median 0 705 were lower than those of the ug samples median 0 874 it indicates that dom had higher humification degree in the cg samples while that in the ug samples was of higher bioreactivity four different fluorescent components were obtained for all groundwater samples by parafac modeling fig s1 which were comparable to other studies table s1 among them c1 and c4 were characterized as terrestrial humic like components and c3 as a microbial humic like component while c2 was a protein like component as shown in fig s2 the relative intensity of c1 in the cg samples was significantly higher p 0 019 with c2 c3 and c4 components were less abundant relative to the ug samples this indicates that the cg samples had more terrestrial humic like organic components with higher aromaticity however the ug samples had higher relative intensities of c2 c3 and c4 components which are in line with the results of uv visible spectrophotometer 3 3 dom molecular signatures molecular compositions of dom in the cg and ug samples from the ft icr ms are shown in figs 3 and s3 there were 2759 to 4309 formulas identified in the cg samples which were comparable to those in the ug samples with 1950 to 4415 formulas p 1 0 fig s3 for these dom formulas the intensity weighted average h c h cwa intensity weighted average o c o cwa and intensity weighted average nosc noscwa in the cg samples showed wider ranges but lower median values than those in the ug samples fig s3 however the intensity weighted average dbe values dbewa and intensity weighted average values of aimod aimod wa in the cg samples were higher relative to those in the ug samples fig s3 the identified aliphatic compounds showed similar abundances in the cg median 254 and ug samples median 243 p 0 898 although they exhibited broader ranges in the ug samples fig s3 highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds were significantly enriched in the ug median 2545 than those in the cg samples median 2138 p 0 002 while the cg samples contained more polycyclic aromatics median 338 vs 54 in the ug samples p 0 042 and polyphenols median 467 vs 335 in the ug samples fig s3 the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenol compounds in dom of the cg samples accounted for 6 38 43 2 median 24 4 of the total identified peak numbers which was around two times as high as that in the ug samples median 12 9 the richness of the cho and chontot compounds in cg samples was similar to that in ug samples table 1 the sum of cho and chontot compounds were the most abundant formulas in the dom of both cg and ug samples accounting for 78 93 of the total identified organic molecules table 1 among the chontot compounds the chon1 compounds showed much higher richness than the chon2 and chon3 compounds which accounted for around 48 62 of the peak numbers of chontot formulas the dom in the cg and ug samples had similar abundances of chos formulas median 250 in the cg vs 231 in the ug samples and chons formulas median 89 in the cg vs 92 in the ug samples table 1 overall little differences in dom elemental compositions were observed between the cg and the ug samples 3 4 variations of dom molecular composition in confined aquifer along the flow path nine cg samples approximately along the profile fig 1 were monitored to illustrate the evolutions of groundwater geochemistry fig 4 and dom optical and molecular compositions figs s4 s5 along the groundwater flow path groundwater ph increased from around 7 4 to 8 8 and then slightly decreased to around 8 4 however groundwater temperature exhibited an ascending trend from around 12 to 20 c fig 4a dissolved nh4 increased from 0 01 mg l to a plateau of around 0 4 mg l along the flow path which peaked up to 0 7 mg l at around 10 5 km fig 4b however dissolved fe ii concentrations were quite low along the flow path with the highest concentration of 0 07 mg l at around 6 km fig 4b dissolved as concentrations continuously increased from 4 91 μg l to a peak of 352 μg l at around 10 km and then decreased sharply to 86 3 μg l at around 10 5 km which subsequently returned to around 300 μg l fig 4b although doc concentrations decreased significantly from 1 5 to 0 65 mg l in the first 6 5 km they gradually increased to around 2 2 mg l at the end of the flow path fig s4a similarly the hix of dom slightly decreased from around 3 to 1 at around 6 5 km and then greatly increased to around 10 at around 10 km fig s4b however the bix kept relatively constant of around 0 9 from 0 to 6 5 km and then decreased sharply to around 0 7 from around 6 5 to 11 5 km fig s4b the relative intensity of c1 component had a similar trend to the hix showing a steady level and then a sharply increasing trend fig s4c being different from the c1 component evolutions of the relative intensity of c2 showed a spoon like changing trend along the groundwater flow path fig s4c for the dom molecular signatures the aimod wa and dbewa values presented continuously increasing trends along the flow path while the h c wa showed the opposite trend fig s5a the numbers of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols also remarkably increased fig s5b analogous to as concentration fig 4b however the numbers of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds which mainly contained the labile organic components showed decreasing trends along the flow path fig s5c 4 discussion 4 1 dom molecules mobilized along the flow path the dom molecular compositions of the cg0 and ug0 samples were considered as the background dom characteristics of the confined and unconfined aquifers respectively each of the remaining eight cg samples and four ug samples was compared with their relevant background samples in terms of molecular compositions based on this molecular peaks that were commonly observed in the sample and the background sample were regarded as common compounds whereas the unique molecules relative to the background sample were regarded as mobilized compounds during water rock interactions the total number of the mobilized compounds in the ug samples increased from 1179 in the ug1 to 2571 in the ug4 along the flow path fig s6a among them highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds were the most abundant compounds that were mobilized during groundwater flushing which accounted for 80 2 to 88 5 of the total mobilized compounds fig s6a these compounds were generally considered as labile organic matter which can be as carbon sources and electron donors for microbial growth mladenov et al 2010 2015 qiao et al 2021 although abundant organic compounds with varied o c ratios were mobilized in the ug samples along the flow path the numbers of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds among them were typically low fig s7a the relative abundance of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds ranged from 11 5 to 19 8 furthermore there was no obviously changing trend in the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds along the flow path in the unconfined aquifer although their abundances in the ug4 were relatively higher fig s7a in the cg samples the total number of the mobilized compounds increased from 767 in the cg1 to 2068 in the cg8 along the flow path fig s6b in addition the average intensity of these mobilized compounds increased from 5 52 106 in the cg1 to 1 07 107 in the cg8 fig 5 b molecules with low h c ratio typically lower than 1 0 and o c ratio typically lower than 0 67 covered the majority of these mobilized organic compounds typically as polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds fig s6b being different from highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds in the ug samples fig s6a the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds accounted for 31 7 58 9 of the total number of the mobilized compounds in the cg samples in addition these mobilized molecules mostly had o c ratio 0 67 which were consistently peaked at o c ratio of around 0 3 fig s7b organic molecules with o c ratio 0 67 were considered to be readily adsorbed onto fe iii oxides lv et al 2018 the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols with o c ratio 0 67 was thus calculated both the number and intensity of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols compounds with o c ratio 0 67 generally increased along the flow path fig 6 the results indicate that the cg samples are gradually enriched in more complex structures and higher aromaticity organic compounds with relatively low o c ratio and high dbe values which are resistant to microbial biodegradation kim et al 2004 2006 baldock and smernik 2002 chen et al 2018 4 2 processes mobilizing unique dom molecules along the flow path the differences in groundwater temperature ph and sediment age may explain the discrepancies of the mobilized dom molecules between the ug and the cg samples the cg samples had much higher temperature and ph values than the ug samples fig 2 which are likely conducive to mobilizing the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples significantly positive correlations between temperature and the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics r 0 79 p 0 001 fig 7 a and polyphenols with o c ratio 0 67 r 0 79 p 0 001 fig 7b were observed in the studied samples similarly groundwater ph values also showed good positive correlations with the number of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics r 0 71 p 0 005 fig 7c and polyphenols r 0 59 p 0 025 fig 7d with o c ratio 0 67 in the ug samples the sum of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols accounted for less than around 20 of the unique organic compounds that were mobilized along the flow path fig s6a however they occupied up to around 60 of the total mobilized organic compounds in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph actually both groundwater temperature and ph showed increasing trends in the confined aquifers along the flow path fig 4a analogous to the evolutions of the mobilized polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols fig 6 roth et al 2015 indicate that dom molecular compositions are universally influenced by temperature and ph previous studies have found that the aromaticity of om increases with the increased temperature li et al 2013 chen et al 2018 and the abundances of polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics increase with increased ph roth et al 2015 li et al 2018 ding et al 2020 being highly analogous to the higher hix fig s2 and abundances of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols fig s3 in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph geothermal groundwater was reported to be associated with higher aromaticity than low temperature groundwater kovács et al 2012 more specifically the o c ratios of dom in the cg samples with higher temperature and ph were lower than those in the ug samples fig s3 the possible reason may be that the o containing functional groups are destroyed with increased groundwater temperature kovács et al 2012 and ph roth et al 2015 by using the ft icr ms technique chen et al 2018 showed that the o c ratio and the abundances of amino sugars peptides and carbohydrates of incubated dom decreased but the proportions of lignin condensed aromatics and tannins increased to a larger extent in the warmer incubation system relative to the colder one chen et al 2018 two mechanisms may explain these phenomena 1 microbial decomposition of labile dom and 2 release of recalcitrant som under elevated temperature and ph numerous studies suggest that organic carbon mineralization rates are significantly increased with the increased temperature benbi et al 2014 moinet et al 2018 and ph andersson and nilsson 2001 ye et al 2012 roth et al 2015 temperature has been implicated as an important factor controlling the biogeochemical reaction rate in deeply buried aquifers burdige 2011 according to the van t hoff equation an increase in temperature by around 10 c may increase the reaction rate by a factor of around 2 3 dunalska et al 2012 westermann 1996 even found that microbial activities may increase by 6 5 times when groundwater temperature increased by 10 c furthermore higher ph values may induce higher level of diversity and richness of microbes in sediments fierer and jackson 2006 seward et al 2020 which facilitate a variety of microorganisms being delivered into groundwater and consuming the labile organic pools preferential consumption of the labile dom may lead to the accumulation of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols as observed in the hetao basin qiao et al 2021 however this may not be the case in the confined aquifer of guide basin supported by variations of doc concentrations and molecular properties doc concentrations increased by a factor of around three from 0 65 mg l at 6 5 km to 2 2 mg l at the end of the flow path fig s4a with the number of recalcitrant molecules increasing by around eight times from 177 to 1598 fig s5b in comparison the number of the relatively labile dom molecules only decreased by around 12 from 2593 to around 2278 along the flow path fig s5c the less extent of labile dom consumption cannot account for the higher doc concentrations and largely enriched recalcitrant dom molecules in the confined aquifer therefore relative enrichment of the recalcitrant molecules may not be due to labile dom consumption in the confined aquifer the som could be the potential source of those recalcitrant dom release of som into groundwater can be enhanced by elevated temperature kaiser et al 2001 and ph kleber et al 2015 typically polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols that are resistant to microbial consumption kim et al 2006 in extraction experiments higher temperature and ph may not extract more om than the control ones but aromaticity of extracted om generally increases with the extraction temperature and ph li et al 2013 this reason may be that more aromatic containing compounds are released during the extraction similarly the recalcitrant dom is readily to be adsorbed on the sediment surface in unconfined aquifers with lower temperature and ph while elevated temperature and ph in confined aquifers facilitate the release of recalcitrant om into groundwater xu and saiers 2010 grybos et al 2009 showed that ph elevation contributes to more than 60 of total released om via desorption whereas the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides contributes to much lesser of around 18 with the released om mostly as aromatic containing molecules the sediment age may be another important factor responsible for the different dom molecular compositions between the ug and cg samples a lot of labile organic molecules were found in the mobilized dom of the ug samples hosted in the holocene aquifer while the mobilized recalcitrant organic compounds were enriched in the cg samples hosted in the pliocene aquifer fig 5 lower h cwa qiao et al 2021 o cwa ohno et al 2014 and noscwa larowe and van cappellen et al 2011 of dom in the cg samples relative to those in the ug samples fig s3 also indicate that dom in the cg samples was less labile such patterns of generous recalcitrant organic compounds observed in the confined aquifers may be attributed to release of recalcitrant som into groundwater and the lack of the external inputs it is believed that the majority of the labile som has been consumed after millions of geological period gao et al 2020a such as in an anoxic pliocene aquifer hence recalcitrant som compounds are left in the confined aquifers which are subsequently mobilized during groundwater flushing especially at elevated temperature and ph conditions therefore the second mechanism was more plausible to explain evolution of organic molecules along the flow path in the confined aquifer the ug samples had near neutral ph and relatively low temperature fig 2 with highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds covering 80 of the total mobilized organic compounds fig s6a these may be due to low microbial activity under low groundwater temperature and ph andersson and nilsson 2001 or infiltration of surface water dom enriched in these labile molecules kellerman et al 2015 4 3 factors controlling arsenic concentrations groundwater geochemistry dom optical properties and dom molecular signatures were used in the pca as environmental factors four principle components influencing as enrichment were identified table s2 among them the first two pcs explain 70 of the variance of these samples suggesting linear relationships among the variables sleighter et al 2010 results show that high and low as groundwater 50 μg l is clearly separated into two groups fig 8 low as groundwaters including five ug samples and two cg samples are mainly plotted in the negative end of pca1 while high as groundwater typically spread to its positive end fig 8 these environmental factors are clearly differentiated into two groups one scatters to the low as groundwater group mainly including eh values hco3 concentrations bix c2 c3 h c wa o c wa and the numbers of highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds the other points to the high as groundwater group including ph temperature nh4 concentrations hix c1 dbe wa aimod wa and the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols the latter one shows significantly positive correlations with groundwater as concentrations table s3 high ph should be conducive to as desorption in the confined aquifers this could be evidenced by the good positive correlation between as concentrations and groundwater ph r 0 94 p 0 0001 table s3 and the similar increasing trends of as concentration and groundwater ph in the cg samples along the groundwater flow path fig 4 it is consistent with our previous investigation showing as enrichment in groundwater with high ph in the guide basin wang et al 2018b generally both as v and as iii adsorption onto aquifer sediments gao et al 2020b natural fe iii oxides giménez et al 2007 and synthesized fe iii oxides dixit and hering 2003 decreases with increasing alkaline ph at alkaline ph the electrostatic repulsion between the surface of fe iii oxides and as is due to the fact that the surface of fe iii oxide could carry more negative charges which greatly promotes as desorption into groundwater raven et al 1998 biswas et al 2014 a plenty of studies have suggested that high groundwater ph especially above 8 5 is responsible for as mobility smedley and kinniburgh 2002 naseem and mcarthur 2018 podgorski et al 2017 deng et al 2018 the good positive correlation between as concentration and groundwater temperature r 0 89 p 0 0001 table s3 and the similar increasing trends of groundwater temperature and as concentrations in the cg samples along the flow path fig 4b support that high temperature promoted as mobility in the guide basin high groundwater temperature decreases as adsorption and increases reaction kinetics and microbial activities jesußek et al 2012 arsenic adsorption on sediment surfaces is reported to be temperature dependent el batouti et al 2003 when groundwater temperature increases from 11 to 25 c as concentration increases significantly due to desorption under higher temperature kersten and vlasova 2009 bonte et al 2013 groundwater temperatures in the cg samples are higher than those of high as groundwaters in the hetao basin guo et al 2016 the datong basin xie et al 2013 and india and bangladesh chakraborti et al 2016 relatively high temperature in the cg samples significantly promoted as desorption from reservoir host rocks guo et al 2020 although microbial activities would be more active with increased temperature andersson and nilsson 2001 labile dom degradation may not be an important trigger for as enrichment in the confined aquifer this is supported by 1 the relatively constant abundances of the labile dom molecules fig s5c and 2 the low dissolved fe ii and hco3 concentrations fig 2 and limited secondary fe ii mineral precipitation observed in the high as cg samples which may be indicative of less extent of om degradation in the cg aquifer the saturation indices of siderite and mackinawite were calculated using phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 which turned out to be far from saturation sisiderite 0 4 simackinawite 1 in the cg samples therefore no siderite and mackinawite precipitation are favored in the confined aquifer these may suggest that fe iii oxide reduction stimulated by labile om degradation should be insignificant in relative to the hot spring water dissolved as concentrations in the cg samples are rather higher but concentrations of li and b are around thousand times lower wang et al 2018b therefore groundwater as in the cg samples should be not directly sourced from geothermal water wang et al 2018b recently lone et al 2020 indicate that high groundwater as concentrations in a high altitude bedrock aquifer are not affected by hot springs by utilizing δ7li rowland et al 2011 evidenced that geothermal groundwater as in the pannonian basin is not from external input but is released from internal geochemical processes the evolutions of optical properties and molecular signatures of groundwater dom in the cg samples support that the recalcitrant organic compounds are linked to as mobilization good positive correlations between as concentrations and hix dbe wa aimod wa and the number of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols as shown in table s3 suggest that the recalcitrant and humic like compounds may contribute to as mobilization via electron shuttling complexation and competition for surface sites schittich et al 2018 qiao et al 2021 along the groundwater flow path groundwater as concentration gradually increased fig 4 accompanied by increases in hix and proportions of c1 component of dom in the cg samples fig s4 the dbe wa and aimod wa values and the numbers of polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols in the cg samples also increased along the flow path fig s5 especially the number of these recalcitrant compounds with o c ratio 0 67 fig s7b this concurs with the result by lv et al 2018 showing that phenols and polyphenol compounds with 0 4 o c 0 67 made major contribution to the electron donating capacity of humic substances recently both tan et al 2017 and lacroix et al 2020 have found that increasing temperature may increase the electron accepting capacities eac of soil humic substances even under long term warming conditions i e 5 c higher for 15 years lacroix et al 2020 the eac values are found to be positively correlated with the aromaticity of dom kulkarni et al 2018 the quinone functional groups are reported to contribute primarily to the eac values which are also the functional groups shuttling electrons during fe iii oxide reduction stern et al 2018 higher eac values are associated with higher fe iii oxide reduction rates bai et al 2020 therefore the electron shuttling ability of dom in the cg samples may be further enhanced by the elevated temperature which thus promotes the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides and as mobility mladenov et al 2010 2015 chen et al 2017 many studies have suggested that humic substances presenting in reducing groundwater may greatly promote as mobilization chen et al 2017 gillispie et al 2016 li et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 schittich et al 2018 furthermore the complexation ability of humus with dissolved as is related to aromatic contents of groundwater dom fujii et al 2014 especially polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols with high dbe value lv et al 2016 huang et al 2019 these mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules may also compete for adsorption sites with as bauer and blodau 2006 coward et al 2018 kothawala et al 2012 mcdonough et al 2020a further promoting as mobility the high abundances of polyphenols and polycyclic aromatics in high as cg samples highlight the importance of these recalcitrant compounds as electron shuttling complexing and competitive agents in as mobilization in aquifers 5 conclusion the cg samples tapping the pliocene strata had much higher groundwater temperature ph and as concentration than the ug samples from the holocene strata by comparison the unique highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and aliphatic compounds were inclined to be mobilized in the as poor unconfined aquifer however the confined aquifer with much older sediment age tended to mobilize the unique polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols along the groundwater flow path in the pliocene confined aquifer labile organic molecules were near completely depleted high groundwater ph and temperature may facilitate mobilization of both as and polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols these mobilized recalcitrant organic molecules are conducive to as mobility via electron shuttling complexation and competition the low fe ii concentrations and the limited secondary fe ii mineral precipitation suggest that the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxides should play a minor role on as mobility this study provides molecular level evidences that polycyclic aromatics and polyphenols and as may be co mobilized under high temperature and ph

16997,antimicrobial resistance continues to be a rising global threat to public health it is well recognized that wastewater treatment plants are reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args however traditional disinfection techniques are not effective to simultaneously remove arb and args and the dynamic analysis of arb inactivation have also been deficient in this study sulfidated nano zerovalent iron s nzvi coupled with persulfate ps was applied to simultaneously remove both arb e coli k 12 with rp4 plasmid and args extra and intracellular args s nzvi ps completely inactivated arb 7 8 log reduction within 10 min and degraded all extracellular args 8 0 log reduction within 5 min these efficiencies were significantly higher decay rate constant k 0 138 min 1 than those achieved individually s nzvi k 0 076 min 1 ps k 0 008 min 1 implying a synergistic effect between s nzvi and ps against arb and args the efficient removal rate of arb was also supported by confocal microscopy and microfluidics at a single cell level the complete inactivation of arb by s nzvi ps was also demonstrated in real drinking water and real wastewater effluent that contained natural organic matter and suspended solids regrowth assays showed that the treated arb was not observed after 72 h or longer incubation suggesting that arb was permanently inactivated by radicals such as so4 and oh the destruction of bacterial cells compromised the removal efficiency of the intracellular args with only 4 0 log reduction after 60 min treatment by s nzvi ps collectively our results suggest the feasibility of s nzvi coupled with ps for simultaneous arb and args removal in real water matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes disinfection nano zerovalent iron nzvi radicals 1 introduction the spread of antibiotic resistance has become a global challenge in the 21st century it is annually estimated that 700 000 death results from bacteria resistant infections and this data can be rising to 10 million by 2050 if there are no actions taken now o neill 2016 antibiotic resistance develops unprecedently fast because of antibiotics abuse for example a tertiary hospital in australia has seen that over 44 of escherichia coli e coli clinical isolates associated with urinary tract infections became resistant to ampicillin within five years 2009 2013 fasugba et al 2016 bacteria can survive antibiotic treatments and convert to antibiotic resistant bacteria arb through acquiring antibiotic resistance genes args that generally reside on mobile genetic elements including plasmid plasmids e g the broad range host rp4 with various args have been recovered from e coli species and enable their transfer across genus via horizontal gene transfer li et al 2016 thus both arb and args have been considered as emerging pollutants pruden et al 2006 which can be widely detected in water or wastewater treatment plants guo et al 2017b currently various disinfection processes such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation have been widely employed to remove pathogens from water and wastewater ding et al 2019 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 however their effectiveness towards arb and arg removal remains controversial and even contrary to the original intentions for example chlorine was found to only partially inactivate pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 under exposure to 4 mg l hypochlorite and enhance antibiotic resistance in pathogens hou et al 2019 it was also reported that chlorine increased the levels of both intra and extracellular args in the effluent of a full scale wastewater treatment plant liu et al 2018 this increases the demand of alternative approaches for permanent removal of both arb and args during disinfection so far various advanced oxidation processes have been proposed as alternatives to remove arb and args among them photocatalysis has been intensively developed for bacterial disinfection and the removal of args ahmed et al 2020 2021 however low removal efficiencies may compromise real applications of this technique towards arb and arg inactivation for example nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres 200 mg l only achieved 2 0 log reduction of e coli ndm 1 after 60 min of uva visible light photocatalytic inactivation li et al 2020 up to 4 0 log reduction of e coli puc19 was achieved after 6 h treatment with tetrapodal zno 1 g l under uv exposure hwangbo et al 2019 in addition this technique is a photo driven process which may not be practically feasible in conditions with low light transmission gohy and zhao 2013 furthermore the photoinduced pairs of electron and hole can be easily recombined or scavenged by organic matters to compromise reactive oxygen species ros production long et al 2017 photocatalysts could be deactivated because of either their heterogeneity or blocking activate sites during photocatalytic processes butt 2012 jeong et al 2020 low et al 2017 as a nano catalyzer nano zerovalent iron nzvi has been widely applied to achieve effective remediation of environmental pollutions in water soil and groundwater because of its high reactivity to produce diverse radicals via triggering heterogeneous fenton reactions vilardi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a that do not rely on photo driven conditions nevertheless nzvi particles tend to be aggregated and can be easily corroded by various natural reductant demand nrd including dissolved oxygen nitrate and water resulting in a rapid loss of its reactivity to preserve the reactivity and longevity sulfidation of nzvi with reducing sulfur compounds has gained increasing interests fan et al 2016 garcia et al 2020 he et al 2018 li et al 2017 this can be achieved through reactions between sulfide or dithionite and the released fe2 from nzvi surface fan et al 2013 2017 compared to dithionite sulfide can maintain most of the nzvi as fe 0 and retain reactivity of nzvi towards trichloroethylene fan et al 2016 the shell of sulfidated nzvi s nzvi can be composed of fes rather than corrosive products such as iron hydr oxides that impede reactions with targets the evolved core shell structure enables s nzvi to perform heterogeneous catalysis and promote electron transfer kim et al 2011 in addition as a source of fe2 or fe3 nzvi can be an efficient persulfate ps activator to initiate the formation of so4 radicals wang et al 2020 which have a longer half life and are more robust than oh to remove chemical pollutants hori et al 2004 khan et al 2017 these properties could be contributors in efficient removal of both arb and args so far s nzvi has been widely used for removing chemical pollutants he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 xu et al 2020 however little is known about how efficiently s nzvi coupled with ps could inactivate arb and args and whether the inactivation efficiency could be compromised under realistic conditions e g drinking water or real wastewater effluent matrices herein we sulfidated nzvi s nzvi with sulfide and systematically investigated the performance of the materials on inactivation of arb e coli k 12 le392 carrying rp4 plasmid and args both extracellular and intracellular args in the presence of persulfate various experiments including kinetic studies cell variability and confocal microscopy analyses were conducted to verify arb inactivation performance two water matrices including drinking water and real wastewater effluent were also used to assess the inactivation efficiency of s nzvi coupled with persulfate dynamic analyses of arb inactivation processes were for the first time conducted at a single cell level by a microfluidic system and a confocal microscopy moreover inactivation mechanisms were explored by scavenging tests and radical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 material synthesis and characterizations nzvi particles were synthesized by borohydride reduction method yu et al 2019a 2019b as described in text s1 for s nzvi the freshly prepared na2s with degassed deionized water was added to the prepared nzvi suspension this was followed by 24 h equilibration while rolling on a shaker 100 rpm 25 c all solutions were used after 30 min n2 sparging the prepared particles were stored at 4 c in the dark surface morphological structure elemental components the crystallinity surface chemistry of materials particles stability and the dissolved iron were analyzed by various characterization technologies detail methods were described in text s2 2 2 arb inactivation plate culturing experiments were conducted to examine arb inactivation efficiencies of nanoparticles li et al 2020 a gram negative arb e coli k 12 le392 harboring the plasmid rp4 that carries ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline resistance genes was isolated from soil chung and kim 2007 and was selected for this study one ml of 108 cfu ml cell suspension text s3 was added together with persulfate ps 1 mm and nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi 100 mg l into respective 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes the s fe molar ratios 1 5 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 5 1 and material dosage 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l were optimized figure s1 where 1 1 of s fe ratio for s nzvi and 100 mg l of all particles were used as defaults throughout this study if not stated a kinetic study of arb inactivation was performed to evaluate the removal efficacy at different elapsed times the disinfection kinetics was fitted with an exponential decay model as eq 1 1 c c 0 a e k t a where c c0 and a are the cell number cfu ml at time zero t and infinite time respectively k is the decay rate constant min 1 the adsorption desorption of bacterial cells on s nzvi particles was also assessed by plate culturing ma et al 2016 after bacterial treatment the particles were collected resuspended and were then poured onto respective lb agar plates in addition cell variability analysis was also conducted to verify the performance on arb inactivation before and after nanoparticle treatments e coli k 12 strain was fluorescently stained by the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa further details of the method were described in text s4 the limit of detection of plate culturing for arb enumeration was 20 cfu ml inactivation performance of arb was also evaluated by using real water matrices including drinking water ph 8 08 dissolved oxygen 7 80 mg l total organic carbon 7 33 mg l total suspended solids 1 0 mg l and wastewater effluent ph 7 23 chemical oxygen demand 100 0 mg l total nitrogen 10 0 mg l total phosphate 1 0 mg l total suspended solids 20 0 mg l the drinking water collected from a building water pipeline and wastewater effluent collected from a biological reactor that removes nitrogen from real wastewater were filtered with a 0 45 µm membrane to remove any particles or indigenous bacteria wu et al 2018 prior to the preparation of a bacterial suspension to obtain a final concentration of 108 cfu ml in addition the real drinking water without any filtration was used to test the reliability of s nzvi ps since the unfiltered drinking water contained very low concentration of bacterial cells 103 cfu ml up to 108 cfu ml of e coli k 12 was spiked for an inactivation test furthermore we set up a lab scale reactor to continuously treat unfiltered real wastewater effluent text s5 figure s2 in order to illustrate the feasibility of s nzvi ps to the mimicking real settings the solution of s nzvi ps was also continuously dosed into the reactor to reach the target concentration 100 mg l of s nzvi and 1 mm of ps we tested arb inactivation efficiency under two different contact time conditions or hydraulic retention time hrt 10 and 30 min the reactor effluent was collected after reaching steady state and were spread onto heterotrophic plate medium for the enumeration of heterotrophic plate counts hpc 2 3 arb regrowth in order to confirm whether the treated arb cells still have the potential to be resuscitated and regrow after exiting from unfavorable conditions regrowth of e coli from treatment that enabled to completely inactivate arb was investigated here we examined the regrowth of bacterial cells at all experimental durations 0 min 5 min 10 min 30 min and 60 min of s nzvi or nzvi after treatment the samples were directly taken from the tube transferred to another container that consisted of lb broth media where the samples were diluted at least 1000 times at which the concentration of nanoparticles had no significant p 0 314 effect on arb removal figure s3 and then can be ignored and were incubated in the darkness at 30 c for 24 h or longer afterwards aliquots of cell culture were plated onto lb agar plates that did not contain any antibiotics and were incubated at 30 c before enumeration 2 4 real time visualization of arb inactivation overnight cultured e coli k 12 cells were sub cultured in fresh lb media for another several hours growth until exponential phase the pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in pbs with 108 cfu ml bacterial cells were initially stained by both 30 µm propidium iodide pi and 5 µm syto 9 fluorescent dyes for 15 min afterwards the stained cells were loaded onto b04a microfluidic plate chamber onix cellasic merk with 5 psi for 5 min yu et al 2021 s nzvi suspension was then loaded with 1 psi and the temperature was maintained at 25 c conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy imaging was conducted by an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope zeiss lsm 710 axioobserver which is equipped with a plan apochromat 40 1 4 oil dic m27 objective and 3 channel quasa spectral pmt array zen 2 3 software was used for imaging acquisition and analysis where acquisition was set up with 0 39 µs pixel time of both green and red fluorescence using a fluo led spectra x light source green fluorescence was detected at 488 nm excitation and 518 nm emission wavelengths while red fluorescence was detected at 561 nm excitation and 585 nm emission wavelengths each image contained 1024 1024 pixels 2 5 arg degradation in this study degradation of both extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs were tested for arg degradation blatem and teta carried by an inca c plasmid rp4 were selected for earg treatment the solution of purified rp4 plasmids was treated with nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi in the absence or presence of ps followed by centrifuging the supernatant was collected and assayed by real time quantitative pcr qpcr applied biosystems quantstudio 6 text s6 and figure s4 to measure the concentration of both types of eargs meanwhile the supernatant was also used for pcr assays of both types of eargs for further analysis and visualization by gel electrophoresis the adsorption desorption capability of eargs on the nanoparticles was also examined after eargs treatment 5 10 30 and 60 min nzvi or s nzvi particles were collected by centrifugation washed with pbs and were then resuspended in pbs for desorption kinetics 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h of eargs desorption from nzvi was conducted to optimize the desorption duration after that the supernatant was collected for qpcr analysis for iargs treatment the procedures were followed as described above for the study of arb inactivation after different durations of arb treatment the samples were centrifuged and the precipitates where the supernatants were removed were collected for dna extraction by the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio according to the manufacturer s protocols the extracted dna iarg samples were analyzed with qpcr assays primers used for pcr were summarized in table s1 all bands were visualized using sybr safe dna gel staining and the generuler 1 kb dna ladder gel electrophoresis was used to qualitatively analyze whether these args were completely removed or not to confirm whether the treated bacterial could release their iargs to the bulk solution and contribute as part of eargs the supernatant of each arb treated sample was also collected for qpcr analysis the pcr amplification efficiency of eargs was 105 1 for teta and 108 2 for blatem the amplification efficiency of iargs was 108 9 for teta and 104 1 for blatem the limit of quantification for the qpcr assays was 10 copies per μl for each arg the recovery efficiency of eargs from bacterial bulk solution was 0 83 0 04 based on which all data of eargs extraction from bacterial suspension was corrected mao et al 2014 2 6 ros identification to understand which type of ros plays a dominant role in arb inactivation scavenging tests were conducted by adding different scavengers together with 1 mm ps and 100 mg l nanoparticles into cell suspensions here thiourea fe ii edta and ethanol were selected as scavengers to eradicate hydroxyl oh h2o2 and oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively table s2 after certain time intervals in each test the samples were collected and plated diluted if necessary onto lb agar plates and were incubated at 30 c for 2 days before cfus enumeration for radical detection an electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker elexsyse500 billerica ma was employed a spin trapped reagent 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used for epr analysis zhang et al 2019b a solution containing 50 mm dmpo and 1 mm persulfate was prepared and nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi was then added to trigger the reaction after 1 min samples were loaded and analyzed on the epr spectrometer the solution that only contained nanoparticles was also analyzed as control the settings for analysis were modulation frequency of 100 khz band microwave 9 43 ghz 1 5 mw and sweeping magnetic field 110 k 2 7 statistical analysis phenotypic results were analyzed by analysis of variance anova and independent sample t test through spss 26 0 spss chicago usa all data were expressed as mean sd a value of p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant and a value of p 0 01 was considered to be highly significant 3 results 3 1 material characterizations the solid phases of both nzvi and s nzvi were characterized by tem eds xrd and xps tem images show some differences in particle morphologies between pristine nzvi and s nzvi pristine nzvi particles exhibited spherical core shell structures fig 1 a with a shell thickness of 4 nm inset image which is consistent with a previous study using the same synthesis method yu et al 2019b by contrast the s nzvi particles showed a separate phase of flocculent particles being surrounded fig 1b the eds mapping results confirmed that the surface dominant element was fe in both particles fig 1a b even though the peak of element o was observed figure s5 because of the inevitable facile oxidation during the sample preparation cao et al 2017 specifically the content of o in pristine nzvi was much higher than that in s nzvi the presence of element s was validated after sulfide modification the elemental mapping results also showed homogenous distribution of the elements on both particles the xrd patterns show a diffraction line for fe0 in pristine nzvi while a more pronounced peak of fe0 was observed for s nzvi than for pristine nzvi fig 1c suggesting a more crystalline fe0 in the particles after sulfide modification in addition after modification with sulfide the diffraction lines for fes were observed this indicates chemical liquid state reactions between fe0 and s2 eqs 2 and 3 2 2 f e 0 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e a q 2 4 o h 3 f e a q 2 s 2 f e s the speciation of fe on these particles were analyzed by xps the fe 2p xps spectra of pristine nzvi and s nzvi show peaks for feo fe2o3 fe3o4 but without those for fe0 fig 1d and e considering xps only detects less than 5 nm depth of the material kim et al 2011 this result indicates the oxidation of the surficial fe0 during the sample preparation despite the fe0 remaining in the particles according to tem and xrd results the chemical state of s on the s nzvi particles was also analyzed in fig 1f a mixture of sulfur species s2 so3 2 and so4 2 were detected on the surface of s nzvi indicating the oxidation of the surficial s2 it has been reported that fes is very sensitive to oxygen and can be transformed to iron oxides and greigite mullet et al 2002 thus the s nzvi surface can be composed of metallic iron sulfide and iron oxides presenting as a weathered thin layer as shown in tem images fig 1b as a result the surficial fes protects the bulk s nzvi particles from further oxidation and endows these particles with multi functionalities kim et al 2011 in addition s nzvi particles exhibited a superior stability to pristine nzvi figure s6 collectively these results support the positive role of sulfide modification in physio chemical properties of nzvi 3 2 arb inactivation performance in the control experiment ps only the bactericidal effect was negligible fig 2 a compared to the experiment with a single component of nzvi particles 2 0 log reduction the addition of ps significantly promoted inactivation efficiency increasing by 1 0 log reduction within 30 min treatment fig 2a similar results were also observed between s nzvi and binary components of s nzvi ps within 30 min for example s nzvi only inactivated 3 4 log of e coli while s nzvi ps achieved a greater 7 8 log reduction complete inactivation at 10 min all of the variables obtained from the decay model were summarized in table 1 the inactivation rate constant k increased dramatically with sulfidation nzvi 0 036 min 1 s nzvi 0 076 min 1 and ps addition s nzvi 0 076 min 1 s nzvi ps 0 138 min 1 correspondingly larger reduction of bacterial inactivation indicated as plateau or span values in table 1 can be achieved combination of sulfidation and ps greatly shortened the time required for half of these reductions or half life with only 5 min required by s nzvi ps it should be noted that ps only had a very limited effect on this inactivation these results indicate that the combined s nzvi ps exhibited a synergistic bactericidal effect arb inactivation performance of nzvi ps and s nzvi ps was further evaluated by a flow cytometer prior to treatment cells 97 14 live cells were positively stained by syto 9 with minimal proportions of pi stained cells 0 17 dead cells and both pi and syto 9 stained cells 2 14 damaged cells fig 2b after inactivation by nzvi ps proportions of the damaged and dead cells increased as a time dependent pattern fig 2c e for example the proportion of dead cells increased from 0 23 after 5 min treatment to 5 90 after 30 min treatment a more dramatic increase was observed with inactivation by s nzvi ps fig 2f h after 5 min s nzvi ps killed 52 83 of total cells after prolonging the treatments to 10 min all bacterial cells were inactivated because negligible live cells 0 01 and damaged cells 0 05 were detected fig 2g these results can be also found in fig 2i and were consistent with the results that arb was completely inactivated after 10 min treatment with s nzvi ps fig 2a it is to be noted that s nzvi particles themselves exhibited negligible effects on the fractions of live and dead cells that were analyzed by flow cytometry figure s7 moreover we verified the permanent inactivation of arb by nzvi ps or by s nzvi ps after 24 h incubation a considerable regrowth of nzvi ps treated cells 10 min was observed even if the number 7 7 log was less than the number 8 1 log of untreated cells fig 2j the treated cells with nzvi ps still maintained its regrowth ability when elongating the treatment durations 30 min and 60 min figure s8 by contrast s nzvi ps was more efficient to inactivate e coli after 10 min treatment all bacterial cells were permanently inactivated as there were no colonies on the lb agar plates after 24 h 48 h and 72 h incubation fig 2k and figure s8 similar results were also found when the duration of s nzvi ps treatment was elongated 30 min and 60 min taken together nzvi ps can kill bacteria but it cannot perform a similar effect to s nzvi ps that can completely and permanently kill bacterial cells within a relatively short period to further validate the feasibility of bacteria inactivation by s nzvi ps towards a more realistic scenario we used filtered drinking water and wastewater effluent for the tests s nzvi ps exhibited very efficient arb inactivation in both realistic scenarios after 10 min treatment a 7 8 log reduction complete inactivation was achieved from both drinking water fig 3 a and wastewater effluent fig 3b the complete inactivation was also supported by the live and dead staining images fig 3c moreover we also tested disinfection performance of s nzvi ps in real water matrices again 8 0 log reduction of bacterial cells was achieved after 10 min treatment with s nzvi ps in unfiltered drinking water fig 3d in the continuous reactor fed with unfiltered wastewater effluent up to 3 7 log reduction of bacteria was achieved under contact time of 10 min while all bacterial cells were inactivated under contact time of 30 min under steady state fig 3e to visualize the process of bacterial inactivation by s nzvi ps we employed a fluorescence based microfluidic system that enables real time recording of live and dead cells at a single cell level at time zero staring to upload s nzvi and ps bacterial cells were stained with green fluorescent syto 9 dye indicating that they all are live cells fig 4 under exposure to s nzvi ps the fluorescence of bacterial cells shifted from green to yellow suggesting that s nzvi ps caused damage to the cells afterwards the green fluorescence gradually weakened and was totally replaced with red after 10 min exposure fig 4 surprisingly the red fluorescence faded off in the remaining period considering that pi is a cell membrane impermeable dye that intercalates between dna bases and was still able to stain dead bacteria fig 2b h this phenomenon may be due to the damage of intracellular dna by s nzvi ps overall bacterial cells can be completely killed after 10 min exposure to s nzvi ps which is consistent with the results obtained from cell variability analysis 3 3 degradation of extracellular and intracellular args the effects of nzvi particles on the degradation of both eargs and iargs were examined here we focused on two args including blatem and teta regarding eargs a time dependent increase of blatem degradation by nzvi was found where it was completely degraded 8 0 log reduction fig 5 a at 30 min by contrast the time required for the complete degradation of blatem by nzvi ps was the same but the degradation efficiency dramatically increased at 5 min and 10 min compared to pristine nzvi s nzvi significantly increased the performance on blatem degradation within 30 min for example after 5 min treatment an approximate 6 0 log reduction of blatem was observed with s nzvi treatment while only 0 2 log reduction was achieved with nzvi treatment the superior performance was further enhanced when combined with ps s nzvi ps exhibited the complete degradation of blatem at 5 min a similar trend was observed with the order following s nzvi ps s nzvi nzvi ps nzvi in terms of log reduction of extracellular teta fig 5b based on gel electrophoresis of the treated eargs blatem and teta no bands corresponding to both eargs appeared when the genes were completely degraded fig 5c d to confirm whether these eargs were removed by degradation or adsorption the desorption experiments were further conducted results showed that there was no eargs detected from nzvi and s nzvi desorption solutions table s3 suggesting that eargs were degraded rather than through adsorption by these particles it should be noted that ps has little effect on both eargs removal figure s9 in our study we adopted two treatments s nzvi ps and nzvi ps to test their performance on the degradation of iargs blatem and teta again a pattern of time dependent increase was found in all treatments after 60 min treatment with s nzvi ps 4 0 log reduction was achieved for both intracellular blatem and teta fig 5e f by contrast after a 60 min duration nzvi ps achieved up to 2 0 log reduction of blatem and 1 3 log reduction of teta thus s nzvi ps exhibited a superior performance but cannot completely remove iargs the incomplete degradation of both iargs was also confirmed by the corresponding gel electrophoresis where bands of both genes at all durations were observed fig 5g h in addition it was suspected that the inactivated arb might release iargs from cells to the solution and contribute to eargs to address this we collected supernatants from arb treated samples for qpcr analysis results showed that no eargs were detected in the supernatants that were collected from nzvi ps or s nzvi ps treated samples table s3 indicating that the released args might have been efficiently degraded by both nzvi ps or s nzvi ps fig 5a b collectively our results suggest that iargs in the host can be also removed by s nzvi ps consistent with red fluorescence fading off shown in fig 4 but iargs are more recalcitrant than eargs to be damaged which is consistent with a previous study mckinney and pruden 2012 3 4 inactivation mechanisms of arb and args considering the fact that nzvi can react with oxidants to release fe2 and trigger fenton like reactions through radical chain reactions to react with target pollutants su et al 2018 to further explore this in the present study radical scavengers such as thiourea fe ii edta and methanol were used to identify the key radicals during inactivation of arb and args by nzvi and s nzvi here we used bacterial inactivation as an example for the scavenging tests prior to the experiment the applied dosage of each scavenger was optimized to ensure maximum quenching but negligible bactericidal effect on bacterial e coli ghasemian et al 2017 wang et al 2012 with the addition of 100 mm methanol oh and so4 scavenger the bactericidal effects of both nzvi and s nzvi were eliminated comparted with the no scavenger added counterpart fig 6 a b with the addition of 100 mm thiourea oh the inactivation of e coli was inhibited by both materials indicating that oh played a critical role in the bacterial inactivation process given that the inactivation of e coli was much more strictly prohibited with the addition of methanol than that with thiourea both so4 and oh were the dominant reactive species causing bactericidal effects in addition the involvement of h2o2 was determined by prohibiting inactivation efficiency with the addition of 0 1 mm fe ii edta but this prohibition was weaker than those induced by so4 and oh species this can be also supported by the declined k values after adding scavengers following the order methanol thiourea fe ii edta no scavenger table 1 to further confirm the major reactive species so4 and oh responsible for inactivation of arb and args a dmpo spin trapping epr technique was then performed in the absence of ps four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh 1 1 1 1 zhang et al 2020b were identified for both nzvi and s nzvi fig 6c in the single component system the signal intensity of oh generated by s nzvi were stronger than by those generated by nzvi with the addition of ps peaks ascribing to dmpo so4 1 1 1 1 1 1 were identified this suggests the activation of ps by both nanoparticles to produce so4 radicals eqs 4 and 5 as no peaks were detected in the single component of ps in addition the intensity of oh signal was significantly higher in a binary system nzvi ps than in a single component nzvi indicating that oh radical was greatly generated via the persulfate activation process eq 6 radical conversion from so4 to oh was confirmed by a time course epr analysis of s nzvi ps figure s10 in binary component systems s nzvi ps generated stronger so4 and oh signals than that nzvi ps did collectively these results suggest that so4 and oh are the dominant radicals to both arb and args inactivation by s nzvi ps furthermore s nzvi ps can generate much more radicals of so4 and oh than their individual components alone thus achieving better inactivation performance 4 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e a q 2 2 s o 4 2 5 s 2 o 8 2 f e a q 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 f e a q 3 6 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h 4 discussion the emergence and spread of arb and args in water systems e g treated wastewater effluent and drinking water have posed threats to public health although chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet disinfection processes are widely used in both water and wastewater treatment systems however these technologies are not efficient enough to simultaneously remove both arb and args and the outcomes may even be contradictory guo et al 2017a for example a recent full scale survey study reported that chlorine disinfection not only increased the abundance of iargs but also enhanced the concentration of extracellular args liu et al 2018 to overcome these obstacles we synthesized sulfidated nzvi s nzvi and applied it to inactivate both arb and args in the present study to achieve more robust performance towards the removal of arb and args we introduced persulfate ps that can be easily activated by nzvi to produce sulfate radicals so4 which are more robust and has a longer half life than hydroxyl radicals oh oh et al 2016 yang et al 2015 we found that the combination of sulfidation and ps showed the highest inactivation efficiencies against arb and args during sulfidation the secondary phase fes mackinawite can be formed on the s nzvi surface and can serve as a catalyst for ps activation sühnholz et al 2020 this heterogenous surface increases electron transfer efficiency between the bulk solution surface fes and the core nzvi wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a as an electron shuttle fe2 was generated at a much faster rate in s nzvi than in pristine nzvi figure s11 thus triggering reactions eqs 5 and 6 to produce more oh radicals moreover in the system of ps activation it was observed that more fe2 was generated than the system without ps leading to more so4 production collectively s nzvi coupled with ps can be more robust to inactivate arb and args so far there are various advanced materials developed for disinfection purposes but more of them required a much longer contact time up to several hours table s4 to completely inactivate bacterial cells for example 4 h of contact time was required by graphene and g c3n4 nanosheets cowrapped cyclooctasulfur 100 mg l to achieve up to 6 3 log reduction of e coli under visible light irradiation wang et al 2013 a 3 h irradiation was even required by uv led at 268 nm to achieve 4 4 log reduction of e coli nyangaresi et al 2019 by contrast s nzvi ps 100 mg l in our study exhibited much superior performance as it only took 10 min to obtain 7 8 log reduction of e coli the heterogenous phase of s nzvi also enables it to achieve higher bacterial inactivation efficiency than homogenous fenton processes feng et al 2020 mosteo et al 2020 although a higher inactivation efficiency 8 min complete inactivation of 2 107 cfu ml e coli was achieved by a composite photocatalyst loaded with noble silver ions xia et al 2016 it was relatively comparable with that achieved by s nzvi ps within 10 min complete inactivation of 108 cfu ml in our study which did not rely on photo driven reactions moreover we found that the treated arb 10 min exposure with s nzvi ps was permanently inactivated thus eliminating risks to human health although ferrous or ferric ions were released during inactivation processes the leaching of these products exhibited very limited inactivation efficiency 0 36 log reduction figure s12 thus the inactivation of arb was ascribed to the radicals produced from heterogenous reactions trigged by fe2 but not to fe2 itself moreover this superior performance was not ascribed to the adsorption of bacterial on the particles as we did not detect any colonies after pouring the bacterial treated particles onto the plates fig 2 and figure s8 this result was different to the photocatalysts that exhibited good bacterial adsorption li et al 2020 ma et al 2016 in addition to using pbs as a matrix our study also further tested arb inactivation performance of s nzvi ps in more realistic scenarios such as drinking water from a building water pipeline and real wastewater effluent that contained nom and suspended solids our study showed that all bacterial cells were completely inactivated when treating both filtered drinking water and filtered wastewater effluent after 10 min this suggests that nom may not substantially offset the radicals so4 and oh produced by s nzvi ps which is inconsistent with previous reports that nom can compromise bacterial inactivation efficiency by serving as radical scavengers e g quenching so4 and oh lee et al 2020 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b however when the lab scale reactor was used to continuously treat unfiltered wastewater effluent containing 20 0 mg l of suspended solid it took a longer contact time 30 min to achieve complete inactivation of all bacteria this suggests that suspended solids in unfiltered wastewater effluent might have consumed radicals and shelter bacterial cells during disinfection processes as suggested in previous studies falsanisi et al 2008 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 mcfadden et al 2017 it should be noted that s nzvi residuals in the reactor effluent can be separated after 60 min settlement figure s2b d collectively these results suggest the feasibility of s nzvi ps to bacterial inactivation in realistic settings during the inactivation process bacterial cells can be lysed to release their intracellular dna molecules which can become extracellular dna fragments it is well understood that the phenotype conferring genes are frequently found on mobile genetic elements such as broad host range plasmids which can be persistent over 20 weeks in the environment mao et al 2014 these dna fragments can be precursors for the exchange of args across genus through conjugation hu et al 2019 or natural transformation jin et al 2020 therefore apart from arb inactivation degradation of associated args can also be critical in reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance here we also found a synergistic effect of sulfidation and ps on the degradation of args with 8 0 log reduction of all eargs within 5 min by s nzvi ps fig 5 this performance is more efficient than previously reported disinfectants including chlorine ozone and uv he et al 2019 it is reported that the rate constant of oh up to 2 3 1011 m s for arg degradation is far higher than nh2cl 1 4 4 4 m s clo2 3 5 12 m s o3 1 8 6 9 104 m s and uv 2 0 8 8 10 2 cm mj in the present study s nzvi ps produced more oh and so4 radicals fig 6c and had larger rate constants k min 1 of both eargs degradation than pristine nzvi figure s13 and table s5 thus exhibiting higher degradation efficiency of eargs similar results were also found regarding iargs degradation efficiency figure s14 and table s6 previous studies reported that dna damage can be sustained at neighboring bi pyrimidine bases cytotoxic dna lesions e g cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 photoproduct 6 4pp can be induced during disinfection sinha and häder 2002 and in particular tt tc ct and cccpds can be generated at intrastrand 5 bipyrimidine 3 sites he et al 2019 consequently the reaction rate of args is positively correlated with the content of neighboring thymidine bases given that blatem has higher fractions of neighboring pyrimidine bases tt tc ct and cc than teta chang et al 2017 mckinney and pruden 2012 blatem can exhibit a higher reactivity with disinfectants compared to the teta gene consistently as we found in the present study the teta gene was more recalcitrant than the blatem gene in each treatment based on the removal rate constant even though its genomic size is larger than the latter general consistency in the kinetics of the removal of eargs and iargs was observed within the exposure durations in each treatment this suggests that s nzvi ps has the ability to react with cellular dna nevertheless this reactivity is limited because of the cell envelope and other cellular biomolecules acting as a periplasmic gate zgurskaya et al 2015 there is also a possibility that iargs can be released from treated cells and then contribute to eargs the released args from bacterial cells could to some extent consume radicals produced during inactivation process consequently the degradation profiles of iargs lagged behind arb inactivation in all treatments and exhibited lower efficiency compared to eargs suggesting that iargs may escape from disinfection processes even if the host cells are permanently inactivated similar results have been reported in previous studies of iargs degradation with various disinfectants czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 zhang et al 2019a these findings raise concerns for the spread of args across bacteria genera via horizontal gene transfer and may require more advanced techniques to degrade iargs from arb 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that s nzvi ps exhibited a superior performance on permanent arb inactivation and arg degradation via the generation of high levels of radicals so4 and oh the complete and permanent inactivation of arb 7 8 log reduction was achieved after 10 min treatment and the complete degradation of eargs 8 0 log reduction was obtained after 5 min treatment with 100 mg l of s nzvi ps in pbs this superior arb inactivation performance was also observed in real water matrices even with the presence of nom and suspended solids in addition this study for the first time visualizes the inactivation process of arb at a single cell level the combination of microscopy and microfluidics in this study will enable us to explore areas such as the interactions between bacterial cells and disinfecting materials as well as the bacterial responses to stress our results imply that the synergistic s nzvi ps system is promising for water disinfection such as both arb inactivation and the degradation of associated args thus reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance in real settings however we should be cautious that iargs degradation lagged behind arb inactivation and was not parallelly efficient with eargs degradation scale up studies and the effects of other water quality parameters such as ph turbidity and suspended solids on arb and args removal need to be examined in the future in addition the health risks associated with the application of s nzvi ps in water disinfection should be further evaluated in particular for drinking

16997,antimicrobial resistance continues to be a rising global threat to public health it is well recognized that wastewater treatment plants are reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and antibiotic resistance genes args however traditional disinfection techniques are not effective to simultaneously remove arb and args and the dynamic analysis of arb inactivation have also been deficient in this study sulfidated nano zerovalent iron s nzvi coupled with persulfate ps was applied to simultaneously remove both arb e coli k 12 with rp4 plasmid and args extra and intracellular args s nzvi ps completely inactivated arb 7 8 log reduction within 10 min and degraded all extracellular args 8 0 log reduction within 5 min these efficiencies were significantly higher decay rate constant k 0 138 min 1 than those achieved individually s nzvi k 0 076 min 1 ps k 0 008 min 1 implying a synergistic effect between s nzvi and ps against arb and args the efficient removal rate of arb was also supported by confocal microscopy and microfluidics at a single cell level the complete inactivation of arb by s nzvi ps was also demonstrated in real drinking water and real wastewater effluent that contained natural organic matter and suspended solids regrowth assays showed that the treated arb was not observed after 72 h or longer incubation suggesting that arb was permanently inactivated by radicals such as so4 and oh the destruction of bacterial cells compromised the removal efficiency of the intracellular args with only 4 0 log reduction after 60 min treatment by s nzvi ps collectively our results suggest the feasibility of s nzvi coupled with ps for simultaneous arb and args removal in real water matrices graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antimicrobial resistance antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes disinfection nano zerovalent iron nzvi radicals 1 introduction the spread of antibiotic resistance has become a global challenge in the 21st century it is annually estimated that 700 000 death results from bacteria resistant infections and this data can be rising to 10 million by 2050 if there are no actions taken now o neill 2016 antibiotic resistance develops unprecedently fast because of antibiotics abuse for example a tertiary hospital in australia has seen that over 44 of escherichia coli e coli clinical isolates associated with urinary tract infections became resistant to ampicillin within five years 2009 2013 fasugba et al 2016 bacteria can survive antibiotic treatments and convert to antibiotic resistant bacteria arb through acquiring antibiotic resistance genes args that generally reside on mobile genetic elements including plasmid plasmids e g the broad range host rp4 with various args have been recovered from e coli species and enable their transfer across genus via horizontal gene transfer li et al 2016 thus both arb and args have been considered as emerging pollutants pruden et al 2006 which can be widely detected in water or wastewater treatment plants guo et al 2017b currently various disinfection processes such as chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet uv irradiation have been widely employed to remove pathogens from water and wastewater ding et al 2019 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 however their effectiveness towards arb and arg removal remains controversial and even contrary to the original intentions for example chlorine was found to only partially inactivate pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 under exposure to 4 mg l hypochlorite and enhance antibiotic resistance in pathogens hou et al 2019 it was also reported that chlorine increased the levels of both intra and extracellular args in the effluent of a full scale wastewater treatment plant liu et al 2018 this increases the demand of alternative approaches for permanent removal of both arb and args during disinfection so far various advanced oxidation processes have been proposed as alternatives to remove arb and args among them photocatalysis has been intensively developed for bacterial disinfection and the removal of args ahmed et al 2020 2021 however low removal efficiencies may compromise real applications of this technique towards arb and arg inactivation for example nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide wrapped bi2o2co3 microspheres 200 mg l only achieved 2 0 log reduction of e coli ndm 1 after 60 min of uva visible light photocatalytic inactivation li et al 2020 up to 4 0 log reduction of e coli puc19 was achieved after 6 h treatment with tetrapodal zno 1 g l under uv exposure hwangbo et al 2019 in addition this technique is a photo driven process which may not be practically feasible in conditions with low light transmission gohy and zhao 2013 furthermore the photoinduced pairs of electron and hole can be easily recombined or scavenged by organic matters to compromise reactive oxygen species ros production long et al 2017 photocatalysts could be deactivated because of either their heterogeneity or blocking activate sites during photocatalytic processes butt 2012 jeong et al 2020 low et al 2017 as a nano catalyzer nano zerovalent iron nzvi has been widely applied to achieve effective remediation of environmental pollutions in water soil and groundwater because of its high reactivity to produce diverse radicals via triggering heterogeneous fenton reactions vilardi et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a that do not rely on photo driven conditions nevertheless nzvi particles tend to be aggregated and can be easily corroded by various natural reductant demand nrd including dissolved oxygen nitrate and water resulting in a rapid loss of its reactivity to preserve the reactivity and longevity sulfidation of nzvi with reducing sulfur compounds has gained increasing interests fan et al 2016 garcia et al 2020 he et al 2018 li et al 2017 this can be achieved through reactions between sulfide or dithionite and the released fe2 from nzvi surface fan et al 2013 2017 compared to dithionite sulfide can maintain most of the nzvi as fe 0 and retain reactivity of nzvi towards trichloroethylene fan et al 2016 the shell of sulfidated nzvi s nzvi can be composed of fes rather than corrosive products such as iron hydr oxides that impede reactions with targets the evolved core shell structure enables s nzvi to perform heterogeneous catalysis and promote electron transfer kim et al 2011 in addition as a source of fe2 or fe3 nzvi can be an efficient persulfate ps activator to initiate the formation of so4 radicals wang et al 2020 which have a longer half life and are more robust than oh to remove chemical pollutants hori et al 2004 khan et al 2017 these properties could be contributors in efficient removal of both arb and args so far s nzvi has been widely used for removing chemical pollutants he et al 2018 rajajayavel and ghoshal 2015 xu et al 2020 however little is known about how efficiently s nzvi coupled with ps could inactivate arb and args and whether the inactivation efficiency could be compromised under realistic conditions e g drinking water or real wastewater effluent matrices herein we sulfidated nzvi s nzvi with sulfide and systematically investigated the performance of the materials on inactivation of arb e coli k 12 le392 carrying rp4 plasmid and args both extracellular and intracellular args in the presence of persulfate various experiments including kinetic studies cell variability and confocal microscopy analyses were conducted to verify arb inactivation performance two water matrices including drinking water and real wastewater effluent were also used to assess the inactivation efficiency of s nzvi coupled with persulfate dynamic analyses of arb inactivation processes were for the first time conducted at a single cell level by a microfluidic system and a confocal microscopy moreover inactivation mechanisms were explored by scavenging tests and radical analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 material synthesis and characterizations nzvi particles were synthesized by borohydride reduction method yu et al 2019a 2019b as described in text s1 for s nzvi the freshly prepared na2s with degassed deionized water was added to the prepared nzvi suspension this was followed by 24 h equilibration while rolling on a shaker 100 rpm 25 c all solutions were used after 30 min n2 sparging the prepared particles were stored at 4 c in the dark surface morphological structure elemental components the crystallinity surface chemistry of materials particles stability and the dissolved iron were analyzed by various characterization technologies detail methods were described in text s2 2 2 arb inactivation plate culturing experiments were conducted to examine arb inactivation efficiencies of nanoparticles li et al 2020 a gram negative arb e coli k 12 le392 harboring the plasmid rp4 that carries ampicillin kanamycin and tetracycline resistance genes was isolated from soil chung and kim 2007 and was selected for this study one ml of 108 cfu ml cell suspension text s3 was added together with persulfate ps 1 mm and nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi 100 mg l into respective 1 5 ml eppendorf tubes the s fe molar ratios 1 5 1 3 1 1 3 1 and 5 1 and material dosage 100 200 500 and 1000 mg l were optimized figure s1 where 1 1 of s fe ratio for s nzvi and 100 mg l of all particles were used as defaults throughout this study if not stated a kinetic study of arb inactivation was performed to evaluate the removal efficacy at different elapsed times the disinfection kinetics was fitted with an exponential decay model as eq 1 1 c c 0 a e k t a where c c0 and a are the cell number cfu ml at time zero t and infinite time respectively k is the decay rate constant min 1 the adsorption desorption of bacterial cells on s nzvi particles was also assessed by plate culturing ma et al 2016 after bacterial treatment the particles were collected resuspended and were then poured onto respective lb agar plates in addition cell variability analysis was also conducted to verify the performance on arb inactivation before and after nanoparticle treatments e coli k 12 strain was fluorescently stained by the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit invitrogen usa further details of the method were described in text s4 the limit of detection of plate culturing for arb enumeration was 20 cfu ml inactivation performance of arb was also evaluated by using real water matrices including drinking water ph 8 08 dissolved oxygen 7 80 mg l total organic carbon 7 33 mg l total suspended solids 1 0 mg l and wastewater effluent ph 7 23 chemical oxygen demand 100 0 mg l total nitrogen 10 0 mg l total phosphate 1 0 mg l total suspended solids 20 0 mg l the drinking water collected from a building water pipeline and wastewater effluent collected from a biological reactor that removes nitrogen from real wastewater were filtered with a 0 45 µm membrane to remove any particles or indigenous bacteria wu et al 2018 prior to the preparation of a bacterial suspension to obtain a final concentration of 108 cfu ml in addition the real drinking water without any filtration was used to test the reliability of s nzvi ps since the unfiltered drinking water contained very low concentration of bacterial cells 103 cfu ml up to 108 cfu ml of e coli k 12 was spiked for an inactivation test furthermore we set up a lab scale reactor to continuously treat unfiltered real wastewater effluent text s5 figure s2 in order to illustrate the feasibility of s nzvi ps to the mimicking real settings the solution of s nzvi ps was also continuously dosed into the reactor to reach the target concentration 100 mg l of s nzvi and 1 mm of ps we tested arb inactivation efficiency under two different contact time conditions or hydraulic retention time hrt 10 and 30 min the reactor effluent was collected after reaching steady state and were spread onto heterotrophic plate medium for the enumeration of heterotrophic plate counts hpc 2 3 arb regrowth in order to confirm whether the treated arb cells still have the potential to be resuscitated and regrow after exiting from unfavorable conditions regrowth of e coli from treatment that enabled to completely inactivate arb was investigated here we examined the regrowth of bacterial cells at all experimental durations 0 min 5 min 10 min 30 min and 60 min of s nzvi or nzvi after treatment the samples were directly taken from the tube transferred to another container that consisted of lb broth media where the samples were diluted at least 1000 times at which the concentration of nanoparticles had no significant p 0 314 effect on arb removal figure s3 and then can be ignored and were incubated in the darkness at 30 c for 24 h or longer afterwards aliquots of cell culture were plated onto lb agar plates that did not contain any antibiotics and were incubated at 30 c before enumeration 2 4 real time visualization of arb inactivation overnight cultured e coli k 12 cells were sub cultured in fresh lb media for another several hours growth until exponential phase the pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in pbs with 108 cfu ml bacterial cells were initially stained by both 30 µm propidium iodide pi and 5 µm syto 9 fluorescent dyes for 15 min afterwards the stained cells were loaded onto b04a microfluidic plate chamber onix cellasic merk with 5 psi for 5 min yu et al 2021 s nzvi suspension was then loaded with 1 psi and the temperature was maintained at 25 c conventional wide field fluorescence microscopy imaging was conducted by an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope zeiss lsm 710 axioobserver which is equipped with a plan apochromat 40 1 4 oil dic m27 objective and 3 channel quasa spectral pmt array zen 2 3 software was used for imaging acquisition and analysis where acquisition was set up with 0 39 µs pixel time of both green and red fluorescence using a fluo led spectra x light source green fluorescence was detected at 488 nm excitation and 518 nm emission wavelengths while red fluorescence was detected at 561 nm excitation and 585 nm emission wavelengths each image contained 1024 1024 pixels 2 5 arg degradation in this study degradation of both extracellular args eargs and intracellular args iargs were tested for arg degradation blatem and teta carried by an inca c plasmid rp4 were selected for earg treatment the solution of purified rp4 plasmids was treated with nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi in the absence or presence of ps followed by centrifuging the supernatant was collected and assayed by real time quantitative pcr qpcr applied biosystems quantstudio 6 text s6 and figure s4 to measure the concentration of both types of eargs meanwhile the supernatant was also used for pcr assays of both types of eargs for further analysis and visualization by gel electrophoresis the adsorption desorption capability of eargs on the nanoparticles was also examined after eargs treatment 5 10 30 and 60 min nzvi or s nzvi particles were collected by centrifugation washed with pbs and were then resuspended in pbs for desorption kinetics 0 5 1 2 4 8 12 and 24 h of eargs desorption from nzvi was conducted to optimize the desorption duration after that the supernatant was collected for qpcr analysis for iargs treatment the procedures were followed as described above for the study of arb inactivation after different durations of arb treatment the samples were centrifuged and the precipitates where the supernatants were removed were collected for dna extraction by the powerwater dna isolation kit mobio according to the manufacturer s protocols the extracted dna iarg samples were analyzed with qpcr assays primers used for pcr were summarized in table s1 all bands were visualized using sybr safe dna gel staining and the generuler 1 kb dna ladder gel electrophoresis was used to qualitatively analyze whether these args were completely removed or not to confirm whether the treated bacterial could release their iargs to the bulk solution and contribute as part of eargs the supernatant of each arb treated sample was also collected for qpcr analysis the pcr amplification efficiency of eargs was 105 1 for teta and 108 2 for blatem the amplification efficiency of iargs was 108 9 for teta and 104 1 for blatem the limit of quantification for the qpcr assays was 10 copies per μl for each arg the recovery efficiency of eargs from bacterial bulk solution was 0 83 0 04 based on which all data of eargs extraction from bacterial suspension was corrected mao et al 2014 2 6 ros identification to understand which type of ros plays a dominant role in arb inactivation scavenging tests were conducted by adding different scavengers together with 1 mm ps and 100 mg l nanoparticles into cell suspensions here thiourea fe ii edta and ethanol were selected as scavengers to eradicate hydroxyl oh h2o2 and oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively table s2 after certain time intervals in each test the samples were collected and plated diluted if necessary onto lb agar plates and were incubated at 30 c for 2 days before cfus enumeration for radical detection an electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker elexsyse500 billerica ma was employed a spin trapped reagent 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used for epr analysis zhang et al 2019b a solution containing 50 mm dmpo and 1 mm persulfate was prepared and nanoparticles nzvi or s nzvi was then added to trigger the reaction after 1 min samples were loaded and analyzed on the epr spectrometer the solution that only contained nanoparticles was also analyzed as control the settings for analysis were modulation frequency of 100 khz band microwave 9 43 ghz 1 5 mw and sweeping magnetic field 110 k 2 7 statistical analysis phenotypic results were analyzed by analysis of variance anova and independent sample t test through spss 26 0 spss chicago usa all data were expressed as mean sd a value of p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant and a value of p 0 01 was considered to be highly significant 3 results 3 1 material characterizations the solid phases of both nzvi and s nzvi were characterized by tem eds xrd and xps tem images show some differences in particle morphologies between pristine nzvi and s nzvi pristine nzvi particles exhibited spherical core shell structures fig 1 a with a shell thickness of 4 nm inset image which is consistent with a previous study using the same synthesis method yu et al 2019b by contrast the s nzvi particles showed a separate phase of flocculent particles being surrounded fig 1b the eds mapping results confirmed that the surface dominant element was fe in both particles fig 1a b even though the peak of element o was observed figure s5 because of the inevitable facile oxidation during the sample preparation cao et al 2017 specifically the content of o in pristine nzvi was much higher than that in s nzvi the presence of element s was validated after sulfide modification the elemental mapping results also showed homogenous distribution of the elements on both particles the xrd patterns show a diffraction line for fe0 in pristine nzvi while a more pronounced peak of fe0 was observed for s nzvi than for pristine nzvi fig 1c suggesting a more crystalline fe0 in the particles after sulfide modification in addition after modification with sulfide the diffraction lines for fes were observed this indicates chemical liquid state reactions between fe0 and s2 eqs 2 and 3 2 2 f e 0 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e a q 2 4 o h 3 f e a q 2 s 2 f e s the speciation of fe on these particles were analyzed by xps the fe 2p xps spectra of pristine nzvi and s nzvi show peaks for feo fe2o3 fe3o4 but without those for fe0 fig 1d and e considering xps only detects less than 5 nm depth of the material kim et al 2011 this result indicates the oxidation of the surficial fe0 during the sample preparation despite the fe0 remaining in the particles according to tem and xrd results the chemical state of s on the s nzvi particles was also analyzed in fig 1f a mixture of sulfur species s2 so3 2 and so4 2 were detected on the surface of s nzvi indicating the oxidation of the surficial s2 it has been reported that fes is very sensitive to oxygen and can be transformed to iron oxides and greigite mullet et al 2002 thus the s nzvi surface can be composed of metallic iron sulfide and iron oxides presenting as a weathered thin layer as shown in tem images fig 1b as a result the surficial fes protects the bulk s nzvi particles from further oxidation and endows these particles with multi functionalities kim et al 2011 in addition s nzvi particles exhibited a superior stability to pristine nzvi figure s6 collectively these results support the positive role of sulfide modification in physio chemical properties of nzvi 3 2 arb inactivation performance in the control experiment ps only the bactericidal effect was negligible fig 2 a compared to the experiment with a single component of nzvi particles 2 0 log reduction the addition of ps significantly promoted inactivation efficiency increasing by 1 0 log reduction within 30 min treatment fig 2a similar results were also observed between s nzvi and binary components of s nzvi ps within 30 min for example s nzvi only inactivated 3 4 log of e coli while s nzvi ps achieved a greater 7 8 log reduction complete inactivation at 10 min all of the variables obtained from the decay model were summarized in table 1 the inactivation rate constant k increased dramatically with sulfidation nzvi 0 036 min 1 s nzvi 0 076 min 1 and ps addition s nzvi 0 076 min 1 s nzvi ps 0 138 min 1 correspondingly larger reduction of bacterial inactivation indicated as plateau or span values in table 1 can be achieved combination of sulfidation and ps greatly shortened the time required for half of these reductions or half life with only 5 min required by s nzvi ps it should be noted that ps only had a very limited effect on this inactivation these results indicate that the combined s nzvi ps exhibited a synergistic bactericidal effect arb inactivation performance of nzvi ps and s nzvi ps was further evaluated by a flow cytometer prior to treatment cells 97 14 live cells were positively stained by syto 9 with minimal proportions of pi stained cells 0 17 dead cells and both pi and syto 9 stained cells 2 14 damaged cells fig 2b after inactivation by nzvi ps proportions of the damaged and dead cells increased as a time dependent pattern fig 2c e for example the proportion of dead cells increased from 0 23 after 5 min treatment to 5 90 after 30 min treatment a more dramatic increase was observed with inactivation by s nzvi ps fig 2f h after 5 min s nzvi ps killed 52 83 of total cells after prolonging the treatments to 10 min all bacterial cells were inactivated because negligible live cells 0 01 and damaged cells 0 05 were detected fig 2g these results can be also found in fig 2i and were consistent with the results that arb was completely inactivated after 10 min treatment with s nzvi ps fig 2a it is to be noted that s nzvi particles themselves exhibited negligible effects on the fractions of live and dead cells that were analyzed by flow cytometry figure s7 moreover we verified the permanent inactivation of arb by nzvi ps or by s nzvi ps after 24 h incubation a considerable regrowth of nzvi ps treated cells 10 min was observed even if the number 7 7 log was less than the number 8 1 log of untreated cells fig 2j the treated cells with nzvi ps still maintained its regrowth ability when elongating the treatment durations 30 min and 60 min figure s8 by contrast s nzvi ps was more efficient to inactivate e coli after 10 min treatment all bacterial cells were permanently inactivated as there were no colonies on the lb agar plates after 24 h 48 h and 72 h incubation fig 2k and figure s8 similar results were also found when the duration of s nzvi ps treatment was elongated 30 min and 60 min taken together nzvi ps can kill bacteria but it cannot perform a similar effect to s nzvi ps that can completely and permanently kill bacterial cells within a relatively short period to further validate the feasibility of bacteria inactivation by s nzvi ps towards a more realistic scenario we used filtered drinking water and wastewater effluent for the tests s nzvi ps exhibited very efficient arb inactivation in both realistic scenarios after 10 min treatment a 7 8 log reduction complete inactivation was achieved from both drinking water fig 3 a and wastewater effluent fig 3b the complete inactivation was also supported by the live and dead staining images fig 3c moreover we also tested disinfection performance of s nzvi ps in real water matrices again 8 0 log reduction of bacterial cells was achieved after 10 min treatment with s nzvi ps in unfiltered drinking water fig 3d in the continuous reactor fed with unfiltered wastewater effluent up to 3 7 log reduction of bacteria was achieved under contact time of 10 min while all bacterial cells were inactivated under contact time of 30 min under steady state fig 3e to visualize the process of bacterial inactivation by s nzvi ps we employed a fluorescence based microfluidic system that enables real time recording of live and dead cells at a single cell level at time zero staring to upload s nzvi and ps bacterial cells were stained with green fluorescent syto 9 dye indicating that they all are live cells fig 4 under exposure to s nzvi ps the fluorescence of bacterial cells shifted from green to yellow suggesting that s nzvi ps caused damage to the cells afterwards the green fluorescence gradually weakened and was totally replaced with red after 10 min exposure fig 4 surprisingly the red fluorescence faded off in the remaining period considering that pi is a cell membrane impermeable dye that intercalates between dna bases and was still able to stain dead bacteria fig 2b h this phenomenon may be due to the damage of intracellular dna by s nzvi ps overall bacterial cells can be completely killed after 10 min exposure to s nzvi ps which is consistent with the results obtained from cell variability analysis 3 3 degradation of extracellular and intracellular args the effects of nzvi particles on the degradation of both eargs and iargs were examined here we focused on two args including blatem and teta regarding eargs a time dependent increase of blatem degradation by nzvi was found where it was completely degraded 8 0 log reduction fig 5 a at 30 min by contrast the time required for the complete degradation of blatem by nzvi ps was the same but the degradation efficiency dramatically increased at 5 min and 10 min compared to pristine nzvi s nzvi significantly increased the performance on blatem degradation within 30 min for example after 5 min treatment an approximate 6 0 log reduction of blatem was observed with s nzvi treatment while only 0 2 log reduction was achieved with nzvi treatment the superior performance was further enhanced when combined with ps s nzvi ps exhibited the complete degradation of blatem at 5 min a similar trend was observed with the order following s nzvi ps s nzvi nzvi ps nzvi in terms of log reduction of extracellular teta fig 5b based on gel electrophoresis of the treated eargs blatem and teta no bands corresponding to both eargs appeared when the genes were completely degraded fig 5c d to confirm whether these eargs were removed by degradation or adsorption the desorption experiments were further conducted results showed that there was no eargs detected from nzvi and s nzvi desorption solutions table s3 suggesting that eargs were degraded rather than through adsorption by these particles it should be noted that ps has little effect on both eargs removal figure s9 in our study we adopted two treatments s nzvi ps and nzvi ps to test their performance on the degradation of iargs blatem and teta again a pattern of time dependent increase was found in all treatments after 60 min treatment with s nzvi ps 4 0 log reduction was achieved for both intracellular blatem and teta fig 5e f by contrast after a 60 min duration nzvi ps achieved up to 2 0 log reduction of blatem and 1 3 log reduction of teta thus s nzvi ps exhibited a superior performance but cannot completely remove iargs the incomplete degradation of both iargs was also confirmed by the corresponding gel electrophoresis where bands of both genes at all durations were observed fig 5g h in addition it was suspected that the inactivated arb might release iargs from cells to the solution and contribute to eargs to address this we collected supernatants from arb treated samples for qpcr analysis results showed that no eargs were detected in the supernatants that were collected from nzvi ps or s nzvi ps treated samples table s3 indicating that the released args might have been efficiently degraded by both nzvi ps or s nzvi ps fig 5a b collectively our results suggest that iargs in the host can be also removed by s nzvi ps consistent with red fluorescence fading off shown in fig 4 but iargs are more recalcitrant than eargs to be damaged which is consistent with a previous study mckinney and pruden 2012 3 4 inactivation mechanisms of arb and args considering the fact that nzvi can react with oxidants to release fe2 and trigger fenton like reactions through radical chain reactions to react with target pollutants su et al 2018 to further explore this in the present study radical scavengers such as thiourea fe ii edta and methanol were used to identify the key radicals during inactivation of arb and args by nzvi and s nzvi here we used bacterial inactivation as an example for the scavenging tests prior to the experiment the applied dosage of each scavenger was optimized to ensure maximum quenching but negligible bactericidal effect on bacterial e coli ghasemian et al 2017 wang et al 2012 with the addition of 100 mm methanol oh and so4 scavenger the bactericidal effects of both nzvi and s nzvi were eliminated comparted with the no scavenger added counterpart fig 6 a b with the addition of 100 mm thiourea oh the inactivation of e coli was inhibited by both materials indicating that oh played a critical role in the bacterial inactivation process given that the inactivation of e coli was much more strictly prohibited with the addition of methanol than that with thiourea both so4 and oh were the dominant reactive species causing bactericidal effects in addition the involvement of h2o2 was determined by prohibiting inactivation efficiency with the addition of 0 1 mm fe ii edta but this prohibition was weaker than those induced by so4 and oh species this can be also supported by the declined k values after adding scavengers following the order methanol thiourea fe ii edta no scavenger table 1 to further confirm the major reactive species so4 and oh responsible for inactivation of arb and args a dmpo spin trapping epr technique was then performed in the absence of ps four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh 1 1 1 1 zhang et al 2020b were identified for both nzvi and s nzvi fig 6c in the single component system the signal intensity of oh generated by s nzvi were stronger than by those generated by nzvi with the addition of ps peaks ascribing to dmpo so4 1 1 1 1 1 1 were identified this suggests the activation of ps by both nanoparticles to produce so4 radicals eqs 4 and 5 as no peaks were detected in the single component of ps in addition the intensity of oh signal was significantly higher in a binary system nzvi ps than in a single component nzvi indicating that oh radical was greatly generated via the persulfate activation process eq 6 radical conversion from so4 to oh was confirmed by a time course epr analysis of s nzvi ps figure s10 in binary component systems s nzvi ps generated stronger so4 and oh signals than that nzvi ps did collectively these results suggest that so4 and oh are the dominant radicals to both arb and args inactivation by s nzvi ps furthermore s nzvi ps can generate much more radicals of so4 and oh than their individual components alone thus achieving better inactivation performance 4 f e 0 s 2 o 8 2 f e a q 2 2 s o 4 2 5 s 2 o 8 2 f e a q 2 s o 4 s o 4 2 f e a q 3 6 s o 4 h 2 o s o 4 2 o h h 4 discussion the emergence and spread of arb and args in water systems e g treated wastewater effluent and drinking water have posed threats to public health although chlorination ozonation and ultraviolet disinfection processes are widely used in both water and wastewater treatment systems however these technologies are not efficient enough to simultaneously remove both arb and args and the outcomes may even be contradictory guo et al 2017a for example a recent full scale survey study reported that chlorine disinfection not only increased the abundance of iargs but also enhanced the concentration of extracellular args liu et al 2018 to overcome these obstacles we synthesized sulfidated nzvi s nzvi and applied it to inactivate both arb and args in the present study to achieve more robust performance towards the removal of arb and args we introduced persulfate ps that can be easily activated by nzvi to produce sulfate radicals so4 which are more robust and has a longer half life than hydroxyl radicals oh oh et al 2016 yang et al 2015 we found that the combination of sulfidation and ps showed the highest inactivation efficiencies against arb and args during sulfidation the secondary phase fes mackinawite can be formed on the s nzvi surface and can serve as a catalyst for ps activation sühnholz et al 2020 this heterogenous surface increases electron transfer efficiency between the bulk solution surface fes and the core nzvi wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2020a as an electron shuttle fe2 was generated at a much faster rate in s nzvi than in pristine nzvi figure s11 thus triggering reactions eqs 5 and 6 to produce more oh radicals moreover in the system of ps activation it was observed that more fe2 was generated than the system without ps leading to more so4 production collectively s nzvi coupled with ps can be more robust to inactivate arb and args so far there are various advanced materials developed for disinfection purposes but more of them required a much longer contact time up to several hours table s4 to completely inactivate bacterial cells for example 4 h of contact time was required by graphene and g c3n4 nanosheets cowrapped cyclooctasulfur 100 mg l to achieve up to 6 3 log reduction of e coli under visible light irradiation wang et al 2013 a 3 h irradiation was even required by uv led at 268 nm to achieve 4 4 log reduction of e coli nyangaresi et al 2019 by contrast s nzvi ps 100 mg l in our study exhibited much superior performance as it only took 10 min to obtain 7 8 log reduction of e coli the heterogenous phase of s nzvi also enables it to achieve higher bacterial inactivation efficiency than homogenous fenton processes feng et al 2020 mosteo et al 2020 although a higher inactivation efficiency 8 min complete inactivation of 2 107 cfu ml e coli was achieved by a composite photocatalyst loaded with noble silver ions xia et al 2016 it was relatively comparable with that achieved by s nzvi ps within 10 min complete inactivation of 108 cfu ml in our study which did not rely on photo driven reactions moreover we found that the treated arb 10 min exposure with s nzvi ps was permanently inactivated thus eliminating risks to human health although ferrous or ferric ions were released during inactivation processes the leaching of these products exhibited very limited inactivation efficiency 0 36 log reduction figure s12 thus the inactivation of arb was ascribed to the radicals produced from heterogenous reactions trigged by fe2 but not to fe2 itself moreover this superior performance was not ascribed to the adsorption of bacterial on the particles as we did not detect any colonies after pouring the bacterial treated particles onto the plates fig 2 and figure s8 this result was different to the photocatalysts that exhibited good bacterial adsorption li et al 2020 ma et al 2016 in addition to using pbs as a matrix our study also further tested arb inactivation performance of s nzvi ps in more realistic scenarios such as drinking water from a building water pipeline and real wastewater effluent that contained nom and suspended solids our study showed that all bacterial cells were completely inactivated when treating both filtered drinking water and filtered wastewater effluent after 10 min this suggests that nom may not substantially offset the radicals so4 and oh produced by s nzvi ps which is inconsistent with previous reports that nom can compromise bacterial inactivation efficiency by serving as radical scavengers e g quenching so4 and oh lee et al 2020 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2020b however when the lab scale reactor was used to continuously treat unfiltered wastewater effluent containing 20 0 mg l of suspended solid it took a longer contact time 30 min to achieve complete inactivation of all bacteria this suggests that suspended solids in unfiltered wastewater effluent might have consumed radicals and shelter bacterial cells during disinfection processes as suggested in previous studies falsanisi et al 2008 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 mcfadden et al 2017 it should be noted that s nzvi residuals in the reactor effluent can be separated after 60 min settlement figure s2b d collectively these results suggest the feasibility of s nzvi ps to bacterial inactivation in realistic settings during the inactivation process bacterial cells can be lysed to release their intracellular dna molecules which can become extracellular dna fragments it is well understood that the phenotype conferring genes are frequently found on mobile genetic elements such as broad host range plasmids which can be persistent over 20 weeks in the environment mao et al 2014 these dna fragments can be precursors for the exchange of args across genus through conjugation hu et al 2019 or natural transformation jin et al 2020 therefore apart from arb inactivation degradation of associated args can also be critical in reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance here we also found a synergistic effect of sulfidation and ps on the degradation of args with 8 0 log reduction of all eargs within 5 min by s nzvi ps fig 5 this performance is more efficient than previously reported disinfectants including chlorine ozone and uv he et al 2019 it is reported that the rate constant of oh up to 2 3 1011 m s for arg degradation is far higher than nh2cl 1 4 4 4 m s clo2 3 5 12 m s o3 1 8 6 9 104 m s and uv 2 0 8 8 10 2 cm mj in the present study s nzvi ps produced more oh and so4 radicals fig 6c and had larger rate constants k min 1 of both eargs degradation than pristine nzvi figure s13 and table s5 thus exhibiting higher degradation efficiency of eargs similar results were also found regarding iargs degradation efficiency figure s14 and table s6 previous studies reported that dna damage can be sustained at neighboring bi pyrimidine bases cytotoxic dna lesions e g cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 photoproduct 6 4pp can be induced during disinfection sinha and häder 2002 and in particular tt tc ct and cccpds can be generated at intrastrand 5 bipyrimidine 3 sites he et al 2019 consequently the reaction rate of args is positively correlated with the content of neighboring thymidine bases given that blatem has higher fractions of neighboring pyrimidine bases tt tc ct and cc than teta chang et al 2017 mckinney and pruden 2012 blatem can exhibit a higher reactivity with disinfectants compared to the teta gene consistently as we found in the present study the teta gene was more recalcitrant than the blatem gene in each treatment based on the removal rate constant even though its genomic size is larger than the latter general consistency in the kinetics of the removal of eargs and iargs was observed within the exposure durations in each treatment this suggests that s nzvi ps has the ability to react with cellular dna nevertheless this reactivity is limited because of the cell envelope and other cellular biomolecules acting as a periplasmic gate zgurskaya et al 2015 there is also a possibility that iargs can be released from treated cells and then contribute to eargs the released args from bacterial cells could to some extent consume radicals produced during inactivation process consequently the degradation profiles of iargs lagged behind arb inactivation in all treatments and exhibited lower efficiency compared to eargs suggesting that iargs may escape from disinfection processes even if the host cells are permanently inactivated similar results have been reported in previous studies of iargs degradation with various disinfectants czekalski et al 2016 he et al 2019 mckinney and pruden 2012 zhang et al 2019a these findings raise concerns for the spread of args across bacteria genera via horizontal gene transfer and may require more advanced techniques to degrade iargs from arb 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that s nzvi ps exhibited a superior performance on permanent arb inactivation and arg degradation via the generation of high levels of radicals so4 and oh the complete and permanent inactivation of arb 7 8 log reduction was achieved after 10 min treatment and the complete degradation of eargs 8 0 log reduction was obtained after 5 min treatment with 100 mg l of s nzvi ps in pbs this superior arb inactivation performance was also observed in real water matrices even with the presence of nom and suspended solids in addition this study for the first time visualizes the inactivation process of arb at a single cell level the combination of microscopy and microfluidics in this study will enable us to explore areas such as the interactions between bacterial cells and disinfecting materials as well as the bacterial responses to stress our results imply that the synergistic s nzvi ps system is promising for water disinfection such as both arb inactivation and the degradation of associated args thus reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance in real settings however we should be cautious that iargs degradation lagged behind arb inactivation and was not parallelly efficient with eargs degradation scale up studies and the effects of other water quality parameters such as ph turbidity and suspended solids on arb and args removal need to be examined in the future in addition the health risks associated with the application of s nzvi ps in water disinfection should be further evaluated in particular for drinking

16998,uv sulfite systems with oxygen have recently been considered as advanced oxidation processes in view of the participation of oxysulfur radicals however the contribution of oh and the efficiency of destructing emerging contaminants ecs in water remain largely unclear here the uv s iv process was applied with natural reoxygenation to degrade two typical ecs diethyl phthalate dep and bisphenol a bpa showing different properties solution ph played the key role in determining the reactive species and both dep and bpa were more favorably degraded at more alkaline conditions with higher utilization efficiency of so3 2 specifically the h o2 oh and so3 were identified at acidic condition but the amount of oh accumulated significantly with the elevation of ph competitive quenching experiments showed that eaq and oh dominated the degradation of dep and bpa at alkaline condition respectively besides dep showed higher quantum efficiency for the indirect photolysis and mineralization degree than that of bpa at ph 9 2 mainly due to the direct use of the primary photoproduct the possible transformation mechanisms of s iv and mineralization routes of both pollutants were proposed this study may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in uv s iv process and a promising alternative for efficient removal of ecs in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv sulfite oxygen advanced oxidation emerging contaminant hydroxyl radical 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs has received increasing attention due to the extensive detection in various water bodies and serious risks on human heath petrie et al 2015 most ecs are difficult to be effectively removed during conventional wastewater treatment which leads to their continuous discharge to receiving waters with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 up to mg l 1 ngoc han et al 2018 due to the lack of appropriate policy and legislation for the regulation of ecs discharge the effects of ecs may be notable in the long run thus it is necessary to develop efficient and applicable technologies for the degradation of ecs in wastewater advanced oxidation technologies aots exhibit good performance in the removal of various ecs pan et al 2020a pan et al 2020b rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 especially those by activating peroxymonosulfate or peroxydisulfate different reactive oxygen species ros can be in situ generated by using various activating methods wang and wang 2018 besides persulfate shows higher stability and convenience than h2o2 for storage and transportation although the above dominant advantages significantly propel the development of various novel persulfate activating methods persulfate based aots still face the drawbacks of prohibitively high cost and potential toxicity brought by treated water liang and wang 2013 sulfite the residual product of flue gas desulfurization has been considered as a possible alternative in recent years recent studies have reported the effective sulfite activation by transition metals e g fe3 dong et al 2019 co2 yuan et al 2018 photo electrons from photocatalysts e g bivo4 chen et al 2019 and the ultraviolet uv light among which the uv light activation is relatively simple environmentally friendly and free of secondary pollution so far some studies have been carried out using uv sulfite process to successfully degrade various organic compounds li et al 2014 li et al 2012 yang et al 2020 unlike transition metal activation and photo electrons activation of sulfite in which processes various ros e g so4 oh are responsible for compound degradation cao et al 2019 chen et al 2019 dong et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 hydrated electrons eaq generated by photolysis of sulfite is proposed to be the dominant even exclusive reactive species in uv sulfite for pollutants decomposition li et al 2012 song et al 2013 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b xie et al 2017 additionally ph is assumed as one determinant factor influencing process efficiency and alkaline condition has been found favorable for compound removal xiao et al 2017b effective quantum efficiency φ for the formation of eaq in uv sulfite process was determined to be 0 116 0 002 mol einstein 1 at ph 9 20 li et al 2012 in addition dissolved oxygen do invariably present in most open water systems may also play an important role in scavenging eaq song et al 2013 the presence of do may also yield the generation of ros but so far limited studies have considered and measured the contribution of possible ros other than eaq or h in uv sulfite process yang et al 2020 luo et al 2019 have investigated the oxidation of as iii in uvc s iv system exposed to air in which ros was assumed to contribute as iii oxidation but direct detection of ros and in depth discussion was missing luo et al 2019 seid et al 2020 reported that both so4 and eaq participated in the conversion of organic pollutants in uv sulfite process but the variation of reactive species under different ph conditions was not considered seid et al 2020 moreover up to now most studies have investigated the removal of halogenated organic inorganic pollutants e g monochloroacetic acid li et al 2012 perchlorate vellanki and batchelor 2013 vinyl chloride liu et al 2013b cr vi xie et al 2017 and bromate xiao et al 2017a limited efforts have been taken to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of uv s iv process for degrading ecs in this study two typical ecs diethyl phthalate dep and bisphenol a bpa showing remarkable differences in photoactivities and dissociating properties were selected as the model pollutants the kinetics and mechanism of their degradation in uv s iv process s iv denoting the mixture of so3 2 and hso3 were investigated under 254 nm uv irradiation influencing factors of solution ph and do were examined emphatically based on competitive quenching study and esr analysis at different ph the mechanisms of uv s iv process in degrading ec pollutants were revealed finally based on the analysis of degradation products the degradation pathways of the investigated pollutants were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reaction solution all the chemicals and solvents are listed in supporting information table s1 all reagents were used as received without further treatment ultrapure water prepared by a hitech water purification machine was used exclusively solution ph was adjusted by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or 0 1 m phosphoric acid the na2so3 stock solution was freshly prepared before each experiment using degassed ultrapure water to minimize the oxidation of sulfite 2 2 photoreactions all photochemical experiments were carried out in a tailor made photoreactor equipped with a coolant thermostat fig s1 the uv irradiation was provided by low pressure mercury lamps rayonet org with emission wavelength of 254 nm installed on the ceiling solution temperature was maintained at 25 0 5 c by water bath cylindrical quartz beakers with the inner diameter of 85 mm were placed on magnetic stirrers during the reaction the photon flux i0 entering the solution from the light source was calculated to be 4 88 10 7 einstein s 1 10 lamps using the ki kio3 method text s1 fig s2 li et al 2012 rahn 1997 since the uv light in the reactor was not strictly collimated beam and there may be possible interference from water bath especially for lamps installed toward each end the effective path length of light l was determined to be 4 04 cm based on the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 text s2 fig s3 li et al 2012 which was a little smaller than the solution depth 4 5 cm reaction solutions with 250 ml total volume were used for photochemical reactions unless otherwise stated the initial concentrations of dep or bpa was applied as 0 01 mm except for lc ms and toc analysis in which 0 1 mm compound was applied to intensify the signal for most experiments solution was stirred and exposed to air to obtain natural reoxygenation the na2so3 with 8 0 mm initial concentration was adopted unless otherwise stated which induced a transient anaerobic solution environment in the initial period afterwards the continuous reoxygenation kept the do level in the range of 1 0 2 5 mg l without artificial control oxygen free condition was achieved by purging n2 before and during the reaction which was conducted in quartz tubes to suppress fast reoxygenation the desired solution ph was adjusted after na2so3 addition without further control during reaction 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dep and bpa was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 with athena c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm a mobile phase of methanol 0 1 phosphoric acid water solution 70 30 vol vol was employed at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentrations of so3 2 so4 2 and s2o6 2 were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 90 equipped with a dionex ionpac ag15 4 50 mm guard column dionex ionpac as15 analytical column 4 250 mm and an anion suppressor aers 500 4mm the eluent was 38 mm koh water solution at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the degradation intermediates of target pollutants were analyzed by lc ms xevo g2 xs tof waters equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a time of flight mass spectrometer both negative and positive modes were used for intermediates detection the total organic carbon toc concentration was quantified by analytic jena multi n c 3100 toc electron spin resonance esr signals were collected by bruker emx 10 12 equipped with x band field sweep dmpo was added in reaction solution as a spin trapping agent and signals were collected after 20 min reaction coumarin was applied as a probe for the quantification of oh nafradi et al 2020 newton and milligan 2006 and the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was detected by fluorescence spectrometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 the degradation kinetics of dep and bpa at different ph solution ph can influence the existing states of both sulfurous acid and pollutants so as to further affect the efficiency of pollutants degradation the degradation kinetics of dep and bpa were examined at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 fig 1 reaction between sulfite and two pollutants could be excluded based on dark tests only sulfite it was found that although moderate removal by direct photolysis was achieved for dep 45 and bpa 63 the combination of uv and s iv could accelerate pollutants degradation to different extent at varied ph in general alkaline conditions were found more favorable for pollutants removal compared with neutral and acidic conditions the degradation kinetics of both compounds were found well fitted for pseudo first order decay model fig s4 the apparent rate constants kobs of dep and bpa could increase by 36 and 17 times respectively in uv s iv process when ph0 changed from 7 0 to 10 0 as comparison the influence of ph on direct photolysis no sulfite of both compounds was also examined fig 1 c d hardly any influence was made on dep photolysis by changing ph but remarkable effect was observed for bpa the kinetic fitting results given in fig s4 also demonstrated pseudo first order however it was clearly seen from the variation profiles of kobs along with ph0 fig s5 that the acceleration of bpa degradation at alkaline conditions was largely attributed to the improved direct photolysis but the enhancement of dep was almost entirely attributed to sulfite induced indirect photolysis such difference was probably caused by different properties of two compounds the dissociating property of bpa pka1 9 6 pka2 10 2 meng et al 2019 leads to different species distribution at varied ph fig s6 and the fully deprotonated bpa molecules are in the majority at ph exceeding pka2 therefore the absorbance of bpa near 254 nm fig s7 and the corresponding photolysis rate of bpa can be enhanced due to the presence of unshared electrons of bpa structure at alkaline condition kang et al 2018 3 2 qualitative and quantitative analysis of radical species at different ph esr detection was conducted to qualitatively analyze the radical species formed at different ph fig 2 under only uv irradiation weak signals showing the characteristic 4 fold peak of dmpo oh αn 14 8 g αβ h 14 8 g were observed fig s8 and the involved mechanism has been discussed elsewhere xu et al 2019 strong signals showing different peaks were detected in uv s iv at different ph at ph 3 the mixture of dmpo so3 αn 14 4 g αβ h 16 2 g and dmpo h αn 15 8 g αβ h 23 4 g could be identified fig 2a yutaka kirino 1981 since the fraction of hso3 at ph 3 accounts for more than 90 and so3 2 accounts for less than 10 of the total amount of sulphurous acid pka1 1 9 pka2 7 2 fig s9 li et al 2014 the captured so3 and h should be resulting from the photolysis of hso3 eq 1 and or the protonation of eaq eqs 2 3 that is widely reported as the photolysis product of so3 2 xiao et al 2017b the rapid reaction between eaq and hso3 eq 4 should also be one possible source of h with abundant hso3 hayon et al 1972 1 hs o 3 hv h s o 3 2 s o 3 2 hv e aq s o 3 3 e aq h h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 4 e aq h h s o 3 2 k 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 5 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 at neutral condition the signal of h almost disappeared probably due to the dramatic decrease of h fig 2b however four peaks with similar intensity were detected which can be assigned to the signals overlapped from the comparable amount of dmpo so3 and dmpo oh due to the similar hyperfine constants of both species zamora and villamena 2012 when the ph further increased to 8 a quartet with the height ratio of 1 1 8 1 7 1 was observed which closely resembles the signal of dmpo oh expect for the slightly unmatched height ratios fig 2c the reason was reported to be the overlapping of predominant oh and a small ratio of so3 zamora and villamena 2012 fig 2d shows the esr signals obtained at ph 10 where the typical four peaks with very close height intensity to 1 2 2 1 1 1 95 1 89 1 were obtained indicating the presence of abundant oh and few so3 zamora and villamena 2012 it could be concluded that h only existed in acidic condition but oh was more easily produced under alkaline conditions moreover coumarin was applied as a probe to quantify oh k 2 0 109 m 1s 1 newton and milligan 2006 previous study verified that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was initiated only by oh rather than h nor eaq nafradi et al 2020 fig 3 shows the variation profiles of 7 hydroxycoumarin during 254 nm uv irradiation with and without the presence of s iv at different ph it can be clearly seen that the generation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was remarkably enhanced in the presence of na2so3 and larger amount of 7 hydroxycoumarin could be detected at higher ph which proved that more oh was produced at more alkaline condition however it was noticed that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin at acidic condition could also be seen at the later period although showing an inhibitory phase initially therefore the failure of oh detection by esr at ph 3 was probably resulting from the effective capture of so3 by dmpo that hindered the further reaction of so3 as a possible source for oh moreover the ratio of oh so3 gradually increased with the elevation of solution ph fig 2 which also supported the hypothesis that the generation of oh may consume so3 in addition in light of the coexistence of eaq and o2 the formation of o2 eq 5 at different ph was also detected by esr fig s10 it was found that the o2 signals decreased gradually at increasing ph and almost disappeared at ph 10 this suggests that o2 may be more readily produced or accumulated at acidic condition 3 3 role of dissolved oxygen in the degradation of bpa and dep at different ph many studies have reported the negative impact of oxygen as a quencher for eaq in uv sulfite process eq 5 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2017b however the production of ros in uv s iv may depend on o2 the generation of highly reactive ros in many other sulfite activation technologies has been reported needing the involvement of o2 wang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 and the oxidation of so3 was assumed as a crucial step eq 6 das 2001 deister and warneck 1990 hence n2 was purged into solution before and during the reaction to create anaerobic condition do 0 3 mg l in order to investigate the possible role of o2 as shown in fig 4 weak change was made by purging n2 at acidic conditions implying that o2 played minor role in the degradation of dep and bpa at acidic condition contrastingly the degradation of dep and bpa under alkaline conditions showed different influences by n2 purging weak inhibition was observed for dep fig 4a but significant inhibition was found for bpa degradation fig 4b results indicated that o2 played an important role in promoting bpa degradation at alkaline condition while the fast degradation of dep related much less with o2 coumarin was further applied at ph 10 with and without n2 purging to compare the amount of oh produced fig 4c it can been found that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin during n2 purging was significantly decreased indicating the involvement of o2 in forming oh 6 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 k 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 4 competitive quenching analysis at different ph 3 4 1 the quenching examination at alkaline condition competitive quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the indirect photolysis mechanism of both compounds the quenching results at alkaline conditions are shown in fig 5 as known n2o is an effective scavenger for eaq eq 7 pimblott et al 1992 which was tried to evaluate the role of eaq formed at alkaline condition it was found that the indirect photolysis of both compounds could be well inhibited however in view of the anaerobic condition in n2o saturated solution do 0 3 mg l n2o purging may not only quench eaq but also hinder the formation of o2 derived ros therefore another effective eaq scavenger no3 was used to further evaluate the role of eaq which can react with eaq at diffusion controlled rate eq 8 gonzalez et al 2004 the indirect photodegradation of dep was significantly inhibited by no3 implying the dominant role of eaq in degrading dep but no3 failed to significantly quench bpa degradation suggesting that the indirect photolysis of bpa may be also related with other reactive species the interference caused by the photoactivity of no3 was discussed in text s3 fig s11 and fig s12 7 n 2 o e aq n 2 o k 9 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 8 n o 3 e aq n o 3 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 the possible contribution of ros were further investigated by adding tert butanol tba and methanol meoh tba is an effective scavenger for oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 and inert toward so4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 xu et al 2016 but meoh is effective for both oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 similar inhibitory results were obtained by adding meoh or tba for both compounds which suggested that the significant contribution of so4 to dep bpa degradation could be ruled out in addition dep was weakly inhibited by both tba and meoh implying a minor role of oh in dep degradation on the contrary either meoh or tba remarkably slowed down bpa degradation indicating the important role of oh in bpa degradation furtherly monochloroacetic acid macc was applied to simultaneously quench eaq 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2014 and oh 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2007 whose light absorbance of macc at 254 nm can be neglected fig s13 the addition of 8 0 mm macc almost completely inhibited the indirect photolysis of both compounds additional experiments were conducted to examine the role of o2 in compounds removal by using superoxide dismutase sod as a scavenger as shown in fig s14 no inhibition could be observed by doping 50 u ml 1 sod for both compounds which could rule out the contribution of o2 in compounds degradation at alkaline condition 3 4 2 the quenching examination at acidic condition several radicals were verified by esr analysis h so3 o2 and small amount of oh was detected by fluorescence product analysis at acidic condition fig 3 although the improvement of compounds removal was very weak the direct oxidation of compounds by so3 could be ruled out in view of the weak oxidizing ability neta et al 1988 it was found that the addition of meoh could decrease compounds removal fig s15 indicating the possible contribution of oh to compounds degradation it should be noted that no2 as a more effective scavenger for h 7 1 108 m 1 s 1 g v buxton 1988 failed to quench compounds removal due to the high photoactivity of hno2 data not shown therefore no3 was doped as a quencher for eaq to indirectly examine the effect of h and o2 that were formed via eaq the 2 mm no3 was more competitive for reacting with eaq than either h h 1 mm at ph 3 or o2 which may impede the formation of h and o2 simultaneously as can be seen from fig s15 no3 could decrease the degradation of dep and bpa indicating the possible contribution of eaq to compounds removal separate experiments were conducted using sod to quench o2 fig s16 in which inhibition was found for bpa but not for dep which suggested that bpa degradation at ph 3 may also be related with o2 since o2 was reported not capable to oxidize phthalate esters liu et al 2019 the slight decrease of dep degradation by no3 was probably due to the impediment of forming h 2 3 v which may also play weak role in compounds removal 3 5 effective quantum efficiency of uv s iv process the effective quantum yield φ mol einstein 1 for the formation of eaq or so3 has usually been used to evaluate the efficiency of uv s iv process li et al 2012 vellanki and batchelor 2013 but the φ for the degradation of ecs in uv s iv has rarely been discussed herein the φ values for the degradation of both dep and bpa were investigated which were defined as the moles of target ec dep or bpa removed divided by the total photons absorbed by both sulfite and ec eq 9 liu et al 2014 yu et al 2019 based on such calculation direct photolysis of ec and indirect photodegradation induced by s iv were all included the same ph condition at ca 9 2 was chosen to calculate and compare the φ for dep and bpa degradation respectively trying to maintain identical photoproperty of s iv in solution 9 φ r 0 v i 0 1 10 α l where r0 is the initial degradation rate of ec in uv s iv r0 kobs c0 m 1 s 1 i0 is the photon flux entering the solution l is the effective path length of light v is the solution volume α is the summary of all components in solution that absorb light at 254 nm liu et al 2014 liu et al 2013b α εec cec εsulfite csulfite at ph 9 2 εdep 1700 m 1 cm 1 εbpa 1100 m 1 cm 1 εsulfite 16 4 m 1 cm 1 csulfite 8 10 3 m based on this the φ for the degradation of dep and bpa were calculated as 2 02 10 2 mol einstein 1 and 1 47 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively it is noted that the φ values obtained in the present study are smaller than the value reported by li et al 2012 for the formation of eaq in uv sulfite process 0 116 mol einstein 1 at ph 9 20 li et al 2012 this may be because that the primary photoproduct of eaq can only be partially captured by ecs and a fair amount of eaq may participate in the generation of secondary photoproduct e g ros and or in the degradation of the degraded intermediates to further quantify the effective quantum yield for indirect degradation of ecs φindirect that can reveal the efficiency of sulfite based photoreaction more clearly the effective quantum yield for direct photolysis of ecs φdirect in uv s iv process should be deducted from φ eq 10 however since the ecs and sulfite in uv s iv process can compete for light the initial photolysis rate of ecs should depend on the actual amount of photons absorbed by ecs in uv s iv process liu et al 2014 the photon flux iec absorbed by dep or bpa in uv s iv process can be obtained by eq 11 which was calculated as 4 19 10 8 einstein s 1 and 2 77 10 8 einstein s 1 for dep and bpa respectively 10 φ indirect φ φ direct 11 i ec i 0 ε ec c ec ε ec c ec ε sulfite c sulfite 1 10 α l since the direct photolysis rate of dep or bpa in the coexistence of sulfite cannot be measured directly the photolysis rate of two ecs ki ec under different photon flux i ec conditions in the absence of sulfite was measured separately according to eq 12 to analyze the relationship between ki ec and i ec and results are given in table 1 different i ec values were obtained by varying the number of lamp tubes linear relationship was obtained between ki ec and i ec within the examined range fig s19 and the equations were regressed as ki ec dep 1430 i ec 1 10 5 r2 0 999 and ki ec bpa 5624 i ec 6 10 5 r2 0 982 respectively by substituting the photon flux iec absorbed by dep 4 19 10 8 einstein s 1 or bpa 2 77 10 8 einstein s 1 in uv s iv process the kobs of direct photolysis were calculated as 4 99 10 5 s 1 and 9 57 10 5 s 1 respectively comparing with the values obtained in only uv condition fig s4 c d the presence of sulfite can induce inner filter effect leading to slower direct photolysis rate than that in pure water thus the φdirect can be calculated as 2 98 10 3 mol einstein 1 and 8 64 10 3 mol einstein 1 for dep and bpa respectively based on eq 13 correspondingly the φindirect values were obtained as 1 72 10 2 mol einstein 1 and 6 09 10 3 mol einstein 1 for dep and bpa respectively 12 i ec i 0 1 10 ε ec c ec l 13 φ direct r 0 v i ec where r0 is the initial degradation rate of ecs by direct photolysis in uv s iv r0 ki ec c0 m 1 s 1 ki ec the pseudo first order rate constants for direct photolysis of dep and bpa in the presence of sulfite based on the above calculation dep showed higher φindirect than bpa which implied that sulfite made more significant influence on the indirect photodegradation of dep than that of bpa since the indirect degradation of dep was mainly attributed to eaq unlike bpa which was mainly decomposed by oh the direct utilization of the primary photoproduct was beneficial to improve the quantum efficiency 3 6 variation of sulfur ions concentration to further investigate the mechanisms of uv s iv processes the variation of major sulfur ions so3 2 and so4 2 with and without the irradiation of uv was investigated at three ph levels 3 8 and 10 fig 6 in dark condition the s iv species could still undergo gradual oxidation implying the effective reoxygenation during the stirring process the oxidation product in dark was primarily so4 2 according to the almost constant total amount of s iv so4 2 so3 2 hso3 so4 2 the ph 8 condition was found most favorable for the noncatalytic oxidation of s iv and the oxidation of s iv showed the lowest rate at ph 3 fig 6d under uv irradiation the conversion of s iv increased most significantly at ph 3 3 54 mm fig 6 d besides the sum of s iv so4 2 showed the most remarkable decrease at ph 3 ca 31 implying the possible formation of other sulfur species by comparing the retention time on ion chromatography dithionate ion s2o6 2 formation was observed at ph 3 fig s20 based on esr detection and the quantitative analysis of oh so3 radical may experience relatively slow transformation to more oxidative radicals at acidic condition which could therefore increase the probability to form s2o6 2 eq 14 xiao et al 2017b further experiments were conducted to evaluate the photoactivity of s2o6 2 under 254 nm irradiation and hardly any change of s2o6 2 concentration was observed at either acidic or alkaline condition fig s21 suggesting that the formed s2o6 2 could not go further radical propagation at ph 10 hardly any so3 signal could be detected on esr fig 4d suggesting the rapid transformation of so3 which also led to the nearly stoichiometrically balanced formation of so4 2 fig 6c by comparing the difference of so3 2 decrease between conditions with and without uv fig 6d it was easily found that the catalytic decomposition of s iv at more alkaline condition showed higher utilization efficiency 14 s o 3 s o 3 s 2 o 6 2 k 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 7 proposed mechanisms in uv s iv processes based on the above investigation the mechanisms of reactive species transformation involved in uv s iv process were proposed in fig 7 electron transfer has been well established as the primary step during photolysis leading to the formation of eaq and so3 as the primary photoproducts fischer and warneck 1996 hayon et al 1972 according to the results of esr and nitrogen purging experiment o2 was involved in the formation of oh since o2 can react rapidly with both eaq eq 8 h eq 15 and so3 eq 6 das 2001 deister and warneck 1990 competition for o2 between two routes may be invoked under natural reoxygenation conditions in order to verify this artificial aeration was provided to supply sufficient o2 for both routes and the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin under aeration was found to increase significantly at both acidic and alkaline conditions fig s22 indicating the enhancement of oh formation by supplying abundant o2 moreover the influence of aeration on compounds degradation was also studied fig s23 improvement was obtained for the degradation of both compounds at ph 3 and more significant improvement was obtained for bpa which can be explained by the increased formation of oh by air purging and more sensitive to oh of bpa on the contrary the degradation of both compounds at alkaline conditions was inhibited and dep was inhibited more significantly this was due to the complete quenching of eaq by abundant o2 and more sensitive to eaq of dep it should be also noted that the increase of 7 hydroxycoumarin was even more remarkable at ph 3 which was fully confirmed that the lack of oh under acidic condition under natural reoxygenation conditions was due to the lack of o2 however the limited o2 dissolved by natural reoxygenation more easily went to form o2 at acidic condition fig s10 resulting in a severe competition for o2 with reaction of eq 6 previous study showed that o2 did not play the role of a chain carrier for the chain propagation reactions of s iv photocatalysis hayon et al 1972 which could combine with so3 to terminate radical reaction eq 16 zagorski et al 1971 not conductive to efficient utilization of photons 15 o 2 h h o 2 2 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 16 s o 3 o 2 s o 3 2 o 2 k 10 9 m 1 s 1 however the intermediate so5 was important for radical propagation and so4 could form by self combination eq 17 deister and warneck 1990 hayon et al 1972 fast reaction with abundant so3 2 can also give birth to so4 either directly eq 18a or via photolyzing the intermediate of peroxymonosulfate eq 18b 19 deister and warneck 1990 the rate of hso5 so5 2 photolysis into so4 and oh could increase dramatically with ph guan et al 2011 contrastingly hso3 prevailing at acidic condition was reported to show lower quantum yield 0 19 0 03 mol einstein 1 than so3 2 0 39 0 03 mol einstein 1 to form so3 fischer and warneck 1996 besides the slow reaction between so5 and hso3 1 2 0 4 104 m 1s 1 fischer and warneck 1996 coupled with the insufficient o2 available for so3 transformation the formation of so5 may be hindered moreover both hso3 and so3 2 can react with so4 to regenerate so3 eqs 20 21 but the k hso3 so4 is higher than k so3 2 so4 by at least a factor of 2 5 hayon et al 1972 which is also not beneficial to the accumulation of enough so4 at acidic condition whereas hardly any signals of so4 were detected on esr even at alkaline condition which may be related with the short half life of dmpo so4 adduct 95 s finkelstein et al 1980 and the conversion of so4 to oh at higher ph eq 22 can replace so4 by oh guan et al 2011

s iv process ph 9 2 were identified the corresponding degradation and mineralization kinetics were shown in fig s24 as expected dep degraded and mineralized faster than bpa under the same condition the toc decreased by 47 and 33 for dep and bpa respectively within 2 h when the complete removal of target pollutants was achieved fig s25 shows the hplc spectra of samples at different sampling times it can be clearly seen that as the degradation of dep 5 5 min some primary intermediates e g 3 2 min 3 7 min were produced which could be effectively destructed after accumulating to maximum concentration five typical intermediates m z 194 210 210 238 166 were identified fig s26 and the proposed degradation pathways were shown in fig 8 since dep reacts faster with eaq k 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 than with oh 2 3 109 m 1s 1 liu et al 2013a and eaq was found more easily to transfer to ester groups than to aromatic rings wu et al 2011 ester radical anions may be easily produced afterwards the attack by prevailing oh could form monoethyl phthalate m z 194 as a primary intermediate the attack of the aromatic ring by oh could also happen as a minor pathway in view of the detected intermediate with m z of 238 the phthalic acid was identified as a secondary intermediate before ring opening during the degradation of bpa fig s25b the liquid chromatographic peaks showing different intermediates could also be observed but with relatively low intensity indicating the possible split of two benzene rings bpa shows higher reaction rate with oh k 1 7 1010 m 1s 1 than with eaq k 7 0 109 m 1s 1 rivera utrilla et al 2016 which may result in the preference for the h abstraction by oh and the formation of hydroxylated bpa m z 260 fig s27 the formation of 4 isopropenyl phenol m z 134 was also identified fig s27 which was assumed to be a typical intermediate in oh dominated system torres et al 2008 the attack of the aromatic ring and the connecting carbon by oh mainly contributed to bpa destruction agreeing well with the quenching experiment results 4 conclusions uv sulfite process has long been assumed as an advanced reduction process due to the generation of eaq however oxygen may be present in real application which can participate the derivation of oxysulfur radicals but also quench partial eaq at the same time this study mainly focused on revealing the performance and mechanism of uv sulfite process with natural reoxygenation for the degradation of ecs in water results showed that the uv s iv process with natural reoxygenation could efficiently degrade two typical ecs dep and bpa in water solution ph showed important effect on the type of reactive substances in uv s iv and alkaline condition was found favorable for compounds destruction moreover the dissolved oxygen played a key role in deriving oh from so3 and this process was more competitive at alkaline condition under natural reoxygenation the primary species contributing to the degradation of dep and bpa at alkaline condition were determined to be eaq and oh respectively higher quantum efficiency was obtained for dep removal than that for bpa accompanied by better mineralization performance of dep by analyzing the sulfur ions variation higher conversion efficiency of so3 2 was also obtained at more alkaline condition it was found that the decomposition of dep was achieved by the coadjutant attack of eaq and oh but oh attack may be the dominant pathway for bpa removal the results imply that the uv sulfite process with natural reoxygenation can provide a feasible way to degrade different kinds of ecs in order to control their release to the natural environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript

16998,uv sulfite systems with oxygen have recently been considered as advanced oxidation processes in view of the participation of oxysulfur radicals however the contribution of oh and the efficiency of destructing emerging contaminants ecs in water remain largely unclear here the uv s iv process was applied with natural reoxygenation to degrade two typical ecs diethyl phthalate dep and bisphenol a bpa showing different properties solution ph played the key role in determining the reactive species and both dep and bpa were more favorably degraded at more alkaline conditions with higher utilization efficiency of so3 2 specifically the h o2 oh and so3 were identified at acidic condition but the amount of oh accumulated significantly with the elevation of ph competitive quenching experiments showed that eaq and oh dominated the degradation of dep and bpa at alkaline condition respectively besides dep showed higher quantum efficiency for the indirect photolysis and mineralization degree than that of bpa at ph 9 2 mainly due to the direct use of the primary photoproduct the possible transformation mechanisms of s iv and mineralization routes of both pollutants were proposed this study may provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in uv s iv process and a promising alternative for efficient removal of ecs in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv sulfite oxygen advanced oxidation emerging contaminant hydroxyl radical 1 introduction the occurrence of emerging contaminants ecs has received increasing attention due to the extensive detection in various water bodies and serious risks on human heath petrie et al 2015 most ecs are difficult to be effectively removed during conventional wastewater treatment which leads to their continuous discharge to receiving waters with concentrations ranging from ng l 1 up to mg l 1 ngoc han et al 2018 due to the lack of appropriate policy and legislation for the regulation of ecs discharge the effects of ecs may be notable in the long run thus it is necessary to develop efficient and applicable technologies for the degradation of ecs in wastewater advanced oxidation technologies aots exhibit good performance in the removal of various ecs pan et al 2020a pan et al 2020b rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 especially those by activating peroxymonosulfate or peroxydisulfate different reactive oxygen species ros can be in situ generated by using various activating methods wang and wang 2018 besides persulfate shows higher stability and convenience than h2o2 for storage and transportation although the above dominant advantages significantly propel the development of various novel persulfate activating methods persulfate based aots still face the drawbacks of prohibitively high cost and potential toxicity brought by treated water liang and wang 2013 sulfite the residual product of flue gas desulfurization has been considered as a possible alternative in recent years recent studies have reported the effective sulfite activation by transition metals e g fe3 dong et al 2019 co2 yuan et al 2018 photo electrons from photocatalysts e g bivo4 chen et al 2019 and the ultraviolet uv light among which the uv light activation is relatively simple environmentally friendly and free of secondary pollution so far some studies have been carried out using uv sulfite process to successfully degrade various organic compounds li et al 2014 li et al 2012 yang et al 2020 unlike transition metal activation and photo electrons activation of sulfite in which processes various ros e g so4 oh are responsible for compound degradation cao et al 2019 chen et al 2019 dong et al 2019 yuan et al 2018 hydrated electrons eaq generated by photolysis of sulfite is proposed to be the dominant even exclusive reactive species in uv sulfite for pollutants decomposition li et al 2012 song et al 2013 xiao et al 2017a xiao et al 2017b xie et al 2017 additionally ph is assumed as one determinant factor influencing process efficiency and alkaline condition has been found favorable for compound removal xiao et al 2017b effective quantum efficiency φ for the formation of eaq in uv sulfite process was determined to be 0 116 0 002 mol einstein 1 at ph 9 20 li et al 2012 in addition dissolved oxygen do invariably present in most open water systems may also play an important role in scavenging eaq song et al 2013 the presence of do may also yield the generation of ros but so far limited studies have considered and measured the contribution of possible ros other than eaq or h in uv sulfite process yang et al 2020 luo et al 2019 have investigated the oxidation of as iii in uvc s iv system exposed to air in which ros was assumed to contribute as iii oxidation but direct detection of ros and in depth discussion was missing luo et al 2019 seid et al 2020 reported that both so4 and eaq participated in the conversion of organic pollutants in uv sulfite process but the variation of reactive species under different ph conditions was not considered seid et al 2020 moreover up to now most studies have investigated the removal of halogenated organic inorganic pollutants e g monochloroacetic acid li et al 2012 perchlorate vellanki and batchelor 2013 vinyl chloride liu et al 2013b cr vi xie et al 2017 and bromate xiao et al 2017a limited efforts have been taken to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of uv s iv process for degrading ecs in this study two typical ecs diethyl phthalate dep and bisphenol a bpa showing remarkable differences in photoactivities and dissociating properties were selected as the model pollutants the kinetics and mechanism of their degradation in uv s iv process s iv denoting the mixture of so3 2 and hso3 were investigated under 254 nm uv irradiation influencing factors of solution ph and do were examined emphatically based on competitive quenching study and esr analysis at different ph the mechanisms of uv s iv process in degrading ec pollutants were revealed finally based on the analysis of degradation products the degradation pathways of the investigated pollutants were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reaction solution all the chemicals and solvents are listed in supporting information table s1 all reagents were used as received without further treatment ultrapure water prepared by a hitech water purification machine was used exclusively solution ph was adjusted by 0 1 m sodium hydroxide or 0 1 m phosphoric acid the na2so3 stock solution was freshly prepared before each experiment using degassed ultrapure water to minimize the oxidation of sulfite 2 2 photoreactions all photochemical experiments were carried out in a tailor made photoreactor equipped with a coolant thermostat fig s1 the uv irradiation was provided by low pressure mercury lamps rayonet org with emission wavelength of 254 nm installed on the ceiling solution temperature was maintained at 25 0 5 c by water bath cylindrical quartz beakers with the inner diameter of 85 mm were placed on magnetic stirrers during the reaction the photon flux i0 entering the solution from the light source was calculated to be 4 88 10 7 einstein s 1 10 lamps using the ki kio3 method text s1 fig s2 li et al 2012 rahn 1997 since the uv light in the reactor was not strictly collimated beam and there may be possible interference from water bath especially for lamps installed toward each end the effective path length of light l was determined to be 4 04 cm based on the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 text s2 fig s3 li et al 2012 which was a little smaller than the solution depth 4 5 cm reaction solutions with 250 ml total volume were used for photochemical reactions unless otherwise stated the initial concentrations of dep or bpa was applied as 0 01 mm except for lc ms and toc analysis in which 0 1 mm compound was applied to intensify the signal for most experiments solution was stirred and exposed to air to obtain natural reoxygenation the na2so3 with 8 0 mm initial concentration was adopted unless otherwise stated which induced a transient anaerobic solution environment in the initial period afterwards the continuous reoxygenation kept the do level in the range of 1 0 2 5 mg l without artificial control oxygen free condition was achieved by purging n2 before and during the reaction which was conducted in quartz tubes to suppress fast reoxygenation the desired solution ph was adjusted after na2so3 addition without further control during reaction 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of dep and bpa was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 with athena c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm a mobile phase of methanol 0 1 phosphoric acid water solution 70 30 vol vol was employed at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentrations of so3 2 so4 2 and s2o6 2 were measured using ion chromatography dionex ics 90 equipped with a dionex ionpac ag15 4 50 mm guard column dionex ionpac as15 analytical column 4 250 mm and an anion suppressor aers 500 4mm the eluent was 38 mm koh water solution at a flow rate of 0 8 ml min 1 the degradation intermediates of target pollutants were analyzed by lc ms xevo g2 xs tof waters equipped with an electrospray ionization source and a time of flight mass spectrometer both negative and positive modes were used for intermediates detection the total organic carbon toc concentration was quantified by analytic jena multi n c 3100 toc electron spin resonance esr signals were collected by bruker emx 10 12 equipped with x band field sweep dmpo was added in reaction solution as a spin trapping agent and signals were collected after 20 min reaction coumarin was applied as a probe for the quantification of oh nafradi et al 2020 newton and milligan 2006 and the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was detected by fluorescence spectrometry 3 results and discussion 3 1 the degradation kinetics of dep and bpa at different ph solution ph can influence the existing states of both sulfurous acid and pollutants so as to further affect the efficiency of pollutants degradation the degradation kinetics of dep and bpa were examined at the ph range of 3 0 11 0 fig 1 reaction between sulfite and two pollutants could be excluded based on dark tests only sulfite it was found that although moderate removal by direct photolysis was achieved for dep 45 and bpa 63 the combination of uv and s iv could accelerate pollutants degradation to different extent at varied ph in general alkaline conditions were found more favorable for pollutants removal compared with neutral and acidic conditions the degradation kinetics of both compounds were found well fitted for pseudo first order decay model fig s4 the apparent rate constants kobs of dep and bpa could increase by 36 and 17 times respectively in uv s iv process when ph0 changed from 7 0 to 10 0 as comparison the influence of ph on direct photolysis no sulfite of both compounds was also examined fig 1 c d hardly any influence was made on dep photolysis by changing ph but remarkable effect was observed for bpa the kinetic fitting results given in fig s4 also demonstrated pseudo first order however it was clearly seen from the variation profiles of kobs along with ph0 fig s5 that the acceleration of bpa degradation at alkaline conditions was largely attributed to the improved direct photolysis but the enhancement of dep was almost entirely attributed to sulfite induced indirect photolysis such difference was probably caused by different properties of two compounds the dissociating property of bpa pka1 9 6 pka2 10 2 meng et al 2019 leads to different species distribution at varied ph fig s6 and the fully deprotonated bpa molecules are in the majority at ph exceeding pka2 therefore the absorbance of bpa near 254 nm fig s7 and the corresponding photolysis rate of bpa can be enhanced due to the presence of unshared electrons of bpa structure at alkaline condition kang et al 2018 3 2 qualitative and quantitative analysis of radical species at different ph esr detection was conducted to qualitatively analyze the radical species formed at different ph fig 2 under only uv irradiation weak signals showing the characteristic 4 fold peak of dmpo oh αn 14 8 g αβ h 14 8 g were observed fig s8 and the involved mechanism has been discussed elsewhere xu et al 2019 strong signals showing different peaks were detected in uv s iv at different ph at ph 3 the mixture of dmpo so3 αn 14 4 g αβ h 16 2 g and dmpo h αn 15 8 g αβ h 23 4 g could be identified fig 2a yutaka kirino 1981 since the fraction of hso3 at ph 3 accounts for more than 90 and so3 2 accounts for less than 10 of the total amount of sulphurous acid pka1 1 9 pka2 7 2 fig s9 li et al 2014 the captured so3 and h should be resulting from the photolysis of hso3 eq 1 and or the protonation of eaq eqs 2 3 that is widely reported as the photolysis product of so3 2 xiao et al 2017b the rapid reaction between eaq and hso3 eq 4 should also be one possible source of h with abundant hso3 hayon et al 1972 1 hs o 3 hv h s o 3 2 s o 3 2 hv e aq s o 3 3 e aq h h k 2 3 10 10 m 1 s 1 4 e aq h h s o 3 2 k 8 10 7 m 1 s 1 5 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 10 10 m 1 s 1 at neutral condition the signal of h almost disappeared probably due to the dramatic decrease of h fig 2b however four peaks with similar intensity were detected which can be assigned to the signals overlapped from the comparable amount of dmpo so3 and dmpo oh due to the similar hyperfine constants of both species zamora and villamena 2012 when the ph further increased to 8 a quartet with the height ratio of 1 1 8 1 7 1 was observed which closely resembles the signal of dmpo oh expect for the slightly unmatched height ratios fig 2c the reason was reported to be the overlapping of predominant oh and a small ratio of so3 zamora and villamena 2012 fig 2d shows the esr signals obtained at ph 10 where the typical four peaks with very close height intensity to 1 2 2 1 1 1 95 1 89 1 were obtained indicating the presence of abundant oh and few so3 zamora and villamena 2012 it could be concluded that h only existed in acidic condition but oh was more easily produced under alkaline conditions moreover coumarin was applied as a probe to quantify oh k 2 0 109 m 1s 1 newton and milligan 2006 previous study verified that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was initiated only by oh rather than h nor eaq nafradi et al 2020 fig 3 shows the variation profiles of 7 hydroxycoumarin during 254 nm uv irradiation with and without the presence of s iv at different ph it can be clearly seen that the generation of 7 hydroxycoumarin was remarkably enhanced in the presence of na2so3 and larger amount of 7 hydroxycoumarin could be detected at higher ph which proved that more oh was produced at more alkaline condition however it was noticed that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin at acidic condition could also be seen at the later period although showing an inhibitory phase initially therefore the failure of oh detection by esr at ph 3 was probably resulting from the effective capture of so3 by dmpo that hindered the further reaction of so3 as a possible source for oh moreover the ratio of oh so3 gradually increased with the elevation of solution ph fig 2 which also supported the hypothesis that the generation of oh may consume so3 in addition in light of the coexistence of eaq and o2 the formation of o2 eq 5 at different ph was also detected by esr fig s10 it was found that the o2 signals decreased gradually at increasing ph and almost disappeared at ph 10 this suggests that o2 may be more readily produced or accumulated at acidic condition 3 3 role of dissolved oxygen in the degradation of bpa and dep at different ph many studies have reported the negative impact of oxygen as a quencher for eaq in uv sulfite process eq 5 wu et al 2020 xiao et al 2017b however the production of ros in uv s iv may depend on o2 the generation of highly reactive ros in many other sulfite activation technologies has been reported needing the involvement of o2 wang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 and the oxidation of so3 was assumed as a crucial step eq 6 das 2001 deister and warneck 1990 hence n2 was purged into solution before and during the reaction to create anaerobic condition do 0 3 mg l in order to investigate the possible role of o2 as shown in fig 4 weak change was made by purging n2 at acidic conditions implying that o2 played minor role in the degradation of dep and bpa at acidic condition contrastingly the degradation of dep and bpa under alkaline conditions showed different influences by n2 purging weak inhibition was observed for dep fig 4a but significant inhibition was found for bpa degradation fig 4b results indicated that o2 played an important role in promoting bpa degradation at alkaline condition while the fast degradation of dep related much less with o2 coumarin was further applied at ph 10 with and without n2 purging to compare the amount of oh produced fig 4c it can been found that the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin during n2 purging was significantly decreased indicating the involvement of o2 in forming oh 6 s o 3 o 2 s o 5 k 1 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 4 competitive quenching analysis at different ph 3 4 1 the quenching examination at alkaline condition competitive quenching experiments were conducted to investigate the indirect photolysis mechanism of both compounds the quenching results at alkaline conditions are shown in fig 5 as known n2o is an effective scavenger for eaq eq 7 pimblott et al 1992 which was tried to evaluate the role of eaq formed at alkaline condition it was found that the indirect photolysis of both compounds could be well inhibited however in view of the anaerobic condition in n2o saturated solution do 0 3 mg l n2o purging may not only quench eaq but also hinder the formation of o2 derived ros therefore another effective eaq scavenger no3 was used to further evaluate the role of eaq which can react with eaq at diffusion controlled rate eq 8 gonzalez et al 2004 the indirect photodegradation of dep was significantly inhibited by no3 implying the dominant role of eaq in degrading dep but no3 failed to significantly quench bpa degradation suggesting that the indirect photolysis of bpa may be also related with other reactive species the interference caused by the photoactivity of no3 was discussed in text s3 fig s11 and fig s12 7 n 2 o e aq n 2 o k 9 1 10 9 m 1 s 1 8 n o 3 e aq n o 3 2 k 1 10 10 m 1 s 1 the possible contribution of ros were further investigated by adding tert butanol tba and methanol meoh tba is an effective scavenger for oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1s 1 and inert toward so4 9 1 105 m 1s 1 xu et al 2016 but meoh is effective for both oh 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2017 similar inhibitory results were obtained by adding meoh or tba for both compounds which suggested that the significant contribution of so4 to dep bpa degradation could be ruled out in addition dep was weakly inhibited by both tba and meoh implying a minor role of oh in dep degradation on the contrary either meoh or tba remarkably slowed down bpa degradation indicating the important role of oh in bpa degradation furtherly monochloroacetic acid macc was applied to simultaneously quench eaq 1 0 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2014 and oh 4 0 108 m 1 s 1 li et al 2007 whose light absorbance of macc at 254 nm can be neglected fig s13 the addition of 8 0 mm macc almost completely inhibited the indirect photolysis of both compounds additional experiments were conducted to examine the role of o2 in compounds removal by using superoxide dismutase sod as a scavenger as shown in fig s14 no inhibition could be observed by doping 50 u ml 1 sod for both compounds which could rule out the contribution of o2 in compounds degradation at alkaline condition 3 4 2 the quenching examination at acidic condition several radicals were verified by esr analysis h so3 o2 and small amount of oh was detected by fluorescence product analysis at acidic condition fig 3 although the improvement of compounds removal was very weak the direct oxidation of compounds by so3 could be ruled out in view of the weak oxidizing ability neta et al 1988 it was found that the addition of meoh could decrease compounds removal fig s15 indicating the possible contribution of oh to compounds degradation it should be noted that no2 as a more effective scavenger for h 7 1 108 m 1 s 1 g v buxton 1988 failed to quench compounds removal due to the high photoactivity of hno2 data not shown therefore no3 was doped as a quencher for eaq to indirectly examine the effect of h and o2 that were formed via eaq the 2 mm no3 was more competitive for reacting with eaq than either h h 1 mm at ph 3 or o2 which may impede the formation of h and o2 simultaneously as can be seen from fig s15 no3 could decrease the degradation of dep and bpa indicating the possible contribution of eaq to compounds removal separate experiments were conducted using sod to quench o2 fig s16 in which inhibition was found for bpa but not for dep which suggested that bpa degradation at ph 3 may also be related with o2 since o2 was reported not capable to oxidize phthalate esters liu et al 2019 the slight decrease of dep degradation by no3 was probably due to the impediment of forming h 2 3 v which may also play weak role in compounds removal 3 5 effective quantum efficiency of uv s iv process the effective quantum yield φ mol einstein 1 for the formation of eaq or so3 has usually been used to evaluate the efficiency of uv s iv process li et al 2012 vellanki and batchelor 2013 but the φ for the degradation of ecs in uv s iv has rarely been discussed herein the φ values for the degradation of both dep and bpa were investigated which were defined as the moles of target ec dep or bpa removed divided by the total photons absorbed by both sulfite and ec eq 9 liu et al 2014 yu et al 2019 based on such calculation direct photolysis of ec and indirect photodegradation induced by s iv were all included the same ph condition at ca 9 2 was chosen to calculate and compare the φ for dep and bpa degradation respectively trying to maintain identical photoproperty of s iv in solution 9 φ r 0 v i 0 1 10 α l where r0 is the initial degradation rate of ec in uv s iv r0 kobs c0 m 1 s 1 i0 is the photon flux entering the solution l is the effective path length of light v is the solution volume α is the summary of all components in solution that absorb light at 254 nm liu et al 2014 liu et al 2013b α εec cec εsulfite csulfite at ph 9 2 εdep 1700 m 1 cm 1 εbpa 1100 m 1 cm 1 εsulfite 16 4 m 1 cm 1 csulfite 8 10 3 m based on this the φ for the degradation of dep and bpa were calculated as 2 02 10 2 mol einstein 1 and 1 47 10 2 mol einstein 1 respectively it is noted that the φ values obtained in the present study are smaller than the value reported by li et al 2012 for the formation of eaq in uv sulfite process 0 116 mol einstein 1 at ph 9 20 li et al 2012 this may be because that the primary photoproduct of eaq can only be partially captured by ecs and a fair amount of eaq may participate in the generation of secondary photoproduct e g ros and or in the degradation of the degraded intermediates to further quantify the effective quantum yield for indirect degradation of ecs φindirect that can reveal the efficiency of sulfite based photoreaction more clearly the effective quantum yield for direct photolysis of ecs φdirect in uv s iv process should be deducted from φ eq 10 however since the ecs and sulfite in uv s iv process can compete for light the initial photolysis rate of ecs should depend on the actual amount of photons absorbed by ecs in uv s iv process liu et al 2014 the photon flux iec absorbed by dep or bpa in uv s iv process can be obtained by eq 11 which was calculated as 4 19 10 8 einstein s 1 and 2 77 10 8 einstein s 1 for dep and bpa respectively 10 φ indirect φ φ direct 11 i ec i 0 ε ec c ec ε ec c ec ε sulfite c sulfite 1 10 α l since the direct photolysis rate of dep or bpa in the coexistence of sulfite cannot be measured directly the photolysis rate of two ecs ki ec under different photon flux i ec conditions in the absence of sulfite was measured separately according to eq 12 to analyze the relationship between ki ec and i ec and results are given in table 1 different i ec values were obtained by varying the number of lamp tubes linear relationship was obtained between ki ec and i ec within the examined range fig s19 and the equations were regressed as ki ec dep 1430 i ec 1 10 5 r2 0 999 and ki ec bpa 5624 i ec 6 10 5 r2 0 982 respectively by substituting the photon flux iec absorbed by dep 4 19 10 8 einstein s 1 or bpa 2 77 10 8 einstein s 1 in uv s iv process the kobs of direct photolysis were calculated as 4 99 10 5 s 1 and 9 57 10 5 s 1 respectively comparing with the values obtained in only uv condition fig s4 c d the presence of sulfite can induce inner filter effect leading to slower direct photolysis rate than that in pure water thus the φdirect can be calculated as 2 98 10 3 mol einstein 1 and 8 64 10 3 mol einstein 1 for dep and bpa respectively based on eq 13 correspondingly the φindirect values were obtained as 1 72 10 2 mol einstein 1 and 6 09 10 3 mol einstein 1 for dep and bpa respectively 12 i ec i 0 1 10 ε ec c ec l 13 φ direct r 0 v i ec where r0 is the initial degradation rate of ecs by direct photolysis in uv s iv r0 ki ec c0 m 1 s 1 ki ec the pseudo first order rate constants for direct photolysis of dep and bpa in the presence of sulfite based on the above calculation dep showed higher φindirect than bpa which implied that sulfite made more significant influence on the indirect photodegradation of dep than that of bpa since the indirect degradation of dep was mainly attributed to eaq unlike bpa which was mainly decomposed by oh the direct utilization of the primary photoproduct was beneficial to improve the quantum efficiency 3 6 variation of sulfur ions concentration to further investigate the mechanisms of uv s iv processes the variation of major sulfur ions so3 2 and so4 2 with and without the irradiation of uv was investigated at three ph levels 3 8 and 10 fig 6 in dark condition the s iv species could still undergo gradual oxidation implying the effective reoxygenation during the stirring process the oxidation product in dark was primarily so4 2 according to the almost constant total amount of s iv so4 2 so3 2 hso3 so4 2 the ph 8 condition was found most favorable for the noncatalytic oxidation of s iv and the oxidation of s iv showed the lowest rate at ph 3 fig 6d under uv irradiation the conversion of s iv increased most significantly at ph 3 3 54 mm fig 6 d besides the sum of s iv so4 2 showed the most remarkable decrease at ph 3 ca 31 implying the possible formation of other sulfur species by comparing the retention time on ion chromatography dithionate ion s2o6 2 formation was observed at ph 3 fig s20 based on esr detection and the quantitative analysis of oh so3 radical may experience relatively slow transformation to more oxidative radicals at acidic condition which could therefore increase the probability to form s2o6 2 eq 14 xiao et al 2017b further experiments were conducted to evaluate the photoactivity of s2o6 2 under 254 nm irradiation and hardly any change of s2o6 2 concentration was observed at either acidic or alkaline condition fig s21 suggesting that the formed s2o6 2 could not go further radical propagation at ph 10 hardly any so3 signal could be detected on esr fig 4d suggesting the rapid transformation of so3 which also led to the nearly stoichiometrically balanced formation of so4 2 fig 6c by comparing the difference of so3 2 decrease between conditions with and without uv fig 6d it was easily found that the catalytic decomposition of s iv at more alkaline condition showed higher utilization efficiency 14 s o 3 s o 3 s 2 o 6 2 k 3 1 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 7 proposed mechanisms in uv s iv processes based on the above investigation the mechanisms of reactive species transformation involved in uv s iv process were proposed in fig 7 electron transfer has been well established as the primary step during photolysis leading to the formation of eaq and so3 as the primary photoproducts fischer and warneck 1996 hayon et al 1972 according to the results of esr and nitrogen purging experiment o2 was involved in the formation of oh since o2 can react rapidly with both eaq eq 8 h eq 15 and so3 eq 6 das 2001 deister and warneck 1990 competition for o2 between two routes may be invoked under natural reoxygenation conditions in order to verify this artificial aeration was provided to supply sufficient o2 for both routes and the formation of 7 hydroxycoumarin under aeration was found to increase significantly at both acidic and alkaline conditions fig s22 indicating the enhancement of oh formation by supplying abundant o2 moreover the influence of aeration on compounds degradation was also studied fig s23 improvement was obtained for the degradation of both compounds at ph 3 and more significant improvement was obtained for bpa which can be explained by the increased formation of oh by air purging and more sensitive to oh of bpa on the contrary the degradation of both compounds at alkaline conditions was inhibited and dep was inhibited more significantly this was due to the complete quenching of eaq by abundant o2 and more sensitive to eaq of dep it should be also noted that the increase of 7 hydroxycoumarin was even more remarkable at ph 3 which was fully confirmed that the lack of oh under acidic condition under natural reoxygenation conditions was due to the lack of o2 however the limited o2 dissolved by natural reoxygenation more easily went to form o2 at acidic condition fig s10 resulting in a severe competition for o2 with reaction of eq 6 previous study showed that o2 did not play the role of a chain carrier for the chain propagation reactions of s iv photocatalysis hayon et al 1972 which could combine with so3 to terminate radical reaction eq 16 zagorski et al 1971 not conductive to efficient utilization of photons 15 o 2 h h o 2

et al 1972 fast reaction with abundant so3 2 can also give birth to so4 either directly eq 18a or via photolyzing the intermediate of peroxymonosulfate eq 18b 19 deister and warneck 1990 the rate of hso5 so5 2 photolysis into so4 and oh could increase dramatically with ph guan et al 2011 contrastingly hso3 prevailing at acidic condition was reported to show lower quantum yield 0 19 0 03 mol einstein 1 than so3 2 0 39 0 03 mol einstein 1 to form so3 fischer and warneck 1996 besides the slow reaction between so5 and hso3 1 2 0 4 104 m 1s 1 fischer and warneck 1996 coupled with the insufficient o2 available for so3 transformation the formation of so5 may be hindered moreover both hso3 and so3 2 can react with so4 to regenerate so3 eqs 20 21 but the k hso3 so4 is higher than k so3 2 so4 by at least a factor of 2 5 hayon et al 1972 which is also not beneficial to the accumulation of enough so4 at acidic condition whereas hardly any signals of so4 were detected on esr even at alkaline condition which may be related with the short half life of dmpo so4 adduct 95 s finkelstein et al 1980 and the conversion of so4 to oh at higher ph eq 22 can replace so4 by oh guan et al 2011

s iv process ph 9 2 were identified the corresponding degradation and mineralization kinetics were shown in fig s24 as expected dep degraded and mineralized faster than bpa under the same condition the toc decreased by 47 and 33 for dep and bpa respectively within 2 h when the complete removal of target pollutants was achieved fig s25 shows the hplc spectra of samples at different sampling times it can be clearly seen that as the degradation of dep 5 5 min some primary intermediates e g 3 2 min 3 7 min were produced which could be effectively destructed after accumulating to maximum concentration five typical intermediates m z 194 210 210 238 166 were identified fig s26 and the proposed degradation pathways were shown in fig 8 since dep reacts faster with eaq k 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 than with oh 2 3 109 m 1s 1 liu et al 2013a and eaq was found more easily to transfer to ester groups than to aromatic rings wu et al 2011 ester radical anions may be easily produced afterwards the attack by prevailing oh could form monoethyl phthalate m z 194 as a primary intermediate the attack of the aromatic ring by oh could also happen as a minor pathway in view of the detected intermediate with m z of 238 the phthalic acid was identified as a secondary intermediate before ring opening during the degradation of bpa fig s25b the liquid chromatographic peaks showing different intermediates could also be observed but with relatively low intensity indicating the possible split of two benzene rings bpa shows higher reaction rate with oh k 1 7 1010 m 1s 1 than with eaq k 7 0 109 m 1s 1 rivera utrilla et al 2016 which may result in the preference for the h abstraction by oh and the formation of hydroxylated bpa m z 260 fig s27 the formation of 4 isopropenyl phenol m z 134 was also identified fig s27 which was assumed to be a typical intermediate in oh dominated system torres et al 2008 the attack of the aromatic ring and the connecting carbon by oh mainly contributed to bpa destruction agreeing well with the quenching experiment results 4 conclusions uv sulfite process has long been assumed as an advanced reduction process due to the generation of eaq however oxygen may be present in real application which can participate the derivation of oxysulfur radicals but also quench partial eaq at the same time this study mainly focused on revealing the performance and mechanism of uv sulfite process with natural reoxygenation for the degradation of ecs in water results showed that the uv s iv process with natural reoxygenation could efficiently degrade two typical ecs dep and bpa in water solution ph showed important effect on the type of reactive substances in uv s iv and alkaline condition was found favorable for compounds destruction moreover the dissolved oxygen played a key role in deriving oh from so3 and this process was more competitive at alkaline condition under natural reoxygenation the primary species contributing to the degradation of dep and bpa at alkaline condition were determined to be eaq and oh respectively higher quantum efficiency was obtained for dep removal than that for bpa accompanied by better mineralization performance of dep by analyzing the sulfur ions variation higher conversion efficiency of so3 2 was also obtained at more alkaline condition it was found that the decomposition of dep was achieved by the coadjutant attack of eaq and oh but oh attack may be the dominant pathway for bpa removal the results imply that the uv sulfite process with natural reoxygenation can provide a feasible way to degrade different kinds of ecs in order to control their release to the natural environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript

16999,biologically activated carbon bac filters are widely used in china and worldwide as an essential part of advanced water treatment however it is unclear how to properly select the granular activated carbon gac used in bac filters and to determine when gac should be replaced in this study five bac filters each filled with a different coconut or coal based gac with different physicochemical properties were run continuously for 400 days the structure and function of the microbial community and the quantity of specific enzymes in the bac filters were investigated through an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic analysis the results indicated that gac adsorption still played a major role in removing organic matter once the filters reached a steady state which was attributed to bioregeneration and the contribution of adsorption might be relatively greater than that of biodegradation gac with strong adsorption capacity and high bioregeneration potential selected bacterial communities more phylogenetically closely related than others the iodine value could be used as an indicator of bac performance in terms of organic matter removal in the initial stage of the filters which is dominated by adsorption however it could not be used to assess performance at a later stage when adsorption and biodegradation occurred simultaneously pore size distribution characteristics could be chosen as a potential better indicator compared with the current adsorption indicators dually representing the adsorption performance and the microbial activity and the proportion of important pore size of gac that is more suitable for bac filter is suggested gac with strongly polar terminal groups is more conducive to the removal of ammonium nitrogen graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gac selection bioregeneration pore size distribution meta omics 1 introduction the presence of natural organic matter nom and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n can cause problems during the treatment of drinking water including taste and odor disinfection by product dbp formation swietlik et al 2004 and microbial regrowth in distribution networks volk et al 2005 there is a growing concern with the presence of emerging contaminants ecs in water such as pesticides mazille et al 2010 endocrine disrupting compounds edcs rosenfeldt and linden 2004 perfluorinated chemicals pfcs post et al 2013 and pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps padhye et al 2014 approximately 20 30 of nom is removed by coagulation precipitation filtration and disinfection in drinking water treatment plants dwtps chen et al 2007 however the removal of ecs is limited huerta fontela et al 2011 loraine and pettigrove 2006 to improve the quality of drinking water advanced treatment is essential biologically activated carbon bac is widely used in china and worldwide as a key component of advanced water treatment it is often combined with advanced oxidation processes such as ozone o3 or ultraviolet uv irradiation treatment chuang et al 2019 du et al 2020 the o3 bac process has been applied in more than 134 full scale dwtps in china with a daily water supply capacity exceeding 35 8 million m3 d more than 35 of the daily water supply in china however there are issues concerning the selection of the granular activated carbon gac used in bac filters to be used in bac filters gac needs to have a large adsorption capacity a fast adsorption rate a high mechanical strength and needs to meet certain criteria regarding the specific surface area pore volume mechanical strength ash content and filling density details on standards for gac use in the us the eu japan and china are listed in table s1 a common indicator of gac performance is the iodine value or methylene blue value which indicates adsorption performance an iodine value of more than 800 mg g gb t 7701 2 2008 2009 is required for bac filters in dwtps in china and an iodine value of more than 500 mg g awwa b604 12 2012 is required for municipal and industrial water treatment however operational data from full scale plants show that bac performance is not accurately predicted by the iodine value or methylene blue value after several years of operation chao et al 2017 gao 2018 chao et al 2017 reported that the performance of a bac filter using gac with an iodine value of 600 mg g was higher than that of a filter using gac with an iodine value of 900 mg g they found that this was mainly caused by differences in microbial activity therefore it is necessary to study the accuracy of the current gac selection criteria in particular the iodine value another controversial point is the service life of gac replacing or regenerating gac is recommended when its iodine value drops below 600 mg g which takes about 2 3 years in bac filters gao 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang 2007 however the bac filters in full scale dwtps could potentially be stable for 3 7 years even if the gac adsorption capacity gradually declines gao 2018 liu et al 2020 2017 lu et al 2020 teng 2020 for example in a full scale o3 bac filter with a scale of 360 000 m3 d in shanghai the initial iodine value was 1103 mg g it declined to 521 172 and 118 mg g after 2 5 and 7 years of operation respectively despite this the potassium permanganate index concentration codmn of the effluent was maintained at about 1 mg l gao 2018 which indicates that the iodine value alone is not enough to determined when to replace the gac therefore it is important to determine if the gac in bac filters requires replacement after a certain number of years of operation or if indicators can be used to determine when the gac needs to be replaced understanding the mechanisms of pollutant removal by bac filters could inform the proper selection of gac and the service life of gac in bac filters water pollution in china is mainly due to organic matter and nh4 n zhang et al 2013 regarding the removal of organic matter bac filters are thought to follow three stages over their service life period a physical adsorption predominates period b adsorption and biological degradation occur concurrently and period c biological degradation predominates dussert and van stone 1994 simpson 2008 biological degradation is thought to be the predominant process in period c because the adsorption capacity of gac has been saturated cuthbertson et al 2020 dussert and van stone 1994 however this has been debated with some studies suggesting that microbes in bac utilize organic matter resulting in in situ regeneration of adsorptive sites known as bioregeneration therefore bac filters can remove organic matter by adsorption and biodegradation concurrently despite running for several years sirotkin et al 2001 speitel and digiano 1987 the bioregeneration of spent gac could be due to concentration gradients dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997a kim et al 1997b or enzyme reactions klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 regarding the removal of nh4 n by bac filters it was mainly transformed into nitrate nitrogen no3 n by nitrification of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and was seldom removed by adsorption low temperature is one of the limiting factors affecting nitrification in water treatment when using bac andersson et al 2001 jantarakasem et al 2020 the nh4 n removal rates by bac can reach 80 90 at room temperature however the nitrification rate decreases sharply when the temperature is below 15 c and is 50 reduced at 12 c focht and verstraete 1977 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 in that case the implementation of bac would be limited in northern china due to the low nh4 n removal efficiency in the winter months when the average water temperature is usually below 5 c at present some studies have been carried out to enhance the nh4 n removal efficiency by bac at low temperatures and guarantee the water quality such as through reducing organic carbon loading van den akker et al 2011 changing the operating conditions of bac filter clara et al 2005 bioaugmentation e g biologically enhanced activated carbon huang et al 2013 qin et al 2016 and activated carbon modification e g iron loaded activated carbon ren et al 2021 these methods all work through encouraging the maintenance and growth of slow growing nitrifying organisms in the bac filter the type of gac is important for the attachment and colonization of microorganisms including nitrifying bacteria for example the pore size distribution of gac affects the bacterial concentration of which the volume of micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm promotes bacterial colonization dong et al 2019 lu et al 2020 however there is little research on the effect of properties of gac on the nh4 n removal by bac filters at low temperatures andersson et al 2001 in this study the effect of gacs with different physicochemical properties i e iodine value pore size distribution and surface chemical properties on nh4 n removal at normal and low temperature was investigated which may provide ideas to boost the poor nh4 n removal in full scaled coal based bac filter at low temperature biofilms in gac and the corresponding biodegradation guarantee a steady state in bac filters in period c biodegradation is highly affected by the activity and abundance of the microbial biomass lazarova and manem 1995 persson et al 2006 ross et al 2019 and the microbial community boon et al 2011 gerrity et al 2018 oh et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 with the magnitude of the latter far preponderating that of the former gagnon and huck 2001 lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 with recent developments in molecular biological techniques meta omics approaches provide a new way to investigate microbial community structure and function however gene based information provides an incomplete view of community functioning and metabolic activity hettich et al 2013 metaproteomics can provide information on whole protein composition and identify the functional proteins catalytic enzymes and metabolic pathways hettich et al 2013 and has already been applied successfully for diverse environments such as oceans and lakes hanson et al 2014 morris et al 2010 sowell et al 2009 soil mackelprang et al 2011 activated sludge bize et al 2015 li et al 2019 and wastewater salerno et al 2019 but few studies have investigated metaproteomics in bac filters in this study to better understand the enzyme reaction mechanism the type and number of enzymes involved in metabolizing organic matter were further assessed by a metaproteome approach that links genetic information to functions the main purpose of this study was to provide information for the appropriate selection and replacement of gac by exploring the mechanisms of the bac filter process using an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic approach we compared the performances organic matter and ammonium nitrogen removal of five bac filters filled with gacs with different physicochemical properties iodine values pore size distributions and surface chemical properties the bacterial community structure and function and quality of specific enzymes in the bac filters were determined using meta omics in addition the possibility of pore size distribution as a selection indicator for gac was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were guaranteed reagent grade five types of gac were purchased from commercial sources one was coconut based and four were coal based all five types of gac had a granulometry of 8 30 mesh effective size 0 55 to 2 36 mm details of the five types of gac are listed in table 1 the characteristics doc ph uv254 turbidity and nh4 n of the sand filter effluent obtained from a dwtp in beijing china are listed in table s2 2 2 bench scale experiment set up and operation a bench scale experiment was conducted that consisted of five bac filter columns 5 cm in diameter and 130 cm in length in down flow mode as described previously lu et al 2020 the bac filter columns were continuously fed with sand filter effluent from a dwtp in beijing china for 400 days of which the water quality parameters are listed in table s2 the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 the empty bed contact time was 18 min and the influent flow rate was 87 ml min backwashing with simultaneous air and water lasting for 4 5 min was performed twice a week or when the head loss reached a critical value to investigate the effect of gac properties on the doc and nh4 n removal especially the nh4 n removal efficiency at low temperature this study divided the experiment into different stages first between day 1 and day 250 phase i the columns were fed with sand filter effluent doc concentration ranged from 1 8 to 3 5 mg l at 20 25 c second after bac filters were at a steady state the effects of different gac properties on the nh4 n removal at room and low temperature were investigated however the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the sand filter was lower than the detection limit thus nh4cl was added to make the nh4 n concentration in the influent 1 2 mg l from day 250 to day 310 phase ii the columns were fed with sand filter effluent enriched with 1 2 mg l nh4 n at 20 25 c from day 310 to day 400 the columns were moved into a cold storage room and were continuously fed with sand filter effluent enriched with 1 2 mg l nh4 n the water temperature was set to 5 c from day 310 to 360 phase iii and 10 c from day 360 to 400 phase iv water samples were taken from the inlets and outlets of the columns to analyze doc and nh4 n concentrations at regular intervals the used gac samples were collected from the surface of the bac filter at a different time to measure iodine values approximately 0 5 g of the gac sample was taken once a month from the top surface upper 10 cm of each column to determine biomass after sampling 0 5 g of fresh gac was replenished to each column 2 3 batch experiment isotherm experiments were carried out for the adsorption of organic matter on gac in batches as described previously lu et al 2020 in brief five different virgin gac dosages ranged from 0 15 to 34 15 g l and the data about the adsorption of organic matter in sterilized bac column influent were fitted with a slightly modified freundlich model details are provided in text s1 batch simulated bioregeneration experiments were conducted at a constant temperature 23 25 c and ph 7 4 7 8 adjusted by phosphate buffered saline including three different parts first the biodegradation alone tests with microbial suspension from the bac added to autoclaved influent water microbial suspensions were obtained from each bac column on days 210 and 230 at phase i by the method described in our previous study details are provided in text s2 lu et al 2020 and saved for biodegradation experiments and bioregeneration experiments microbial suspensions 1 ml were mixed with 50 ml of sterilized sand filter effluent by autoclaving in 100 ml sterile erlenmeyer flasks which were then agitated the organic matter in terms of uv254 molecular weight mw distribution at 24 36 48 and 72 h and atp of the solution was also monitored fig s2 second rapid adsorption alone experiments with virgin gac to fit a modified freundlich model then 10 mg of fresh gac samples were placed in 100 ml sterile erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of autoclaved sand filter effluent and agitated for 24 h previous results showed that adsorption reached equilibrium after 15 h of agitation therefore we sampled at 1 7 12 15 and 24 h to determine the uv254 removal and mw distribution of organic matter by adsorption alone then bioregeneration experiments were carried out with gac mixed with microbial suspensions after 24 h in adsorption alone experiments 1 ml of microorganisms colonized in the bac filter was added to flasks and batch bioregeneration experiments were conducted the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were measured continuously at 36 48 60 72 84 and 96 h meanwhile the atp in the solution was measured to determine the concentration of suspended bacteria in the solution then the flask was gently shaken for 5 min to desorb the bacteria on the gac surface into the solution before measuring atp in the solution again which was considered to be the concentration of total bacteria in the solution the total bacterial concentration minus the suspended bacterial concentration can be approximately considered as the bacterial concentration on the gac surface or the attached bacterial concentration fig s2 a control that contained only sterilized sand filter effluent by autoclaving was conducted in parallel fig s3 in all batch experiments agitation was conducted at 250 rpm and 23 25 c and each point was a mean value of three replicates 2 4 dna extraction metagenomic sequencing and analysis two biomass samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were taken from the top surface of bac filters at phase i days 210 and 230 phase ii days 280 and 300 and phase iv days 375 and 390 two samples at each phase were mixed to obtain a representative sample for dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing the influent water samples 10 l collected from sand filter effluent from a dwtp were filtered through a stainless steel pressure filter no xx4404700 millipore australia with a 0 22 μm pes membrane millipore australia and the filters were preserved at 80 c in 2 ml centrifuge tubes for dna extraction within a week sample preparation and dna extraction were conducted as described previously lu et al 2020 the extracted dna was sent to majorbio bio pharm technology co in shanghai china and sequenced using the illumina hiseq platform all metagenomics datasets have been deposited into the ncbi sra database with accession numbers srr9903536 srr9903540 phase i srr12816580 srr12816584 phase ii and srr12822860 srr12822864 phase iv the microbial community and potential function analyses were performed using the majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com a free online platform and involved sickle software for quality control megahit software for merging newbler software for assembly soapaligner software for sequence alignment and the kyoto encyclopedia for genes and genomes kegg database for gene annotation 2 5 protein extraction characterization and metaproteomic analysis two gac samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were collected from each bac filter in phase i days 210 and 230 in period c then two samples were mixed to obtain a representative sample protein preparation extraction and purification was performed as described by keiblinger et al 2012 and wang et al 2007 with minor modifications and its details are provided in the text s3 after tryptic digestion overnight with trypsin 1 40 trypsin to protein ratio the peptides were resuspended and detected by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms thermo scientific usa the detailed parameters are provided in text s4 raw spectra files were processed with proteome discoverer software thermo scientific usa the ms data were deposited in proteomexchange the dataset identifier pxd015811 given that the protein concentrations in bac 3 and bac 2 filters were similar they can be used as a single sample to perform a one sample t test with the protein concentrations of other bac filters 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 doc aoc uv254 nh4 n and mw distribution dissolved organic carbon doc was monitored with a total carbon analyzer aurora 1030 oi analytical usa after removing suspended substances and non soluble organic substances by filtering with a filter membrane 0 45 μm pore size water samples taken from the influent and effluent of five bac filters at day 145 and 220 were analyzed for assimilable organic carbon aoc concentration using bioassay method liu et al 2002 van der kooij 1982 and its details are provided in the text s5 the uv254 was measured by a spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 uv vis nh4 n was measured using an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex the mw distribution of organic matter in water was performed by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with a uv detector waters usa as previously described lu et al 2020 the water samples were filtered by a filter membrane 0 45 μm pore size and the calculation of the reduction in the mw range was performed based on the previous studies hidayah et al 2016 the difference and consistency of the removal of each organic matter fraction in the five bac filters on days 45 and 220 were investigated using a paired t test 2 6 2 physical and chemical properties of gac iodine values were measured as described in the standard methods of china gb t 7702 1997 1998 the pore size distributions of micropore and mesopore were determined using the n2 adsorption method dong et al 2019 the distribution characteristics of the macropores were measured by the hg intrusion method morlay and joly 2010 the contents of surface functional groups in the gac samples were determined with an escalab 250xi spectrometer thermo fisher usa and identification was conducted by deconvolution of the c1s xps spectra with peakfit software 2 6 3 biomass concentration bacterial concentration was measured using the adenosine triphosphate atp method lu et al 2019 in brief 0 5 g wet weight gac sample was added to 15 ml desorption solution and the solution was sonicated for 10 min then 10 ml of supernatant was transferred to a sterilized flask by autoclaving next 100 μl of diluted supernatant was transferred to a 96 well plate and 100 μl of bac titer glo reagent promega madison wi usa was added to each well contents were mixed with an orbital shaker and incubated for 5 min using a spectramax m5 microplate luminometer molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa finally the luminescence was measured in batch experiments 100 μl of bactiter glo reagent equal to the volume of sample solution was added to each well and the luminescence was recorded the atp content per ac sample unit weight or atp content in solution was calculated according to the atp standard curve 2 7 statistical analysis spss statistics version 20 was used for data analysis and a paired t test and one sample t test were performed with 95 confidence intervals and significant values of 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments of gac adsorption at present the selection of gac used for bac filters is mainly based on the iodine value the iodine values of the coconut based gac gac 1 and coal based gacs gac 2 gac 5 were 1020 1050 950 1000 and 650 mg g respectively however the results of the freundlich adsorption isotherm showed that the adsorption capacity parameters kf of gac 3 1 96 gac 2 1 77 and gac 4 1 60 were greater than those of gac 1 1 31 fig 1 a the low adsorption capacity of gac 1 was attributed to its surface chemical properties the content of surface acidic functional groups phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxylic group of gac 1 36 88 was more abundant than that of coal based gacs 32 54 32 88 fig s4 and table s3 acidic oxygen containing functional groups increase the surface polarity and reduce the adsorption ability of organic matter franz et al 2000 karanfil et al 1999 lu et al 2020 the levels of surface acidic functional groups were similar among the coal based gacs however the iodine value and micropore volume of gac 5 were lower than those of the other coal based gacs therefore the adsorption capacity of gac 5 was the lowest among the coal based gacs the areas of the resolved peaks of the hpsec chromatograms of feed water and treated water by five gacs are shown in fig s5 the results of the mw distribution showed that the total peak area reduction of all gacs was 87 03 92 45 fig 1b the specific peak area reduction of organic fractions with an mw 400 1500 da were the highest ranging from 30 9 to 33 9 followed by 1500 8500 da 25 3 28 1 and 150 400 da 24 5 27 1 organic fractions with an mw 150 da showed the lowest peak area reduction 3 4 5 6 fig 1b the pore size distributions of the five gacs were similar the micropores 0 2 nm in diameter mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm were easily distinguished the pore volumes in different pore size ranges varied greatly around 0 2 nm peak a 2 50 nm peak b 0 2 10 μm peak c and 100 μm peak d respectively and the proportion of micropores peak a was the highest in most gacs fig 1c d it is generally believed that gac adsorption is mainly determined by the volume of micropores peak a gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 the volumes of micropores for gac 1 gac 5 were 0 45 0 35 0 34 0 30 and 0 14 ml g respectively for the four coal based gacs there was a better correlation between the kf value and micropore volume peak a r2 0 82 but a lower correlation between the kf value and iodine value r2 0 56 in addition a difference in the volume of macropores between peak c and peak d was found gac 5 had the lowest volume of macropores at peak d 0 118 ml g while gac 1 had the highest 0 427 ml g and gac 4 had the highest volume of macropores at peak c 0 284 ml g and a high volume of macropores at peak d 0 347 ml g 3 2 doc removal in bac filters and meta omics analysis 3 2 1 doc removal in bac filters organic matter removal by bac filters can be theoretically divided into three periods which are characterized by adsorption period a concurrent adsorption and biodegradation period b and biodegradation period c simpson 2008 terry and summers 2018 in period a the average doc removal of the bac 3 filter was the highest 77 33 followed by bac 4 74 38 bac 2 72 51 bac 5 57 03 and then bac 1 43 93 fig 2 a for the coal based gacs the ability of the bac filter to remove organic matter in period a could be estimated using the initial micropore volume or iodine value of the gac r2 0 89 and 0 81 respectively fig s6 as the gac adsorption capacity gradually became saturated the ability to remove organic matter declined and the microorganisms colonized to the bac in period b gac adsorption and biodegradation were concurrent and the biodegradation increased gradually finally doc removal reached a relatively steady state in period c however the order of average doc removal in the five bac filters was not consistent with that in period a fig 2a in period c the doc removal of bac 4 was the highest 64 06 followed by bac 3 54 00 bac 2 51 66 bac 1 38 85 and then bac 5 37 23 in addition the rate of decline in iodine values over the three periods was different due to microbial activity fig 2b for example the iodine value of gac 2 in periods a b and c decreased at a rate of 12 4 5 5 and 1 5 respectively it indicated that bioregeneration occurred and gac adsorption still played a role in period c otherwise the iodine value would have decreased rapidly in accordance with the rate in period a which was also proved by the results of mw distribution the doc removal rates on days 145 and 220 were lower than those on day 45 for example in the bac 3 filter 9 1 9 4 19 2 and 12 6 of the fractions with an mw of 150 150 400 400 1500 and 1500 8500 da respectively were removed on day 145 2 7 9 6 30 8 and 12 9 were removed on day 220 respectively and 24 51 24 80 28 20 and 4 94 were removed on day 45 respectively fig 2c moreover the removal rates of organic matter fraction with an mw of 400 1500 da in different bac filters in period c day 220 were significantly correlated with that in period a sig 0 011 however there was no significant difference sig 0 594 table s4 which indicated that gac adsorption still played a role in period c such as in period a in period c the atp concentration of the coconut based bac filter bac 1 1285 82 ng g gac was much higher more than 8 8 25 6 times than that of the coal based bac filters among which bac 4 178 64 ng g gac and bac 3 146 15 ng g gac had higher atp concentrations than bac 5 56 19 ng g gac and bac 2 50 14 ng g gac fig 2d the concentration gradient of the organic matter between gac and bulk liquid results in desorption of organic matter into the bulk liquid when metabolized by microbes the equilibrium shifts again resulting in further desorption dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997a kim et al 1997b in this study the biomass of bac 1 was approximately more than 9 times that of the coal based bac filters theoretically its doc removal should be the highest while actually the doc removal by bac 1 was the lowest the reason for this is discussed in the following section 3 2 2 huck et al 2000 and emelko et al 2006 also found that biomass was not linearly related to doc removal the aoc concentrations of the influent and effluent of five bac filters at periods b and c are shown in table 2 it was found that although doc removal of bac decreased by 1 35 12 49 between periods b and c aoc removal increased by 32 96 40 62 which suggests that biodegradation gradually enhanced during bac treatment process in addition the biodegradable organic matter expressed in terms of aoc is the part of doc that can be easily assimilated by bacteria and converted to cell mass liu et al 2002 assuming that gac adsorption no longer played a role in the steady state period c the aoc concentration decrease and bacterial regrowth should occur simultaneously however the aoc concentration in the effluent of bac 1 48 48 11 19 μg acetate c l was equal to that of bac 5 48 14 12 58 μg acetate c l and higher than that of other bac filters from 11 54 2 39 to 25 2 4 27 μg acetate c l even though the surface biomass of bac 1 was 8 8 25 6 times higher than that of other bac filters the result may be attributed to the regeneration of saturated gac by microorganisms which is discussed in detail in the following section 3 2 2 the results of bench scaled bac filters indicate that the iodine or micropore volume could not be used as indicators for gacselection as they neglect the microbial activity loading on the gac surface and did not accurately reflect bac performance in period c when adsorption still played a role 3 2 2 batch simulated bioregeneration experiments the bac process could not keep a stable state in period c without microbial action and doc removal in the bench scale bac filter contradicted the concentration gradient mechanism in this study therefore to better understand the phenomenon in the steady state period period c in bac filters simulations of bioregeneration of saturated gac were conducted the results of the biodegradation alone experiments are shown in fig 3 and fig s2 the biodegradation experiments using the bacteria detached from the surface of the bac filter in a steady state period c showed that organic matter removal first increased and then stabilized fig 3a the organic matter removal rate was proportional to the bacterial concentration based on the uv254 and atp at 48 and 72 h r2 0 84 fig 3b and fig s7 and the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 da and 1500 8500 da were the main fractions removed fig 3c and fig s8 the results of the rapid adsorption alone experiments and bioregeneration experiments are shown in fig 4 and fig s9 the batch rapid adsorption experiments showed that gac reached saturation after 24 h and the removal rate of organic matter ranged from 15 56 to 36 67 fig 4a the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da and 400 1500 da were the main fractions removed fig 4b bacteria were added to the saturated gac solution after 24 h to simulate bioregeneration it was assumed that the gac adsorption no longer played a role or played a very small role in removing organic matter and the organic matter removal was mainly attributed to biodegradation the behavior of different organic matter fractions removed should be more consistent with that by biodegradation and the organic matter removal rate should also be positively correlated with biomass like as in biodegradation alone experiment fig 3 and fig s7 however there was no correlation between the organic matter removal and the concentration of total bacterial or bacterial attached gac surface in bioregeneration fig 4c the results did not agree with the hypothesis and were consistent with the results of the adsorption of organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da being the main fractions removed fig 4d which indicated that after adding bacteria and while metabolizing organic matter in water bacteria also metabolized organic matter adsorbed by gac releasing part of adsorption sites and resulting in adsorption played a role again and the contribution of the latter to removing organic matter was greater than that of the former in this study bacteria would preferentially metabolize the organic matter fractions with mws of 1500 8500 da and 150 da adsorbed by gac after bacteria solution was added however the amount of organic matter fraction with an mw of 150 da adsorbed by gac is negligible 0 30 2 11 and bacteria will also use other organic matter fractions such as 1500 8500 da therefore these adsorption sites would regain their adsorption capacity and continue to adsorb the organic matter in the liquid however because the gac mainly adsorbed the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da this organic fraction is mainly removed after the bioregeneration process the role of microorganisms is more to drive the regeneration of gac which is in close agreement with a recent study by sharaf and liu 2021 which found that although the contribution of biodegradation might seem relatively small compared to the sorption mechanisms biodegradation helps to regenerate the adsorptive capacity of the gac media because the concentration of organic matter in the water phase 63 33 84 44 was higher than that adsorbed by gac 15 56 36 67 the gradient mechanism was limited to some extent in this study moreover the organic matter removal rate of regenerated gac was 37 50 52 61 indicating that there was still 47 39 62 50 of the organic matter remaining in the water and the concentration of organic matter in the aqueous phase was still higher than the adsorption capacity of gac 15 56 36 67 therefore the regeneration of activated carbon was mostly caused by the enzyme reactions mechanism i e the enzyme secreted by bacteria can degrade the organic matter adsorbed by activated carbon into small molecules for further metabolism and activated carbon obtains part of the adsorption capacity again klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 3 2 3 integrative metagenomic metaproteomic analysis little is known about what forces determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities in bac filters the niche based theory and neutral theory can help to explain how natural microbial communities assemble where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors shape microbial communities respectively hubbell 2005 ramette and tiedje 2007 recent studies suggested that the assembly of lab scale filter communities is weakly influenced by neutral processes and strongly influenced by filter medium ma et al 2020 vignola et al 2018 in our study the bacterial community structure of the influent differed in five bac filters analyzed by cluster analysis also indicating that the filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by deterministic factors rather than neutral processes furthermore bac 2 and bac 3 had the closest phylogenetic relationship and the community structure of the four coal based bac filters differed from the coconut based bac filter fig 5 a indicating that gac was a deterministic factor in driving the assembly of different bacterial communities in the bac filter results indicated that the bacterial communities differed among five bac filters at the genus level the bacterial communities of bac filters in period c were dominated by sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria gemmata sphingobium and methyloversatilis fig 5a most of these genera belong to alphaproteobacteria are highly competitive at low organic matter concentrations and have been detected in drinking water lautenschlager et al 2014 liao et al 2013 the highest relative abundance of sphingomonas was observed in bac 4 25 followed by bac 3 18 sphingomonas had low relative abundances in bac 2 bac 5 and bac 1 12 12 and 11 respectively the functional annotation with kegg found that metabolic pathways differed among which the metabolism pathways were dominant the particular subfunctional categories were enriched including carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism and global and overview maps fig s10 different microbes have diverse metabolic abilities and pathways for several substrates newton et al 2011 in this study the contribution of the dominant bacteria top 10 to amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism revealed that the genus of sphingomonas and belnapia had the strongest ability to metabolize organic compounds fig 5b c for example the contributions of sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria gemmata and sphingobium to amino acid metabolism in the bac 3 filters were 15 06 15 43 7 51 2 62 and 3 52 respectively moreover due to different gac properties the abilities of bacteria to metabolize organic compounds differed depending on the bac filter for example the contribution of sphingomonas to carbohydrate metabolism was 5 23 16 77 15 65 12 19 and 22 18 in the five bac filters respectively fig 5b in addition the classification based on functional hierarchical clusters was similar to that based on hierarchical clusters of bacterial communities that is bac 2 and bac 3 were closely related to bac 4 whereas bac 1 was relatively distant from the coal based bac filters fig s10 therefore boththe microbial community composition and potential functions were affected by the properties of gac i e the iodine values and pore size distributions the proteins identified using metaproteomics were consistent with those identified using metagenomics most of which were related to metabolism pathways the top 20 proteins were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism and global and overview maps fig 5d of these the quantity of proteins involved in diverse functional categories in different bac filters varied to some extent fig s11 the number of enzymes related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism in bac 1 bac 5 was 54 63 62 68 and 65 proteins g gac respectively fig 5e in general the largest number of metabolism related enzymes were observed in bac 4 followed by bac 5 bac 3 bac 2 and then bac 1 with 500 487 468 467 and 443 proteins g gac respectively additionally a significant difference was observed in the number of metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 sig 0 016 bac 4 sig 0 010 and bac 1 sig 0 013 in contrast to those in bac 3 and bac 2 using a one sample t test fig 5d more importantly if it is assumed that gac adsorption does not play a role in the bac filter at the steady state only the role of biodegradation the doc removal was positively correlated with the amount of metabolism related enzymes such as in the results of the biodegradation experiment alone fig 3b and fig s7 however it was found that there was no proportional relationship between the amount of metabolism related enzymes and doc removal in the bac filter at the steady state for example the quantity of metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 487 proteins g gac was more abundant than that in bac 3 468 proteins g gac while the average doc removal rate in period c of bac 5 37 23 was lower than that of bac 3 54 00 the reason for this unexpected result is discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 3 nh4 n removal in bac filters and metagenomic analysis the nh4 n removal experiment was carried out using bac filters after 250 days and doc removal was also monitored fig 6 a when the water temperature dropped from 20 to 25 c to 5 c doc removal began to decline significantly doc removal then gradually returned to a similar level to what it was at 20 25 c after 10 20 days of operation after doc removal remained at a steady state at 5 c the temperature increased to 10 c and doc removal was relatively stable moreover bac 4 had the highest doc removal rate followed by bac 2 bac 3 bac 1 and then bac 5 regardless of temperature the performance of bac filters behaved differently in terms of doc and nh4 n fig 6b when nh4 n removal was stable at 20 25 c bac 1 had the highest removal rate 63 86 followed by bac 3 10 89 bac 5 8 05 bac 2 4 32 and then bac 4 3 25 when the temperature dropped to 5 c the nh4 n removal by bac 1 dropped sharply and the nh4 n removal rate of bac 1 bac 5 was steady at 8 47 2 64 6 41 2 46 and 7 10 respectively in contrast to doc removal when the temperature increased from 5 c to 10 c the removal rate of nh4 n in the bac 1 filter increased from 8 47 to 28 98 this indicates that temperature had a significant effect on nh4 n removal by the bac filter nh4 n removal at 10 c was lower than that at 20 25 c however the order of nh4 n removal in the different bac filters was consistent with bac 1 having the highest nh4 n removal rate 28 98 followed by bac 3 8 40 bac 5 6 67 bac 4 3 53 and then bac 2 2 90 the performance of bac filters differed in terms of doc and nh4 n this is likely because the adsorption capacity of nh4 n with gac is poor halim et al 2010 park and kim 2005 yapsakli et al 2010 and nh4 n is mainly degraded by nitrifying bacteria on the surface of gac liu et al 2017 that is nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosomonas and nitrospira in this study the total relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria in bac 1 bac 5 at 20 25 c was 9 10 1 63 3 32 1 25 and 2 92 respectively and at 10 c was 4 12 1 44 2 22 0 97 and 2 11 respectively fig 6c moreover the removal rate of nh4 n by the bac filters correlated strongly with the relative abundances of nitrifying bacteria r2 0 95 fig s12 previous studies reported that two nitrospira species isolated from filters and drinking water concurrently contained the genes for ammonia oxidation including genes for ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrite oxidation including the gene for molybdoprotein nitrite oxidoreductase nxr and uncovered a one step nitrification process named comammox santoro 2016 van kessel et al 2015 in this study nitrospira simultaneously contained amo hao and nxr table 3 moreover it was the most abundant nitrifying bacteria in the bac filter accounting for 52 63 90 54 of all nitrifying bacteria fig 6c 3 4 implications for gac selection and replacement understanding the mechanisms of pollutant removal by bac filters helps determine criteria for gac selection and replacement in full scale dwtps to date the reference indicator for gac used in bac filters is the adsorption capacity such as the iodine value or methylene blue value more importantly the potential action of microorganisms loaded on gac is ignored by the current selection indicators of gac in this study the micropore volumes of gac 1 gac 5 were 0 45 0 35 0 34 0 3 and 0 14 ml g and their iodine values were 1000 950 950 1050 and 650 mg g respectively if gac was selected based only on iodine values the performances of gac 2 gac 4 would likely be equal to or higher than that of gac 5 which was confirmed by the doc removal in period a with rates of 72 51 77 33 74 38 and 57 03 respectively except gac 1 43 93 due to its surface chemical properties gac 2 gac 3 and gac 4 had similar adsorption capacities and the average doc removal rate of bac 4 64 06 was unexpectedly 10 higher than that of bac 3 54 00 and bac 2 51 66 after operating for more than 200 days this was because there were more metabolism related enzymes in bac 4 500 proteins g gac than in bac 3 468 proteins g gac and bac 2 467 proteins g gac increasing the bioregeneration ability of bac 4 although there were more metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 487 proteins g gac than in bac 3 468 proteins g gac the adsorption capacity of gac 5 was much lower than that of gac 3 eventually leading to an average doc removal of 37 23 in bac 5 in period c which was much lower than that of bac 3 54 00 this indicated that the microbial activity releases gac partial adsorption sites in bioregeneration while the biodegradation was limited by the adsorption capacity of gac therefore the gac material with different characteristics was a deterministic factor that drove the assembly of different microbial communities resulting in differences in bacterial communities and expressed proteins between the different bac filters in this study moreover the gac with stronger adsorption capacity and higher bioregeneration potential selected bacterial communities which were more phylogenetically closely related in addition it also indicated that the iodine value cannot be accurately used as the main indicator for gac replacement due to regeneration which is consistent with previous studies klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 for example in our study the doc of effluent water in the bac 5 filter running for more than 400 days was below 2 mg l although iodine values were less than 600 mg g fig 6a it is suggested that effluent water quality could be used as the main criterion for gac replacement one of the replacement guidelines of gac used in bac filters in jiangsu province in china stipulates that when the codmn in raw water is less than 5 mg l the codmn removal rate of bac filters should be 10 20 if the removal rate is lower than this limit gac replacement is required in some dwtps in shanghai china the spent gac was replaced in whole or in part when the removal rate of disinfection byproduct trihalomethanes thms by the bac filter was less than 20 of the removal rate of the conventional process coagulation precipitation filtration and disinfection this study showed that for gac made from the same material the iodine value could be used to determine organic matter removal by adsorption period a but not at a steady state period c in which synergy between adsorption and biodegradation ensures the performance of bac filters for several years therefore the synergistic value s s xi xp αxi βx p was proposed where xi and xp are the iodine value of gac and the number of metabolic organic enzymes and α and β are 0 012 and 0 059 respectively it was found that there was a good correlation between the s value and doc removal in bac filters r2 0 97 fig 7 a x i and x p were correlated with the micropore peak a and micro level macropore peak c volumes of initial gac r2 0 76 and 0 78 respectively fig 7b c moreover the atp concentration was also correlated with the volumes of micro level macropores peak d r2 0 86 fig 7d in contrast with previous studies which report that macropores only serve as channels for transporting organic matter dastgheib et al 2004 velten et al 2011 our study found that some macropores pore size structure at peak c and peak d here can promote bioregeneration in bac filters and have a vital role similar to micropores therefore gac pore size distribution characteristics could dually represent the adsorption capacity and the microbial activity of bac filters at a stable state and it could be used as an important indicator for the selection of gac used in bac filters in this study we suggest that the pore size distribution of gac most suitable for bac filters is a total pore volume greater than 1 ml g and the proportion of micropores micro level macropores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm should be 24 5 23 2 and 28 4 respectively in contrast with organic matter nh4 n is a non adsorbable and biodegradable fraction nh4 n removal has previously been found to differ between coconut based gac more than 90 and coal based gac 45 at 4 10 c andersson et al 2001 in the current study the nh4 n removal rate in the coconut based bac filter was 1 8 4 2 fold higher than that in the coal based bac filters fig 6b this may be because the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in the coconut based bac filter was the highest at 20 25 c and 10 c fig 6c more hydrophilic attachment surfaces provide higher rates of nitrification than more hydrophobic attachment surfaces khan et al 2013 kim et al 1997 and ammonia oxidizers have higher adhesion rates on surfaces with polar terminal groups hydroxyl carboxyl trimethylamine and amine khan et al 2011 in the current study the content of surface polar groups the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxylic group of gac 1 was higher than that of the coal based gacs fig s4 and table s3 therefore the coconut based gac had better hydrophilicity than the coal based gacs this may explain why the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in the coconut based bac filter was much higher than that in coal based bac filters bacteria are more likely to grow and reproduce in the macropores or mesopores of gac dong et al 2019 walker and weatherley 1998 in this study gac 1 had the highest volume of macropores and mesopores which may make its surface more conducive to the attachment of nitrifying bacteria whether the pore size distribution or the surface chemical properties of coconut based gac is more suitable for nitrifying bacterial growth needs further study especially nitrospira which may provide new insights into the use of coal based bac filters to achieve higher removal of ammonium at low temperatures 4 conclusion in this study five bac filters filled with different types of gac were operated in parallel for 400 days and the mechanisms of organic matter and nh4 n removal were determined using an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic analysis the results indicated that the filter communities were strongly assembled by gac properties rather than neutral processes the iodine value could not be used to evaluate bac performance in a steady state period in which adsorption and biodegradation were synergistic due to bioregeneration the contribution of adsorption to organic matter removal was greater than that of biodegradation and the role of microorganisms is predominantly to drive the regeneration of gac the suggested pore size distribution of gac most suitable for bac filters is a total pore volume greater than 1 ml g and the proportion of micropores micro level macropores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm should be 24 5 23 2 and 28 4 respectively additionally bacteria had higher adhesion rates on gac surfaces with higher hydrophilicity these results have important theoretical and practical implications for boosting the performance of bac filters and gac manufacturing future studies are required to verify the reliability of pore size distribution as an indicator and the effect of surface chemical properties of gac on nh4 n for full scale bac filters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16999,biologically activated carbon bac filters are widely used in china and worldwide as an essential part of advanced water treatment however it is unclear how to properly select the granular activated carbon gac used in bac filters and to determine when gac should be replaced in this study five bac filters each filled with a different coconut or coal based gac with different physicochemical properties were run continuously for 400 days the structure and function of the microbial community and the quantity of specific enzymes in the bac filters were investigated through an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic analysis the results indicated that gac adsorption still played a major role in removing organic matter once the filters reached a steady state which was attributed to bioregeneration and the contribution of adsorption might be relatively greater than that of biodegradation gac with strong adsorption capacity and high bioregeneration potential selected bacterial communities more phylogenetically closely related than others the iodine value could be used as an indicator of bac performance in terms of organic matter removal in the initial stage of the filters which is dominated by adsorption however it could not be used to assess performance at a later stage when adsorption and biodegradation occurred simultaneously pore size distribution characteristics could be chosen as a potential better indicator compared with the current adsorption indicators dually representing the adsorption performance and the microbial activity and the proportion of important pore size of gac that is more suitable for bac filter is suggested gac with strongly polar terminal groups is more conducive to the removal of ammonium nitrogen graphical

treatment is essential biologically activated carbon bac is widely used in china and worldwide as a key component of advanced water treatment it is often combined with advanced oxidation processes such as ozone o3 or ultraviolet uv irradiation treatment chuang et al 2019 du et al 2020 the o3 bac process has been applied in more than 134 full scale dwtps in china with a daily water supply capacity exceeding 35 8 million m3 d more than 35 of the daily water supply in china however there are issues concerning the selection of the granular activated carbon gac used in bac filters to be used in bac filters gac needs to have a large adsorption capacity a fast adsorption rate a high mechanical strength and needs to meet certain criteria regarding the specific surface area pore volume mechanical strength ash content and filling density details on standards for gac use in the us the eu japan and china are listed in table s1 a common indicator of gac performance is the iodine value or methylene blue value which indicates adsorption performance an iodine value of more than 800 mg g gb t 7701 2 2008 2009 is required for bac filters in dwtps in china and an iodine value of more than 500 mg g awwa b604 12 2012 is required for municipal and industrial water treatment however operational data from full scale plants show that bac performance is not accurately predicted by the iodine value or methylene blue value after several years of operation chao et al 2017 gao 2018 chao et al 2017 reported that the performance of a bac filter using gac with an iodine value of 600 mg g was higher than that of a filter using gac with an iodine value of 900 mg g they found that this was mainly caused by differences in microbial activity therefore it is necessary to study the accuracy of the current gac selection criteria in particular the iodine value another controversial point is the service life of gac replacing or regenerating gac is recommended when its iodine value drops below 600 mg g which takes about 2 3 years in bac filters gao 2018 zhang et al 2017 zhang 2007 however the bac filters in full scale dwtps could potentially be stable for 3 7 years even if the gac adsorption capacity gradually declines gao 2018 liu et al 2020 2017 lu et al 2020 teng 2020 for example in a full scale o3 bac filter with a scale of 360 000 m3 d in shanghai the initial iodine value was 1103 mg g it declined to 521 172 and 118 mg g after 2 5 and 7 years of operation respectively despite this the potassium permanganate index concentration codmn of the effluent was maintained at about 1 mg l gao 2018 which indicates that the iodine value alone is not enough to determined when to replace the gac therefore it is important to determine if the gac in bac filters requires replacement after a certain number of years of operation or if indicators can be used to determine when the gac needs to be replaced understanding the mechanisms of pollutant removal by bac filters could inform the proper selection of gac and the service life of gac in bac filters water pollution in china is mainly due to organic matter and nh4 n zhang et al 2013 regarding the removal of organic matter bac filters are thought to follow three stages over their service life period a physical adsorption predominates period b adsorption and biological degradation occur concurrently and period c biological degradation predominates dussert and van stone 1994 simpson 2008 biological degradation is thought to be the predominant process in period c because the adsorption capacity of gac has been saturated cuthbertson et al 2020 dussert and van stone 1994 however this has been debated with some studies suggesting that microbes in bac utilize organic matter resulting in in situ regeneration of adsorptive sites known as bioregeneration therefore bac filters can remove organic matter by adsorption and biodegradation concurrently despite running for several years sirotkin et al 2001 speitel and digiano 1987 the bioregeneration of spent gac could be due to concentration gradients dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997a kim et al 1997b or enzyme reactions klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 regarding the removal of nh4 n by bac filters it was mainly transformed into nitrate nitrogen no3 n by nitrification of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and was seldom removed by adsorption low temperature is one of the limiting factors affecting nitrification in water treatment when using bac andersson et al 2001 jantarakasem et al 2020 the nh4 n removal rates by bac can reach 80 90 at room temperature however the nitrification rate decreases sharply when the temperature is below 15 c and is 50 reduced at 12 c focht and verstraete 1977 huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 in that case the implementation of bac would be limited in northern china due to the low nh4 n removal efficiency in the winter months when the average water temperature is usually below 5 c at present some studies have been carried out to enhance the nh4 n removal efficiency by bac at low temperatures and guarantee the water quality such as through reducing organic carbon loading van den akker et al 2011 changing the operating conditions of bac filter clara et al 2005 bioaugmentation e g biologically enhanced activated carbon huang et al 2013 qin et al 2016 and activated carbon modification e g iron loaded activated carbon ren et al 2021 these methods all work through encouraging the maintenance and growth of slow growing nitrifying organisms in the bac filter the type of gac is important for the attachment and colonization of microorganisms including nitrifying bacteria for example the pore size distribution of gac affects the bacterial concentration of which the volume of micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm promotes bacterial colonization dong et al 2019 lu et al 2020 however there is little research on the effect of properties of gac on the nh4 n removal by bac filters at low temperatures andersson et al 2001 in this study the effect of gacs with different physicochemical properties i e iodine value pore size distribution and surface chemical properties on nh4 n removal at normal and low temperature was investigated which may provide ideas to boost the poor nh4 n removal in full scaled coal based bac filter at low temperature biofilms in gac and the corresponding biodegradation guarantee a steady state in bac filters in period c biodegradation is highly affected by the activity and abundance of the microbial biomass lazarova and manem 1995 persson et al 2006 ross et al 2019 and the microbial community boon et al 2011 gerrity et al 2018 oh et al 2018 pinto et al 2012 with the magnitude of the latter far preponderating that of the former gagnon and huck 2001 lautenschlager et al 2014 oh et al 2018 with recent developments in molecular biological techniques meta omics approaches provide a new way to investigate microbial community structure and function however gene based information provides an incomplete view of community functioning and metabolic activity hettich et al 2013 metaproteomics can provide information on whole protein composition and identify the functional proteins catalytic enzymes and metabolic pathways hettich et al 2013 and has already been applied successfully for diverse environments such as oceans and lakes hanson et al 2014 morris et al 2010 sowell et al 2009 soil mackelprang et al 2011 activated sludge bize et al 2015 li et al 2019 and wastewater salerno et al 2019 but few studies have investigated metaproteomics in bac filters in this study to better understand the enzyme reaction mechanism the type and number of enzymes involved in metabolizing organic matter were further assessed by a metaproteome approach that links genetic information to functions the main purpose of this study was to provide information for the appropriate selection and replacement of gac by exploring the mechanisms of the bac filter process using an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic approach we compared the performances organic matter and ammonium nitrogen removal of five bac filters filled with gacs with different physicochemical properties iodine values pore size distributions and surface chemical properties the bacterial community structure and function and quality of specific enzymes in the bac filters were determined using meta omics in addition the possibility of pore size distribution as a selection indicator for gac was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were guaranteed reagent grade five types of gac were purchased from commercial sources one was coconut based and four were coal based all five types of gac had a granulometry of 8 30 mesh effective size 0 55 to 2 36 mm details of the five types of gac are listed in table 1 the characteristics doc ph uv254 turbidity and nh4 n of the sand filter effluent obtained from a dwtp in beijing china are listed in table s2 2 2 bench scale experiment set up and operation a bench scale experiment was conducted that consisted of five bac filter columns 5 cm in diameter and 130 cm in length in down flow mode as described previously lu et al 2020 the bac filter columns were continuously fed with sand filter effluent from a dwtp in beijing china for 400 days of which the water quality parameters are listed in table s2 the schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig s1 the empty bed contact time was 18 min and the influent flow rate was 87 ml min backwashing with simultaneous air and water lasting for 4 5 min was performed twice a week or when the head loss reached a critical value to investigate the effect of gac properties on the doc and nh4 n removal especially the nh4 n removal efficiency at low temperature this study divided the experiment into different stages first between day 1 and day 250 phase i the columns were fed with sand filter effluent doc concentration ranged from 1 8 to 3 5 mg l at 20 25 c second after bac filters were at a steady state the effects of different gac properties on the nh4 n removal at room and low temperature were investigated however the nh4 n concentration in the effluent of the sand filter was lower than the detection limit thus nh4cl was added to make the nh4 n concentration in the influent 1 2 mg l from day 250 to day 310 phase ii the columns were fed with sand filter effluent enriched with 1 2 mg l nh4 n at 20 25 c from day 310 to day 400 the columns were moved into a cold storage room and were continuously fed with sand filter effluent enriched with 1 2 mg l nh4 n the water temperature was set to 5 c from day 310 to 360 phase iii and 10 c from day 360 to 400 phase iv water samples were taken from the inlets and outlets of the columns to analyze doc and nh4 n concentrations at regular intervals the used gac samples were collected from the surface of the bac filter at a different time to measure iodine values approximately 0 5 g of the gac sample was taken once a month from the top surface upper 10 cm of each column to determine biomass after sampling 0 5 g of fresh gac was replenished to each column 2 3 batch experiment isotherm experiments were carried out for the adsorption of organic matter on gac in batches as described previously lu et al 2020 in brief five different virgin gac dosages ranged from 0 15 to 34 15 g l and the data about the adsorption of organic matter in sterilized bac column influent were fitted with a slightly modified freundlich model details are provided in text s1 batch simulated bioregeneration experiments were conducted at a constant temperature 23 25 c and ph 7 4 7 8 adjusted by phosphate buffered saline including three different parts first the biodegradation alone tests with microbial suspension from the bac added to autoclaved influent water microbial suspensions were obtained from each bac column on days 210 and 230 at phase i by the method described in our previous study details are provided in text s2 lu et al 2020 and saved for biodegradation experiments and bioregeneration experiments microbial suspensions 1 ml were mixed with 50 ml of sterilized sand filter effluent by autoclaving in 100 ml sterile erlenmeyer flasks which were then agitated the organic matter in terms of uv254 molecular weight mw distribution at 24 36 48 and 72 h and atp of the solution was also monitored fig s2 second rapid adsorption alone experiments with virgin gac to fit a modified freundlich model then 10 mg of fresh gac samples were placed in 100 ml sterile erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml of autoclaved sand filter effluent and agitated for 24 h previous results showed that adsorption reached equilibrium after 15 h of agitation therefore we sampled at 1 7 12 15 and 24 h to determine the uv254 removal and mw distribution of organic matter by adsorption alone then bioregeneration experiments were carried out with gac mixed with microbial suspensions after 24 h in adsorption alone experiments 1 ml of microorganisms colonized in the bac filter was added to flasks and batch bioregeneration experiments were conducted the uv254 and mw distribution patterns were measured continuously at 36 48 60 72 84 and 96 h meanwhile the atp in the solution was measured to determine the concentration of suspended bacteria in the solution then the flask was gently shaken for 5 min to desorb the bacteria on the gac surface into the solution before measuring atp in the solution again which was considered to be the concentration of total bacteria in the solution the total bacterial concentration minus the suspended bacterial concentration can be approximately considered as the bacterial concentration on the gac surface or the attached bacterial concentration fig s2 a control that contained only sterilized sand filter effluent by autoclaving was conducted in parallel fig s3 in all batch experiments agitation was conducted at 250 rpm and 23 25 c and each point was a mean value of three replicates 2 4 dna extraction metagenomic sequencing and analysis two biomass samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were taken from the top surface of bac filters at phase i days 210 and 230 phase ii days 280 and 300 and phase iv days 375 and 390 two samples at each phase were mixed to obtain a representative sample for dna extraction and metagenomic sequencing the influent water samples 10 l collected from sand filter effluent from a dwtp were filtered through a stainless steel pressure filter no xx4404700 millipore australia with a 0 22 μm pes membrane millipore australia and the filters were preserved at 80 c in 2 ml centrifuge tubes for dna extraction within a week sample

hiseq platform all metagenomics datasets have been deposited into the ncbi sra database with accession numbers srr9903536 srr9903540 phase i srr12816580 srr12816584 phase ii and srr12822860 srr12822864 phase iv the microbial community and potential function analyses were performed using the majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com a free online platform and involved sickle software for quality control megahit software for merging newbler software for assembly soapaligner software for sequence alignment and the kyoto encyclopedia for genes and genomes kegg database for gene annotation 2 5 protein extraction characterization and metaproteomic analysis two gac samples approximately 0 5 1 g each were collected from each bac filter in phase i days 210 and 230 in period c then two samples were mixed to obtain a representative sample protein preparation extraction and purification was performed as described by keiblinger et al 2012 and wang et al 2007 with minor modifications and its details are provided in the text s3 after tryptic digestion overnight with trypsin 1 40 trypsin to protein ratio the peptides were resuspended and detected by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms thermo scientific usa the detailed parameters are provided in text s4 raw spectra files were processed with proteome discoverer software thermo scientific usa the ms data were deposited in proteomexchange the dataset identifier pxd015811 given that the protein concentrations in bac 3 and bac 2 filters were similar they can be used as a single sample to perform a one sample t test with the protein concentrations of other bac filters 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 doc aoc uv254 nh4 n and mw distribution dissolved organic carbon doc was monitored with a total carbon analyzer aurora 1030 oi analytical usa after removing suspended substances and non soluble organic substances by filtering with a filter membrane 0 45 μm pore size water samples taken from the influent and effluent of five bac filters at day 145 and 220 were analyzed for assimilable organic carbon aoc concentration using bioassay method liu et al 2002 van der kooij 1982 and its details are provided in the text s5 the uv254 was measured by a spectrophotometer hach dr 6000 uv vis nh4 n was measured using an ion chromatograph ics 3000 dionex the mw distribution of organic matter in water was performed by high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with high performance liquid chromatography hplc system with a uv detector waters usa as previously described lu et al 2020 the water samples were filtered by a filter membrane 0 45 μm pore size and the calculation of the reduction in the mw range was performed based on the previous studies hidayah et al 2016 the difference and consistency of the removal of each organic matter fraction in the five bac filters on days 45 and 220 were investigated using a paired t test 2 6 2 physical and chemical properties of gac iodine values were measured as described in the standard methods of china gb t 7702 1997 1998 the pore size distributions of micropore and mesopore were determined using the n2 adsorption method dong et al 2019 the distribution characteristics of the macropores were measured by the hg intrusion method morlay and joly 2010 the contents of surface functional groups in the gac samples were determined with an escalab 250xi spectrometer thermo fisher usa and identification was conducted by deconvolution of the c1s xps spectra with peakfit software 2 6 3 biomass concentration bacterial concentration was measured using the adenosine triphosphate atp method lu et al 2019 in brief 0 5 g wet weight gac sample was added to 15 ml desorption solution and the solution was sonicated for 10 min then 10 ml of supernatant was transferred to a sterilized flask by autoclaving next 100 μl of diluted supernatant was transferred to a 96 well plate and 100 μl of bac titer glo reagent promega madison wi usa was added to each well contents were mixed with an orbital shaker and incubated for 5 min using a spectramax m5 microplate luminometer molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa finally the luminescence was measured in batch experiments 100 μl of bactiter glo reagent equal to the volume of sample solution was added to each well and the luminescence was recorded the atp content per ac sample unit weight or atp content in solution was calculated according to the atp standard curve 2 7 statistical analysis spss statistics version 20 was used for data analysis and a paired t test and one sample t test were performed with 95 confidence intervals and significant values of 0 05 and 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 batch experiments of gac adsorption at present the selection of gac used for bac filters is mainly based on the iodine value the iodine values of the coconut based gac gac 1 and coal based gacs gac 2 gac 5 were 1020 1050 950 1000 and 650 mg g respectively however the results of the freundlich adsorption isotherm showed that the adsorption capacity parameters kf of gac 3 1 96 gac 2 1 77 and gac 4 1 60 were greater than those of gac 1 1 31 fig 1 a the low adsorption capacity of gac 1 was attributed to its surface chemical properties the content of surface acidic functional groups phenolic hydroxyl group and carboxylic group of gac 1 36 88 was more abundant than that of coal based gacs 32 54 32 88 fig s4 and table s3 acidic oxygen containing functional groups increase the surface polarity and reduce the adsorption ability of organic matter franz et al 2000 karanfil et al 1999 lu et al 2020 the levels of surface acidic functional groups were similar among the coal based gacs however the iodine value and micropore volume of gac 5 were lower than those of the other coal based gacs therefore the adsorption capacity of gac 5 was the lowest among the coal based gacs the areas of the resolved peaks of the hpsec chromatograms of feed water and treated water by five gacs are shown in fig s5 the results of the mw distribution showed that the total peak area reduction of all gacs was 87 03 92 45 fig 1b the specific peak area reduction of organic fractions with an mw 400 1500 da were the highest ranging from 30 9 to 33 9 followed by 1500 8500 da 25 3 28 1 and 150 400 da 24 5 27 1 organic fractions with an mw 150 da showed the lowest peak area reduction 3 4 5 6 fig 1b the pore size distributions of the five gacs were similar the micropores 0 2 nm in diameter mesopores 2 50 nm and macropores 50 nm were easily distinguished the pore volumes in different pore size ranges varied greatly around 0 2 nm peak a 2 50 nm peak b 0 2 10 μm peak c and 100 μm peak d respectively and the proportion of micropores peak a was the highest in most gacs fig 1c d it is generally believed that gac adsorption is mainly determined by the volume of micropores peak a gibert et al 2013 moore et al 2001 the volumes of micropores for gac 1 gac 5 were 0 45 0 35 0 34 0 30 and 0 14 ml g respectively for the four coal based gacs there was a better correlation between the kf value and micropore volume peak a r2 0 82 but a lower correlation between the kf value and iodine value r2 0 56 in addition a difference in the volume of macropores between peak c and peak d was found gac 5 had the lowest volume of macropores at peak d 0 118 ml g while gac 1 had the highest 0 427 ml g and gac 4 had the highest volume of macropores at peak c 0 284 ml g and a high volume of macropores at peak d 0 347 ml g 3 2 doc removal in bac filters and meta omics analysis 3 2 1 doc removal in bac filters organic matter removal by bac filters can be theoretically divided into three periods which are characterized by adsorption period a concurrent adsorption and biodegradation period b and biodegradation period c simpson 2008 terry and summers 2018 in period a the average doc removal of the bac 3 filter was the highest 77 33 followed by bac 4 74 38 bac 2 72 51 bac 5 57 03 and then bac 1 43 93 fig 2 a for the coal based gacs the ability of the bac filter to remove organic matter in period a could be estimated using the initial micropore volume or iodine value of the gac r2 0 89 and 0 81 respectively fig s6 as the gac adsorption capacity gradually became saturated the ability to remove organic matter declined and the microorganisms colonized to the bac in period b gac adsorption and biodegradation were concurrent and the biodegradation increased gradually finally doc removal reached a relatively steady state in period c however the order of average doc removal in the five bac filters was not consistent with that in period a fig 2a in period c the doc removal of bac 4 was the highest 64 06 followed by bac 3 54 00 bac 2 51 66 bac 1 38 85 and then bac 5 37 23 in addition the rate of decline in iodine values over the three periods was different due to microbial activity fig 2b for example the iodine value of gac 2 in periods a b and c decreased at a rate of 12 4 5 5 and 1 5 respectively it indicated that bioregeneration occurred and gac adsorption still played a role in period c otherwise the iodine value would have decreased rapidly in accordance with the rate in period a which was also proved by the results of mw distribution the doc removal rates on days 145 and 220 were lower than those on day 45 for example in the bac 3 filter 9 1 9 4 19 2 and 12 6 of the fractions with an mw of 150 150 400 400 1500 and 1500 8500 da respectively were removed on day 145 2 7 9 6 30 8 and 12 9 were removed on day 220 respectively and 24 51 24 80 28 20 and 4 94 were removed on day 45 respectively fig 2c moreover the removal rates of organic matter fraction with an mw of 400 1500 da in different bac filters in period c day 220 were significantly correlated with that in period a sig 0 011 however there was no significant difference sig 0 594 table s4 which indicated that gac adsorption still played a role in period c such as in period a in period c the atp concentration of the coconut based bac filter bac 1 1285 82 ng g gac was much higher more than 8 8 25 6 times than that of the coal based bac filters among which bac 4 178 64 ng g gac and bac 3 146 15 ng g gac had higher atp concentrations than bac 5 56 19 ng g gac and bac 2 50 14 ng g gac fig 2d the concentration gradient of the organic matter between gac and bulk liquid results in desorption of organic matter into the bulk liquid when metabolized by microbes the equilibrium shifts again resulting in further desorption dejonge et al 1996 kim et al 1997a kim et al 1997b in this study the biomass of bac 1 was approximately more than 9 times that of the coal based bac filters theoretically its doc removal should be the highest while actually the doc removal by bac 1 was the lowest the reason for this is discussed in the following section 3 2 2 huck et al 2000 and emelko et al 2006 also found that biomass was not linearly related to doc removal the aoc concentrations of the influent and effluent of five bac filters at periods b and c are shown in table 2 it was found that although doc removal of bac decreased by 1 35 12 49 between periods b and c aoc removal increased by 32 96 40 62 which suggests that biodegradation gradually enhanced during bac treatment process in addition the biodegradable organic matter expressed in terms of aoc is the part of doc that can be easily assimilated by bacteria and converted to cell mass liu et al 2002 assuming that gac adsorption no longer played a role in the steady state period c the aoc concentration decrease and bacterial regrowth should occur simultaneously however the aoc concentration in the effluent of bac 1 48 48 11 19 μg acetate c l was equal to that of bac 5 48 14 12 58 μg acetate c l and higher than that of other bac filters from 11 54 2 39 to 25 2 4 27 μg acetate c l even though the surface biomass of bac 1 was 8 8 25 6 times higher than that of other bac filters the result may be attributed to the regeneration of saturated gac by microorganisms which is discussed in detail in the following section 3 2 2 the results of bench scaled bac filters indicate that the iodine or micropore volume could not be used as indicators for gacselection as they neglect the microbial activity loading on the gac surface and did not accurately reflect bac performance in period c when adsorption still played a role 3 2 2 batch simulated bioregeneration experiments the bac process could not keep a stable state in period c without microbial action and doc removal in the bench scale bac filter contradicted the concentration gradient mechanism in this study therefore to better understand the phenomenon in the steady state period period c in bac filters simulations of bioregeneration of saturated gac were conducted the results of the biodegradation alone experiments are shown in fig 3 and fig s2 the biodegradation experiments using the bacteria detached from the surface of the bac filter in a steady state period c showed that organic matter removal first increased and then stabilized fig 3a the organic matter removal rate was proportional to the bacterial concentration based on the uv254 and atp at 48 and 72 h r2 0 84 fig 3b and fig s7 and the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 da and 1500 8500 da were the main fractions removed fig 3c and fig s8 the results of the rapid adsorption alone experiments and bioregeneration experiments are shown in fig 4 and fig s9 the batch rapid adsorption experiments showed that gac reached saturation after 24 h and the removal rate of organic matter ranged from 15 56 to 36 67 fig 4a the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da and 400 1500 da were the main fractions removed fig 4b bacteria were added to the saturated gac solution after 24 h to simulate bioregeneration it was assumed that the gac adsorption no longer played a role or played a very small role in removing organic matter and the organic matter removal was mainly attributed to biodegradation the behavior of different organic matter fractions removed should be more consistent with that by biodegradation and the organic matter removal rate should also be positively correlated with biomass like as in biodegradation alone experiment fig 3 and fig s7 however there was no correlation between the organic matter removal and the concentration of total bacterial or bacterial attached gac surface in bioregeneration fig 4c the results did not agree with the hypothesis and were consistent with the results of the adsorption of organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da being the main fractions removed fig 4d which indicated that after adding bacteria and while metabolizing organic matter in water bacteria also metabolized organic matter adsorbed by gac releasing part of adsorption sites and resulting in adsorption played a role again and the contribution of the latter to removing organic matter was greater than that of the former in this study bacteria would preferentially metabolize the organic matter fractions with mws of 1500 8500 da and 150 da adsorbed by gac after bacteria solution was added however the amount of organic matter fraction with an mw of 150 da adsorbed by gac is negligible 0 30 2 11 and bacteria will also use other organic matter fractions such as 1500 8500 da therefore these adsorption sites would regain their adsorption capacity and continue to adsorb the organic matter in the liquid however because the gac mainly adsorbed the organic matter fractions with an mw of 150 400 da this organic fraction is mainly removed after the bioregeneration process the role of microorganisms is more to drive the regeneration of gac which is in close agreement with a recent study by sharaf and liu 2021 which found that although the contribution of biodegradation might seem relatively small compared to the sorption mechanisms biodegradation helps to regenerate the adsorptive capacity of the gac media because the concentration of organic matter in the water phase 63 33 84 44 was higher than that adsorbed by gac 15 56 36 67 the gradient mechanism was limited to some extent in this study moreover the organic matter removal rate of regenerated gac was 37 50 52 61 indicating that there was still 47 39 62 50 of the organic matter remaining in the water and the concentration of organic matter in the aqueous phase was still higher than the adsorption capacity of gac 15 56 36 67 therefore the regeneration of activated carbon was mostly caused by the enzyme reactions mechanism i e the enzyme secreted by bacteria can degrade the organic matter adsorbed by activated carbon into small molecules for further metabolism and activated carbon obtains part of the adsorption capacity again klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 3 2 3 integrative metagenomic metaproteomic analysis little is known about what forces determine the assembly of diverse bacterial communities in bac filters the niche based theory and neutral theory can help to explain how natural microbial communities assemble where environmental deterministic factors or stochastic factors shape microbial communities respectively hubbell 2005 ramette and tiedje 2007 recent studies suggested that the assembly of lab scale filter communities is weakly influenced by neutral processes and strongly influenced by filter medium ma et al 2020 vignola et al 2018 in our study the bacterial community structure of the influent differed in five bac filters analyzed by cluster analysis also indicating that the filter communities seemed to be strongly assembled by deterministic factors rather than neutral processes furthermore bac 2 and bac 3 had the closest phylogenetic relationship and the community structure of the four coal based bac filters differed from the coconut based bac filter fig 5 a indicating that gac was a deterministic factor in driving the assembly of different bacterial communities in the bac filter results indicated that the bacterial communities differed among five bac filters at the genus level the bacterial communities of bac filters in period c were dominated by sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria gemmata sphingobium and methyloversatilis fig 5a most of these genera belong to alphaproteobacteria are highly competitive at low organic matter concentrations and have been detected in drinking water lautenschlager et al 2014 liao et al 2013 the highest relative abundance of sphingomonas was observed in bac 4 25 followed by bac 3 18 sphingomonas had low relative abundances in bac 2 bac 5 and bac 1 12 12 and 11 respectively the functional annotation with kegg found that metabolic pathways differed among which the metabolism pathways were dominant the particular subfunctional categories were enriched including carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism and global and overview maps fig s10 different microbes have diverse metabolic abilities and pathways for several substrates newton et al 2011 in this study the contribution of the dominant bacteria top 10 to amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism revealed that the genus of sphingomonas and belnapia had the strongest ability to metabolize organic compounds fig 5b c for example the contributions of sphingomonas belnapia unclassified c alphaproteobacteria gemmata and sphingobium to amino acid metabolism in the bac 3 filters were 15 06 15 43 7 51 2 62 and 3 52 respectively moreover due to different gac properties the abilities of bacteria to metabolize organic compounds differed depending on the bac filter for example the contribution of sphingomonas to carbohydrate metabolism was 5 23 16 77 15 65 12 19 and 22 18 in the five bac filters respectively fig 5b in addition the classification based on functional hierarchical clusters was similar to that based on hierarchical clusters of bacterial communities that is bac 2 and bac 3 were closely related to bac 4 whereas bac 1 was relatively distant from the coal based bac filters fig s10 therefore boththe microbial community composition and potential functions were affected by the properties of gac i e the iodine values and pore size distributions the proteins identified using metaproteomics were consistent with those identified using metagenomics most of which were related to metabolism pathways the top 20 proteins were mainly associated with amino acid metabolism carbohydrate metabolism energy metabolism and global and overview maps fig 5d of these the quantity of proteins involved in diverse functional categories in different bac filters varied to some extent fig s11 the number of enzymes related to glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism in bac 1 bac 5 was 54 63 62 68 and 65 proteins g gac respectively fig 5e in general the largest number of metabolism related enzymes were observed in bac 4 followed by bac 5 bac 3 bac 2 and then bac 1 with 500 487 468 467 and 443 proteins g gac respectively additionally a significant difference was observed in the number of metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 sig 0 016 bac 4 sig 0 010 and bac 1 sig 0 013 in contrast to those in bac 3 and bac 2 using a one sample t test fig 5d more importantly if it is assumed that gac adsorption does not play a role in the bac filter at the steady state only the role of biodegradation the doc removal was positively correlated with the amount of metabolism related enzymes such as in the results of the biodegradation experiment alone fig 3b and fig s7 however it was found that there was no proportional relationship between the amount of metabolism related enzymes and doc removal in the bac filter at the steady state for example the quantity of metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 487 proteins g gac was more abundant than that in bac 3 468 proteins g gac while the average doc removal rate in period c of bac 5 37 23 was lower than that of bac 3 54 00 the reason for this unexpected result is discussed in detail in section 3 4 3 3 nh4 n removal in bac filters and metagenomic analysis the nh4 n removal experiment was carried out using bac filters after 250 days and doc removal was also monitored fig 6 a when the water temperature dropped from 20 to 25 c to 5 c doc removal began to decline significantly doc removal then gradually returned to a similar level to what it was at 20 25 c after 10 20 days of operation after doc removal remained at a steady state at 5 c the temperature increased to 10 c and doc removal was relatively stable moreover bac 4 had the highest doc removal rate followed by bac 2 bac 3 bac 1 and then bac 5 regardless of temperature the performance of bac filters behaved differently in terms of doc and nh4 n fig 6b when nh4 n removal was stable at 20 25 c bac 1 had the highest removal rate 63 86 followed by bac 3 10 89 bac 5 8 05 bac 2 4 32 and then bac 4 3 25 when the temperature dropped to 5 c the nh4 n removal by bac 1 dropped sharply and the nh4 n removal rate of bac 1 bac 5 was steady at 8 47 2 64 6 41 2 46 and 7 10 respectively in contrast to doc removal when the temperature increased from 5 c to 10 c the removal rate of nh4 n in the bac 1 filter increased from 8 47 to 28 98 this indicates that temperature had a significant effect on nh4 n removal by the bac filter nh4 n removal at 10 c was lower than that at 20 25 c however the order of nh4 n removal in the different bac filters was consistent with bac 1 having the highest nh4 n removal rate 28 98 followed by bac 3 8 40 bac 5 6 67 bac 4 3 53 and then bac 2 2 90 the performance of bac filters differed in terms of doc and nh4 n this is likely because the adsorption capacity of nh4 n with gac is poor halim et al 2010 park and kim 2005 yapsakli et al 2010 and nh4 n is mainly degraded by nitrifying bacteria on the surface of gac liu et al 2017 that is nitrosopumilus nitrososphaera nitrosomonas and nitrospira in this study the total relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria in bac 1 bac 5 at 20 25 c was 9 10 1 63 3 32 1 25 and 2 92 respectively and at 10 c was 4 12 1 44 2 22 0 97 and 2 11 respectively fig 6c moreover the removal rate of nh4 n by the bac filters correlated strongly with the relative abundances of nitrifying bacteria r2 0 95 fig s12 previous studies reported that two nitrospira species isolated from filters and drinking water concurrently contained the genes for ammonia oxidation including genes for ammonia monooxygenase amo and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase hao and nitrite oxidation including the gene for molybdoprotein nitrite oxidoreductase nxr and uncovered a one step nitrification process named comammox santoro 2016 van kessel et al 2015 in this study nitrospira simultaneously contained amo hao and nxr table 3 moreover it was the most abundant nitrifying bacteria in the bac filter accounting for 52 63 90 54 of all nitrifying bacteria fig 6c 3 4 implications for gac selection and replacement understanding the mechanisms of pollutant removal by bac filters helps determine criteria for gac selection and replacement in full scale dwtps to date the reference indicator for gac used in bac filters is the adsorption capacity such as the iodine value or methylene blue value more importantly the potential action of microorganisms loaded on gac is ignored by the current selection indicators of gac in this study the micropore volumes of gac 1 gac 5 were 0 45 0 35 0 34 0 3 and 0 14 ml g and their iodine values were 1000 950 950 1050 and 650 mg g respectively if gac was selected based only on iodine values the performances of gac 2 gac 4 would likely be equal to or higher than that of gac 5 which was confirmed by the doc removal in period a with rates of 72 51 77 33 74 38 and 57 03 respectively except gac 1 43 93 due to its surface chemical properties gac 2 gac 3 and gac 4 had similar adsorption capacities and the average doc removal rate of bac 4 64 06 was unexpectedly 10 higher than that of bac 3 54 00 and bac 2 51 66 after operating for more than 200 days this was because there were more metabolism related enzymes in bac 4 500 proteins g gac than in bac 3 468 proteins g gac and bac 2 467 proteins g gac increasing the bioregeneration ability of bac 4 although there were more metabolism related enzymes in bac 5 487 proteins g gac than in bac 3 468 proteins g gac the adsorption capacity of gac 5 was much lower than that of gac 3 eventually leading to an average doc removal of 37 23 in bac 5 in period c which was much lower than that of bac 3 54 00 this indicated that the microbial activity releases gac partial adsorption sites in bioregeneration while the biodegradation was limited by the adsorption capacity of gac therefore the gac material with different characteristics was a deterministic factor that drove the assembly of different microbial communities resulting in differences in bacterial communities and expressed proteins between the different bac filters in this study moreover the gac with stronger adsorption capacity and higher bioregeneration potential selected bacterial communities which were more phylogenetically closely related in addition it also indicated that the iodine value cannot be accurately used as the main indicator for gac replacement due to regeneration which is consistent with previous studies klimenko et al 2002 sirotkin et al 2001 for example in our study the doc of effluent water in the bac 5 filter running for more than 400 days was below 2 mg l although iodine values were less than 600 mg g fig 6a it is suggested that effluent water quality could be used as the main criterion for gac replacement one of the replacement guidelines of gac used in bac filters in jiangsu province in china stipulates that when the codmn in raw water is less than 5 mg l the codmn removal rate of bac filters should be 10 20 if the removal rate is lower than this limit gac replacement is required in some dwtps in shanghai china the spent gac was replaced in whole or in part when the removal rate of disinfection byproduct trihalomethanes thms by the bac filter was less than 20 of the removal rate of the conventional process coagulation precipitation filtration and disinfection this study showed that for gac made from the same material the iodine value could be used to determine organic matter removal by adsorption period a but not at a steady state period c in which synergy between adsorption and biodegradation ensures the performance of bac filters for several years therefore the synergistic value s s xi xp αxi βx p was proposed where xi and xp are the iodine value of gac and the number of metabolic organic enzymes and α and β are 0 012 and 0 059 respectively it was found that there was a good correlation between the s value and doc removal in bac filters r2 0 97 fig 7 a x i and x p were correlated with the micropore peak a and micro level macropore peak c volumes of initial gac r2 0 76 and 0 78 respectively fig 7b c moreover the atp concentration was also correlated with the volumes of micro level macropores peak d r2 0 86 fig 7d in contrast with previous studies which report that macropores only serve as channels for transporting organic matter dastgheib et al 2004 velten et al 2011 our study found that some macropores pore size structure at peak c and peak d here can promote bioregeneration in bac filters and have a vital role similar to micropores therefore gac pore size distribution characteristics could dually represent the adsorption capacity and the microbial activity of bac filters at a stable state and it could be used as an important indicator for the selection of gac used in bac filters in this study we suggest that the pore size distribution of gac most suitable for bac filters is a total pore volume greater than 1 ml g and the proportion of micropores micro level macropores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm should be 24 5 23 2 and 28 4 respectively in contrast with organic matter nh4 n is a non adsorbable and biodegradable fraction nh4 n removal has previously been found to differ between coconut based gac more than 90 and coal based gac 45 at 4 10 c andersson et al 2001 in the current study the nh4 n removal rate in the coconut based bac filter was 1 8 4 2 fold higher than that in the coal based bac filters fig 6b this may be because the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in the coconut based bac filter was the highest at 20 25 c and 10 c fig 6c more hydrophilic attachment surfaces provide higher rates of nitrification than more hydrophobic attachment surfaces khan et al 2013 kim et al 1997 and ammonia oxidizers have higher adhesion rates on surfaces with polar terminal groups hydroxyl carboxyl trimethylamine and amine khan et al 2011 in the current study the content of surface polar groups the phenolic hydroxyl group and the carboxylic group of gac 1 was higher than that of the coal based gacs fig s4 and table s3 therefore the coconut based gac had better hydrophilicity than the coal based gacs this may explain why the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in the coconut based bac filter was much higher than that in coal based bac filters bacteria are more likely to grow and reproduce in the macropores or mesopores of gac dong et al 2019 walker and weatherley 1998 in this study gac 1 had the highest volume of macropores and mesopores which may make its surface more conducive to the attachment of nitrifying bacteria whether the pore size distribution or the surface chemical properties of coconut based gac is more suitable for nitrifying bacterial growth needs further study especially nitrospira which may provide new insights into the use of coal based bac filters to achieve higher removal of ammonium at low temperatures 4 conclusion in this study five bac filters filled with different types of gac were operated in parallel for 400 days and the mechanisms of organic matter and nh4 n removal were determined using an integrated metagenomic metaproteomic analysis the results indicated that the filter communities were strongly assembled by gac properties rather than neutral processes the iodine value could not be used to evaluate bac performance in a steady state period in which adsorption and biodegradation were synergistic due to bioregeneration the contribution of adsorption to organic matter removal was greater than that of biodegradation and the role of microorganisms is predominantly to drive the regeneration of gac the suggested pore size distribution of gac most suitable for bac filters is a total pore volume greater than 1 ml g and the proportion of micropores micro level macropores with diameters of 0 2 10 μm and micro level macropores with diameters 100 μm should be 24 5 23 2 and 28 4 respectively additionally bacteria had higher adhesion rates on gac surfaces with higher hydrophilicity these results have important theoretical and practical implications for boosting the performance of bac filters and gac manufacturing future studies are required to verify the reliability of pore size distribution as an indicator and the effect of surface chemical properties of gac on nh4 n for full scale bac filters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
