1665,we present an experimental and numerical study of transport in carbonates during dissolution and its upscaling from the pore μm to core cm scale for the experimental part we use nuclear magnetic resonance nmr to probe molecular displacements propagators of an aqueous hydrochloric acid hcl solution through a ketton limestone core a series of propagator profiles are obtained at a large number of spatial points along the core at multiple time steps during dissolution for the numerical part first the transport model a particle tracking method based on continuous time random walks ctrw by rhodes et al 2008 is validated at the pore scale by matching to the nmr measured propagators in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate scheven et al 2005 it was found that the emerging distribution of particle transit times in these samples can be approximated satisfactorily using the power law function ψ t t 1 β where 0 β 2 next the evolution of the propagators during reaction is modelled at the pore scale the experimental data is used to calibrate the ctrw parameters then the shape of the propagators is predicted at later observation times finally a numerical upscaling technique is employed to obtain ctrw parameters for the core from the nmr measured propagators an increasing frequency of displacements in stagnant regions was apparent as the reaction progressed the present model predicts that non fickian behaviour exhibited at the pore scale persists on the centimetre scale nomenclature acronyms ctrw continuous time random walk pfg pulsed field gradient ptm

hydrogeological problems examples include stimulation in petroleum reservoirs by acidization fredd et al 2017 water and contaminant management singurindy et al 2004 and geological storage of carbon dioxide herzog et al 2003 luquot and gouze 2009 rock matrix dissolution refers to reactions at fluid solid boundaries that result in the dissolution of the solid grains pore growth and variation of flow characteristics for practical applications the main difficulties in building models with predictive capabilities are twofold first reaction changes the microstructure of the rock and thus the structure heterogeneity starting at the pore scale second there is a large disparity between the scale at which transport can be understood from first principles and the scale at which practical predictions are needed scheibe et al 2015 since in many cases the formal closure problem may be too complex for general solution we propose to study the effects of reaction on solute transport from micrometre to centimetre scales using a heuristic multiscale modelling approach which does not impose a particular form to the governing equations in conjunction with nmr fluid propagator method to validate and calibrate the model at the pore scale sequentially during dissolution the heterogeneity of porous media in geological formations is embodied by the pore structure as well as the mineralogical heterogeneity resulting from multiple components in heterogeneous porous media the observed reactive transport processes frequently do not behave according to the transport laws that can be derived for homogeneous media see kang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 molins et al 2012 ovaysi and piri 2014 szymczak and ladd 2009 and tartakovsky et al 2007 such as the classical advection diffusion reaction equations because reactive transport modelling is typically applied at large scales it necessarily ignores spatial heterogeneities at scales smaller than the size of model discretization see li et al 2006 and noiriel et al 2004 several techniques have been introduced as a remedy i e to compute effective parameters which capture subscale effects see chastanet and wood 2008 and porta et al 2013 furthermore while under limited circumstances the homogeneity assumption is reasonable the pore scale heterogeneities can result in a significant scaling effect because of the spatial variations of concentrations and reaction rates leading to the breakdown of the homogeneity assumption this scaling effect may be one of the causes of the order of magnitude differences between laboratory measured reaction rates and that obtained from field measurements see li et al 2006 and steefel et al 2005 therefore it is important to understand the effects of pore scale heterogeneities on the reactive transport processes conventionally transport simulation is performed by solving the advection dispersion equation ade with known albeit complicated boundary condition in some cases depending on the investigated conditions and on the quality of the characterisation of the heterogeneity of the system the ade can still be used effectively see riva et al 2008 furthermore it is difficult to determine the correct values of the coefficients in the model as the solution of the ade at a fine scale over the full extent of the geological heterogeneity is prohibitively difficult as we have no general way to incorporate uncertainty in the description of the reservoir model for the prediction of transport motivated by this problem rhodes et al 2008 2009 presented a particle tracking method based on ctrw from here on called ptm ctrw for solving single phase transport across a hierarchy of length scales unlike other upscaling methods which rely on special basis functions or homogenisation to capture the subscale effects see degond et al 2015 muljadi 2017 muljadi et al 2015 porta et al 2013 the method does not pre suppose the functional form of the upscaled transport equations and automatically accounts for uncertainty in the field scale description ptm ctrw has been tested for simulating transport in sandstones here ptm ctrw forms the basis of our solute transport simulations and its application is extended to reactive transport in carbonates to rid geological transport simulation of uncertainties due to upscaling it is imperative that a numerical model undergoes rigorous laboratory validations in our study the model and its validation are built upon pore scale information the distribution of molecular displacement or propagators in the preasymptotic dispersion regime can provide the basis for validation of transport models that are based on x ray microtomography images of the pore space see bijeljic et al 2013a b and yang et al 2013 in recent years nuclear magnetic resonance nmr has been used to probe transport signatures in porous glass beads see scheven et al 2004 it has also been used in beadpack sandstone and carbonate samples in the preasymptotic dispersion regimes e g in scheven et al 2005 and mitchell et al 2008 this paper augments previous work and describes how nmr 1d imaging and fluid propagator measurements are employed to provide experimental insights of hydrochloric acid hcl flow through ketton carbonate cores at multiple time increments during dissolution first hcl solution is injected into the core as illustrated in fig 1 the change in porosity and propagators at a large number of spatial points along the core can be monitored throughout the experiment these propagators are then used to calibrate our model at a pore μ m and core plug scale mm as well as to derive the local probability density functions pdfs of transit times the combination of which will be used to derive the pdf at the core scale cm the scope of this work can be summarized as follows first ptm ctrw is employed to reproduce the nmr measured propagators through a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate cores and thereby validate the described model second the pulsed field gradient nmr technique is used to find a series of reactive propagators in preasymptotic flow through ketton carbonate core at multiple times during dissolution third these propagators are reproduced numerically an array of time transit distributions is obtained and thereby calibrate the present model at the pore scale finally these propagators are used as the bases of our core scale simulation and derive the upscaled ctrw parameters at the beginning and the end of the experiments this model can then be used to predict transport at any scale of interest 2 continuous time random walks the description of ctrw here is by no means exhaustive for details on the application of ctrw in a geological context the reader is referred to an excellent review by berkowitz et al 2006 anomalous or non fickian transport is prevalent in heterogeneous porous media and is ubiquitous in the context of tracer migration in geological formations anomalous transport can be described elegantly as a continuous time random walk in a ctrw framework dispersion which results in solute spreading at the scale of observation is accounted for by a transit time distribution function ψ t for many systems ψ t exhibits power law dependencies ψ t t 1 β where β 2 is an exponent for such systems this leads to the scaling of outlet concentration c t t 1 β see nunes et al 2015 3 transport model description traditionally ctrw has been applied to find the ensemble average behaviour of a plume in a macroscopically homogenous domain see berkowitz et al 2006 and dentz et al 2004 ctrw has been applied to heterogeneous media but for relatively coarsely gridded two dimensional systems where the solution involves the numerical inversion of a multi dimensional laplace transform see cortis et al 2004 rhodes et al 2008 2009 developed a simpler approach ptm ctrw to describe transport spanning across microns to kilometre scales the stochastic framework also allows more complicated boundary conditions and various types of distribution function to be used here the modelling framework according to ptm ctrw is explained in which transport is seen as a series of random hops from one node in a 3d lattice to its neighbouring node particles move between a series of discrete nodes or sites with a probability ψ t i j that a particle that first arrives at site i will move to site j in a time t dt at the heart of ptm ctrw is the correct choice of transit time distribution ψ t in their pore scale simulation rhodes et al 2008 employed two types of transit time distribution one derived from the advection diffusion equation as presented in bijeljic et al 2004 and another a truncated power law function as an ensemble averaged transit time distribution presented in dentz et al 2004 they conducted numerical studies comparing the two functions the former was employed in a 3d lattice with a berea sandstone derived distribution of throat radii while the latter was implemented in an effective homogenous lattice they compared the results from both methods with experimental data for berea sandstone and found that the truncated power law function gave the observed transport behaviour and reproduced the dispersion coefficients obtained from experiments accurately the truncated power law tpl transit time distribution function as presented in dentz et al 2004 is 1 ψ t a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β where a is a normalization constant such that 0 t ψ t d t 1 and β 2 is a power law coefficient using network modelling of transport bijeljic and blunt 2006 were able to match the transit time probability density function measured in links between neighbouring pores of a berea sandstone pore network using eq 1 with β 1 8 furthermore bijeljic et al 2011 performed direct simulations of transport in the pore spaces of micro ct images of berea sandstone and portland carbonate and obtained β 1 8 and β 0 7 respectively transit times were now measured as the time particles to migrate from one pore voxel to another at the darcy scale an explicit relationship between the histogram of permeability and β has been demonstrated edery et al 2014 here a truncated power law is also used to describe small scale transport where the exponent β exponent acts as a measure of heterogeneity in fig 2 the pore to core transport simulation framework is described to clarify the implementation of our method in fig 3 we show the behaviour of ψ given the variety of its parameters we plot eq 1 where ψ is a function of the normalized time τ t t 1 for several péclet numbers pe 2t 2 t 1 the left figure shows ψ for β 0 6 and the right figure β 1 8 at larger β the long time distribution diminish faster as illustrated by the power law trend ψ τ 1 β at the pore scale μ m a transit time distribution function ψ p t is derived from either a semi analytic description in an idealized network or from direct simulation ψ p t will form the basis of simulation at the core plug scale mm numerical upscaling will be implemented such that transport at this scale can be modelled as a single hop governed by a transit time distribution ψ cp t for the core scale simulation cm a lattice is used that is similar in shape to the rock core used in the experiments a cylinder in which ψ cp t is applied in each link this core scale lattice will be calibrated a priori numerical upscaling will then be used again to obtain ψ c t see section 6 in the pore scale simulation transport is simulated on a homogeneous 3d lattice consisted of nodes and links within each link transport is governed by the transit time distribution function ψ p t eq 1 first a pressure difference is assigned at the inlet and outlet faces then the pressure field is solved by enforcing mass balance at each node assuming slow single phase newtonian flow at each node the mass flux q conservation k q k 0 is applied for each node connected to links k by which the velocity field at each link can be known see appendix a for details assuming complete mixing at each node the probability p i j that a particle landing at pore i will move to one of its neighbours is calculated 2 p i j g q i j 1 e pe i j if q i j 0 p i j g q j i e pe i j 1 if q i j 0 where q ij is the flux in a link connecting node i and j and g is a normalization coefficient such that j p i j 1 i e 3 1 g q i j 0 q i j 1 e pe i j q i j 0 q j i e pe i j 1 then a number of particles are released either at the inlet face or randomly in the lattice at an intersection a random number a is generated p i j is then read from memory and defined as p i j m p i m m j the process is iterated such that 4 p i j 1 a p i j when eq 4 is satisfied the particle will move along the link i j a random number z is generated and the time t required to move along the link i j is found by solving using a root finding method f t z i e 5 f t 0 t ψ p t z where 6 ψ p t a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β and t 1 l v l is the link length and v is the fluid velocity within that link t 2 l 2 d m is the cut off diffusion time and d m is the self diffusion coefficient of the working fluid v and d m thus t 1 and t 2 are known a priori leaving the adjustable parameter β that describes transport heterogeneity to obtain the transit time distribution at the next larger scale the same technique as in rhodes et al 2008 is used i e a number of particles at t 0 is released at the inlet face of a 3d lattice and the time required for each particle to transit recorded ψ t can be obtained at the next larger scale by matching the emergent distribution of the transit times of each particle to eq 1 this is illustrated in fig 4 where ψ s t is the transit time distribution function at a scale larger than where transport is governed by ψ r t this methodology is applied to obtain both ψ cp t from ψ p t and ψ c t from ψ cp t 4 experimental technique apparatus and results in this paper pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance pfg nmr is used to obtain propagator measurements i e probability distributions p ζ of molecular displacement for a given observation time δ as described in kärger and heink 1983 here the experiments are applied such that the water resident in the rock core is studied by observing the displacement ζ of water molecules over a range of observation times δ and flow velocities v the fluid behaviour and pore scale heterogeneity can be characterised these experiments are time consuming when the data is fully sampled requiring experimental durations of the order of hours to complete which is impractical for the study of the dynamic reacting system being investigated here in this work we have reduced the data acquisition time through undersampling and reconstruction of the smooth acquisition domain signal further details of the sampling and reconstruction parameters used here can be found are described in colbourne et al 2016 for the reaction 10l of a 0 01m hcl solution was flowed at q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 through a 7 2cm long by 3 81cm diameter sample of ketton limestone propagators are recorded in 0 88cm slices along the core with an observation time δ of 0 25s in each slice the porosity ϕ and propagator are measured throughout the dissolution process with porosity profile measurements being acquired in 0 5min and the propagator measurements being acquired in 14 5min using the undersampling methods described in colbourne et al 2016 the diffusion coefficient d m of water in water at 293k is 2 1 10 9 m2 s 1 the initial porosity of the core ϕ is 0 24 the interstitial velocity v is q a ϕ 3 06 1 0 3 ms 1 the characteristic length l of the ketton limestone can be estimated i e l π s where s m 1 is the specific surface area such that l 4 07 10 4 m as presented in mostaghimi et al 2013 the corresponding péclet number pe lv d m is therefore 593 the damköhler number the ratio of acid consumed and the acid transported by convection is defined in menke et al 2016 as 7 d a π r v n where r is the reaction rate constant of pure calcite in 0 01m hcl solution at 293k 1 5 10 3 molm 2 s 1 measured experimentally in peng et al 2015 n is calculated using n ρ calcite 1 ϕ m calcite ρ calcite is the density of pure calcite 2 71 103 kgm 3 and m calcite is the molecular mass of calcite 0 1kgmol 1 in our experiment da 7 7 10 5 fig 5 shows the propagators as a function of axial position along the core plug before and after dissolution before reaction the propagators are uniform along the length of the core showing a sharp stagnant region centred on 0 displacement and a broad flowing region extending to a displacement of 3 5mm after dissolution of the solid matrix has taken place predominantly in the first half of the core the propagators in this region evolve fast moving fluid slows as the pore space is opened up and the overall porosity is increased 5 model validation 5 1 comparison with nmr measured propagators in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate the results of the numerical methods are now compared with the nmr measured propagators without reaction transport only scheven et al 2005 in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate the computational domain is a homogenous 0 008 0 008 0 008m3 lattice consisting of 80 80 80 links in this analysis the system is homogeneous at the core scale and the measurements of displacement are taken across the whole core in these computations the same interstitial velocities are used as in the experiments namely v 9 1 10 4 1 03 10 3 and 1 26 10 3 ms 1 for beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate respectively particles are launched at random locations in the lattice at t 0s and their movement is tracked if a particle exits the inlet or outlet it is randomly reassigned to the opposite face using a flux weighted assignment the propagators were measured at different δ the propagators were computed using the transit time distribution eq 1 average advection times t 1 0 11 0 097 and 0 079s are known from the interstitial velocities v and the cut off diffusion time is t 2 l 2 d m 15s by fitting the power law exponent βs it was possible to match the experimental data β 1 96 1 76 and 0 63 yield propagator profiles with those of a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate respectively at all studied observation times as shown in fig 6 the experiments therefore calibrate our model at the pore scale as expected transport is the most heterogeneous in the portland sample and the least in the beadpack our model matches the persistently dominant stagnant region in the portland sample which is a manifestation of transport heterogeneity this is discussed in more detail in bijeljic et al 2013b 5 2 comparison with nmr experiments of transport involving mineral dissolution the propagators obtained from nmr measurement of reactive transport experiments are now reproduced the model is calibrated with experimental data of porosities ϕ and propagators in a number of slices along the sample measured at the beginning and the end of the dissolution process transport in each slice of the core is computed in a lattice consisting of 100 100 100 links representing a cube of side length 8 10 3 m each link in the lattice has a length of 8 10 5 m which is the resolution of our pore scale simulation 100 000 particles are launched at random locations in the lattice at t 0s periodic boundary conditions are applied at the inlet and outlet faces if a particle exits the inlet or outlet it is randomly reassigned to the opposite face using a flux weighted rule at this scale transport is governed by ψ p according to eq 1 the ctrw parameters t 1 t 2 are computed using the knowledge of flow rate q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 molecular diffusion coefficient and porosity ϕ within that slice from which interstitial velocity v can be computed for example for the slice with initial porosity ϕ 0 24 the initial interstitial velocity is v 3 06 10 3 ms 1 hence t 1 l v is 0 0261s whereas t 2 l 2 d m 3 03s this leaves β as the only tunable parameter we match our computations in each lattice with the propagators measured within each slice in fig 7 the porosity profiles at the beginning and the end of the dissolution process are given then five propagator profiles at various locations along the core computed at initial and final times respectively are plotted and matched with the propagators computed according to unique and different β values first it is worthy of note that the numerical results satisfactorily match the experimental data second as dissolution takes place along the core β values at the front of the experiments become smaller as in section 5 1 the propagators can be computed beyond δ 0 25s in fig 8 the propagators can be observed computed initially with β 0 8 and 0 62 with t 1 and t 2 0 0275 and 9 6s respectively plotted at observation times δ up to 1 6s our model shows that the stagnant diffusion dominated regimes persist even at later observation times asymptotically according to berkowitz et al 2006 fickian behaviour should be expected at t much larger than t 2 5 3 core plug scale ctrw parameters transport at the core plug scale is modelled as a hop governed by ψ cp t which is obtained using the methodology illustrated in fig 4 at this scale transport is modelled in each 8 8 10 4 m thick slice of the core using a cubic lattice with side length 8 8 10 4 m consisting of 100 100 100 links see fig 9 particles are injected into the inlet face at t 0 and record the transit time required by each particle to reach the outlet face transport in each link is governed by ψ p ψ β p t 1 t 2 where β p is calibrated for every slice along the core i e by matching the nmr measured propagators during dissolution an example of how β p is obtained has been reported in section 5 2 i e by computing the propagators in each section along the core and matching them with those measured in the experiments t 1 l v can be determined by knowing the constant flow rate q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 and porosities ϕ of each slice for example for the slice where porosity ϕ 0 32 the interstitial velocity is v 2 74 10 3 ms 1 hence t 1 l v is 3 2 10 3 s the diffusion cut off time t 2 l 2 d m is 0 036s in a single micron scale link ψ cp ψ β cp for every 8 8 10 4 m thick slices are obtained by matching the emergent transit time distribution with eq 1 ψ cp t from ψ p t are obtained using the upscaling methodology presented in rhodes et al 2008 which is illustrated in fig 9 first we run a particle tracking simulation in each core plug lattice described above then the emergent transit time distribution ψ cp is matched with eq 1 by selecting the correct β cp value whereas t 1 and t 2 are assigned according to the lattice dimension flow rate and porosities at before and after dissolution the list of β cp coefficients and measured porosities obtained before and after reaction at a number of points along the core can be found in appendix b after reaction we found that the markedly increased porosities especially in the first half of the core near the inlet do not lead to a more homogeneous spread of particle displacements rather the overall transport process becomes more heterogeneous as shown by the change of propagator profiles before and after reaction quantitatively this is shown by the decrease of β cp this shows that emergent channels in the core result in some particles experiencing an increase in velocity whereas other particles who remain in the slower regions now become even more stagnant in comparison the non fickian features are more pronounced after dissolution this is characterised and quantified by a smaller beta values after dissolution a smaller beta value means a higher probability of long transit times this is apparent when seeing the propagator profiles where the most common displacement after dissolution is much smaller than the average 6 transport at the core scale obtaining ψ c t at the core scale transport can be interpreted as a single hop with corresponding ψ c for transport at this scale a cylindrical lattice is used see fig 10 with length and diameter similar to the core plug used in the experiments within each link in the lattice transport is governed by a transit time distribution ψ cp which has previously been computed the diameter of the lattice is 3 8cm and the length 7 16cm identical to the core used in the experiments the lattice comprises 40 40 82 links the relation ψ c p a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β c p is applied in each link with t 1 and t 2 equal to 0 3s and 1161s respectively 100 000 particles are launched at the inlet face at t 0s the flux q is determined from experiment having measured the porosity of every slice along the core the interstitial velocity v is computed for every link along the flow direction the times required for each particle to break through and reach the outlet face are recorded the emergent transit time distribution function is plotted for three pe numbers 59 3 593 the pe number of the experiments and 5930 before and after reaction see fig 11 and have them matched to a functional form i e eq 1 thus the corresponding β c at initial and final experimental times can be obtained i e 0 75 and 0 65 respectively note that the power law behaviour continues to exist at the core cm scale prior to reaction the emergent transit time distribution function showed a power law behaviour with β c 0 75 according to dentz et al 2004 in this region i e 1 2 β 1 the longitudinal dispersion is super diffusive this can be seen from the propagators fig 7 initially the bulk of displacement occurs below the mean displacement with reaction transport becomes more heterogeneous and even more super diffusive as seen in other dissolution experiments menke et al 2016 7 conclusions a robust multiscale modelling of transport based on ctrw is validated with a combination of nmr imaging and transport experimentation to study reactive transport signatures at a pore and core plug scale for the specific conditions investigated in our work the analysis of the propagators before and after reaction show that transport becomes more heterogeneous after reaction the present model reproduces these results well and quantifies the increase in heterogeneity by the decrease of β values for a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate systems the numerical results agree with the experimental data validating the pore scale ctrw model for different porous media heterogeneities by predicting the propagators at longer observation times it is shown that non fickian behaviour persists at the cm scale truncated power law behaviour is demonstrated for transport at the core plug scale emerging from the pore scale representation of heterogeneity in future work the modelling could be extended to include reactive transport at the pore scale and hence predict the

1665,we present an experimental and numerical study of transport in carbonates during dissolution and its upscaling from the pore μm to core cm scale for the experimental part we use nuclear magnetic resonance nmr to probe molecular displacements propagators of an aqueous hydrochloric acid hcl solution through a ketton limestone core a series of propagator profiles are obtained at a large number of spatial points along the core at multiple time steps during dissolution for the numerical part first the transport model a particle tracking method based on continuous time random walks ctrw by rhodes et al 2008 is validated at the pore scale by matching to the nmr measured propagators in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate scheven et al 2005 it was found that the emerging distribution of particle transit times in these samples can be approximated satisfactorily using the power law function ψ t t 1 β where 0 β 2 next the evolution of the propagators during reaction is modelled at the pore scale the experimental data is used to calibrate the ctrw parameters then the shape of the propagators is predicted at later observation times finally a numerical upscaling technique is employed to obtain ctrw parameters for the core from the nmr measured propagators an increasing frequency of displacements in stagnant regions was apparent as the reaction progressed the present model predicts that non fickian behaviour exhibited at the pore scale persists on the centimetre scale nomenclature acronyms ctrw continuous time random walk pfg pulsed field gradient ptm

hydrogeological problems examples include stimulation in petroleum reservoirs by acidization fredd et al 2017 water and contaminant management singurindy et al 2004 and geological storage of carbon dioxide herzog et al 2003 luquot and gouze 2009 rock matrix dissolution refers to reactions at fluid solid boundaries that result in the dissolution of the solid grains pore growth and variation of flow characteristics for practical applications the main difficulties in building models with predictive capabilities are twofold first reaction changes the microstructure of the rock and thus the structure heterogeneity starting at the pore scale second there is a large disparity between the scale at which transport can be understood from first principles and the scale at which practical predictions are needed scheibe et al 2015 since in many cases the formal closure problem may be too complex for general solution we propose to study the effects of reaction on solute transport from micrometre to centimetre scales using a heuristic multiscale modelling approach which does not impose a particular form to the governing equations in conjunction with nmr fluid propagator method to validate and calibrate the model at the pore scale sequentially during dissolution the heterogeneity of porous media in geological formations is embodied by the pore structure as well as the mineralogical heterogeneity resulting from multiple components in heterogeneous porous media the observed reactive transport processes frequently do not behave according to the transport laws that can be derived for homogeneous media see kang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 molins et al 2012 ovaysi and piri 2014 szymczak and ladd 2009 and tartakovsky et al 2007 such as the classical advection diffusion reaction equations because reactive transport modelling is typically applied at large scales it necessarily ignores spatial heterogeneities at scales smaller than the size of model discretization see li et al 2006 and noiriel et al 2004 several techniques have been introduced as a remedy i e to compute effective parameters which capture subscale effects see chastanet and wood 2008 and porta et al 2013 furthermore while under limited circumstances the homogeneity assumption is reasonable the pore scale heterogeneities can result in a significant scaling effect because of the spatial variations of concentrations and reaction rates leading to the breakdown of the homogeneity assumption this scaling effect may be one of the causes of the order of magnitude differences between laboratory measured reaction rates and that obtained from field measurements see li et al 2006 and steefel et al 2005 therefore it is important to understand the effects of pore scale heterogeneities on the reactive transport processes conventionally transport simulation is performed by solving the advection dispersion equation ade with known albeit complicated boundary condition in some cases depending on the investigated conditions and on the quality of the characterisation of the heterogeneity of the system the ade can still be used effectively see riva et al 2008 furthermore it is difficult to determine the correct values of the coefficients in the model as the solution of the ade at a fine scale over the full extent of the geological heterogeneity is prohibitively difficult as we have no general way to incorporate uncertainty in the description of the reservoir model for the prediction of transport motivated by this problem rhodes et al 2008 2009 presented a particle tracking method based on ctrw from here on called ptm ctrw for solving single phase transport across a hierarchy of length scales unlike other upscaling methods which rely on special basis functions or homogenisation to capture the subscale effects see degond et al 2015 muljadi 2017 muljadi et al 2015 porta et al 2013 the method does not pre suppose the functional form of the upscaled transport equations and automatically accounts for uncertainty in the field scale description ptm ctrw has been tested for simulating transport in sandstones here ptm ctrw forms the basis of our solute transport simulations and its application is extended to reactive transport in carbonates to rid geological transport simulation of uncertainties due to upscaling it is imperative that a numerical model undergoes rigorous laboratory validations in our study the model and its validation are built upon pore scale information the distribution of molecular displacement or propagators in the preasymptotic dispersion regime can provide the basis for validation of transport models that are based on x ray microtomography images of the pore space see bijeljic et al 2013a b and yang et al 2013 in recent years nuclear magnetic resonance nmr has been used to probe transport signatures in porous glass beads see scheven et al 2004 it has also been used in beadpack sandstone and carbonate samples in the preasymptotic dispersion regimes e g in scheven et al 2005 and mitchell et al 2008 this paper augments previous work and describes how nmr 1d imaging and fluid propagator measurements are employed to provide experimental insights of hydrochloric acid hcl flow through ketton carbonate cores at multiple time increments during dissolution first hcl solution is injected into the core as illustrated in fig 1 the change in porosity and propagators at a large number of spatial points along the core can be monitored throughout the experiment these propagators are then used to calibrate our model at a pore μ m and core plug scale mm as well as to derive the local probability density functions pdfs of transit times the combination of which will be used to derive the pdf at the core scale cm the scope of this work can be summarized as follows first ptm ctrw is employed to reproduce the nmr measured propagators through a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate cores and thereby validate the described model second the pulsed field gradient nmr technique is used to find a series of reactive propagators in preasymptotic flow through ketton carbonate core at multiple times during dissolution third these propagators are reproduced numerically an array of time transit distributions is obtained and thereby calibrate the present model at the pore scale finally these propagators are used as the bases of our core scale simulation and derive the upscaled ctrw parameters at the beginning and the end of the experiments this model can then be used to predict transport at any scale of interest 2 continuous time random walks the description of ctrw here is by no means exhaustive for details on the application of ctrw in a geological context the reader is referred to an excellent review by berkowitz et al 2006 anomalous or non fickian transport is prevalent in heterogeneous porous media and is ubiquitous in the context of tracer migration in geological formations anomalous transport can be described elegantly as a continuous time random walk in a ctrw framework dispersion which results in solute spreading at the scale of observation is accounted for by a transit time distribution function ψ t for many systems ψ t exhibits power law dependencies ψ t t 1 β where β 2 is an exponent for such systems this leads to the scaling of outlet concentration c t t 1 β see nunes et al 2015 3 transport model description traditionally ctrw has been applied to find the ensemble average behaviour of a plume in a macroscopically homogenous domain see berkowitz et al 2006 and dentz et al 2004 ctrw has been applied to heterogeneous media but for relatively coarsely gridded two dimensional systems where the solution involves the numerical inversion of a multi dimensional laplace transform see cortis et al 2004 rhodes et al 2008 2009 developed a simpler approach ptm ctrw to describe transport spanning across microns to kilometre scales the stochastic framework also allows more complicated boundary conditions and various types of distribution function to be used here the modelling framework according to ptm ctrw is explained in which transport is seen as a series of random hops from one node in a 3d lattice to its neighbouring node particles move between a series of discrete nodes or sites with a probability ψ t i j that a particle that first arrives at site i will move to site j in a time t dt at the heart of ptm ctrw is the correct choice of transit time distribution ψ t in their pore scale simulation rhodes et al 2008 employed two types of transit time distribution one derived from the advection diffusion equation as presented in bijeljic et al 2004 and another a truncated power law function as an ensemble averaged transit time distribution presented in dentz et al 2004 they conducted numerical studies comparing the two functions the former was employed in a 3d lattice with a berea sandstone derived distribution of throat radii while the latter was implemented in an effective homogenous lattice they compared the results from both methods with experimental data for berea sandstone and found that the truncated power law function gave the observed transport behaviour and reproduced the dispersion coefficients obtained from experiments accurately the truncated power law tpl transit time distribution function as presented in dentz et al 2004 is 1 ψ t a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β where a is a normalization constant such that 0 t ψ t d t 1 and β 2 is a power law coefficient using network modelling of transport bijeljic and blunt 2006 were able to match the transit time probability density function measured in links between neighbouring pores of a berea sandstone pore network using eq 1 with β 1 8 furthermore bijeljic et al 2011 performed direct simulations of transport in the pore spaces of micro ct images of berea sandstone and portland carbonate and obtained β 1 8 and β 0 7 respectively transit times were now measured as the time particles to migrate from one pore voxel to another at the darcy scale an explicit relationship between the histogram of permeability and β has been demonstrated edery et al 2014 here a truncated power law is also used to describe small scale transport where the exponent β exponent acts as a measure of heterogeneity in fig 2 the pore to core transport simulation framework is described to clarify the implementation of our method in fig 3 we show the behaviour of ψ given the variety of its parameters we plot eq 1 where ψ is a function of the normalized time τ t t 1 for several péclet numbers pe 2t 2 t 1 the left figure shows ψ for β 0 6 and the right figure β 1 8 at larger β the long time distribution diminish faster as illustrated by the power law trend ψ τ 1 β at the pore scale μ m a transit time distribution function ψ p t is derived from either a semi analytic description in an idealized network or from direct simulation ψ p t will form the basis of simulation at the core plug scale mm numerical upscaling will be implemented such that transport at this scale can be modelled as a single hop governed by a transit time distribution ψ cp t for the core scale simulation cm a lattice is used that is similar in shape to the rock core used in the experiments a cylinder in which ψ cp t is applied in each link this core scale lattice will be calibrated a priori numerical upscaling will then be used again to obtain ψ c t see section 6 in the pore scale simulation transport is simulated on a homogeneous 3d lattice consisted of nodes and links within each link transport is governed by the transit time distribution function ψ p t eq 1 first a pressure difference is assigned at the inlet and outlet faces then the pressure field is solved by enforcing mass balance at each node assuming slow single phase newtonian flow at each node the mass flux q conservation k q k 0 is applied for each node connected to links k by which the velocity field at each link can be known see appendix a for details assuming complete mixing at each node the probability p i j that a particle landing at pore i will move to one of its neighbours is calculated 2 p i j g q i j 1 e pe i j if q i j 0 p i j g q j i e pe i j 1 if q i j 0 where q ij is the flux in a link connecting node i and j and g is a normalization coefficient such that j p i j 1 i e 3 1 g q i j 0 q i j 1 e pe i j q i j 0 q j i e pe i j 1 then a number of particles are released either at the inlet face or randomly in the lattice at an intersection a random number a is generated p i j is then read from memory and defined as p i j m p i m m j the process is iterated such that 4 p i j 1 a p i j when eq 4 is satisfied the particle will move along the link i j a random number z is generated and the time t required to move along the link i j is found by solving using a root finding method f t z i e 5 f t 0 t ψ p t z where 6 ψ p t a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β and t 1 l v l is the link length and v is the fluid velocity within that link t 2 l 2 d m is the cut off diffusion time and d m is the self diffusion coefficient of the working fluid v and d m thus t 1 and t 2 are known a priori leaving the adjustable parameter β that describes transport heterogeneity to obtain the transit time distribution at the next larger scale the same technique as in rhodes et al 2008 is used i e a number of particles at t 0 is released at the inlet face of a 3d lattice and the time required for each particle to transit recorded ψ t can be obtained at the next larger scale by matching the emergent distribution of the transit times of each particle to eq 1 this is illustrated in fig 4 where ψ s t is the transit time distribution function at a scale larger than where transport is governed by ψ r t this methodology is applied to obtain both ψ cp t from ψ p t and ψ c t from ψ cp t 4 experimental technique apparatus and results in this paper pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance pfg nmr is used to obtain propagator measurements i e probability distributions p ζ of molecular displacement for a given observation time δ as described in kärger and heink 1983 here the experiments are applied such that the water resident in the rock core is studied by observing the displacement ζ of water molecules over a range of observation times δ and flow velocities v the fluid behaviour and pore scale heterogeneity can be characterised these experiments are time consuming when the data is fully sampled requiring experimental durations of the order of hours to complete which is impractical for the study of the dynamic reacting system being investigated here in this work we have reduced the data acquisition time through undersampling and reconstruction of the smooth acquisition domain signal further details of the sampling and reconstruction parameters used here can be found are described in colbourne et al 2016 for the reaction 10l of a 0 01m hcl solution was flowed at q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 through a 7 2cm long by 3 81cm diameter sample of ketton limestone propagators are recorded in 0 88cm slices along the core with an observation time δ of 0 25s in each slice the porosity ϕ and propagator are measured throughout the dissolution process with porosity profile measurements being acquired in 0 5min and the propagator measurements being acquired in 14 5min using the undersampling methods described in colbourne et al 2016 the diffusion coefficient d m of water in water at 293k is 2 1 10 9 m2 s 1 the initial porosity of the core ϕ is 0 24 the interstitial velocity v is q a ϕ 3 06 1 0 3 ms 1 the characteristic length l of the ketton limestone can be estimated i e l π s where s m 1 is the specific surface area such that l 4 07 10 4 m as presented in mostaghimi et al 2013 the corresponding péclet number pe lv d m is therefore 593 the damköhler number the ratio of acid consumed and the acid transported by convection is defined in menke et al 2016 as 7 d a π r v n where r is the reaction rate constant of pure calcite in 0 01m hcl solution at 293k 1 5 10 3 molm 2 s 1 measured experimentally in peng et al 2015 n is calculated using n ρ calcite 1 ϕ m calcite ρ calcite is the density of pure calcite 2 71 103 kgm 3 and m calcite is the molecular mass of calcite 0 1kgmol 1 in our experiment da 7 7 10 5 fig 5 shows the propagators as a function of axial position along the core plug before and after dissolution before reaction the propagators are uniform along the length of the core showing a sharp stagnant region centred on 0 displacement and a broad flowing region extending to a displacement of 3 5mm after dissolution of the solid matrix has taken place predominantly in the first half of the core the propagators in this region evolve fast moving fluid slows as the pore space is opened up and the overall porosity is increased 5 model validation 5 1 comparison with nmr measured propagators in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate the results of the numerical methods are now compared with the nmr measured propagators without reaction transport only scheven et al 2005 in a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate the computational domain is a homogenous 0 008 0 008 0 008m3 lattice consisting of 80 80 80 links in this analysis the system is homogeneous at the core scale and the measurements of displacement are taken across the whole core in these computations the same interstitial velocities are used as in the experiments namely v 9 1 10 4 1 03 10 3 and 1 26 10 3 ms 1 for beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate respectively particles are launched at random locations in the lattice at t 0s and their movement is tracked if a particle exits the inlet or outlet it is randomly reassigned to the opposite face using a flux weighted assignment the propagators were measured at different δ the propagators were computed using the transit time distribution eq 1 average advection times t 1 0 11 0 097 and 0 079s are known from the interstitial velocities v and the cut off diffusion time is t 2 l 2 d m 15s by fitting the power law exponent βs it was possible to match the experimental data β 1 96 1 76 and 0 63 yield propagator profiles with those of a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate respectively at all studied observation times as shown in fig 6 the experiments therefore calibrate our model at the pore scale as expected transport is the most heterogeneous in the portland sample and the least in the beadpack our model matches the persistently dominant stagnant region in the portland sample which is a manifestation of transport heterogeneity this is discussed in more detail in bijeljic et al 2013b 5 2 comparison with nmr experiments of transport involving mineral dissolution the propagators obtained from nmr measurement of reactive transport experiments are now reproduced the model is calibrated with experimental data of porosities ϕ and propagators in a number of slices along the sample measured at the beginning and the end of the dissolution process transport in each slice of the core is computed in a lattice consisting of 100 100 100 links representing a cube of side length 8 10 3 m each link in the lattice has a length of 8 10 5 m which is the resolution of our pore scale simulation 100 000 particles are launched at random locations in the lattice at t 0s periodic boundary conditions are applied at the inlet and outlet faces if a particle exits the inlet or outlet it is randomly reassigned to the opposite face using a flux weighted rule at this scale transport is governed by ψ p according to eq 1 the ctrw parameters t 1 t 2 are computed using the knowledge of flow rate q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 molecular diffusion coefficient and porosity ϕ within that slice from which interstitial velocity v can be computed for example for the slice with initial porosity ϕ 0 24 the initial interstitial velocity is v 3 06 10 3 ms 1 hence t 1 l v is 0 0261s whereas t 2 l 2 d m 3 03s this leaves β as the only tunable parameter we match our computations in each lattice with the propagators measured within each slice in fig 7 the porosity profiles at the beginning and the end of the dissolution process are given then five propagator profiles at various locations along the core computed at initial and final times respectively are plotted and matched with the propagators computed according to unique and different β values first it is worthy of note that the numerical results satisfactorily match the experimental data second as dissolution takes place along the core β values at the front of the experiments become smaller as in section 5 1 the propagators can be computed beyond δ 0 25s in fig 8 the propagators can be observed computed initially with β 0 8 and 0 62 with t 1 and t 2 0 0275 and 9 6s respectively plotted at observation times δ up to 1 6s our model shows that the stagnant diffusion dominated regimes persist even at later observation times asymptotically according to berkowitz et al 2006 fickian behaviour should be expected at t much larger than t 2 5 3 core plug scale ctrw parameters transport at the core plug scale is modelled as a hop governed by ψ cp t which is obtained using the methodology illustrated in fig 4 at this scale transport is modelled in each 8 8 10 4 m thick slice of the core using a cubic lattice with side length 8 8 10 4 m consisting of 100 100 100 links see fig 9 particles are injected into the inlet face at t 0 and record the transit time required by each particle to reach the outlet face transport in each link is governed by ψ p ψ β p t 1 t 2 where β p is calibrated for every slice along the core i e by matching the nmr measured propagators during dissolution an example of how β p is obtained has been reported in section 5 2 i e by computing the propagators in each section along the core and matching them with those measured in the experiments t 1 l v can be determined by knowing the constant flow rate q 8 3 10 7 m3 s 1 and porosities ϕ of each slice for example for the slice where porosity ϕ 0 32 the interstitial velocity is v 2 74 10 3 ms 1 hence t 1 l v is 3 2 10 3 s the diffusion cut off time t 2 l 2 d m is 0 036s in a single micron scale link ψ cp ψ β cp for every 8 8 10 4 m thick slices are obtained by matching the emergent transit time distribution with eq 1 ψ cp t from ψ p t are obtained using the upscaling methodology presented in rhodes et al 2008 which is illustrated in fig 9 first we run a particle tracking simulation in each core plug lattice described above then the emergent transit time distribution ψ cp is matched with eq 1 by selecting the correct β cp value whereas t 1 and t 2 are assigned according to the lattice dimension flow rate and porosities at before and after dissolution the list of β cp coefficients and measured porosities obtained before and after reaction at a number of points along the core can be found in appendix b after reaction we found that the markedly increased porosities especially in the first half of the core near the inlet do not lead to a more homogeneous spread of particle displacements rather the overall transport process becomes more heterogeneous as shown by the change of propagator profiles before and after reaction quantitatively this is shown by the decrease of β cp this shows that emergent channels in the core result in some particles experiencing an increase in velocity whereas other particles who remain in the slower regions now become even more stagnant in comparison the non fickian features are more pronounced after dissolution this is characterised and quantified by a smaller beta values after dissolution a smaller beta value means a higher probability of long transit times this is apparent when seeing the propagator profiles where the most common displacement after dissolution is much smaller than the average 6 transport at the core scale obtaining ψ c t at the core scale transport can be interpreted as a single hop with corresponding ψ c for transport at this scale a cylindrical lattice is used see fig 10 with length and diameter similar to the core plug used in the experiments within each link in the lattice transport is governed by a transit time distribution ψ cp which has previously been computed the diameter of the lattice is 3 8cm and the length 7 16cm identical to the core used in the experiments the lattice comprises 40 40 82 links the relation ψ c p a e t t 2 1 t t 1 1 β c p is applied in each link with t 1 and t 2 equal to 0 3s and 1161s respectively 100 000 particles are launched at the inlet face at t 0s the flux q is determined from experiment having measured the porosity of every slice along the core the interstitial velocity v is computed for every link along the flow direction the times required for each particle to break through and reach the outlet face are recorded the emergent transit time distribution function is plotted for three pe numbers 59 3 593 the pe number of the experiments and 5930 before and after reaction see fig 11 and have them matched to a functional form i e eq 1 thus the corresponding β c at initial and final experimental times can be obtained i e 0 75 and 0 65 respectively note that the power law behaviour continues to exist at the core cm scale prior to reaction the emergent transit time distribution function showed a power law behaviour with β c 0 75 according to dentz et al 2004 in this region i e 1 2 β 1 the longitudinal dispersion is super diffusive this can be seen from the propagators fig 7 initially the bulk of displacement occurs below the mean displacement with reaction transport becomes more heterogeneous and even more super diffusive as seen in other dissolution experiments menke et al 2016 7 conclusions a robust multiscale modelling of transport based on ctrw is validated with a combination of nmr imaging and transport experimentation to study reactive transport signatures at a pore and core plug scale for the specific conditions investigated in our work the analysis of the propagators before and after reaction show that transport becomes more heterogeneous after reaction the present model reproduces these results well and quantifies the increase in heterogeneity by the decrease of β values for a beadpack bentheimer sandstone and portland carbonate systems the numerical results agree with the experimental data validating the pore scale ctrw model for different porous media heterogeneities by predicting the propagators at longer observation times it is shown that non fickian behaviour persists at the cm scale truncated power law behaviour is demonstrated for transport at the core plug scale emerging from the pore scale representation of heterogeneity in future work the modelling could be extended to include reactive transport at the pore scale and hence predict the

1666,plumes of trichloroethene tce with degradation products occur at a large industrial site in california where tce as a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl entered the fractured sandstone bedrock at many locations beginning in the late 1940s groundwater flows rapidly in closely spaced fractures but plume fronts are strongly retarded relative to groundwater flow velocities owing largely to matrix diffusion in early decades and degradation processes in later decades and going forward multiple data types show field evidence for both biotic and abiotic dechlorination of tce and its degradation products resulting in non chlorinated compounds analyses were conducted on groundwater samples from hundreds of monitoring wells and on thousands of rock samples from continuous core over depths ranging from 6 to 426 metres below ground surface nearly all of the present day mass of tce and degradation products resides in the water saturated low permeability rock matrix blocks although groundwater and dnapl flow primarily occur in the fractures dnapl dissolution followed by diffusion and sorption readily transfers contaminant mass into the rock matrix the presence of non chlorinated degradation products ethene ethane acetylene and compound specific isotope analysis csia of tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce indicate at least some complete dechlorination by both biotic and abiotic pathways consistent with the observed mineralogy and hydrogeochemistry and with published results from crushed rock microcosms the rock matrix contains abundant iron bearing minerals and solid phase organic carbon with large surface areas and long contact times suggesting degradation processes are occurring in the rock matrix multiple high resolution datasets provide strong evidence for spatially heterogeneous distributions of tce and degradation products with varying degrees of degradation observed only when using new methods that achieve better detection of dissolved gases i e snap sampler and contaminant mass stored in the low permeability rock matrix i e core dfn simulations using a discrete fracture matrix dfn m numerical model capable of rigorously simulating flow and transport in both the fractures and matrix including interactions show that even slow first order degradation rates i e 5 to 20 year half lives informed by site derived parameters can contribute strongly to natural attenuation resulting in tce plumes that become stationary in space and might even retreat after 50 to 100 years if the dnapl sources become depleted due to the combination of diffusion and degradation processes 1 introduction trichloroethene tce is a common industrial contaminant in groundwater that occurs in all types of hydrogeologic settings one of the most complex being fractured geologic media with high matrix porosity including fractured sedimentary rock nrc 2005 the most populated and industrialized parts of north america where chlorinated solvent releases commonly occur overlie sedimentary bedrock back et al 1990 degradation is widely known as an important contributor to the natural attenuation of tce plumes in non indurated granular aquifers i e sand gravel wiedemeier et al 1999 nrc 2000 alvarez and illman 2006 and in fractured rock bishop et al 1993 yager et al 1997 hohnstock ashe et al 2001 lenczewski et al 2003 ellis and rivett 2007 pooley et al 2009 revesz et al 2009 lima et al 2012 schaefer et al 2013 2015 yet much is still not known about the physical and chemical conditions in fractured sedimentary rock that govern degradation mechanisms of tce and thereby contribute to natural attenuation especially at sites that feature no accumulation of vinyl chloride understanding tce degradation in fractured sedimentary rock is particularly challenging because nearly all groundwater flow occurs in the fractures and also dominates the hydrochemistry and contaminant concentrations in samples collected from monitoring wells however in aged plumes diffusion over decades has caused most or nearly all of the contaminant mass to reside in the low permeability rock matrix blocks between the fractures as dissolved and sorbed phases requiring alternative methods for characterization and approaches to remediation it has become well established over the past 40 years of contaminant hydrogeology research and practice that the processes affecting contaminant distribution and plume behavior in fractured porous rocks such as sandstone shale chalk limestone and dolostone are much different than in granular aquifers including chlorinated solvents present as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl freeze and cherry 1979 parker et al 1994 1997 pankow and cherry 1996 nrc 2005 national academy of sciences 2015 fractured sedimentary rocks are known as fractured porous media with at least two distinct domains of permeability and porosity i e the fractures and the matrix where the much smaller fracture porosity dominates advection and the larger matrix porosity dominates contaminant storage in the hydrogeologic literature foster 1975 first recognized diffusion into the rock matrix as the process controlling the distribution and slow arrival of atmospheric derived tritium in the british chalk aquifer although the movement and storage of dnapl in fractured sedimentary rock occurs almost exclusively in the fractures dnapl dissolution with strong concentration gradients for diffusion results after some years in nearly all contaminant mass residing in the rock matrix parker et al 1994 1997 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 hence while groundwater flow occurs nearly exclusively in the fracture network it is hypothesized that degradation mechanisms will dominate in the rock matrix where contaminant residence times are large due to much slower transport by diffusion and given that the matrix has orders of magnitude larger porosity for mass storage with large mineral surface area for enhanced sorption and reactions relative to the fractures therefore the rock matrix conditions that foster microbial and geochemical processes are expected to be most influential on solute contaminant transport and fate published field studies regarding tce degradation in fractured sedimentary rock are few and have not focused on the occurrence of the microbial or abiotic reactions in the rock matrix itself therefore the objective of this study was to use multiple lines of field evidence from both the rock matrix and groundwater within the fractures to identify various degradation mechanisms the interactive effects of degradation in the fractures or the matrix on plume behavior are presented using discrete fracture matrix dfn m numerical model simulations using site derived parameters this study focuses on numerous groundwater and rock samples obtained at multiple spatial and temporal scales to characterize in situ degradation processes at a field research site in california where the predominant contaminant tce entered the subsurface several decades ago primarily in the 1950s and 1960s groundwater monitoring using conventional wells began in the mid 1980s providing long term volatile organic contaminant voc and groundwater hydrochemistry monitoring data these long term temporal records are used to evaluate trends in tce degradation products in groundwater present in the fractures in addition research activities since 1997 provide high resolution characterization of voc concentrations and minerology in the rock matrix from sampling continuous core compound specific isotope analysis csia of groundwater contaminant concentrations hydrochemistry using various groundwater sampling techniques including depth discrete multi level samplers and geochemical information to evaluate processes involved in the attenuation of tce in this fractured rock aquifer these data types are combined with site derived parameters to inform the dfn m numerical model fractran and illustrate how the various physical chemical and microbial processes interact and influence bulk plume behavior over several decades of transport this steady state groundwater flow and transient transport model explicitly represents the key characteristics and processes and their interactions affecting flow and transport in fractured porous rocks pathways for complete dechlorination of tce in groundwater are separated into two categories biotic or abiotic for granular geologic media the literature concerning the biotic pathways is voluminous as summarized by alvarez and illman 2006 there is also substantial literature about potential abiotic pathways especially those associated with the presence of naturally occurring iron bearing minerals such as iron sulphides and oxides nicely summarized by the usepa 2009 the present study is the first to assess both biotic and abiotic degradation at a fractured sedimentary rock site using multiple types of field data particularly to provide information about both the low hydraulic conductivity k matrix as well as the fracture derived groundwater from wells anaerobic microcosm studies using crushed rock from this same site were conducted in parallel darlington et al 2008 the microcosms showed the occurrence of biotic reduction of tce to cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and suggested a combination of biotic and abiotic processes are responsible for degradation of both tce and cdce in a follow up microcosm study darlington et al 2013 provide additional evidence that cdce undergoes anaerobic abiotic and biotic transformation in typical sandstone with formation of carbon dioxide co2 and soluble products microcosms can examine degradation over time scales of months or even a few years using crushed rock however time scales for degradation reaction products to appear in amounts substantial enough to be observed at the field scale span many decades based on groundwater concentration data from conventional wells in bedrock this paper presents the first field study that examines the role of both biotic and abiotic processes in the attenuation of tce based on multiple lines of available field evidence with collection of sample at scales relevant to both the large contaminant mass storage in the low permeability rock matrix and wells that best represent groundwater in fractures where the mass storage is much smaller voc analyses were conducted using samples from both components of the dual porosity system the groundwater for conditions in the fractures and the rock matrix for conditions in the low permeability porous rock between the fractures both groundwater and rock core were extensively sampled over a large depth range 6 to 426 metres below ground surface m bgs the focus of this investigation was to evaluate the biotic and abiotic processes contributing to the degradation of tce within the rock matrix the methods included high resolution voc characterization in the rock matrix and application of an improved downhole in situ groundwater sampling method and conventional long term groundwater data with an enhanced list of analytes including vocs dissolved gases csia and hydrochemical parameters including redox indicators this study is also the first intensive process based investigation of degradation mechanisms that uses field samples of the matrix and fractures along with other site derived data to inform a dfn m numerical model that illustrates how degradation mechanisms identified in the field influence plume behavior over several decades 2 study area 2 1 site description the field site known as the santa susana field laboratory ssfl is one of the most publicly recognized groundwater contamination sites in california fig 1a it is 115 square kilometres km2 in area and sits on a regional topographic high approximately 300 m above the surrounding valleys fig 1b tce plumes occur in a late cretaceous turbidite strata consisting of fractured sandstone with interbeds of siltstone and shale referred to as the chatsworth formation located in the simi hills near los angeles link et al 1984 the chatsworth formation lithologies are highly fractured and physical property measurements of the rock matrix indicate an average matrix porosity of 13 6 sterling et al 2005 tce was discovered in groundwater in the chatsworth formation in 1984 and 150 monitoring wells have since been installed in the bedrock fig 1c annual or quarterly sampling records with water levels and voc concentrations extend over a 5 to 25 year period depending on when the well was installed concentrations of tce in bedrock monitoring wells above 5 micrograms per litre μg l are found in multiple areas originating from various operations i e input areas fig 1b in addition many wells also show cdce and minor occurrences of trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce 1 1 dce and to a lesser extent vinyl chloride vc the source of subsurface contamination is historical releases of an estimated 2 million litres l of tce as dnapl that entered the subsurface at 58 locations i e chemical use areas primarily between the early 1950s and late 1960s in accordance with site operations mwh 2009 a conceptual model for dnapl disappearance in fractured sedimentary rock parker et al 1994 1997 was confirmed using numerous depth discrete rock samples taken adjacent to and at increasing distances away from fractures observed in continuous cores at 12 locations across the site in source areas i e tce use and release areas as described by sterling et al 2005 these data show maximum concentrations more than one order of magnitude lower than tce solubility strongly supporting no persistent dnapl in these subsurface source zones and demonstrate that mass accumulation and storage in the low permeability rock matrix is either in the dissolved and or sorbed phase 2 2 hydrogeologic conditions many aspects of the hydrogeology of the ssfl have been studied and the geology groundwater flow system and inorganic hydrochemistry are generally understood the field study of tce degradation presented in this paper occurs within a broad and informed framework of related information the study area sits on an upland sandstone ridge approximately 300 m above the surrounding lowlands where the terrain consists mainly of exposed bedrock outcrops with 25 covered by soil and vegetation and or alluvial colluvial deposits the site is an area of groundwater recharge with semi arid recharge rates varying between 1 8 and 9 5 of annual average precipitation 451 mm per year manna et al 2016 the water table generally varies between 10 and 30 m bgs groundwater flow paths are generally directed downward and laterally outward toward seeps in off site areas and the adjacent simi and san fernando valleys fig 1b active groundwater flow occurs in the ubiquitous interconnected fractures in the chatsworth formation and is complex due to the influence of faults and the spatially variable fracture network in dipping strata cilona et al 2016 fig 1b field observations during the logging of rock core from 36 continuously cored holes indicate an average fracture spacing of approximately 4 5 fractures per m much of the water recharged in the study area discharges at over 100 seeps observed along the slopes downgradient of the site pierce et al 2018 the average flow velocity in the fractures below the water table ranges between approximately 18 and 40 m per day cherry et al 2009 in the vadose zone recharge is dominated by flow in the rock matrix estimated to be 20 cm per year with 20 of recharge through fractures manna et al 2016 borehole and well hydraulic tests in addition to laboratory tests on rock core samples indicate that the bulk hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 10 5 to 7 10 4 cm s governed by interconnected fractures and is much higher than that of the rock matrix geometric mean 4 1 10 7 cm s cherry et al 2009 therefore nearly all groundwater flow occurs in the fracture network however nearly all groundwater resides in the porous rock matrix where the matrix porosity arithmetic mean 13 6 is almost four orders of magnitude larger than the fracture porosity cherry et al 2009 groundwater present in the rock matrix is nearly immobile and contaminants that diffuse into the rock matrix pore space are exposed for long periods of time to the minerals and solid organic carbon foc that comprise the chatsworth formation sandstones and shales atmospheric tritium values from monitoring well samples show expected trends with depth where deeper groundwater has lower or non detect tritium values that indicate older groundwater ages than the shallower groundwater such observations support the conceptual model of strong vertical gradients for downward flow and contaminant migration with strong diffusion driven mass transfer of solutes from the active flow regime in the fractures to the immobile water in the rock matrix cherry et al 2009 examination of thin sections from rock cores indicates that the chatsworth formation mainly consists of quartz 33 plagioclase feldspar 33 and potassium feldspar 20 with 18 phyllosilicates composed mainly of biotite and chlorite fig 2a b loomer and al 2009 used scanning electron microscopy sem to identify pyrite iron sulphides and iron oxides fig 2c these data are similar to previous mineralogical investigations that also identified smaller amounts of clays 6 9 calcite 0 8 and dolomite 0 1 and indicated the presence of iron oxide and calcitic cement link et al 1984 pyrite was identified in the field during drilling in all rock cores jakobsen 1981 also identified iron bearing accessory minerals including epidote hornblende and amphibole tremolite and actinolite therefore the physical environment of this aquifer has favorable characteristics for the abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes laboratory studies show chlorinated ethenes degrading abiotically in the presence of naturally occurring minerals such as iron sulphide fes sivavec and horney 1997 butler and hayes 1998 1999 2001 clay minerals e g smectite and montmorillonite nzengung et al 2001 pyrite weerasooriya and dharmasena 2001 magnetite lee and batchelor 2002 and iron bearing phyllosilicates lee and batchelor 2004 3 research approach the conceptual model for tce occurrence and degradation at the site includes the dissolution of tce dnapl initially present in the fractures and subsequent diffusion of dissolved tce into the porous rock matrix where nearly all of the mass is now found due to its large contaminant mass storage capacity this is described conceptually by parker et al 1994 1997 and confirmed at this site by sterling et al 2005 therefore even though groundwater velocity in the fractures is large plume fronts have not migrated far from dnapl input locations because of strong plume front retardation due to matrix diffusion parker et al 2010 chapman et al 2014 due to the nature of sedimentary rock systems and considering the importance of matrix diffusion processes a research approach was developed where samples were collected and analyzed at multiple spatial scales across the site the examination of tce degradation mechanisms is based on i a review of historical quarterly groundwater sampling results ii collection of groundwater samples from conventional monitoring wells for detailed hydrochemistry csia of contaminants sulphate and dissolved gases fig 3a iii comparison of conventional three volume purge sampling to depth discrete point samples collected from conventional wells using the snap sampler fig 3b and iv a review of existing rock core voc data collected from the site fig 3c locations of conventional monitoring wells and rock cores with voc data are shown in fig 1c the work presented in this study is based on groundwater data collected at the site from 1985 to present rock core samples collected between 1999 and 2012 and depth discrete snap sampler samples collected in 2008 groundwater samples were obtained from 122 conventional wells at the site with open interval lengths of less than approximately 30 m fig 1c groundwater samples collected from these wells using both conventional methods and depth discrete point samples represent water from multiple fractures at different scales whereas rock core samples represent depth discrete samples taken from the matrix blocks adjacent to and further away from fractures the conventional wells were sampled using large scale three volume purge where water was obtained from fractures within the capture zone of the well in contrast the depth discrete samples collected using the snap sampler represent in situ local conditions within the same conventional well and specifically the dominant high flow fractures obtaining groundwater at these two scales allowed for better representation of dissolved gas concentrations integral to understanding the extent of tce degradation within the system the multiple depth point samples from the unpurged water columns reflect the spatial variability of hydrochemistry that exists in the fracture network and matrix blocks in the formation away from the well bores this type of spatial variability is not represented by single samples collected after purging because of the blending that occurs as the water is drawn to the well from the formation and mixed in the well during pumping comparison of data from wells both large volume purge and depth discrete samples and rock core samples should therefore show strong variability with respect to evidence of tce degradation throughout the contaminated fractured sedimentary rock system 4 methods historical results from quarterly groundwater sampling starting in 1985 and continuing to present were reviewed to identify the presence of known tce degradation daughter products and to evaluate temporal concentration trends in 2003 and 2004 groundwater samples were collected from 122 conventional monitoring wells with open intervals over a depth range from 5 to 400 m fig 1b 95 wells were equipped with dedicated submersible pumps four with triloc inertial systems three with bailer systems 10 with flute systems and 10 flowing wells with spigots all samples and field measurements were taken after three well volumes were purged table 1 provides a summary of field and laboratory methods for groundwater sample analyses used in this study additional parameter specific details are provided as supplemental information continuous core for depth discrete rock core voc sampling and analyses was obtained from 20 locations from 1998 to 2008 fig 1c with a total of 7575 samples over a total core interval of 2899 m from depths ranging from 2 to 426 m bgs average sample spacing of 0 4 m rock core samples approximately 5 to 10 cm in length were collected for voc analysis at varying distances from visible fractures lithologic changes and other points along the core using a chisel and hammer then immediately trimmed crushed and preserved in the field by immersion in high purity methanol in either 125 ml clear glass volatile organic analysis voa bottles earlier samples or 40 ml voa vials later samples with screw caps and teflon lined septa sterling et al 2005 the preserved samples were placed in coolers on ice and shipped to the laboratory at the university of waterloo for voc analysis upon arrival the shake flask extraction technique was applied for 5 to 8 weeks dincutoiu et al 2003 samples were analyzed by injecting methanol directly into the gas chromatograph gc dincutoiu et al 2003 and results reported as micrograms of each contaminant per gram of wet crushed rock mass μg g conversions to porewater concentrations were made using average site derived values for porosity n 13 6 wet bulk density p bw 2 44 g cm3 and retardation factors tce 3 5 cdce 2 4 tdce 1 7 1 1 dce 1 9 estimated using literature values of koc for each chlorinated ethene pankow and cherry 1996 with site derived values for solid phase organic carbon foc 0 146 and bulk dry density p b 2 32 g cm3 hurley 2003 snap sampler samples were collected in 2008 during three sampling events from 14 monitoring wells as a subset of the 122 wells sampled in 2003 2004 the snap sampler is a passive groundwater sampling device that collects an in situ groundwater sample at a discrete depth in conventional wells britt et al 2010 the snap sampler bottles are deployed at different depths within the water column with the bottle open at both ends britt et al 2010 groundwater samples are collected by activating the trigger system to automatically seal all bottles within the water column samplers are retrieved at the surface bottles are removed end caps with septa are screwed on and the samples sent directly to the automatic sampler in the analytical laboratory without being opened or poured in addition vertical profiles of field parameters for temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen and ph were obtained from these 14 wells using a ysi 600qs multi parameter sonde at approximately 1 m intervals due to cable length limitations the sonde could only be lowered to a maximum depth of approximately 60 m 5 results and discussion 5 1 temporal and spatial analysis of groundwater voc data long term trends of decreasing voc concentrations vs time are commonly used as evidence for natural attenuation by degradation in granular aquifers usepa 1998 our study area features 167 conventional monitoring wells with long term 10 years contaminant analysis records quarterly groundwater voc concentrations from these conventional monitoring wells were examined for long term trends first the most recent tce concentration was compared to the maximum historical concentration fig 4 in nearly all wells the most recent tce concentration measured is less than the maximum historical concentration suggesting an overall decrease in groundwater tce concentrations across the site by at least an order of magnitude over the past 25 years fig 4a in contrast the most recent groundwater cdce concentration is the highest measured in 10 of the wells in other wells cdce concentrations have decreased over time consistent with tce concentration trends fig 4b which suggests a loss of mass by degradation and or dilution by diffusion into the matrix notably tce has decreased by up to four orders of magnitude whereas cdce has in general only decreased by one or two orders of magnitude inspection of records for individual wells shows that tce concentrations increase decrease fluctuate or remain nearly steady with time of the 167 wells at the site with three or more detections of tce 117 show discernable concentration trends with time 47 7 are nearly constant 36 5 are decreasing 11 2 are fluctuating and 4 7 are increasing fig 5 shows examples of these trends for selected wells and provides examples of the coinciding daughter product concentration trends over the same period for 90 of the monitoring wells daughter product concentration trends are similar to those of tce similar concentration trends over time for both parent and daughter products are evidence of matrix diffusion mechanical dispersion physical mixing in contrast the concentration of tce in 10 of the wells decreases while that of cdce increases over a limited period in granular aquifers this would constitute evidence supporting degradation of tce however increases and decreases in contaminant concentrations in fractured sedimentary rocks can occur due to matrix diffusion processes monitoring in fractured rock aquifers presents different challenges but clear trends indicative of degradation are not likely to be as evident in fractured sedimentary rock because of complexities not present in granular media plumes in granular media tend to have greater orderliness with respect to concentration distributions than those in fractured rock complicating factors or complexities inherent in the analysis of concentration trends in fractured rock pertain to the scale of the contaminant occurrence the nature of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in fractured rock including discrete fractures with variable hydraulic conditions the nature of fracture properties and matrix variability as well as the design of monitoring wells in rock relative to those in granular aquifers although the time series data cover more than a decade and as such are long relative to what exists at many sites where degradation is assessed they are short relative to the period during which contamination has existed at the site i e since the 1950s another complexity imposed on many of the monitoring wells is historical pumping of the sandstone aquifer for water supply to on site facilities largely in the 1950s 1970s this pumping was terminated in 1968 but some of the wells were put back into service from 1995 to 1998 of the wells for which long term records exist most are located within the influence of this historical pumping given all of the potential influences on the temporal trends for monitoring the fact that these trends provide no clear evidence of complete degradation is not surprising therefore at this and likely many other sedimentary fractured rock sites evidence for the extent of tce degradation must come from the analysis of water and rock core samples for the diagnostic daughter products ethene ethane and acetylene csia and characterization of the redox conditions therefore judgement concerning the extent of tce degradation and its transformation to non chlorinated compounds must be based on the information presented in subsequent sections 5 2 rock core data rock core voc concentration data from 20 coreholes located at contaminant input areas fig 1 show abundant tce and cdce as well as some tdce and 1 1 dce in the rock matrix porewater calculations of cumulative mass of tce and dce isomers from these 20 profiles show that overall approximately 80 of the mass is tce 13 is cdce 7 is 1 1 dce and 1 is tdce a 40 m section of a 170 m rock core voc concentration profile c 1 proximal to a groundwater monitoring well rd 77 near one of the many tce dnapl input areas is shown in fig 6 for comparison of depth discrete matrix porewater concentrations to a blended groundwater sample where many fractures contribute flow to the well the 40 m section presented in fig 6 corresponds to the open interval of the well approximately 150 m away the voc rock core profile expressed as μg l of porewater and plotted with groundwater voc concentration results from rd 77 illustrates the spatial variability of parent and daughter products within the rock matrix the porewater voc concentrations obtained from rock core are calculated from measured total mass concentrations and site derived rock matrix parameters as detailed in the supporting information the discrete porewater voc concentrations are higher than blended voc concentrations observed in groundwater fig 6 from well sampling which represents a mixture of water derived from many fractures at different depths with strong bias toward the most transmissive fractures when multi level monitoring systems are installed and comparisons made between the shorter groundwater sampling intervals and the rock core results the heterogeneity of the porewater voc concentrations are better reflected in the groundwater voc concentrations sterling et al 2005 the occurrence of cdce concentrations and minor occurrence of tdce in the rock samples similar in some cases to what is seen in the fracture water from monitoring wells is evidence of strong degradation of tce likely due to microbial reductive dichlorination however at certain depths in the rock porewater concentration profile e g at depths of 17 36 and 50 m bgs concentrations of 1 1 dce exceed those of cdce and tce fig 6 suggesting it is a locally abundant transformation product the occurrence of 1 1 dce is mainly attributed to the localized abiotic degradation of 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca vogel et al 1987 historically 1 1 1 tca was detected in some groundwater wells at concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 5200 μg l but not in the rock core samples two explanations are offered for this apparent inconsistency 1 the mass of 1 1 1 tca that has diffused into the matrix has undergone abiotic transformation to 1 1 dce at a higher rate than that in the fractures which is emanating from an upgradient source of tca not locally present in the rock matrix or 2 abiotic transformation of 1 1 1 tca to 1 1 dce occurred in the crushed rock samples in the time between collection and analysis the presence of 1 1 dce in 7 of the samples from 20 coreholes some located in areas where 1 1 1 tca was not used indicates tce as an alternative parent compound for 1 1 dce at the site this is supported by previous studies in which 1 1 dce was observed as a trace transformation product during the biotic degradation of tce in sulphate reducing or methanogenic conditions kastner 1991 tandoi et al 1994 maymo gatell et al 2001 also suggest cdce as the precursor to 1 1 dce in laboratory biotic microcosm studies in addition trace 1 1 dce has been observed during laboratory investigations of the abiotic degradation of tce in the presence of iron sulphide iron hydroxide and pyrite kastner 1991 jeong and hayes 2007 jeong et al 2007 he et al 2010 which are commonly present in the rock matrix fig 2 unfortunately dissolved gases indicative of further dichlorination beyond the dce isomers including vc ethene ethane and methane could not be measured by the rock core analytical methods used direct on column injection of the methanol extract into the gc coupled with micro electron capture detection was used to enhance the quantification of limits of the higher halogenated compounds e g tce without improvements to the lower chlorinated daughter products thus limiting the assessment of complete dechlorination in the rock matrix therefore the rock core data only provide evidence of the occurrence and spatial variability of parent compounds and the dce isomers that indicate various degradation pathways but cannot be used to assess the occurrence of complete reductive dechlorination 5 3 distribution of degradation products and dissolved gas in groundwater groundwater samples collected during the 2003 2004 investigation were analyzed for the known suite of tce degradation products and dissolved gases results from these samples and an examination of the monitoring well historical records indicate cdce is the dominant degradation product with lesser concentrations of tdce 1 1 dce vc and ethene cdce was present in 42 of the 122 wells sampled 34 at concentrations ranging from 2 1 to 2553 μg l 1 1 dce was detected in 17 of the wells sampled 14 ranging from 1 3 to 150 μg l and tdce was detected in 24 of the wells sampled 20 ranging from 2 3 to 107 μg l in general tce degradation appears to be stalled at cdce across most of the site this can be explained by redox conditions being variable and in some areas not reducing enough for reductive dechlorination to proceed past cdce to vc and ethene the microbes likely required for high rates of cdce reduction to ethene i e dehalococcoides are either lacking at the site or present in low numbers sulphate reducers are also possibly outcompeting the dehalococcoides for electron donors dissolved gas analysis indicates the presence of vc in samples from 12 wells at concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 74 μg l mean 21 5 μg l and ethene in samples from 11 wells ranging from 0 5 to 8 9 μg l mean 2 7 μg l these data suggest that dechlorination is proceeding past dce and vc in local zones within the system acetylene identified by others as a product of the dichloroelimination pathway for abiotic tce degradation usepa 2009 was also detected in 17 groundwater samples in concentrations ranging from the detection limit of 0 5 to 17 μg l the current literature contains no evidence of acetylene occurring naturally in groundwater and therefore its detection in this field study is taken as strong evidence of tce abiotic degradation however due to negative sampling and analysis bias for dissolved gases in general and especially for acetylene these measurements are not suitable for quantifying the extent of abiotic degradation mechanisms occurring in this system ethane has been identified as a product of both the biotic and abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 he et al 2015 ethane was detected in 21 wells at concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 7 2 μg l the dissolved gas analysis likely underestimates the extent of the occurrence of vc ethene ethane and acetylene due to negative bias common in conventional purge sampling and analysis procedures britt et al 2010 blending of groundwater in long open well intervals dilutes the maximum concentration of both vocs and dissolved gases improved sampling methods for dissolved gases and vocs have since been used at the site including deployment of snap samplers to collect in situ depth discrete groundwater samples it is also important to highlight that acetylene and ethene are not conservative and can also be consumed by biodegradation bloom et al 2000 miller et al 2015 the results from the depth discrete samples obtained using the snap sampler were compared to those collected in 2003 2004 by conventional methods fig 7 each comparison figure shows results from 14 locations where both methods were applied in which one sample obtained by conventional purging and sampling methodology is compared to up to five snap samples from the same well during one sampling event providing a range of analyte concentrations vs one value from the conventional sampling approach this series of comparison plots for all wells and events shows all of the chlorinated ethene results tce cdce tdce 1 1 dce and vc with the exception of snap sampler sample concentrations below the method detection limit mdl a large range of tce concentrations i e higher concentrations for both conventional and snap sampler samples were observed relative to the other chlorinated ethenes snap sampler results show a minimum tce concentration of 1 μg l and a maximum of 9850 μg l whereas the conventional aggressive purge results range from 1 to 4100 μg l concentration data for cdce tdce and 1 1 dce from conventional and snap sampler samples were more similar in range however variability is still present minimum and maximum cdce concentrations for the snap sampler samples are 0 6 and 2420 μg l whereas for the conventional samples are 2 1 and 4900 μg l measured concentrations of dissolved gases vc and ethene are two times higher in the snap sampler samples compared to the conventional samples fig 7e f the higher concentrations for the vc and ethene measured in the snap sampler samples are expected because the snap sampler methodology avoids sample exposure to the atmosphere during sample collection as well as in the laboratory sample containers are placed into the auto sampler vials for direct injection into the gc this positive bias for dissolved gas analytes is consistently observed at chlorinated ethene contaminated sites in addition to the ssfl as reported by britt et al 2010 the data obtained from in situ sampling methods confirm and provide additional insights into the variability of degradation processes occurring at the site a conventional three volume purge sample provides a blended dataset for each well that represents a mixture of water from many fractures due to the bulk fracture porosity in fractured rock being extremely small 0 1 to 0 01 compared to granular media 25 35 the volume of water purged from a conventional well in a fractured rock system travels a larger distance to reach the well the snap sampler provides a measurement under natural groundwater flow conditions in the well and therefore the resulting data represent conditions nearer to the well at the time of sampling in addition the vertical concentration profiles obtained using the snap sampler show the variability with depth groundwater flows into the well bore from one or more dominant fractures reflecting the variable contribution of fractures with different flow rates a string of snap samplers can provide concentration profiles of parent and daughter products that can be useful in identifying higher concentration zones occurring in the well bore however the maximum concentrations shown in the snap sampler profile are likely still not the true maximum concentrations existing in the formation due to inadvertent blending of water from different fractures and not nearly as spatially resolved as the rock core data that more completely show the extent of the spatial variability if the goal of sampling is to obtain contaminant concentrations most representative of what would occur in a water supply well for use in risk assessment concerning drinking water then purge sampling from similarly completed monitoring wells is warranted however if the goal is to obtain results providing more insights concerning the occurrence and variability of in situ degradation processes to assess prospects for natural attenuation or how and where to enhance remediation then point profiles have more value the application of the snap sampler at ssfl shows a greater range of voc and dissolved gas concentrations compared to the conventional well sampling results more similar to the rock core voc data further confirming local areas of complete dechlorination 5 4 redox parameters groundwater samples from conventional wells indicate dissolved oxygen is low across the site except at a few shallow locations and the subsurface environment is predominantly moderately to strongly reducing as indicated by the common presence of dissolved iron methane and dissolved hydrogen fig 8b detectable nitrate no3 is rare as expected due to the lack of nitrate sources substantial sulphate so4 2 occurs in all wells 30 to 300 mg l and stable sulphur isotope data δ34s show sulphate is derived from the oxidation of sulphide minerals furthermore a trend toward more enriched δ34s values correlated with decreasing sulphate concentrations indicates sulphate reduction influences these concentrations at some locations fig 8a no trends in redox state with depth are evident suggesting that the processes governing the redox state of the groundwater are spatially variable throughout the system the observed redox conditions are compatible with the suite of degradation products cdce to ethene present at the site and as reported for microbial reductive dechlorination in granular aquifers chapelle 2001 a comparison of the redox parameter concentrations from both snap sampler and conventional three volume purge sampling is shown in fig 9 nitrate concentrations below 0 5 mg l are found in nine of the 14 wells sampled with the low levels related to the lack of nitrate sources at the site total dissolved manganese was detected in only three of the 14 wells at concentrations exceeding 1 mg l the generally low manganese concentrations indicate conditions favorable for manganese reduction chapelle 2001 total dissolved iron concentrations 0 5 mg l are found in 13 out of the 14 wells sampled due to low oxygen total iron is expected to be mainly ferrous iron and therefore these concentrations indicate iron reducing conditions chapelle 2001 methane detected by conventional methods ranged from 0 3 to 204 μg l whereas methane detected in the snap sampler samples ranged from 0 6 to 333 μg l both sampling methods yielded methane concentrations that provide evidence of methanogenesis which is a favorable condition for microbial reductive dechlorination of tce chapelle 2001 in general the redox indicators from both conventional and snap sampler samples indicate iron reducing conditions are predominant across the site with local zones of manganese and sulphate reducing conditions as well as methanogenesis perhaps enhancing the heterogeneity of voc concentrations observed in the rock matrix overall the redox data show favorable conditions for both biotic and abiotic degradation of tce at the site 5 5 compound specific isotope analysis compound specific stable carbon isotope analysis a widely accepted method that provides definitive evidence of tce degradation and the fate of its degradation products in groundwater aelion et al 2010 was used to confirm the extent of tce degradation at the site the stable carbon isotope ratio δ13c for tce and cdce was measured in 25 and 15 conventional groundwater samples respectively δ13c values for tce across the site range from 30 5 to 11 8 no dnapl sample could be analyzed however δ13c results for tce in areas near potential tce sources range from 31 9 to 27 4 and agree with known values for manufactured tce products shouakar stash et al 2003 the isotope data similar to the voc and geochemical data are highly spatially variable at the site for example results from the northeast of the site show the expected pattern for biodegradation of tce i e more depleted δ13c values are observed in areas of higher tce concentration and more enriched δ13c values are observed in areas with lower tce concentrations fig 10a in contrast the reverse is observed in an area to the southeast fig 10b with more enriched δ13c values observed in the high concentration areas the degree of isotopic fractionation during biodegradation is a function of the fractionation factor and the initial mass of the compound sherwood lollar et al 1999 the higher 13c enrichment observed in high concentration areas in the southeast is an indication of a greater degree of biodegradation of tce and that the initial tce mass in the southeast area was much higher than in the northeast this conclusion is supported by the high concentration of cdce observed in the southeast where the δ13c signatures of tce tend to be more enriched despite the relatively high concentration fig 10b a common pattern in field studies conducted in granular aquifers is decreasing parent product concentrations with a trend toward more enriched δ13c values in conjunction with increasing daughter product concentrations slater et al 2001 bloom et al 2000 the δ13c enrichment patterns observed for tce in both areas at this field site relative to the manufactured tce values indicate degradation is occurring within the fractured sandstone aquifer regardless of the concentration data trends the apparent lack of correspondence between the concentration and isotope composition is likely due to the complexity of these dual porosity systems where groundwater flow is heterogeneous and groundwater in fractures and porewater in the matrix represent different geochemical regimes captured in groundwater samples during purging the δ13c signatures of cdce range from 27 1 to 20 8 and in all areas the cdce δ13c values tend to be more depleted than the δ13c values for tce as shown in fig 10 for the northeast and southeast areas of the site these results indicate the cdce has not been substantially affected by further degradation the exceptions are three areas where the cdce is similarly enriched or more enriched in 13c than the tce in these cases the cdce concentrations exceed or are similar to those of tce and in some cases vc and ethene are also present in the groundwater this is a clear indication of biodegradation proceeding beyond cdce these reflect typical patterns for biotic transformation of chlorinated ethenes hunkeler and aravena 2009 csia data collected from snap sampler samples show a similar pattern to those presented for the northeast portion of the site fig 10a fig 11 shows that the δ13c value of tce becomes more enriched as the fraction of tce decreases and reaches 10 8 when the remaining tce concentration presented as mole fraction percentage is around 18 of the original tce it is important to highlight that biotic and abiotic degradation can cause an isotopic enrichment trend associated with a decrease in tce concentration the role of both processes can be examined by plotting the data using the theoretical fractionation curves for microbial reductive dichlorination and abiotic reactions as a framework as shown in fig 11 for microbial reductive dechlorination of tce measured laboratory enrichment factors ε based on a series of laboratory studies and summarized in aelion et al 2010 range from 2 5 to 18 5 the theoretical fractionation curves for the minimum and maximum enrichment factors for microbial reductive dichlorination are plotted with the snap sampler results and compared to theoretical fractionation curves for abiotic reactions in fig 11 recent abiotic degradation experiments for tce in the presence of sulphide minerals show the carbon isotopic enrichment factor for this process is approximately 30 liang et al 2007 which is much larger than the values reported for biodegradation of tce a similar value of 39 has been obtained for abiotic degradation of tce in the presence of magnetite usepa 2009 the resulting theoretical fractionation curves show that much more enriched δ13c values should be observed for tce if abiotic degradation is a dominant process fig 11 the δ13c data analyzed from the snap sampler samples when plotted with the mole fraction of tce fall in the range expected for microbial reductive dichlorination rather than abiotic processes fig 11 due to the nature of groundwater sampling in fractured rock systems the samples represent a blend of groundwater from different depths dominated by few high flow fractures i e the samples do not represent the contaminant mass present within the monitoring interval because mass concentrations and transmissivity distributions are both heterogeneous and not correlated the groundwater and rock matrix concentrations of cdce vc ethene acetylene and ethane provide strong evidence that abiotic processes are occurring mostly likely in the low permeability rock matrix however the microbial processes remain the dominant processes responsible for the degradation of tce at the site this conclusion based on the isotope data agrees with a microcosm study using 14c labeled tce and chatsworth formation rock and groundwater that showed cdce is the main biodegradation product of tce and that abiotic reactions are responsible for 20 of the tce degradation in the laboratory darlington et al 2008 therefore the δ13c signature associated with this amount of abiotic degradation would likely not be reflected in the csia results from groundwater samples consistent with observations 5 6 summary of degradation processes both rock matrix and groundwater samples indicate the occurrence of biotic and abiotic degradation processes which is consistent with the dual porosity nature of the fractured porous sandstone the dominant degradation product in both the rock matrix and groundwater is cdce the csia and redox parameters which could only be determined on groundwater samples at the time of this study suggest microbial reductive dichlorination of tce to cdce is the dominant degradation process at the site rock core data indicate this process is likely occurring in the rock matrix where contaminant residence times are large higher quality concentration data from point in situ sampling methods used in the water column of open bore wells suggest the local occurrence of complete dichlorination to ethene and ethane the presence of acetylene in groundwater samples confirms the occurrence of abiotic processes likely occurring in the presence of iron sulphides iron oxhydroxides and biotite the nature of contaminant transport in fractured sedimentary rock is controlled by matrix diffusion which allows for long contact time with reactive minerals and sorption to organic carbon with large surface area to facilitate reactions within the matrix 6 conceptualization of site processes using dfn m transport model and site parameters the conceptual model for tce occurrence and degradation at the site includes the dissolution of tce dnapl initially present only in the fractures in the source zone and subsequent diffusion of dissolved tce from this dnapl into the porous rock matrix where nearly all voc mass is now found within and close to the initial source zone this model is described conceptually by parker et al 1994 1997 for the generic case and confirmed at the ssfl site by sterling et al 2005 and additional rock core analyses presented in this study groundwater flowing through the short lived dnapl zone creates a plume in the down flow direction with active transport occurring in the fracture network while diffusion transfers mass into the nearly immobile volume of water in the rock matrix where sorption and reactions can occur after the dnapl has disappeared due to dissolution in fractures and diffusion driven mass transfer to the rock matrix the initial zone where dnapl occurred and the plume have the same features in that all of the mass occurs in the dissolved and sorbed phases with the majority in the rock matrix the combination of these processes results in a plume originating at each dnapl input location and even after decades of migration not extending very far downgradient this is consistent with the map of groundwater contamination at the site that shows all plumes remaining within or proximal to the site property boundary fig 1c comprehensive sampling of the many seeps along the mountain slopes fig 1b has shown no off site detection of tce pierce et al 2018 these results indicate no plume arrivals at these groundwater discharge locations due to the combined effect of four primary natural attenuation processes matrix diffusion sorption dispersion and degradation of these processes only degradation results in mass reduction while the others result in mass redistribution all four together contribute to the bulk retardation effect where plumes have not migrated far from their source zones even after decades of transport with rapid groundwater velocities in the fractures freeze and cherry 1979 the relative contribution of each of these attenuation processes can be assessed by means of mathematical simulations of plume evolution the conceptualization of plume evolution over long periods of time was shown by parker et al 2010 based on transport simulations for a generic case but similar to our study site parameters these simulations were also done using the two dimensional numerical model fractran described by sudicky and mclaren 1992 for steady groundwater flow and transient solute transport in discrete fracture networks the model rigorously simulates advective dispersive groundwater flow and solute transport in both the fractures and rock matrix and interactions between these environments i e diffusive exchange linear sorption on fracture surfaces and in the rock matrix can be incorporated degradation is included in simulations as first order decay occurring in both the fractures and the rock matrix similar simulations to those reported in parker et al 2010 using fractran with fracture and matrix parameters specific to this study site are presented herein the simulated domain is a rectangular vertical slice of the upland with a fixed duration dnapl source assigned along the upgradient boundary with steady flow created across the domain and both vertical and horizontal components of hydraulic gradient due to the upland recharge conditions at the site and recreated by the assigned boundary conditions fig 12 the rock matrix parameters assigned to the model domain were selected to represent in a generalized manner the conditions in the chatsworth formation at the study site using average values from hundreds of measurements from depth discrete samples focused on the sandstone lithology which makes up the bulk of the chatsworth formation in these simulations the following matrix parameters for sandstone were used matrix porosity ϕm 13 linear matrix retardation factor rm 2 0 and matrix hydraulic conductivity km 1 10 8 m s similarly fracture network parameters were also informed by site data for example the fracture aperture distribution is based on many values of hydraulic aperture obtained using the cubic law and derived from hydraulic tests in boreholes as described by quinn et al 2011 and transmissivity profiling as described by keller et al 2014 fracture spacing is assessed from core observations as well as geophysical logs such as acoustic televiewer or atv and other hydrophysical tests e g pehme et al 2013 in these model simulations the fracture apertures are log normally distributed with a mean of 0 7 10 4 m 70 μm and variance of log aperture of 0 3 m2 the assigned fracture network is orthogonal which is reasonable for such sedimentary sequences dominated by bedding plane fractures and near vertical joints based on the assigned statistics for the fracture network aperture distribution fracture density and fracture length ranges fracture network realizations were produced for randomly generated fracture networks the steady state flow simulations produced for each realization yield a calculated bulk hydraulic conductivity kb for flow through the model domain which is assessed for consistency with the estimated bulk transmissivity obtained from nearby long term pumping tests allègre et al 2016 and other site derived datasets this represents an independent check on the reasonableness of the fracture network properties fracture network density and range of fracture lengths which cannot be measured directly were varied to produce model generated fracture network realizations with a target kb within the field range kb 3 10 7 m s flow is allowed in both the fractures and the matrix however the effects of matrix flow are likely small compared to rates of diffusion in the rock matrix given the low measured matrix hydraulic conductivity of field rock core samples from boreholes a similarly low value was applied in the model such that the km is a factor of 30 lower than the kb in the simulations however due to heterogeneity matrix flow may play a role in addition to diffusion for matrix transport in some layers for example applying km 1 10 8 m s ϕm 13 and an average hydraulic gradient i of 0 01 provides a matrix flow velocity of 0 024 m year furthermore the model kb and fracture density values for these simulations were selected from the lower end of the range for these field derived paramaters which keeps the simulated plumes within the model domain over the time periods of interest while model simulations were informed by field parameter measurements we refer to these simulations as stylistic they are not intended to match exact conditions at any specific position within the plume but rather bulk plume behavior approximate plume position in both the transverse vertical and longitudinal directions observed at the field site were used to inform the conceptual model for long term contaminant behavior at the site as such these simulations conceptually illustrate the key processes and effects on plume transport and fate for conditions reasonable for the site fig 13a shows the simulated distribution of tce contamination from a constant source after 10 50 and 100 years without degradation which would represent worst case conditions the positions of the plume fronts for tce at the three different times are 350 m from the dnapl source and strongly retarded relative to the groundwater travel distances based on average linear groundwater velocities estimated from fracture porosity values and assuming all groundwater flow occurs through the interconnected fracture network fig 13b shows the distribution of tce after adding the effects of first order degradation in both the fractures and the matrix for the same time periods lima et al 2012 show the presence of microbial communities in the rock matrix of cambrian sandstone in wisconsin united states supporting the possibility of microbial degradation in the matrix at ssfl notice that the long half life of 20 years has little effect on plume front and internal plume concentrations in the 10 and 50 year scenarios but a strong influence after 100 years of transport the dfn m numerical model of the site conditions informed by site parameters for fracture and matrix properties processes simulates the non linear effects of the multiple processes on bulk plume behavior it shows the importance of matrix diffusion enhanced by sorption in the early decades 0 to 50 years after contamination began and a transition to when the plume is nearly steady in position but a few degradation half lives dramatically impact plume position and internal concentrations after 50 years fig 13b due to a paucity of field data many professionals have speculated that microbial degradation believed to be the most significant in the subsurface until recent years would only occur in the fractures due to microbe sizes and pore exclusion effects and access to substrates to sustain activity hence we simulate the outcome for degradation in fractures alone versus degradation occurring in both fractures and within the matrix fig 13c shows that degradation only occurring in the fractures has little impact on the plume position or internal concentrations compared to the no degradation scenario fig 13a this is expected given the low bulk fracture porosity ϕf of about 5 10 5 compared to the matrix porosity of 0 13 so that orders of magnitude more contaminant mass occurs in the matrix where storage is further enhanced by sorption fig 14 shows sensitivity to the degradation rate using half lives of 20 10 and 5 years in comparison to the no degradation scenario for cases with constant persistent dnapl and finite dnapl disappearance sources the latter is the expected condition given expectations for dnapl disappearance from fractures due to dissolution in groundwater flowing in fractures combined with matrix diffusion processes parker et al 1994 1997 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 these simulations further illustrate concepts related to diffusion and degradation in and out of the matrix in a fractured porous medium without degradation plume front transport rates slow significantly within the first few decades but the plume continues to advance in later decades albeit at very slow rates of a few meters per year and declining with degradation and a constant source the plume achieves a steady position within about 20 to 100 years achieving this state more rapidly with a shorter half life with a finite duration source and degradation the plume reaches a maximum extent and then retreats which is evident in these simulations for scenarios with 5 and 10 year half lives but not for the 20 year half live scenario where it would take longer than 100 years to observe such retreat for a 20 year dnapl source declines in internal plume concentrations are also evident in scenarios with a finite source and degradation we have presented numerous lines of evidence for biotic and abiotic degradation within the system and by deduction shown the likelihood of this occurring in the matrix this is due to the long residence times for mass in the lower permeability zones where organic carbon dominated sorption and reaction with iron bearing minerals with large surface area and low redox conditions can provide conditions appropriate for supporting degradation reactions the occurrence of degradation is confirmed by the measured shifts in carbon isotopes as well as the occurrence of degradation products and dissolved gases these simulations demonstrate that even very low degradation half lives i e 5 to 20 years which are slower than the extreme low end of values reported in the literature for tce in sandy aquifers are effective in reducing plume mass and retarding plume fronts in fractured porous media after the plume has expanded sufficiently such that the surface area for diffusion allows the overall plume to have substantially slowed 0 to 50 years this stage of the plume conditions then allows the degradation rate to show a measurable effect in future decades 50 to 100 year time frames although the groundwater monitoring data over 30 years from conventional wells mid 1980s to the present support the very low half life estimates the lack of continual inputs to the subsurface and possible acclimation of microbial communities to chlorinated ethenes might result in increased degradation half lives in the future alternatively the assignment of multiple degradation rates for multiple ongoing processes might be useful for evaluating the prospects and timescales for in situ attenuation and complete remediation at these sites this work simply shows the prospects for quantitative process evaluations informed by site measurements to advance this one would continue to monitor groundwater concentrations of the suite of contaminants and degradation products isotopes and hydrochemical conditions including microbial community activity with rna and dna methods that continually improve our diagnostic capabilities one thing is clear 5 to 20 year half lives are inordinately long and unlikely to be observed in laboratory experiments but have marked impact on field scale plume behavior over long time periods therefore attention must be paid to collecting appropriately resolved field datasets to inform actual site conditions relevant processes and rates the simulations presented to this point have been limited to the parent contaminant position with time however the toxic nature of the chlorinated degradation products make knowledge of the distribution of the decay products based on their properties and individual degradation rates important an initial evaluation of the multiple species transport emanating from tce transport with reductive dechlorination to cdce to vc to ethene is shown in fig 15 using the same matrix and fracture network conditions for the fractran model but using the hydrogeosphere hgs model therrien and sudicky 1996 therrien et al 2005 this model allows the use of fractran generated fracture networks but includes the additional capability to allow the simultaneous evolution of chain decay contaminants each constituent is expected to have its own half life consistent with observations in sandy aquifers approximate values have been assigned in a manner aligned with that observed in the literature for granular aquifers but scaled for the slower degradation rate observed for tce at the site these results strongly illustrate the value of a detailed site characterization to inform the processes in both the fractures and the matrix and how these combined mechanisms create a time evolution of plume conditions that is only possible to interpret with the use of these dfn m models future challenges in these simulations exist given the need for 3 d dfn m simulations and multiple reaction processes with individual half lives or reaction orders and parameters and the associated computational demands the current models are sufficiently robust to advance our interpretation and intuition for how these processes affect plume conditions however numerical models with improved capabilities to represent these processes are needed to better represent the site complexity and provide improved prediction qualities for the profession the observed behavior of plumes in fractured porous sandstone with and without the inclusion of degradation with a long half life is much different than the behavior of plumes for tce in granular aquifers most notable is the importance of a long half life in fractured porous rock where diffusion into the matrix controls plume behavior in the first few decades slowing down the rate of plume front advancement to the point that eventually within 50 years or less for the site in our study the plume migrates so slowly that even very slow degradation half lives have a noticeable impact on plume conditions into the future such extremely low rates of degradation would be inconsequential in sandy aquifers where transverse dispersion effects on bulk plume behavior are much smaller and therefore much more rapid rates of degradation are required to have a measurable effect 7 conclusions this paper describes the presence of abundant tce and degradation products in two components of a fractured rock system groundwater in the fractures represented by sampling of monitor wells and the porous but lower permeability rock matrix represented by rock core analyses the presence of tce degradation products in the rock core does not on its own indicate degradation preferentially in the rock matrix because diffusion continually results in chemical mass transfer between the matrix and the fractures however consideration of the matrix porewater volume available surface area mineralogy organic carbon content and contact time in the matrix suggests that biotic and abiotic processes operating in the rock matrix are most influential on bulk plume behavior as illustrated by the numerical simulations laboratory methods existing at the time of the study were not capable of reliable analysis of dissolved or free gas analysis in rock core samples for quantifying the diagnostic degradation products ethane ethane acetylene and redox parameters in the matrix however the matrix provides a large surface area and long contact times with iron bearing minerals favorable for some degree of abiotic degradation as documented by others the matrix has abundant solid phase organic matter and a search for the presence of microbes in the matrix that are diagnostic of reductive dichlorination at this site is the subject of ongoing research the multiple datasets used in this study clearly provide evidence that both abiotic and biotic degradation are occurring but to varying degrees as much heterogeneity in parent and transformation products was observed the occurrence of abiotic degradation is likely sporadic and even more heterogeneous given the rock core voc data and dissolved gas concentrations in groundwater biotic degradation dominates according to the csia results where the δ13c signature for microbial reductive dichlorination is shown in samples derived from monitoring wells and the transmissive fractures dfn m transport modeling using site informed parameters indicates that biotic and or abiotic reactions operating in the matrix at extremely slow rates might be sufficient to contribute substantially to plume front retardation and internal plume attenuation after the source zone and the plume have evolved resulting in plumes that are stationary or retreating after five or more decades the use of the down hole snap sampler deployed at a few depths in each long open well bore produced stronger evidence of complete dechlorination than conventional purging and sampling at surface the snap sampler should be used in future studies at this and other sites seeking better detection of dissolved gas concentrations such as ethene ethane methane and acetylene the latter being diagnostic of abiotic dichlorination even when found at extremely low concentrations the field evidence from this study favors some degree of complete dechlorination in the rock matrix by a combination of biotic and abiotic pathways consistent with crushed rock microcosm experiments reported in the literature however these processes operate with much spatial heterogeneity very slow degradation rates are expected to be sufficient to cause the current delineated contaminated zones i e plumes to remain stationary and most likely shrink in future decades over a very long time likely centuries naturally occurring degradation of the chlorinated solvent contaminants will allow this sandstone aquifer to return to an uncontaminated state the time and distance scales for a plume to become stationary are dependent on rock matrix properties fracture network properties and the flow regime in the fracture network and degradation rates along with subsurface source zone conditions the latter is the most difficult to characterize especially without a combination of high resolution sampling and measurement methods for the low permeability zones however for slow degradation rates to be effective in plume attenuation a high percentage of the contaminant mass must reside in the rock matrix due to diffusion such slow degradation rates would be considered inconsequential in granular aquifers recognizing that the magnitude of the relevant processes and the nature of their interaction in sedimentary rock aquifers are distinctly different in their ultimate effect on plumes is important this points to the need for different strategies and

1666,plumes of trichloroethene tce with degradation products occur at a large industrial site in california where tce as a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl entered the fractured sandstone bedrock at many locations beginning in the late 1940s groundwater flows rapidly in closely spaced fractures but plume fronts are strongly retarded relative to groundwater flow velocities owing largely to matrix diffusion in early decades and degradation processes in later decades and going forward multiple data types show field evidence for both biotic and abiotic dechlorination of tce and its degradation products resulting in non chlorinated compounds analyses were conducted on groundwater samples from hundreds of monitoring wells and on thousands of rock samples from continuous core over depths ranging from 6 to 426 metres below ground surface nearly all of the present day mass of tce and degradation products resides in the water saturated low permeability rock matrix blocks although groundwater and dnapl flow primarily occur in the fractures dnapl dissolution followed by diffusion and sorption readily transfers contaminant mass into the rock matrix the presence of non chlorinated degradation products ethene ethane acetylene and compound specific isotope analysis csia of tce and cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce indicate at least some complete dechlorination by both biotic and abiotic pathways consistent with the observed mineralogy and hydrogeochemistry and with published results from crushed rock microcosms the rock matrix contains abundant iron bearing minerals and solid phase organic carbon with large surface areas and long contact times suggesting degradation processes are occurring in the rock matrix multiple high resolution datasets provide strong evidence for spatially heterogeneous distributions of tce and degradation products with varying degrees of degradation observed only when using new methods that achieve better detection of dissolved gases i e snap sampler and contaminant mass stored in the low permeability rock matrix i e core dfn simulations using a discrete fracture matrix dfn m numerical model capable of rigorously simulating flow and transport in both the fractures and matrix including interactions show that even slow first order degradation rates i e 5 to 20 year half lives informed by site derived parameters can contribute strongly to natural attenuation resulting in tce plumes that become stationary in space and might even retreat after 50 to 100 years if the dnapl sources become depleted due to the combination of diffusion and degradation processes 1 introduction trichloroethene tce is a common industrial contaminant in groundwater that occurs in all types of hydrogeologic settings one of the most complex being fractured geologic media with high matrix porosity including fractured sedimentary rock nrc 2005 the most populated and industrialized parts of north america where chlorinated solvent releases commonly occur overlie sedimentary bedrock back et al 1990 degradation is widely known as an important contributor to the natural attenuation of tce plumes in non indurated granular aquifers i e sand gravel wiedemeier et al 1999 nrc 2000 alvarez and illman 2006 and in fractured rock bishop et al 1993 yager et al 1997 hohnstock ashe et al 2001 lenczewski et al 2003 ellis and rivett 2007 pooley et al 2009 revesz et al 2009 lima et al 2012 schaefer et al 2013 2015 yet much is still not known about the physical and chemical conditions in fractured sedimentary rock that govern degradation mechanisms of tce and thereby contribute to natural attenuation especially at sites that feature no accumulation of vinyl chloride understanding tce degradation in fractured sedimentary rock is particularly challenging because nearly all groundwater flow occurs in the fractures and also dominates the hydrochemistry and contaminant concentrations in samples collected from monitoring wells however in aged plumes diffusion over decades has caused most or nearly all of the contaminant mass to reside in the low permeability rock matrix blocks between the fractures as dissolved and sorbed phases requiring alternative methods for characterization and approaches to remediation it has become well established over the past 40 years of contaminant hydrogeology research and practice that the processes affecting contaminant distribution and plume behavior in fractured porous rocks such as sandstone shale chalk limestone and dolostone are much different than in granular aquifers including chlorinated solvents present as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl freeze and cherry 1979 parker et al 1994 1997 pankow and cherry 1996 nrc 2005 national academy of sciences 2015 fractured sedimentary rocks are known as fractured porous media with at least two distinct domains of permeability and porosity i e the fractures and the matrix where the much smaller fracture porosity dominates advection and the larger matrix porosity dominates contaminant storage in the hydrogeologic literature foster 1975 first recognized diffusion into the rock matrix as the process controlling the distribution and slow arrival of atmospheric derived tritium in the british chalk aquifer although the movement and storage of dnapl in fractured sedimentary rock occurs almost exclusively in the fractures dnapl dissolution with strong concentration gradients for diffusion results after some years in nearly all contaminant mass residing in the rock matrix parker et al 1994 1997 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 hence while groundwater flow occurs nearly exclusively in the fracture network it is hypothesized that degradation mechanisms will dominate in the rock matrix where contaminant residence times are large due to much slower transport by diffusion and given that the matrix has orders of magnitude larger porosity for mass storage with large mineral surface area for enhanced sorption and reactions relative to the fractures therefore the rock matrix conditions that foster microbial and geochemical processes are expected to be most influential on solute contaminant transport and fate published field studies regarding tce degradation in fractured sedimentary rock are few and have not focused on the occurrence of the microbial or abiotic reactions in the rock matrix itself therefore the objective of this study was to use multiple lines of field evidence from both the rock matrix and groundwater within the fractures to identify various degradation mechanisms the interactive effects of degradation in the fractures or the matrix on plume behavior are presented using discrete fracture matrix dfn m numerical model simulations using site derived parameters this study focuses on numerous groundwater and rock samples obtained at multiple spatial and temporal scales to characterize in situ degradation processes at a field research site in california where the predominant contaminant tce entered the subsurface several decades ago primarily in the 1950s and 1960s groundwater monitoring using conventional wells began in the mid 1980s providing long term volatile organic contaminant voc and groundwater hydrochemistry monitoring data these long term temporal records are used to evaluate trends in tce degradation products in groundwater present in the fractures in addition research activities since 1997 provide high resolution characterization of voc concentrations and minerology in the rock matrix from sampling continuous core compound specific isotope analysis csia of groundwater contaminant concentrations hydrochemistry using various groundwater sampling techniques including depth discrete multi level samplers and geochemical information to evaluate processes involved in the attenuation of tce in this fractured rock aquifer these data types are combined with site derived parameters to inform the dfn m numerical model fractran and illustrate how the various physical chemical and microbial processes interact and influence bulk plume behavior over several decades of transport this steady state groundwater flow and transient transport model explicitly represents the key characteristics and processes and their interactions affecting flow and transport in fractured porous rocks pathways for complete dechlorination of tce in groundwater are separated into two categories biotic or abiotic for granular geologic media the literature concerning the biotic pathways is voluminous as summarized by alvarez and illman 2006 there is also substantial literature about potential abiotic pathways especially those associated with the presence of naturally occurring iron bearing minerals such as iron sulphides and oxides nicely summarized by the usepa 2009 the present study is the first to assess both biotic and abiotic degradation at a fractured sedimentary rock site using multiple types of field data particularly to provide information about both the low hydraulic conductivity k matrix as well as the fracture derived groundwater from wells anaerobic microcosm studies using crushed rock from this same site were conducted in parallel darlington et al 2008 the microcosms showed the occurrence of biotic reduction of tce to cis 1 2 dichloroethene cdce and suggested a combination of biotic and abiotic processes are responsible for degradation of both tce and cdce in a follow up microcosm study darlington et al 2013 provide additional evidence that cdce undergoes anaerobic abiotic and biotic transformation in typical sandstone with formation of carbon dioxide co2 and soluble products microcosms can examine degradation over time scales of months or even a few years using crushed rock however time scales for degradation reaction products to appear in amounts substantial enough to be observed at the field scale span many decades based on groundwater concentration data from conventional wells in bedrock this paper presents the first field study that examines the role of both biotic and abiotic processes in the attenuation of tce based on multiple lines of available field evidence with collection of sample at scales relevant to both the large contaminant mass storage in the low permeability rock matrix and wells that best represent groundwater in fractures where the mass storage is much smaller voc analyses were conducted using samples from both components of the dual porosity system the groundwater for conditions in the fractures and the rock matrix for conditions in the low permeability porous rock between the fractures both groundwater and rock core were extensively sampled over a large depth range 6 to 426 metres below ground surface m bgs the focus of this investigation was to evaluate the biotic and abiotic processes contributing to the degradation of tce within the rock matrix the methods included high resolution voc characterization in the rock matrix and application of an improved downhole in situ groundwater sampling method and conventional long term groundwater data with an enhanced list of analytes including vocs dissolved gases csia and hydrochemical parameters including redox indicators this study is also the first intensive process based investigation of degradation mechanisms that uses field samples of the matrix and fractures along with other site derived data to inform a dfn m numerical model that illustrates how degradation mechanisms identified in the field influence plume behavior over several decades 2 study area 2 1 site description the field site known as the santa susana field laboratory ssfl is one of the most publicly recognized groundwater contamination sites in california fig 1a it is 115 square kilometres km2 in area and sits on a regional topographic high approximately 300 m above the surrounding valleys fig 1b tce plumes occur in a late cretaceous turbidite strata consisting of fractured sandstone with interbeds of siltstone and shale referred to as the chatsworth formation located in the simi hills near los angeles link et al 1984 the chatsworth formation lithologies are highly fractured and physical property measurements of the rock matrix indicate an average matrix porosity of 13 6 sterling et al 2005 tce was discovered in groundwater in the chatsworth formation in 1984 and 150 monitoring wells have since been installed in the bedrock fig 1c annual or quarterly sampling records with water levels and voc concentrations extend over a 5 to 25 year period depending on when the well was installed concentrations of tce in bedrock monitoring wells above 5 micrograms per litre μg l are found in multiple areas originating from various operations i e input areas fig 1b in addition many wells also show cdce and minor occurrences of trans 1 2 dichloroethene tdce 1 1 dce and to a lesser extent vinyl chloride vc the source of subsurface contamination is historical releases of an estimated 2 million litres l of tce as dnapl that entered the subsurface at 58 locations i e chemical use areas primarily between the early 1950s and late 1960s in accordance with site operations mwh 2009 a conceptual model for dnapl disappearance in fractured sedimentary rock parker et al 1994 1997 was confirmed using numerous depth discrete rock samples taken adjacent to and at increasing distances away from fractures observed in continuous cores at 12 locations across the site in source areas i e tce use and release areas as described by sterling et al 2005 these data show maximum concentrations more than one order of magnitude lower than tce solubility strongly supporting no persistent dnapl in these subsurface source zones and demonstrate that mass accumulation and storage in the low permeability rock matrix is either in the dissolved and or sorbed phase 2 2 hydrogeologic conditions many aspects of the hydrogeology of the ssfl have been studied and the geology groundwater flow system and inorganic hydrochemistry are generally understood the field study of tce degradation presented in this paper occurs within a broad and informed framework of related information the study area sits on an upland sandstone ridge approximately 300 m above the surrounding lowlands where the terrain consists mainly of exposed bedrock outcrops with 25 covered by soil and vegetation and or alluvial colluvial deposits the site is an area of groundwater recharge with semi arid recharge rates varying between 1 8 and 9 5 of annual average precipitation 451 mm per year manna et al 2016 the water table generally varies between 10 and 30 m bgs groundwater flow paths are generally directed downward and laterally outward toward seeps in off site areas and the adjacent simi and san fernando valleys fig 1b active groundwater flow occurs in the ubiquitous interconnected fractures in the chatsworth formation and is complex due to the influence of faults and the spatially variable fracture network in dipping strata cilona et al 2016 fig 1b field observations during the logging of rock core from 36 continuously cored holes indicate an average fracture spacing of approximately 4 5 fractures per m much of the water recharged in the study area discharges at over 100 seeps observed along the slopes downgradient of the site pierce et al 2018 the average flow velocity in the fractures below the water table ranges between approximately 18 and 40 m per day cherry et al 2009 in the vadose zone recharge is dominated by flow in the rock matrix estimated to be 20 cm per year with 20 of recharge through fractures manna et al 2016 borehole and well hydraulic tests in addition to laboratory tests on rock core samples indicate that the bulk hydraulic conductivity ranges from 1 10 5 to 7 10 4 cm s governed by interconnected fractures and is much higher than that of the rock matrix geometric mean 4 1 10 7 cm s cherry et al 2009 therefore nearly all groundwater flow occurs in the fracture network however nearly all groundwater resides in the porous rock matrix where the matrix porosity arithmetic mean 13 6 is almost four orders of magnitude larger than the fracture porosity cherry et al 2009 groundwater present in the rock matrix is nearly immobile and contaminants that diffuse into the rock matrix pore space are exposed for long periods of time to the minerals and solid organic carbon foc that comprise the chatsworth formation sandstones and shales atmospheric tritium values from monitoring well samples show expected trends with depth where deeper groundwater has lower or non detect tritium values that indicate older groundwater ages than the shallower groundwater such observations support the conceptual model of strong vertical gradients for downward flow and contaminant migration with strong diffusion driven mass transfer of solutes from the active flow regime in the fractures to the immobile water in the rock matrix cherry et al 2009 examination of thin sections from rock cores indicates that the chatsworth formation mainly consists of quartz 33 plagioclase feldspar 33 and potassium feldspar 20 with 18 phyllosilicates composed mainly of biotite and chlorite fig 2a b loomer and al 2009 used scanning electron microscopy sem to identify pyrite iron sulphides and iron oxides fig 2c these data are similar to previous mineralogical investigations that also identified smaller amounts of clays 6 9 calcite 0 8 and dolomite 0 1 and indicated the presence of iron oxide and calcitic cement link et al 1984 pyrite was identified in the field during drilling in all rock cores jakobsen 1981 also identified iron bearing accessory minerals including epidote hornblende and amphibole tremolite and actinolite therefore the physical environment of this aquifer has favorable characteristics for the abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes laboratory studies show chlorinated ethenes degrading abiotically in the presence of naturally occurring minerals such as iron sulphide fes sivavec and horney 1997 butler and hayes 1998 1999 2001 clay minerals e g smectite and montmorillonite nzengung et al 2001 pyrite weerasooriya and dharmasena 2001 magnetite lee and batchelor 2002 and iron bearing phyllosilicates lee and batchelor 2004 3 research approach the conceptual model for tce occurrence and degradation at the site includes the dissolution of tce dnapl initially present in the fractures and subsequent diffusion of dissolved tce into the porous rock matrix where nearly all of the mass is now found due to its large contaminant mass storage capacity this is described conceptually by parker et al 1994 1997 and confirmed at this site by sterling et al 2005 therefore even though groundwater velocity in the fractures is large plume fronts have not migrated far from dnapl input locations because of strong plume front retardation due to matrix diffusion parker et al 2010 chapman et al 2014 due to the nature of sedimentary rock systems and considering the importance of matrix diffusion processes a research approach was developed where samples were collected and analyzed at multiple spatial scales across the site the examination of tce degradation mechanisms is based on i a review of historical quarterly groundwater sampling results ii collection of groundwater samples from conventional monitoring wells for detailed hydrochemistry csia of contaminants sulphate and dissolved gases fig 3a iii comparison of conventional three volume purge sampling to depth discrete point samples collected from conventional wells using the snap sampler fig 3b and iv a review of existing rock core voc data collected from the site fig 3c locations of conventional monitoring wells and rock cores with voc data are shown in fig 1c the work presented in this study is based on groundwater data collected at the site from 1985 to present rock core samples collected between 1999 and 2012 and depth discrete snap sampler samples collected in 2008 groundwater samples were obtained from 122 conventional wells at the site with open interval lengths of less than approximately 30 m fig 1c groundwater samples collected from these wells using both conventional methods and depth discrete point samples represent water from multiple fractures at different scales whereas rock core samples represent depth discrete samples taken from the matrix blocks adjacent to and further away from fractures the conventional wells were sampled using large scale three volume purge where water was obtained from fractures within the capture zone of the well in contrast the depth discrete samples collected using the snap sampler represent in situ local conditions within the same conventional well and specifically the dominant high flow fractures obtaining groundwater at these two scales allowed for better representation of dissolved gas concentrations integral to understanding the extent of tce degradation within the system the multiple depth point samples from the unpurged water columns reflect the spatial variability of hydrochemistry that exists in the fracture network and matrix blocks in the formation away from the well bores this type of spatial variability is not represented by single samples collected after purging because of the blending that occurs as the water is drawn to the well from the formation and mixed in the well during pumping comparison of data from wells both large volume purge and depth discrete samples and rock core samples should therefore show strong variability with respect to evidence of tce degradation throughout the contaminated fractured sedimentary rock system 4 methods historical results from quarterly groundwater sampling starting in 1985 and continuing to present were reviewed to identify the presence of known tce degradation daughter products and to evaluate temporal concentration trends in 2003 and 2004 groundwater samples were collected from 122 conventional monitoring wells with open intervals over a depth range from 5 to 400 m fig 1b 95 wells were equipped with dedicated submersible pumps four with triloc inertial systems three with bailer systems 10 with flute systems and 10 flowing wells with spigots all samples and field measurements were taken after three well volumes were purged table 1 provides a summary of field and laboratory methods for groundwater sample analyses used in this study additional parameter specific details are provided as supplemental information continuous core for depth discrete rock core voc sampling and analyses was obtained from 20 locations from 1998 to 2008 fig 1c with a total of 7575 samples over a total core interval of 2899 m from depths ranging from 2 to 426 m bgs average sample spacing of 0 4 m rock core samples approximately 5 to 10 cm in length were collected for voc analysis at varying distances from visible fractures lithologic changes and other points along the core using a chisel and hammer then immediately trimmed crushed and preserved in the field by immersion in high purity methanol in either 125 ml clear glass volatile organic analysis voa bottles earlier samples or 40 ml voa vials later samples with screw caps and teflon lined septa sterling et al 2005 the preserved samples were placed in coolers on ice and shipped to the laboratory at the university of waterloo for voc analysis upon arrival the shake flask extraction technique was applied for 5 to 8 weeks dincutoiu et al 2003 samples were analyzed by injecting methanol directly into the gas chromatograph gc dincutoiu et al 2003 and results reported as micrograms of each contaminant per gram of wet crushed rock mass μg g conversions to porewater concentrations were made using average site derived values for porosity n 13 6 wet bulk density p bw 2 44 g cm3 and retardation factors tce 3 5 cdce 2 4 tdce 1 7 1 1 dce 1 9 estimated using literature values of koc for each chlorinated ethene pankow and cherry 1996 with site derived values for solid phase organic carbon foc 0 146 and bulk dry density p b 2 32 g cm3 hurley 2003 snap sampler samples were collected in 2008 during three sampling events from 14 monitoring wells as a subset of the 122 wells sampled in 2003 2004 the snap sampler is a passive groundwater sampling device that collects an in situ groundwater sample at a discrete depth in conventional wells britt et al 2010 the snap sampler bottles are deployed at different depths within the water column with the bottle open at both ends britt et al 2010 groundwater samples are collected by activating the trigger system to automatically seal all bottles within the water column samplers are retrieved at the surface bottles are removed end caps with septa are screwed on and the samples sent directly to the automatic sampler in the analytical laboratory without being opened or poured in addition vertical profiles of field parameters for temperature conductivity dissolved oxygen and ph were obtained from these 14 wells using a ysi 600qs multi parameter sonde at approximately 1 m intervals due to cable length limitations the sonde could only be lowered to a maximum depth of approximately 60 m 5 results and discussion 5 1 temporal and spatial analysis of groundwater voc data long term trends of decreasing voc concentrations vs time are commonly used as evidence for natural attenuation by degradation in granular aquifers usepa 1998 our study area features 167 conventional monitoring wells with long term 10 years contaminant analysis records quarterly groundwater voc concentrations from these conventional monitoring wells were examined for long term trends first the most recent tce concentration was compared to the maximum historical concentration fig 4 in nearly all wells the most recent tce concentration measured is less than the maximum historical concentration suggesting an overall decrease in groundwater tce concentrations across the site by at least an order of magnitude over the past 25 years fig 4a in contrast the most recent groundwater cdce concentration is the highest measured in 10 of the wells in other wells cdce concentrations have decreased over time consistent with tce concentration trends fig 4b which suggests a loss of mass by degradation and or dilution by diffusion into the matrix notably tce has decreased by up to four orders of magnitude whereas cdce has in general only decreased by one or two orders of magnitude inspection of records for individual wells shows that tce concentrations increase decrease fluctuate or remain nearly steady with time of the 167 wells at the site with three or more detections of tce 117 show discernable concentration trends with time 47 7 are nearly constant 36 5 are decreasing 11 2 are fluctuating and 4 7 are increasing fig 5 shows examples of these trends for selected wells and provides examples of the coinciding daughter product concentration trends over the same period for 90 of the monitoring wells daughter product concentration trends are similar to those of tce similar concentration trends over time for both parent and daughter products are evidence of matrix diffusion mechanical dispersion physical mixing in contrast the concentration of tce in 10 of the wells decreases while that of cdce increases over a limited period in granular aquifers this would constitute evidence supporting degradation of tce however increases and decreases in contaminant concentrations in fractured sedimentary rocks can occur due to matrix diffusion processes monitoring in fractured rock aquifers presents different challenges but clear trends indicative of degradation are not likely to be as evident in fractured sedimentary rock because of complexities not present in granular media plumes in granular media tend to have greater orderliness with respect to concentration distributions than those in fractured rock complicating factors or complexities inherent in the analysis of concentration trends in fractured rock pertain to the scale of the contaminant occurrence the nature of groundwater flow and contaminant transport in fractured rock including discrete fractures with variable hydraulic conditions the nature of fracture properties and matrix variability as well as the design of monitoring wells in rock relative to those in granular aquifers although the time series data cover more than a decade and as such are long relative to what exists at many sites where degradation is assessed they are short relative to the period during which contamination has existed at the site i e since the 1950s another complexity imposed on many of the monitoring wells is historical pumping of the sandstone aquifer for water supply to on site facilities largely in the 1950s 1970s this pumping was terminated in 1968 but some of the wells were put back into service from 1995 to 1998 of the wells for which long term records exist most are located within the influence of this historical pumping given all of the potential influences on the temporal trends for monitoring the fact that these trends provide no clear evidence of complete degradation is not surprising therefore at this and likely many other sedimentary fractured rock sites evidence for the extent of tce degradation must come from the analysis of water and rock core samples for the diagnostic daughter products ethene ethane and acetylene csia and characterization of the redox conditions therefore judgement concerning the extent of tce degradation and its transformation to non chlorinated compounds must be based on the information presented in subsequent sections 5 2 rock core data rock core voc concentration data from 20 coreholes located at contaminant input areas fig 1 show abundant tce and cdce as well as some tdce and 1 1 dce in the rock matrix porewater calculations of cumulative mass of tce and dce isomers from these 20 profiles show that overall approximately 80 of the mass is tce 13 is cdce 7 is 1 1 dce and 1 is tdce a 40 m section of a 170 m rock core voc concentration profile c 1 proximal to a groundwater monitoring well rd 77 near one of the many tce dnapl input areas is shown in fig 6 for comparison of depth discrete matrix porewater concentrations to a blended groundwater sample where many fractures contribute flow to the well the 40 m section presented in fig 6 corresponds to the open interval of the well approximately 150 m away the voc rock core profile expressed as μg l of porewater and plotted with groundwater voc concentration results from rd 77 illustrates the spatial variability of parent and daughter products within the rock matrix the porewater voc concentrations obtained from rock core are calculated from measured total mass concentrations and site derived rock matrix parameters as detailed in the supporting information the discrete porewater voc concentrations are higher than blended voc concentrations observed in groundwater fig 6 from well sampling which represents a mixture of water derived from many fractures at different depths with strong bias toward the most transmissive fractures when multi level monitoring systems are installed and comparisons made between the shorter groundwater sampling intervals and the rock core results the heterogeneity of the porewater voc concentrations are better reflected in the groundwater voc concentrations sterling et al 2005 the occurrence of cdce concentrations and minor occurrence of tdce in the rock samples similar in some cases to what is seen in the fracture water from monitoring wells is evidence of strong degradation of tce likely due to microbial reductive dichlorination however at certain depths in the rock porewater concentration profile e g at depths of 17 36 and 50 m bgs concentrations of 1 1 dce exceed those of cdce and tce fig 6 suggesting it is a locally abundant transformation product the occurrence of 1 1 dce is mainly attributed to the localized abiotic degradation of 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca vogel et al 1987 historically 1 1 1 tca was detected in some groundwater wells at concentrations ranging from 0 05 to 5200 μg l but not in the rock core samples two explanations are offered for this apparent inconsistency 1 the mass of 1 1 1 tca that has diffused into the matrix has undergone abiotic transformation to 1 1 dce at a higher rate than that in the fractures which is emanating from an upgradient source of tca not locally present in the rock matrix or 2 abiotic transformation of 1 1 1 tca to 1 1 dce occurred in the crushed rock samples in the time between collection and analysis the presence of 1 1 dce in 7 of the samples from 20 coreholes some located in areas where 1 1 1 tca was not used indicates tce as an alternative parent compound for 1 1 dce at the site this is supported by previous studies in which 1 1 dce was observed as a trace transformation product during the biotic degradation of tce in sulphate reducing or methanogenic conditions kastner 1991 tandoi et al 1994 maymo gatell et al 2001 also suggest cdce as the precursor to 1 1 dce in laboratory biotic microcosm studies in addition trace 1 1 dce has been observed during laboratory investigations of the abiotic degradation of tce in the presence of iron sulphide iron hydroxide and pyrite kastner 1991 jeong and hayes 2007 jeong et al 2007 he et al 2010 which are commonly present in the rock matrix fig 2 unfortunately dissolved gases indicative of further dichlorination beyond the dce isomers including vc ethene ethane and methane could not be measured by the rock core analytical methods used direct on column injection of the methanol extract into the gc coupled with micro electron capture detection was used to enhance the quantification of limits of the higher halogenated compounds e g tce without improvements to the lower chlorinated daughter products thus limiting the assessment of complete dechlorination in the rock matrix therefore the rock core data only provide evidence of the occurrence and spatial variability of parent compounds and the dce isomers that indicate various degradation pathways but cannot be used to assess the occurrence of complete reductive dechlorination 5 3 distribution of degradation products and dissolved gas in groundwater groundwater samples collected during the 2003 2004 investigation were analyzed for the known suite of tce degradation products and dissolved gases results from these samples and an examination of the monitoring well historical records indicate cdce is the dominant degradation product with lesser concentrations of tdce 1 1 dce vc and ethene cdce was present in 42 of the 122 wells sampled 34 at concentrations ranging from 2 1 to 2553 μg l 1 1 dce was detected in 17 of the wells sampled 14 ranging from 1 3 to 150 μg l and tdce was detected in 24 of the wells sampled 20 ranging from 2 3 to 107 μg l in general tce degradation appears to be stalled at cdce across most of the site this can be explained by redox conditions being variable and in some areas not reducing enough for reductive dechlorination to proceed past cdce to vc and ethene the microbes likely required for high rates of cdce reduction to ethene i e dehalococcoides are either lacking at the site or present in low numbers sulphate reducers are also possibly outcompeting the dehalococcoides for electron donors dissolved gas analysis indicates the presence of vc in samples from 12 wells at concentrations ranging from 3 5 to 74 μg l mean 21 5 μg l and ethene in samples from 11 wells ranging from 0 5 to 8 9 μg l mean 2 7 μg l these data suggest that dechlorination is proceeding past dce and vc in local zones within the system acetylene identified by others as a product of the dichloroelimination pathway for abiotic tce degradation usepa 2009 was also detected in 17 groundwater samples in concentrations ranging from the detection limit of 0 5 to 17 μg l the current literature contains no evidence of acetylene occurring naturally in groundwater and therefore its detection in this field study is taken as strong evidence of tce abiotic degradation however due to negative sampling and analysis bias for dissolved gases in general and especially for acetylene these measurements are not suitable for quantifying the extent of abiotic degradation mechanisms occurring in this system ethane has been identified as a product of both the biotic and abiotic degradation of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 he et al 2015 ethane was detected in 21 wells at concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 7 2 μg l the dissolved gas analysis likely underestimates the extent of the occurrence of vc ethene ethane and acetylene due to negative bias common in conventional purge sampling and analysis procedures britt et al 2010 blending of groundwater in long open well intervals dilutes the maximum concentration of both vocs and dissolved gases improved sampling methods for dissolved gases and vocs have since been used at the site including deployment of snap samplers to collect in situ depth discrete groundwater samples it is also important to highlight that acetylene and ethene are not conservative and can also be consumed by biodegradation bloom et al 2000 miller et al 2015 the results from the depth discrete samples obtained using the snap sampler were compared to those collected in 2003 2004 by conventional methods fig 7 each comparison figure shows results from 14 locations where both methods were applied in which one sample obtained by conventional purging and sampling methodology is compared to up to five snap samples from the same well during one sampling event providing a range of analyte concentrations vs one value from the conventional sampling approach this series of comparison plots for all wells and events shows all of the chlorinated ethene results tce cdce tdce 1 1 dce and vc with the exception of snap sampler sample concentrations below the method detection limit mdl a large range of tce concentrations i e higher concentrations for both conventional and snap sampler samples were observed relative to the other chlorinated ethenes snap sampler results show a minimum tce concentration of 1 μg l and a maximum of 9850 μg l whereas the conventional aggressive purge results range from 1 to 4100 μg l concentration data for cdce tdce and 1 1 dce from conventional and snap sampler samples were more similar in range however variability is still present minimum and maximum cdce concentrations for the snap sampler samples are 0 6 and 2420 μg l whereas for the conventional samples are 2 1 and 4900 μg l measured concentrations of dissolved gases vc and ethene are two times higher in the snap sampler samples compared to the conventional samples fig 7e f the higher concentrations for the vc and ethene measured in the snap sampler samples are expected because the snap sampler methodology avoids sample exposure to the atmosphere during sample collection as well as in the laboratory sample containers are placed into the auto sampler vials for direct injection into the gc this positive bias for dissolved gas analytes is consistently observed at chlorinated ethene contaminated sites in addition to the ssfl as reported by britt et al 2010 the data obtained from in situ sampling methods confirm and provide additional insights into the variability of degradation processes occurring at the site a conventional three volume purge sample provides a blended dataset for each well that represents a mixture of water from many fractures due to the bulk fracture porosity in fractured rock being extremely small 0 1 to 0 01 compared to granular media 25 35 the volume of water purged from a conventional well in a fractured rock system travels a larger distance to reach the well the snap sampler provides a measurement under natural groundwater flow conditions in the well and therefore the resulting data represent conditions nearer to the well at the time of sampling in addition the vertical concentration profiles obtained using the snap sampler show the variability with depth groundwater flows into the well bore from one or more dominant fractures reflecting the variable contribution of fractures with different flow rates a string of snap samplers can provide concentration profiles of parent and daughter products that can be useful in identifying higher concentration zones occurring in the well bore however the maximum concentrations shown in the snap sampler profile are likely still not the true maximum concentrations existing in the formation due to inadvertent blending of water from different fractures and not nearly as spatially resolved as the rock core data that more completely show the extent of the spatial variability if the goal of sampling is to obtain contaminant concentrations most representative of what would occur in a water supply well for use in risk assessment concerning drinking water then purge sampling from similarly completed monitoring wells is warranted however if the goal is to obtain results providing more insights concerning the occurrence and variability of in situ degradation processes to assess prospects for natural attenuation or how and where to enhance remediation then point profiles have more value the application of the snap sampler at ssfl shows a greater range of voc and dissolved gas concentrations compared to the conventional well sampling results more similar to the rock core voc data further confirming local areas of complete dechlorination 5 4 redox parameters groundwater samples from conventional wells indicate dissolved oxygen is low across the site except at a few shallow locations and the subsurface environment is predominantly moderately to strongly reducing as indicated by the common presence of dissolved iron methane and dissolved hydrogen fig 8b detectable nitrate no3 is rare as expected due to the lack of nitrate sources substantial sulphate so4 2 occurs in all wells 30 to 300 mg l and stable sulphur isotope data δ34s show sulphate is derived from the oxidation of sulphide minerals furthermore a trend toward more enriched δ34s values correlated with decreasing sulphate concentrations indicates sulphate reduction influences these concentrations at some locations fig 8a no trends in redox state with depth are evident suggesting that the processes governing the redox state of the groundwater are spatially variable throughout the system the observed redox conditions are compatible with the suite of degradation products cdce to ethene present at the site and as reported for microbial reductive dechlorination in granular aquifers chapelle 2001 a comparison of the redox parameter concentrations from both snap sampler and conventional three volume purge sampling is shown in fig 9 nitrate concentrations below 0 5 mg l are found in nine of the 14 wells sampled with the low levels related to the lack of nitrate sources at the site total dissolved manganese was detected in only three of the 14 wells at concentrations exceeding 1 mg l the generally low manganese concentrations indicate conditions favorable for manganese reduction chapelle 2001 total dissolved iron concentrations 0 5 mg l are found in 13 out of the 14 wells sampled due to low oxygen total iron is expected to be mainly ferrous iron and therefore these concentrations indicate iron reducing conditions chapelle 2001 methane detected by conventional methods ranged from 0 3 to 204 μg l whereas methane detected in the snap sampler samples ranged from 0 6 to 333 μg l both sampling methods yielded methane concentrations that provide evidence of methanogenesis which is a favorable condition for microbial reductive dechlorination of tce chapelle 2001 in general the redox indicators from both conventional and snap sampler samples indicate iron reducing conditions are predominant across the site with local zones of manganese and sulphate reducing conditions as well as methanogenesis perhaps enhancing the heterogeneity of voc concentrations observed in the rock matrix overall the redox data show favorable conditions for both biotic and abiotic degradation of tce at the site 5 5 compound specific isotope analysis compound specific stable carbon isotope analysis a widely accepted method that provides definitive evidence of tce degradation and the fate of its degradation products in groundwater aelion et al 2010 was used to confirm the extent of tce degradation at the site the stable carbon isotope ratio δ13c for tce and cdce was measured in 25 and 15 conventional groundwater samples respectively δ13c values for tce across the site range from 30 5 to 11 8 no dnapl sample could be analyzed however δ13c results for tce in areas near potential tce sources range from 31 9 to 27 4 and agree with known values for manufactured tce products shouakar stash et al 2003 the isotope data similar to the voc and geochemical data are highly spatially variable at the site for example results from the northeast of the site show the expected pattern for biodegradation of tce i e more depleted δ13c values are observed in areas of higher tce concentration and more enriched δ13c values are observed in areas with lower tce concentrations fig 10a in contrast the reverse is observed in an area to the southeast fig 10b with more enriched δ13c values observed in the high concentration areas the degree of isotopic fractionation during biodegradation is a function of the fractionation factor and the initial mass of the compound sherwood lollar et al 1999 the higher 13c enrichment observed in high concentration areas in the southeast is an indication of a greater degree of biodegradation of tce and that the initial tce mass in the southeast area was much higher than in the northeast this conclusion is supported by the high concentration of cdce observed in the southeast where the δ13c signatures of tce tend to be more enriched despite the relatively high concentration fig 10b a common pattern in field studies conducted in granular aquifers is decreasing parent product concentrations with a trend toward more enriched δ13c values in conjunction with increasing daughter product concentrations slater et al 2001 bloom et al 2000 the δ13c enrichment patterns observed for tce in both areas at this field site relative to the manufactured tce values indicate degradation is occurring within the fractured sandstone aquifer regardless of the concentration data trends the apparent lack of correspondence between the concentration and isotope composition is likely due to the complexity of these dual porosity systems where groundwater flow is heterogeneous and groundwater in fractures and porewater in the matrix represent different geochemical regimes captured in groundwater samples during purging the δ13c signatures of cdce range from 27 1 to 20 8 and in all areas the cdce δ13c values tend to be more depleted than the δ13c values for tce as shown in fig 10 for the northeast and southeast areas of the site these results indicate the cdce has not been substantially affected by further degradation the exceptions are three areas where the cdce is similarly enriched or more enriched in 13c than the tce in these cases the cdce concentrations exceed or are similar to those of tce and in some cases vc and ethene are also present in the groundwater this is a clear indication of biodegradation proceeding beyond cdce these reflect typical patterns for biotic transformation of chlorinated ethenes hunkeler and aravena 2009 csia data collected from snap sampler samples show a similar pattern to those presented for the northeast portion of the site fig 10a fig 11 shows that the δ13c value of tce becomes more enriched as the fraction of tce decreases and reaches 10 8 when the remaining tce concentration presented as mole fraction percentage is around 18 of the original tce it is important to highlight that biotic and abiotic degradation can cause an isotopic enrichment trend associated with a decrease in tce concentration the role of both processes can be examined by plotting the data using the theoretical fractionation curves for microbial reductive dichlorination and abiotic reactions as a framework as shown in fig 11 for microbial reductive dechlorination of tce measured laboratory enrichment factors ε based on a series of laboratory studies and summarized in aelion et al 2010 range from 2 5 to 18 5 the theoretical fractionation curves for the minimum and maximum enrichment factors for microbial reductive dichlorination are plotted with the snap sampler results and compared to theoretical fractionation curves for abiotic reactions in fig 11 recent abiotic degradation experiments for tce in the presence of sulphide minerals show the carbon isotopic enrichment factor for this process is approximately 30 liang et al 2007 which is much larger than the values reported for biodegradation of tce a similar value of 39 has been obtained for abiotic degradation of tce in the presence of magnetite usepa 2009 the resulting theoretical fractionation curves show that much more enriched δ13c values should be observed for tce if abiotic degradation is a dominant process fig 11 the δ13c data analyzed from the snap sampler samples when plotted with the mole fraction of tce fall in the range expected for microbial reductive dichlorination rather than abiotic processes fig 11 due to the nature of groundwater sampling in fractured rock systems the samples represent a blend of groundwater from different depths dominated by few high flow fractures i e the samples do not represent the contaminant mass present within the monitoring interval because mass concentrations and transmissivity distributions are both heterogeneous and not correlated the groundwater and rock matrix concentrations of cdce vc ethene acetylene and ethane provide strong evidence that abiotic processes are occurring mostly likely in the low permeability rock matrix however the microbial processes remain the dominant processes responsible for the degradation of tce at the site this conclusion based on the isotope data agrees with a microcosm study using 14c labeled tce and chatsworth formation rock and groundwater that showed cdce is the main biodegradation product of tce and that abiotic reactions are responsible for 20 of the tce degradation in the laboratory darlington et al 2008 therefore the δ13c signature associated with this amount of abiotic degradation would likely not be reflected in the csia results from groundwater samples consistent with observations 5 6 summary of degradation processes both rock matrix and groundwater samples indicate the occurrence of biotic and abiotic degradation processes which is consistent with the dual porosity nature of the fractured porous sandstone the dominant degradation product in both the rock matrix and groundwater is cdce the csia and redox parameters which could only be determined on groundwater samples at the time of this study suggest microbial reductive dichlorination of tce to cdce is the dominant degradation process at the site rock core data indicate this process is likely occurring in the rock matrix where contaminant residence times are large higher quality concentration data from point in situ sampling methods used in the water column of open bore wells suggest the local occurrence of complete dichlorination to ethene and ethane the presence of acetylene in groundwater samples confirms the occurrence of abiotic processes likely occurring in the presence of iron sulphides iron oxhydroxides and biotite the nature of contaminant transport in fractured sedimentary rock is controlled by matrix diffusion which allows for long contact time with reactive minerals and sorption to organic carbon with large surface area to facilitate reactions within the matrix 6 conceptualization of site processes using dfn m transport model and site parameters the conceptual model for tce occurrence and degradation at the site includes the dissolution of tce dnapl initially present only in the fractures in the source zone and subsequent diffusion of dissolved tce from this dnapl into the porous rock matrix where nearly all voc mass is now found within and close to the initial source zone this model is described conceptually by parker et al 1994 1997 for the generic case and confirmed at the ssfl site by sterling et al 2005 and additional rock core analyses presented in this study groundwater flowing through the short lived dnapl zone creates a plume in the down flow direction with active transport occurring in the fracture network while diffusion transfers mass into the nearly immobile volume of water in the rock matrix where sorption and reactions can occur after the dnapl has disappeared due to dissolution in fractures and diffusion driven mass transfer to the rock matrix the initial zone where dnapl occurred and the plume have the same features in that all of the mass occurs in the dissolved and sorbed phases with the majority in the rock matrix the combination of these processes results in a plume originating at each dnapl input location and even after decades of migration not extending very far downgradient this is consistent with the map of groundwater contamination at the site that shows all plumes remaining within or proximal to the site property boundary fig 1c comprehensive sampling of the many seeps along the mountain slopes fig 1b has shown no off site detection of tce pierce et al 2018 these results indicate no plume arrivals at these groundwater discharge locations due to the combined effect of four primary natural attenuation processes matrix diffusion sorption dispersion and degradation of these processes only degradation results in mass reduction while the others result in mass redistribution all four together contribute to the bulk retardation effect where plumes have not migrated far from their source zones even after decades of transport with rapid groundwater velocities in the fractures freeze and cherry 1979 the relative contribution of each of these attenuation processes can be assessed by means of mathematical simulations of plume evolution the conceptualization of plume evolution over long periods of time was shown by parker et al 2010 based on transport simulations for a generic case but similar to our study site parameters these simulations were also done using the two dimensional numerical model fractran described by sudicky and mclaren 1992 for steady groundwater flow and transient solute transport in discrete fracture networks the model rigorously simulates advective dispersive groundwater flow and solute transport in both the fractures and rock matrix and interactions between these environments i e diffusive exchange linear sorption on fracture surfaces and in the rock matrix can be incorporated degradation is included in simulations as first order decay occurring in both the fractures and the rock matrix similar simulations to those reported in parker et al 2010 using fractran with fracture and matrix parameters specific to this study site are presented herein the simulated domain is a rectangular vertical slice of the upland with a fixed duration dnapl source assigned along the upgradient boundary with steady flow created across the domain and both vertical and horizontal components of hydraulic gradient due to the upland recharge conditions at the site and recreated by the assigned boundary conditions fig 12 the rock matrix parameters assigned to the model domain were selected to represent in a generalized manner the conditions in the chatsworth formation at the study site using average values from hundreds of measurements from depth discrete samples focused on the sandstone lithology which makes up the bulk of the chatsworth formation in these simulations the following matrix parameters for sandstone were used matrix porosity ϕm 13 linear matrix retardation factor rm 2 0 and matrix hydraulic conductivity km 1 10 8 m s similarly fracture network parameters were also informed by site data for example the fracture aperture distribution is based on many values of hydraulic aperture obtained using the cubic law and derived from hydraulic tests in boreholes as described by quinn et al 2011 and transmissivity profiling as described by keller et al 2014 fracture spacing is assessed from core observations as well as geophysical logs such as acoustic televiewer or atv and other hydrophysical tests e g pehme et al 2013 in these model simulations the fracture apertures are log normally distributed with a mean of 0 7 10 4 m 70 μm and variance of log aperture of 0 3 m2 the assigned fracture network is orthogonal which is reasonable for such sedimentary sequences dominated by bedding plane fractures and near vertical joints based on the assigned statistics for the fracture network aperture distribution fracture density and fracture length ranges fracture network realizations were produced for randomly generated fracture networks the steady state flow simulations produced for each realization yield a calculated bulk hydraulic conductivity kb for flow through the model domain which is assessed for consistency with the estimated bulk transmissivity obtained from nearby long term pumping tests allègre et al 2016 and other site derived datasets this represents an independent check on the reasonableness of the fracture network properties fracture network density and range of fracture lengths which cannot be measured directly were varied to produce model generated fracture network realizations with a target kb within the field range kb 3 10 7 m s flow is allowed in both the fractures and the matrix however the effects of matrix flow are likely small compared to rates of diffusion in the rock matrix given the low measured matrix hydraulic conductivity of field rock core samples from boreholes a similarly low value was applied in the model such that the km is a factor of 30 lower than the kb in the simulations however due to heterogeneity matrix flow may play a role in addition to diffusion for matrix transport in some layers for example applying km 1 10 8 m s ϕm 13 and an average hydraulic gradient i of 0 01 provides a matrix flow velocity of 0 024 m year furthermore the model kb and fracture density values for these simulations were selected from the lower end of the range for these field derived paramaters which keeps the simulated plumes within the model domain over the time periods of interest while model simulations were informed by field parameter measurements we refer to these simulations as stylistic they are not intended to match exact conditions at any specific position within the plume but rather bulk plume behavior approximate plume position in both the transverse vertical and longitudinal directions observed at the field site were used to inform the conceptual model for long term contaminant behavior at the site as such these simulations conceptually illustrate the key processes and effects on plume transport and fate for conditions reasonable for the site fig 13a shows the simulated distribution of tce contamination from a constant source after 10 50 and 100 years without degradation which would represent worst case conditions the positions of the plume fronts for tce at the three different times are 350 m from the dnapl source and strongly retarded relative to the groundwater travel distances based on average linear groundwater velocities estimated from fracture porosity values and assuming all groundwater flow occurs through the interconnected fracture network fig 13b shows the distribution of tce after adding the effects of first order degradation in both the fractures and the matrix for the same time periods lima et al 2012 show the presence of microbial communities in the rock matrix of cambrian sandstone in wisconsin united states supporting the possibility of microbial degradation in the matrix at ssfl notice that the long half life of 20 years has little effect on plume front and internal plume concentrations in the 10 and 50 year scenarios but a strong influence after 100 years of transport the dfn m numerical model of the site conditions informed by site parameters for fracture and matrix properties processes simulates the non linear effects of the multiple processes on bulk plume behavior it shows the importance of matrix diffusion enhanced by sorption in the early decades 0 to 50 years after contamination began and a transition to when the plume is nearly steady in position but a few degradation half lives dramatically impact plume position and internal concentrations after 50 years fig 13b due to a paucity of field data many professionals have speculated that microbial degradation believed to be the most significant in the subsurface until recent years would only occur in the fractures due to microbe sizes and pore exclusion effects and access to substrates to sustain activity hence we simulate the outcome for degradation in fractures alone versus degradation occurring in both fractures and within the matrix fig 13c shows that degradation only occurring in the fractures has little impact on the plume position or internal concentrations compared to the no degradation scenario fig 13a this is expected given the low bulk fracture porosity ϕf of about 5 10 5 compared to the matrix porosity of 0 13 so that orders of magnitude more contaminant mass occurs in the matrix where storage is further enhanced by sorption fig 14 shows sensitivity to the degradation rate using half lives of 20 10 and 5 years in comparison to the no degradation scenario for cases with constant persistent dnapl and finite dnapl disappearance sources the latter is the expected condition given expectations for dnapl disappearance from fractures due to dissolution in groundwater flowing in fractures combined with matrix diffusion processes parker et al 1994 1997 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 these simulations further illustrate concepts related to diffusion and degradation in and out of the matrix in a fractured porous medium without degradation plume front transport rates slow significantly within the first few decades but the plume continues to advance in later decades albeit at very slow rates of a few meters per year and declining with degradation and a constant source the plume achieves a steady position within about 20 to 100 years achieving this state more rapidly with a shorter half life with a finite duration source and degradation the plume reaches a maximum extent and then retreats which is evident in these simulations for scenarios with 5 and 10 year half lives but not for the 20 year half live scenario where it would take longer than 100 years to observe such retreat for a 20 year dnapl source declines in internal plume concentrations are also evident in scenarios with a finite source and degradation we have presented numerous lines of evidence for biotic and abiotic degradation within the system and by deduction shown the likelihood of this occurring in the matrix this is due to the long residence times for mass in the lower permeability zones where organic carbon dominated sorption and reaction with iron bearing minerals with large surface area and low redox conditions can provide conditions appropriate for supporting degradation reactions the occurrence of degradation is confirmed by the measured shifts in carbon isotopes as well as the occurrence of degradation products and dissolved gases these simulations demonstrate that even very low degradation half lives i e 5 to 20 years which are slower than the extreme low end of values reported in the literature for tce in sandy aquifers are effective in reducing plume mass and retarding plume fronts in fractured porous media after the plume has expanded sufficiently such that the surface area for diffusion allows the overall plume to have substantially slowed 0 to 50 years this stage of the plume conditions then allows the degradation rate to show a measurable effect in future decades 50 to 100 year time frames although the groundwater monitoring data over 30 years from conventional wells mid 1980s to the present support the very low half life estimates the lack of continual inputs to the subsurface and possible acclimation of microbial communities to chlorinated ethenes might result in increased degradation half lives in the future alternatively the assignment of multiple degradation rates for multiple ongoing processes might be useful for evaluating the prospects and timescales for in situ attenuation and complete remediation at these sites this work simply shows the prospects for quantitative process evaluations informed by site measurements to advance this one would continue to monitor groundwater concentrations of the suite of contaminants and degradation products isotopes and hydrochemical conditions including microbial community activity with rna and dna methods that continually improve our diagnostic capabilities one thing is clear 5 to 20 year half lives are inordinately long and unlikely to be observed in laboratory experiments but have marked impact on field scale plume behavior over long time periods therefore attention must be paid to collecting appropriately resolved field datasets to inform actual site conditions relevant processes and rates the simulations presented to this point have been limited to the parent contaminant position with time however the toxic nature of the chlorinated degradation products make knowledge of the distribution of the decay products based on their properties and individual degradation rates important an initial evaluation of the multiple species transport emanating from tce transport with reductive dechlorination to cdce to vc to ethene is shown in fig 15 using the same matrix and fracture network conditions for the fractran model but using the hydrogeosphere hgs model therrien and sudicky 1996 therrien et al 2005 this model allows the use of fractran generated fracture networks but includes the additional capability to allow the simultaneous evolution of chain decay contaminants each constituent is expected to have its own half life consistent with observations in sandy aquifers approximate values have been assigned in a manner aligned with that observed in the literature for granular aquifers but scaled for the slower degradation rate observed for tce at the site these results strongly illustrate the value of a detailed site characterization to inform the processes in both the fractures and the matrix and how these combined mechanisms create a time evolution of plume conditions that is only possible to interpret with the use of these dfn m models future challenges in these simulations exist given the need for 3 d dfn m simulations and multiple reaction processes with individual half lives or reaction orders and parameters and the associated computational demands the current models are sufficiently robust to advance our interpretation and intuition for how these processes affect plume conditions however numerical models with improved capabilities to represent these processes are needed to better represent the site complexity and provide improved prediction qualities for the profession the observed behavior of plumes in fractured porous sandstone with and without the inclusion of degradation with a long half life is much different than the behavior of plumes for tce in granular aquifers most notable is the importance of a long half life in fractured porous rock where diffusion into the matrix controls plume behavior in the first few decades slowing down the rate of plume front advancement to the point that eventually within 50 years or less for the site in our study the plume migrates so slowly that even very slow degradation half lives have a noticeable impact on plume conditions into the future such extremely low rates of degradation would be inconsequential in sandy aquifers where transverse dispersion effects on bulk plume behavior are much smaller and therefore much more rapid rates of degradation are required to have a measurable effect 7 conclusions this paper describes the presence of abundant tce and degradation products in two components of a fractured rock system groundwater in the fractures represented by sampling of monitor wells and the porous but lower permeability rock matrix represented by rock core analyses the presence of tce degradation products in the rock core does not on its own indicate degradation preferentially in the rock matrix because diffusion continually results in chemical mass transfer between the matrix and the fractures however consideration of the matrix porewater volume available surface area mineralogy organic carbon content and contact time in the matrix suggests that biotic and abiotic processes operating in the rock matrix are most influential on bulk plume behavior as illustrated by the numerical simulations laboratory methods existing at the time of the study were not capable of reliable analysis of dissolved or free gas analysis in rock core samples for quantifying the diagnostic degradation products ethane ethane acetylene and redox parameters in the matrix however the matrix provides a large surface area and long contact times with iron bearing minerals favorable for some degree of abiotic degradation as documented by others the matrix has abundant solid phase organic matter and a search for the presence of microbes in the matrix that are diagnostic of reductive dichlorination at this site is the subject of ongoing research the multiple datasets used in this study clearly provide evidence that both abiotic and biotic degradation are occurring but to varying degrees as much heterogeneity in parent and transformation products was observed the occurrence of abiotic degradation is likely sporadic and even more heterogeneous given the rock core voc data and dissolved gas concentrations in groundwater biotic degradation dominates according to the csia results where the δ13c signature for microbial reductive dichlorination is shown in samples derived from monitoring wells and the transmissive fractures dfn m transport modeling using site informed parameters indicates that biotic and or abiotic reactions operating in the matrix at extremely slow rates might be sufficient to contribute substantially to plume front retardation and internal plume attenuation after the source zone and the plume have evolved resulting in plumes that are stationary or retreating after five or more decades the use of the down hole snap sampler deployed at a few depths in each long open well bore produced stronger evidence of complete dechlorination than conventional purging and sampling at surface the snap sampler should be used in future studies at this and other sites seeking better detection of dissolved gas concentrations such as ethene ethane methane and acetylene the latter being diagnostic of abiotic dichlorination even when found at extremely low concentrations the field evidence from this study favors some degree of complete dechlorination in the rock matrix by a combination of biotic and abiotic pathways consistent with crushed rock microcosm experiments reported in the literature however these processes operate with much spatial heterogeneity very slow degradation rates are expected to be sufficient to cause the current delineated contaminated zones i e plumes to remain stationary and most likely shrink in future decades over a very long time likely centuries naturally occurring degradation of the chlorinated solvent contaminants will allow this sandstone aquifer to return to an uncontaminated state the time and distance scales for a plume to become stationary are dependent on rock matrix properties fracture network properties and the flow regime in the fracture network and degradation rates along with subsurface source zone conditions the latter is the most difficult to characterize especially without a combination of high resolution sampling and measurement methods for the low permeability zones however for slow degradation rates to be effective in plume attenuation a high percentage of the contaminant mass must reside in the rock matrix due to diffusion such slow degradation rates would be considered inconsequential in granular aquifers recognizing that the magnitude of the relevant processes and the nature of their interaction in sedimentary rock aquifers are distinctly different in their ultimate effect on plumes is important this points to the need for different strategies and

1667,identification of the original groundwater types present in geochemical mixtures observed in an aquifer is a challenging but very important task frequently some of the groundwater types are related to different infiltration and or contamination sources associated with various geochemical signatures and origins the characterization of groundwater mixing processes typically requires solving complex inverse models representing groundwater flow and geochemical transport in the aquifer where the inverse analysis accounts for available site data usually the model is calibrated against the available data characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of the observed geochemical types numerous different geochemical constituents and processes may need to be simulated in these models which further complicates the analyses in this paper we propose a new contaminant source identification approach that performs decomposition of the observation mixtures based on non negative matrix factorization nmf method for blind source separation bss coupled with a custom semi supervised clustering algorithm our methodology called nmfk is capable of identifying a the unknown number of groundwater types and b the original geochemical concentration of the contaminant sources from measured geochemical mixtures with unknown mixing ratios without any additional site information nmfk is tested on synthetic and real world site data the nmfk algorithm works with geochemical data represented in the form of concentrations ratios of two constituents for example isotope ratios and delta notations standard normalized stable isotope ratios keywords non negative matrix factorization feature extraction blind source separation robustness analysis semi supervised learning groundwater contamination source identification advection diffusion transport geochemical signatures 1 introduction for several decades one of the most important research and real world applications in the hydrogeological sciences has been related to aquifer contamination fetter and fetter 1999 gelhar 1993 vengosh et al 2014 the work has been driven by substantial scientific and engineering challenges associated with prediction and remediation of contaminant plumes in natural environment most of these challenges are due to uncertainties associated with contaminant sources for example the number of contaminant sources their location and geochemical signatures are frequently unknown typically water in an aquifer is a mixture of different groundwater types with different origins and geochemical signatures deutsch and siegel 1997 for example groundwater might be originating from different recharge sources with contrasting geochemical properties also groundwater may have been flowing through different rock types which may have altered the composition by means of geochemical reactions and ion exchanges furthermore some of the groundwater recharge sources might be associated with contamination sources with different geochemical signatures data about the groundwater mixtures are typically collected at multiple sampling locations over time where the measurement data are also associated with uncertainties and measurement errors identification of the original groundwater types representing geochemical mixtures observed in a aquifer is a challenging but very important task wagner 1992 böhlke and denver 1995 lapworth et al 2012 this task is typically performed using complex inverse models representing groundwater mixing processes in the aquifer where the model is calibrated against the available observation data characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of the observed geochemical data wagner 1992 neupauer et al 2000 atmadja and bagtzoglou 2001

to be simulated in these models which further complicates the analyses contemporary analyses of groundwater contamination sources are also performed implementing various multivariate statistical and machine learning techniques chan and huang 2003 rasekh and brumbelow 2012 thus variations in chemical compositions and evolution of groundwater composition have been studied by methods used to describe variability among correlated variables knudson et al 1977 helena et al 2000 such as factor analysis harman 1976 and principle component analysis jolliffe 2002 as well as by unsupervised machine learning methods used to characterize or separate two or more classes of objects shrestha and kazama 2007 tariq et al 2008 such as discriminant analysis scholkopft and mullert 1999 and clustering analysis diday and simon 1980 determination of the average regional concentrations of heavy metals based on surveys of soil contamination has been also investigated by principle component analysis and cluster analysis facchinelli et al 2001 combined with a geostatistical method chiles and delfiner 2009 used to construct regional distribution maps for comparison with regional databases various supervised machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks yegnanarayana 2009 support vector machines drucker et al 1999 locally weighted projection regression vijayakumar and schaal 2000 and relevance vector machines tipping 2001 etc have been also utilized to build surrogates models based on observational data for substitution of the much more complex and time consuming physical models used to simulate the contamination levels such surrogate models have been used to predict contaminant levels in regional groundwater sites khalil et al 2005 the relationship among different chemical pollutants retrieved from in situ measurements of underground and surface water have been investigated by an algorithm for quasi optimal learning cervone et al 2010 that explores a methodology for symbolic machine learning classification by this method it has been shown for example that if one type of contaminant is dissolved in the water table it has to be expected that other chemicals are also present manca and cervone 2013 in this paper we utilize a new hybrid approach which we call nmfk for identification of contaminant sources in an aquifer nmfk utilizes a blind source separation bss technique belouchrani et al 1997 based on non negative non negative matrix factorization nmf lee and seung 1999 combined with a custom made semi supervised k means clustering algorithm alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 to unmix the geochemical signatures in the observations and identify the contaminant sources using synthetic and real world site data we demonstrate that nmfk is capable of accurately determining the unknown number of contaminant sources from observation samples of their mixtures without any additional information the nmfk methodology is coded in julia bezanson et al 2012 and the code is available upon request the nmfk algorithm works with geochemical data represented in the form of concentrations ratios of two constituents for example isotope ratios and delta notations standard normalized stable isotope ratios frequently at the contamination sites the groundwater in the aquifer is a mixture of waters with different origins sources that are commingled in the aquifer several of these groundwater recharge sources might include contaminants typically all these sources will have different geochemical signatures due to differences in their origins and flowpaths through the subsurface before infiltrating in the aquifer the identification of the contamination infiltration sources causing the observed geochemical concentrations in the aquifer can be very challenging at sites where complex physical and chemical processes occur source identification can be complicated because 1 some of these sources may have similar geochemical signatures 2 some of the sources may geochemically interfere with each other and 3 groundwater transport through the subsurface from the entry point at the ground surface to the observation point in the aquifer may be impacted by various physical and chemical processes e g diffusion dispersion sorption retardation precipitation etc and precipitation to address all these issues the source characterization is often carried out by calibrating a numerical model that simulates these complexities against the observed geochemical data here we apply an alternative approach based on a novel model free machine learning algorithm for blind source separation bss 2 blind source separation bss the main goal of the paper is to present a novel application of the bss methodology based on nmfk algorithm presented in alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 additionally substantial changes and extensions of the original nmfk algorithm are reported in order for nmfk to be applicable for contaminant source identification based on geochemical observations as discussed below we assume that the geochemical observations are taken at several discrete detectors sampling points typically monitoring wells dispersed in space the algorithm does not require the data to account for transients in the case of transient data nmfk can be applied consecutively to representative time snapshots which will account for changes and evolution of the mixing ratios of the detected groundwater types when there are multiple contamination sources in the aquifer each detector registers a mixture of contamination fields originating from different sources release locations our objective is to identify the unknown number of original contamination sources which necessitates decomposing the recorded mixtures to their original components consistent with the bss methodology belouchrani et al 1997 the contaminant source identification problem addressed here can be formulated as following 1 v w h ϵ where v is a matrix v m n m r of the known observation data representing m geochemical constituents detected at a set of n detectors monitoring wells the v matrix does not need to be a full matrix and there can be empty entries where not all the geochemical constituents are observed at all the wells w is an unknown source mixing matrix w m n k r representing the mixing coefficients of k unknown original groundwater types at each of the n observation points note that in this formulation the sum of the mixing coefficients for each observation point should add to one j 1 k w i j 1 for each well i and all the mixing coefficient should be between 0 and 1 i e 0 w i j 1 these requirements come from the problem setup the groundwater concentrations at each well are expected to be defined by mixing of all the sources and there are no expectations to have negative source contributions h is the unknown source matrix h m d m r representing the m geochemical concentrations for each k unknown original sources the matrix elements of v w and h are expected to be positive which is consistent with the analyzed problem concentrations cannot be negative ϵ denotes presence of unknown noise or unbiased errors in the measurements ϵ v m ℝ if there are transients in the observed data the bss problem formulated above can be solved for a sequence of temporally discretized snapshots in this case the matrices v w and h will be time dependent in the discrete case the bss analyses will solve for k h t and w t based on a series of inputs v t where t 1 t and t is number discretized moments in time at which the signals are recorded at the detectors this is also consistent with the data acquisition strategies typically used at an actual contamination site where the geochemical data are collected on annual or quarterly basis the joint analyses of the transients will increase the dimensionality of the data requiring factorization of tensors not matrices as presented in eq 2 cf cichocki et al 2009 however currently there are no tensor based methods that can be applied to solve the multi dimensional geochemical mixing problems since both factors h and w are unknown the size k of these matrices is also unknown because we do not know how many sources have been mixed in each detector record the main difficulty in solving a bss problem is that it is under determined there are two widely used approaches to resolve this bss underdetermination independent component analysis ica amari et al 1996 herault and jutten 1986 and non negative matrix factorization nmf lee and seung 1999 paatero and tapper 1994 ica presupposes a statistical independence of the original signals and thus aims to maximize the non gaussian characteristics of the estimated sources in h the other approach nmf is an unsupervised learning method created for parts based representation fischler and elschlager 1973 in the field of image recognition lee and seung 1999 paatero and tapper 1994 that was successfully leveraged for decomposition of mixtures formed by various types of signals cichocki et al 2009 in contrast to ica nmf does not seek statistical independence or constrain any other statistical properties i e nmf allows the original sources to be correlated instead nmf enforces a non negativity constraint on the original signals in h and their mixing components in w nmf can successfully decompose large sets of non negative observations v by leveraging the multiplicative update algorithm lee and seung 1999 however nmf requires a priori knowledge of the number of the original sources recently we reported a methodology called nmfk alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 where the coupling of the original multiplicative algorithm with a custom semi supervised clustering enables it to identify the number of the unknown sources based on the robustness of the solutions here by imposing additional to non negativity constraints to the elements of the mixing matrix and applying a nonconvex non convex nonlinear minimization algorithm we extend nmfk to be applicable for the contaminant source identification based on geochemical signatures in groundwater samples representative of contamination sites the extended nmfk methodology is also applicable for any other situation where the contributions of the original signals in the observed mixtures have to add to 1 due to additional physical constraints 3 methodology 3 1 nmf algorithm in a typical nmf problem the observational data v is formed by a linear mixing of k unknown original signals h blended by an also unknown mixing matrix w i e 2 v n m i 1 k w n k h k m ϵ subject to the following constraints 3 w n d 0 h d m 0 n d m here ϵ is a vector and denotes presence of possible noise or unbiased errors in the measurements also unknown if the problem is solved in a temporally discretized framework the goal of the bss algorithm is to retrieve the k original signals h that have produced n observational mixtures of these signals v recorded at a set of observation points sensors here n is the number of the sensors k is the number of the unknown signals sources observed in the collected data v and m is the number of observed geochemical constituents associated at the observation points the algorithm returns the decomposition through the mixing matrix w n d and source matrix h d m with ϵ being the residual noise the rows in v correspond to the number of sensors while the rows of h correspond to the number of sources in the nmfusually usually the number of sensors has to be greater than the number of sources for nmf to work the problem must be amenable to a non negativity constraint on the sources h and mixing matrix w this constrain leads to reconstruction of the observations the rows of matrix v as linear combinations of the elements of h and w that cannot cancel mutually the nmf algorithm starts with a random guess for h and w and proceeds by minimizing the cost objective function o which in our case is the frobenius norm 4 o 1 2 v w h f 2 1 2 n m v n m k 1 d w n k h k m 2 during each iteration minimizing the frobenius norm eq 4 with non negativity constraints eq 3 is equivalent to representing the discrepancies between the observations v and the reconstruction w h as white noise furthermore to find the contaminant sources geochemical types represented in the observed geochemical mixtures here we have to minimize o with the additional constraints 5 k 1 d w n k 1 n it is important to note that because of the constraints in eq 5 the classical multiplicative nmf optimization algorithm lee and seung 1999 is not applicable instead a non convex nonlinear optimization algorithm is needed and for this purpose we utilized the nonlinear minimization procedure provided by julia packages jump jl and ipopt jl jump jl is a modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in julia dunning et al 2015 it supports a number of open source and commercial solvers for a variety of optimization problems here jump jl is applied for nonlinear programming using ipopt jl ipopt interior point optimizer is an open software package for large scale nonlinear optimization wächter 2002 wächter and biegler 2005 2006 here ipopt is applied to perform non convex constrained second order minimization 3 2 nmfk algorithm if we knew the number of sources the first step described in the previous section would be all that is needed from the best solution of the minimization procedure with known k we would extract the desired estimates of the physical parameters and thus solve the inverse problem unfortunately the true number of sources is typically unknown and thus the number of the sources is an unknown parameter which we have to identified from the observations further the solutions of eq 2 is based on random initial conditions a naive approach would be to explore all of the possible solutions applying the nonlinear minimization described in the previous section for a range of possible number of sources then the solution with the smallest norm will identify the number of sources k s however this is obviously flawed approach the over fitting will certainly lead to an over estimation of the number of sources more free parameters will generally lead to a better fit irrespective of how close the estimated number of sources is to the real one the classical nmf also requires a priory priori knowledge of the number of the original sources previously by coupling the nmf with a custom semi supervised clustering we have demonstrated that the number of the original sources can be estimated based on their robustness reproducibility alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 this approach was introduced to decompose the largest available dataset of human cancer genomes alexandrov et al 2013 and then extended for decomposition of physical signals transients alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 specifically our methodology called nmfk explores consecutively all possible numbers of original sources k ranging from 1 to d k 1 2 d and then estimates the accuracy and robustness of large set of solutions with different number of sources in nmfk the maximum number of explored sources d is user defined and it is not expected to exceed the number of observed geochemical components or the number of observation points although theoretically the used here minimization algorithm can be applied for any k 1 thus nmfk performs m sets of simulations called nmf runs where each run is using different number of sources k 1 2 d with random initial conditions at the end of each nmf run we get a set of m solutions u k where each solution contains two matrices h k j w k j for k original sources and j 1 2 m 6 u k h k 1 w k 1 h k 2 w k 2 h k m w k m after that nmfk leverages a custom semi supervised clustering to assign each of these m solutions in a given set u d to one of k specific clusters this custom semi supervised method is based on k means clustering that keeps the number of solutions in each cluster equal to the number of nmf runs for example for the case with k 2 after the execution of m 1000 nmf runs performed with random initial guesses for the w and h matrix elements each of the two clusters will contain 1 000 1000 solutions note that we have to enforce the condition that the clusters are with equal number of solutions since each nmf simulation contributes equal number of solutions for each source during the clustering the similarity between sources h i1 and h i2 is measured using the cosine distance also known as cosine similarity pang ning et al 2006 alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 the main idea for estimating the unknown number of sources in nmfk is to use the separation between the clusters as a measure of how good a particular choice of k is as an accurate estimate of the number of unknown sources we estimate the degree of clustering for different number of sources and plot it as a function of k we expect a sharp drop after we cross the k s value alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 to quantify this behavior after the clustering we compute the average silhouette width rousseeuw 1987 s k which is a measure of how well the solutions are clustered for given number of original sources k the average silhouette width of the clusters for the nmfk solutions for different s k values can be applied to evaluate the optimal number of contaminant sources k s in general s k declines as k increases theoretically s k varies between 1 and 1 for k 1 s 1 1 since there is only one solution typically s k declines sharply after the optimal number of contaminant sources k s is reached in nmfk in addition to the robustness the average reconstruction error eq 4 is used to evaluate the accuracy with which the derived average cluster solutions h k a w k a reproduce the observations v in general the solution accuracy increases while the solution robustness decreases with the increase of the number of unknown sources hence the average silhouette width and frobenius norm for each of the k cluster solutions can be used to define the optimal number of contaminant sources k s specifically k s can be select to be equal to the minimum number of sources that accurately reconstruct the observations i e the frobenius norm is less than a given value or hit plateau and the clusters of solutions are sufficiently robust or stable i e the average silhouette width s is bigger than 0 8 when some of the source geochemical compositions are very close to each other or do not demonstrate clear features it is more useful to formulate another criteria for the nmfk solution robustness which is based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 2011 specifically to compare the nmf models with different number of sources we calculate for each of them the aic value to calculate aic we take from each of the sets of solutions with different number of sources u k the best nmf solution and use the corresponding frobenius norm o k in the aic formula 7 a i c 2 n 2 ln l 2 k n m n n m ln o k n m here the number of adjustable nmfk parameters n is equal to the number of components in the w and h matrices minus the number of observations points because we impose the constraint j 1 k w n j 1 for each observation points which reduces the number of adjustable parameters thus we have n nk mk n k n m n where k is the number of sources m is the number of wells and n is the number of the observation points l is the likelihood functions of the nmf solution with given k and we define it using the reconstruction error o k of the nmf solutions ln l nm 2 ln o k nm nm is the total number of observational data points the product of the number of detectors by the number of time slices the aic is a standard measure of the relative quality of statistical models which takes into account both the likelihood function in our case determined by the reconstruction error and the independent degrees of freedom needed to achieve this level of likelihood the elements of the matrices w and h choosing the model that minimizes aic helps avoid over fitting in general aic decreases with increasing the number of estimated sources k typically aic substantially drops when k k s for k k s the aic values commonly plateau and do not exhibit substantial changes in general both the average silhouette width s and aic should estimate the same number of sources k s if there is discrepancy typically s based estimate is smaller than the aic based estimate this type of situation is discussed in the results section below in general s based estimate of k s should be preferred because the solutions for k k s are potentially over fitting the data 4 results 4 1 synthetic analysis analysis 4 1 1 example with two sources and three geochemical constituents to illustrate our method we apply the nmfk algorithm described above to identify the source concentrations from a series of synthetic data sets representing realistic scenarios generally consistent with real world conditions first we consider an example generated to represent two unknown synthetic sources groundwater types the true unknown concentrations of three geochemical constituents a b c representing the two synthetic sources are presented in table 1 these sources are mixed at each well using true unknown mixing coefficient show shown in table 2 these are the true unknown matrices w and h respectively as presented in eq 2 these matrices are unknown the number of sources are also unknown they are presented here just to demonstrate the applicability of the method the true matrices w and h in tables 1 and 2 are multiplied to estimate the true known concentrations v table 3 of three geochemical constituents a b c at the five monitoring wells here the measurement errors are assumed to be zero here and in the examples presented below the source concentrations and well mixing coefficients tables 1 and 2 are generated using standard pseudo random pseudo random number generation capabilities provided in julia the random numbers have uniform distribution between 0 and 1 for convenience and without lost of generality the source concentrations are scaled so that the maximum concentration at the sources for each species is 1 the random mixing coefficients are also scaled so that each row in table 2 adds up to 1 as discussed above this requirement comes from the problem setup the groundwater concentrations at each well are expected to be defined by mixing of all the sources we applied v in nmfk to estimate the number of sources and reconstruct the unknown source concentrations and mixing coefficients based on table 4 the number of source is two this is estimated by the behavior of the robustness and aic criteria the robustness is close to 1 for the cases of 1 and 2 sources however it drops substantially for 3 sources this suggest that the solution for 3 sources is not stable and non unique and solution for 2 sources should be preferred similarly aic shows a substantial drop between cases of 1 and 2 sources this also suggests that the solution with 2 sources should be selected the same conclusion can be also drawn here by the reconstruction quality clearly the solution for 2 sources produces a much better fit of the data than the solution for 1 source the solution for 3 sources produces a better match but based on parsimony principle also captured by aic but using much more model parameters i e more degrees of freedom in this case the 2 source solution has 16 model parameters 5 2 2 3 while the 3 source solutions has 21 model parameters 5 3 3 3 in all cases there are only 15 observations 5 3 the estimated unknown concentrations of the three geochemical constituents a b c representing two synthetic sources are presented in table 1 the estimated unknown mixing coefficients of the identified two sources in the five wells are shown in 2table 2 as can be seen the algorithm accurately estimates the number of sources it is also capable of almost perfectly reproducing the observed concentrations table 3 which is not surprising considering the large number of degrees of freedom the algorithm accurately captures the general pattern of geochemical constituent concentrations in the original sources table 1 it also accurately identifies the general pattern of representation mixing of the two original sources in the five monitoring wells table 2 the same synthetic problem was rerun 1 000 1000 times with different random concentrations in all the 1000 cases the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources the same synthetic problem was also rerun 1 000 1000 times adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 representing measurement errors again the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources all test cases 4 1 2 example with four sources and six geochemical constituents as a second test we consider an example generated to represent four unknown synthetic sources groundwater types observed at 30 observation points the synthetic observations v are presented in table 5 the concentration data is perturbed by adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 representing measurement errors we applied v in nmfk to estimate the number of sources based on table 6 the number of source is four this is estimated by the behavior of the average silhouette width s and aic criteria as a function of the number of sources k the average silhouette width s is close to 1 for the cases when k 4 s drops slightly for k 4 but it is still close to 1 substantial drop for s occurs for k 4 this suggest that the solution for more than 4 sources are non unique and depends strongly on the random initial guesses for the unknown matrix components w and h aic shows a substantial drop between cases of 3 and 4 sources this suggests that the solution with 4 sources should be selected in this case the same conclusion can be also drawn here by the reconstruction quality o clearly the solution for 4 sources produces much better fit of the data than the solution for 3 sources the solution for 5 sources also produces a good match but based on parsimony principle also captured by aic it should be rejected because it is using much more model adjustable parameters in this case the 4 source nmfk solution has 114 adjustable parameters 30 4 4 6 30 while the 5 source solution has 150 parameters 30 5 5 6 30 in all cases there are only 180 observations 30 6 this synthetic problem was rerun 1 000 1000 times with different random concentrations all the runs are performed adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 in 912 cases the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources 4 2 site analysis analysis nmfk is applied to analyze and deconstruct the groundwater geochemistry observed in the regional aquifer beneath the los alamos national laboratory lanl site for characterization of contaminant sources lanl is a research facility operated by the u s department of energy in north central new mexico lanl is currently investigating a chromium cr6 plume in the regional aquifer beneath sandia and mortandad canyons fig 1 to ensure contaminants do not threaten human health or the environment the chromium contamination is caused by infiltration of liquid effluents released from an electric power plant a comprehensive investigation of this plume has been ongoing since 2005 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 the site conceptual model describing the physical and biogeochemical processes controlling the movement of groundwater and contaminants in the environment is presented in detail in lanl 2012 and supported by multiples lines of evidence in general the site conceptual model that was proposed in lanl 2012 is still consistent with the recently collected data the establishment and the ongoing testing of the current conceptual model involved a series of field laboratory and modeling analyses lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 the contaminant source mass and the release history on the ground surface is highly uncertain also uncertain are the volume transients and location of the infiltrating water carrying the contamination in the subsurface the water and contaminants infiltrated through 300m thick vadose zone which includes several perching horizons before reaching the regional aquifer water table the hydraulic properties of the regional aquifer are highly heterogeneous the shape of the regional water table is impacted by these heterogeneities as well as by zones of infiltration from the vadose zone furthermore migration of the contaminants in the subsurface is also influenced by effluent and water discharges in two neighboring canyons mortandad and los alamos fig 1 past mortandad canyon effluent releases contain nitrate no 3 and tritium 3h past effluent releases in los alamos canyon are characterized by elevated 3h concentrations some of these mortandad and los alamos canyon tracers were collocated with contaminant released in sandia canyon and detected in the regional aquifer as a result the geochemistry of the regional aquifer groundwater is expected to be representative of several commingled groundwater types with different geochemical signatures the groundwater types can be related to different infiltration flowpaths as wells as background aquifer groundwater coming upgradient from the site a subset of the data collected at the site is applied for the nmfk analysis and is presented in table 7 the nmfk results are presented in table 8 the nmfk analysis suggest 5 original groundwater sources with different geochemical composition are mixed in the aquifer this estimate is based on the silhouette width s values note that s 1 for k 5 the aic values potentially suggest existence of 7 sources however the solutions for 6 and 7 sources are potentially over fitting the data some of the estimated 5 sources groundwater types are associated with contaminant releases table 9 based on table 9 the fifth source s 5 has the highest 3h concentrations the other geochemical components are elevated as well this source might be associated with infiltration along los alamos canyon the fourth source s 4 has high cr6 values and might be associated with infiltration along sandia canyon the second and third sources groundwater types are associated with elevated so 4 2 no 3 and cl so 4 2 concentrations respectively their origin is unknown they might be a result of geochemical processes occurring during groundwater infiltration the fifth source groundwater type represents background concentrations table 10 shows the mixing coefficient of the 5 groundwater types contaminant sources for each observation well note that the mixing coefficients for each well add up to 1 the background groundwater type is predominantly detected at the upgradient wells e g r 14 1 r 1 r 33 as well as in the deep screens of some of the 2 of the two screen wells the fourth and fifth source sources are detected at r 42 and r 28 which are located at the centroid of the existing chromium plume in the regional aquifer the third source groundwater type is predominantly detected in r 28 but interestingly it is not observed in r 42 the second source groundwater type is predominantly detected in r 43 1 and r 11 which are located in the northern portion of the site fig 1 the source concentrations estimated by nmfk are somewhat consistent with more complicated inverse analyses using numerical models applied to solve this problem lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 in the future the nmfk results will be applied as input to inverse analyses of site numerical models in this way instead of calibrating against all the geochemical data the numerical models would be calibrated against the nmfk predicted geochemical mixtures 5 conclusions our analyses demonstrate the applicability of our nmfk approach for identification of contaminant sources based on a non negative matrix factorization nmf technique combined with a custom semi supervised clustering the nmfk approach was originally presented by alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 however important changes and extensions were made in nmfk to develop an algorithm applicable for blind source identification based on geochemical data the analyses required application of non convex nonlinear optimization algorithm the classical multiplicative nmf optimization algorithm lee and seung 1999 is not applicable in this case furthermore additional constraints are imposed on the nmfk solutions the original method relied only non negativity constraints here the nmfk algorithm includes constraints on one of the factorized matrices the mixing matrix in eqs 2 and 5 where the mixture coefficients add up to 1 for each observation point the inverse problem solved in the nmfk analysis is under determined ill posed to address this the nmfk algorithm thoroughly explores the plausible inverse solutions and seeks to narrow the set of possible solutions by estimating the optimal number of contaminant source signals needed to robustly and accurately reconstruct the observed data this allows us to estimate the number of contaminant sources in the synthetic tests we generated datasets representing unknown contaminant sources detected as a set of mixed signals groundwater types contamination sources at a series monitoring wells detectors sensors using only the synthetic dataset representing the observations at the monitoring wells we correctly identified the number of contaminant sources we also applied nmfk on real world dataset related to the lanl chromium contamination site the results of this analysis are consistent with previous data and model analyses lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 nmfk allows the contaminant fields observed at a series of the detectors to be unmixed into a series of independent plumes with independent contamination sources this information can be applied to guide the conceptualization of the site conditions and the design of numerical models that are set up to represent these conditions in some cases decoupled model analyses might be applied to independently analyze the groundwater transport of each contaminant source which can be computationally more efficient nmfk results coupled with modeling analysis can yield information needed for site contaminant fate and transport predictions hazard and risk assessments and contaminant remediation it is important to note that the presented nmf analyses are following the classical bss formulation assuming a linear mixing problem eq 2 however since the nmf problem is solved using nonlinear minimization procedure as discussed in section 2 the bss problem can be expanded to account for nonlinear mixing and geochemical processes occurring in the subsurface this will increase the number of unknowns in eq 2 as well as the computational complexity but as long as data are available to represent nonlinear mixing process the bss problem can be solved we plan to extend our analyses to account for nonlinear mixing and geochemical processes in the future the presented analyses are focusing on two dimensional matrix data where the data define the concentrations of a series of geochemical species as measure at a series of monitoring wells the analyses currently ignore information about the well spatial coordinates the incorporation of the well locations in the analyses will increase the dimensionality of the data e g the problem can be five dimensional if the species concentrations depend on three spatial coordinates and time this will require application of tensor based factorization methods cichocki et al 2009 however currently there are no tensor based methods that can be applied to solve the multi dimensional geochemical mixing problems and we are currently working to address this issue the possible applications of the nmfk approach are not limited to groundwater contamination problems for example nmfk can readily be be used to identify contaminant sources based on soil and air pollution data nmfk can be applied to analyze any mixtures of ingredients in this case our constrained nmfk procedure can be applied to identify the ingredients of the sources that are mixed to produce observed mixtures acknowledgments this research was funded by the environmental programs directorate of the los alamos national laboratory los alamos national

1667,identification of the original groundwater types present in geochemical mixtures observed in an aquifer is a challenging but very important task frequently some of the groundwater types are related to different infiltration and or contamination sources associated with various geochemical signatures and origins the characterization of groundwater mixing processes typically requires solving complex inverse models representing groundwater flow and geochemical transport in the aquifer where the inverse analysis accounts for available site data usually the model is calibrated against the available data characterizing the spatial and temporal distribution of the observed geochemical types numerous different geochemical constituents and processes may need to be simulated in these models which further complicates the analyses in this paper we propose a new contaminant source identification approach that performs decomposition of the observation mixtures based on non negative matrix factorization nmf method for blind source separation bss coupled with a custom semi supervised clustering algorithm our methodology called nmfk is capable of identifying a the unknown number of groundwater types and b the original geochemical concentration of the contaminant sources from measured geochemical mixtures with unknown mixing ratios without any additional site information nmfk is tested on synthetic and real world site data the nmfk algorithm works with geochemical data represented in the form of concentrations ratios of two constituents for example isotope ratios and delta notations standard normalized stable isotope ratios keywords non negative matrix factorization feature extraction blind source separation robustness analysis semi supervised learning groundwater contamination source identification advection diffusion transport geochemical signatures 1 introduction for several decades one of the most important research and real world applications in the hydrogeological sciences has been related to aquifer contamination fetter and fetter 1999 gelhar 1993 vengosh et al 2014 the work has been driven by substantial scientific and engineering challenges associated with prediction and remediation of contaminant plumes in natural environment most of these challenges are due to uncertainties associated with contaminant sources for example the number of contaminant sources their location and geochemical signatures are frequently unknown typically water in an aquifer is a mixture of different groundwater types with different origins and geochemical signatures deutsch and siegel 1997 for example groundwater might be originating from different recharge sources with contrasting geochemical properties also groundwater may have been flowing through different rock types which may have altered the composition by means of geochemical reactions and ion exchanges furthermore some of the groundwater recharge sources might be associated with contamination sources with different geochemical signatures data about the groundwater mixtures are typically collected at multiple sampling locations over time where the measurement data are also associated with uncertainties and measurement errors identification of the original groundwater types representing geochemical mixtures observed in a aquifer is a challenging but very important task wagner 1992 böhlke and denver 1995 lapworth et al 2012 this task is typically performed using complex inverse models representing groundwater mixing processes in the aquifer where the model is

to be simulated in these models which further complicates the analyses contemporary analyses of groundwater contamination sources are also performed implementing various multivariate statistical and machine learning techniques chan and huang 2003 rasekh and brumbelow 2012 thus variations in chemical compositions and evolution of groundwater composition have been studied by methods used to describe variability among correlated variables knudson et al 1977 helena et al 2000 such as factor analysis harman 1976 and principle component analysis jolliffe 2002 as well as by unsupervised machine learning methods used to characterize or separate two or more classes of objects shrestha and kazama 2007 tariq et al 2008 such as discriminant analysis scholkopft and mullert 1999 and clustering analysis diday and simon 1980 determination of the average regional concentrations of heavy metals based on surveys of soil contamination has been also investigated by principle component analysis and cluster analysis facchinelli et al 2001 combined with a geostatistical method chiles and delfiner 2009 used to construct regional distribution maps for comparison with regional databases various supervised machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks yegnanarayana 2009 support vector machines drucker et al 1999 locally weighted projection regression vijayakumar and schaal 2000 and relevance vector machines tipping 2001 etc have been also utilized to build surrogates models based on observational data for substitution of the much more complex and time consuming physical models used to simulate the contamination levels such surrogate models have been used to predict contaminant levels in regional groundwater sites khalil et al 2005 the relationship among different chemical pollutants retrieved from in situ measurements of underground and surface water have been investigated by an algorithm for quasi optimal learning cervone et al 2010 that explores a methodology for symbolic machine learning classification by this method it has been shown for example that if one type of contaminant is dissolved in the water table it has to be expected that other chemicals are also present manca and cervone 2013 in this paper we utilize a new hybrid approach which we call nmfk for identification of contaminant sources in an aquifer nmfk utilizes a blind source separation bss technique belouchrani et al 1997 based on non negative non negative matrix factorization nmf lee and seung 1999 combined with a custom made semi supervised k means clustering algorithm alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 to unmix the geochemical signatures in the observations and identify the contaminant sources using synthetic and real world site data we demonstrate that nmfk is capable of accurately determining the unknown number of contaminant sources from observation samples of their mixtures without any additional information the nmfk methodology is coded in julia bezanson et al 2012 and the code is available upon request the nmfk algorithm works with geochemical data represented in the form of concentrations ratios of two constituents for example isotope ratios and delta notations standard normalized stable isotope ratios frequently at the contamination sites the groundwater in the aquifer is a mixture of waters with different origins sources that are commingled in the aquifer several of these groundwater recharge sources might include contaminants typically all these sources will have different geochemical signatures due to differences in their origins and flowpaths through the subsurface before infiltrating in the aquifer the identification of the contamination infiltration sources causing the observed geochemical concentrations in the aquifer can be very challenging at sites where complex physical and chemical processes occur source identification can be complicated because 1 some of these sources may have similar geochemical signatures 2 some of the sources may geochemically interfere with each other and 3 groundwater transport through the subsurface from the entry point at the ground surface to the observation point in the aquifer may be impacted by various physical and chemical processes e g diffusion dispersion sorption retardation precipitation etc and precipitation to address all these issues the source characterization is often carried out by calibrating a numerical model that simulates these complexities against the observed geochemical data here we apply an alternative approach based on a novel model free machine learning algorithm for blind source separation bss 2 blind source separation bss the main goal of the paper is to present a novel application of the bss methodology based on nmfk algorithm presented in alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 additionally substantial changes and extensions of the original nmfk algorithm are reported in order for nmfk to be applicable for contaminant source identification based on geochemical observations as discussed below we assume that the geochemical observations are taken at several discrete detectors sampling points typically monitoring wells dispersed in space the algorithm does not require the data to account for transients in the case of transient data nmfk can be applied consecutively to representative time snapshots which will account for changes and evolution of the mixing ratios of the detected groundwater types when there are multiple contamination sources in the aquifer each detector registers a mixture of contamination fields originating from different sources release locations our objective is to identify the unknown number of original contamination sources which necessitates decomposing the recorded mixtures to their original components consistent with the bss methodology belouchrani et al 1997 the contaminant source identification problem addressed here can be formulated as following 1 v w h ϵ where v is a matrix v m n m r of the known observation data representing m geochemical constituents detected at a set of n detectors monitoring wells the v matrix does not need to be a full matrix and there can be empty entries where not all the geochemical constituents are observed at all the wells w is an unknown source mixing matrix w m n k r representing the mixing coefficients of k unknown original groundwater types at each of the n observation points note that in this formulation the sum of the mixing coefficients for each observation point should add to one j 1 k w i j 1 for each well i and all the mixing coefficient should be between 0 and 1 i e 0 w i j 1 these requirements come from the problem setup the groundwater concentrations at each well are expected to be defined by mixing of all the sources and there are no expectations to have negative source contributions h is the unknown source matrix h m d m r representing the m geochemical concentrations for each k unknown original sources the matrix elements of v w and h are expected to be positive which is consistent with the analyzed problem concentrations cannot be negative ϵ denotes presence of unknown noise or unbiased errors in the measurements ϵ v m ℝ if there are transients in the observed data the bss problem formulated above can be solved for a sequence of temporally discretized snapshots in this case the matrices v w and h will be time dependent in the discrete case the bss analyses will solve for k h t and w t based on a series of inputs v t where t 1 t and t is number discretized moments in time at which the signals are recorded at the detectors this is also consistent with the data acquisition strategies typically used at an actual contamination site where the geochemical data are collected on annual or quarterly basis the joint analyses of the transients will increase the dimensionality of the data requiring factorization of tensors not matrices as presented in eq 2 cf cichocki et al 2009 however currently there are no tensor based methods that can be applied to solve the multi dimensional geochemical mixing problems since both factors h and w are unknown the size k of these matrices is also unknown because we do not know how many sources have been mixed in each detector record the main difficulty in solving a bss problem is that it is under determined there are two widely used approaches to resolve this bss underdetermination independent component analysis ica amari et al 1996 herault and jutten 1986 and non negative matrix factorization nmf lee and seung 1999 paatero and tapper 1994 ica presupposes a statistical independence of the original signals and thus aims to maximize the non gaussian characteristics of the estimated sources in h the other approach nmf is an unsupervised learning method created for parts based representation fischler and elschlager 1973 in the field of image recognition lee and seung 1999 paatero and tapper 1994 that was successfully leveraged for decomposition of mixtures formed by various types of signals cichocki et al 2009 in contrast to ica nmf does not seek statistical independence or constrain any other statistical properties i e nmf allows the original sources to be correlated instead nmf enforces a non negativity constraint on the original signals in h and their mixing components in w nmf can successfully decompose large sets of non negative observations v by leveraging the multiplicative update algorithm lee and seung 1999 however nmf requires a priori knowledge of the number of the original sources recently we reported a methodology called nmfk alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 where the coupling of the original multiplicative algorithm with a custom semi supervised clustering enables it to identify the number of the unknown sources based on the robustness of the solutions here by imposing additional to non negativity constraints to the elements of the mixing matrix and applying a nonconvex non convex nonlinear minimization algorithm we extend nmfk to be applicable for the contaminant source identification based on geochemical signatures in groundwater samples representative of contamination sites the extended nmfk methodology is also applicable for any other situation where the contributions of the original signals in the observed mixtures have to add to 1 due to additional physical constraints 3 methodology 3 1 nmf algorithm in a typical nmf problem the observational data v is formed by a linear mixing of k unknown original signals h blended by an also unknown mixing matrix w i e 2 v n m i 1 k w n k h k m ϵ subject to the following constraints 3 w n d 0 h d m 0 n d m here ϵ is a vector and denotes presence of possible noise or unbiased errors in the measurements also unknown if the problem is solved in a temporally discretized framework the goal of the bss algorithm is to retrieve the k original signals h that have produced n observational mixtures of these signals v recorded at a set of observation points sensors here n is the number of the sensors k is the number of the unknown signals sources observed in the collected data v and m is the number of observed geochemical constituents associated at the observation points the algorithm returns the decomposition through the mixing matrix w n d and source matrix h d m with ϵ being the residual noise the rows in v correspond to the number of sensors while the rows of h correspond to the number of sources in the nmfusually usually the number of sensors has to be greater than the number of sources for nmf to work the problem must be amenable to a non negativity constraint on the sources h and mixing matrix w this constrain leads to reconstruction of the observations the rows of matrix v as linear combinations of the elements of h and w that cannot cancel mutually the nmf algorithm starts with a random guess for h and w and proceeds by minimizing the cost objective function o which in our case is the frobenius norm 4 o 1 2 v w h f 2 1 2 n m v n m k 1 d w n k h k m 2 during each iteration minimizing the frobenius norm eq 4 with non negativity constraints eq 3 is equivalent to representing the discrepancies between the observations v and the reconstruction w h as white noise furthermore to find the contaminant sources geochemical types represented in the observed geochemical mixtures here we have to minimize o with the additional constraints 5 k 1 d w n k 1 n it is important to note that because of the constraints in eq 5 the classical multiplicative nmf optimization algorithm lee and seung 1999 is not applicable instead a non convex nonlinear optimization algorithm is needed and for this purpose we utilized the nonlinear minimization procedure provided by julia packages jump jl and ipopt jl jump jl is a modeling language for mathematical optimization embedded in julia dunning et al 2015 it supports a number of open source and commercial solvers for a variety of optimization problems here jump jl is applied for nonlinear programming using ipopt jl ipopt interior point optimizer is an open software package for large scale nonlinear optimization wächter 2002 wächter and biegler 2005 2006 here ipopt is applied to perform non convex constrained second order minimization 3 2 nmfk algorithm if we knew the number of sources the first step described in the previous section would be all that is needed from the best solution of the minimization procedure with known k we would extract the desired estimates of the physical parameters and thus solve the inverse problem unfortunately the true number of sources is typically unknown and thus the number of the sources is an unknown parameter which we have to identified from the observations further the solutions of eq 2 is based on random initial conditions a naive approach would be to explore all of the possible solutions applying the nonlinear minimization described in the previous section for a range of possible number of sources then the solution with the smallest norm will identify the number of sources k s however this is obviously flawed approach the over fitting will certainly lead to an over estimation of the number of sources more free parameters will generally lead to a better fit irrespective of how close the estimated number of sources is to the real one the classical nmf also requires a priory priori knowledge of the number of the original sources previously by coupling the nmf with a custom semi supervised clustering we have demonstrated that the number of the original sources can be estimated based on their robustness reproducibility alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 this approach was introduced to decompose the largest available dataset of human cancer genomes alexandrov et al 2013 and then extended for decomposition of physical signals transients alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 specifically our methodology called nmfk explores consecutively all possible numbers of original sources k ranging from 1 to d k 1 2 d and then estimates the accuracy and robustness of large set of solutions with different number of sources in nmfk the maximum number of explored sources d is user defined and it is not expected to exceed the number of observed geochemical components or the number of observation points although theoretically the used here minimization algorithm can be applied for any k 1 thus nmfk performs m sets of simulations called nmf runs where each run is using different number of sources k 1 2 d with random initial conditions at the end of each nmf run we get a set of m solutions u k where each solution contains two matrices h k j w k j for k original sources and j 1 2 m 6 u k h k 1 w k 1 h k 2 w k 2 h k m w k m after that nmfk leverages a custom semi supervised clustering to assign each of these m solutions in a given set u d to one of k specific clusters this custom semi supervised method is based on k means clustering that keeps the number of solutions in each cluster equal to the number of nmf runs for example for the case with k 2 after the execution of m 1000 nmf runs performed with random initial guesses for the w and h matrix elements each of the two clusters will contain 1 000 1000 solutions note that we have to enforce the condition that the clusters are with equal number of solutions since each nmf simulation contributes equal number of solutions for each source during the clustering the similarity between sources h i1 and h i2 is measured using the cosine distance also known as cosine similarity pang ning et al 2006 alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 the main idea for estimating the unknown number of sources in nmfk is to use the separation between the clusters as a measure of how good a particular choice of k is as an accurate estimate of the number of unknown sources we estimate the degree of clustering for different number of sources and plot it as a function of k we expect a sharp drop after we cross the k s value alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 to quantify this behavior after the clustering we compute the average silhouette width rousseeuw 1987 s k which is a measure of how well the solutions are clustered for given number of original sources k the average silhouette width of the clusters for the nmfk solutions for different s k values can be applied to evaluate the optimal number of contaminant sources k s in general s k declines as k increases theoretically s k varies between 1 and 1 for k 1 s 1 1 since there is only one solution typically s k declines sharply after the optimal number of contaminant sources k s is reached in nmfk in addition to the robustness the average reconstruction error eq 4 is used to evaluate the accuracy with which the derived average cluster solutions h k a w k a reproduce the observations v in general the solution accuracy increases while the solution robustness decreases with the increase of the number of unknown sources hence the average silhouette width and frobenius norm for each of the k cluster solutions can be used to define the optimal number of contaminant sources k s specifically k s can be select to be equal to the minimum number of sources that accurately reconstruct the observations i e the frobenius norm is less than a given value or hit plateau and the clusters of solutions are sufficiently robust or stable i e the average silhouette width s is bigger than 0 8 when some of the source geochemical compositions are very close to each other or do not demonstrate clear features it is more useful to formulate another criteria for the nmfk solution robustness which is based on the akaike information criterion aic akaike 2011 specifically to compare the nmf models with different number of sources we calculate for each of them the aic value to calculate aic we take from each of the sets of solutions with different number of sources u k the best nmf solution and use the corresponding frobenius norm o k in the aic formula 7 a i c 2 n 2 ln l 2 k n m n n m ln o k n m here the number of adjustable nmfk parameters n is equal to the number of components in the w and h matrices minus the number of observations points because we impose the constraint j 1 k w n j 1 for each observation points which reduces the number of adjustable parameters thus we have n nk mk n k n m n where k is the number of sources m is the number of wells and n is the number of the observation points l is the likelihood functions of the nmf solution with given k and we define it using the reconstruction error o k of the nmf solutions ln l nm 2 ln o k nm nm is the total number of observational data points the product of the number of detectors by the number of time slices the aic is a standard measure of the relative quality of statistical models which takes into account both the likelihood function in our case determined by the reconstruction error and the independent degrees of freedom needed to achieve this level of likelihood the elements of the matrices w and h choosing the model that minimizes aic helps avoid over fitting in general aic decreases with increasing the number of estimated sources k typically aic substantially drops when k k s for k k s the aic values commonly plateau and do not exhibit substantial changes in general both the average silhouette width s and aic should estimate the same number of sources k s if there is discrepancy typically s based estimate is smaller than the aic based estimate this type of situation is discussed in the results section below in general s based estimate of k s should be preferred because the solutions for k k s are potentially over fitting the data 4 results 4 1 synthetic analysis analysis 4 1 1 example with two sources and three geochemical constituents to illustrate our method we apply the nmfk algorithm described above to identify the source concentrations from a series of synthetic data sets representing realistic scenarios generally consistent with real world conditions first we consider an example generated to represent two unknown synthetic sources groundwater types the true unknown concentrations of three geochemical constituents a b c representing the two synthetic sources are presented in table 1 these sources are mixed at each well using true unknown mixing coefficient show shown in table 2 these are the true unknown matrices w and h respectively as presented in eq 2 these matrices are unknown the number of sources are also unknown they are presented here just to demonstrate the applicability of the method the true matrices w and h in tables 1 and 2 are multiplied to estimate the true known concentrations v table 3 of three geochemical constituents a b c at the five monitoring wells here the measurement errors are assumed to be zero here and in the examples presented below the source concentrations and well mixing coefficients tables 1 and 2 are generated using standard pseudo random pseudo random number generation capabilities provided in julia the random numbers have uniform distribution between 0 and 1 for convenience and without lost of generality the source concentrations are scaled so that the maximum concentration at the sources for each species is 1 the random mixing coefficients are also scaled so that each row in table 2 adds up to 1 as discussed above this requirement comes from the problem setup the groundwater concentrations at each well are expected to be defined by mixing of all the sources we applied v in nmfk to estimate the number of sources and reconstruct the unknown source concentrations and mixing coefficients based on table 4 the number of source is two this is estimated by the behavior of the robustness and aic criteria the robustness is close to 1 for the cases of 1 and 2 sources however it drops substantially for 3 sources this suggest that the solution for 3 sources is not stable and non unique and solution for 2 sources should be preferred similarly aic shows a substantial drop between cases of 1 and 2 sources this also suggests that the solution with 2 sources should be selected the same conclusion can be also drawn here by the reconstruction quality clearly the solution for 2 sources produces a much better fit of the data than the solution for 1 source the solution for 3 sources produces a better match but based on parsimony principle also captured by aic but using much more model parameters i e more degrees of freedom in this case the 2 source solution has 16 model parameters 5 2 2 3 while the 3 source solutions has 21 model parameters 5 3 3 3 in all cases there are only 15 observations 5 3 the estimated unknown concentrations of the three geochemical constituents a b c representing two synthetic sources are presented in table 1 the estimated unknown mixing coefficients of the identified two sources in the five wells are shown in 2table 2 as can be seen the algorithm accurately estimates the number of sources it is also capable of almost perfectly reproducing the observed concentrations table 3 which is not surprising considering the large number of degrees of freedom the algorithm accurately captures the general pattern of geochemical constituent concentrations in the original sources table 1 it also accurately identifies the general pattern of representation mixing of the two original sources in the five monitoring wells table 2 the same synthetic problem was rerun 1 000 1000 times with different random concentrations in all the 1000 cases the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources the same synthetic problem was also rerun 1 000 1000 times adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 representing measurement errors again the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources all test cases 4 1 2 example with four sources and six geochemical constituents as a second test we consider an example generated to represent four unknown synthetic sources groundwater types observed at 30 observation points the synthetic observations v are presented in table 5 the concentration data is perturbed by adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 representing measurement errors we applied v in nmfk to estimate the number of sources based on table 6 the number of source is four this is estimated by the behavior of the average silhouette width s and aic criteria as a function of the number of sources k the average silhouette width s is close to 1 for the cases when k 4 s drops slightly for k 4 but it is still close to 1 substantial drop for s occurs for k 4 this suggest that the solution for more than 4 sources are non unique and depends strongly on the random initial guesses for the unknown matrix components w and h aic shows a substantial drop between cases of 3 and 4 sources this suggests that the solution with 4 sources should be selected in this case the same conclusion can be also drawn here by the reconstruction quality o clearly the solution for 4 sources produces much better fit of the data than the solution for 3 sources the solution for 5 sources also produces a good match but based on parsimony principle also captured by aic it should be rejected because it is using much more model adjustable parameters in this case the 4 source nmfk solution has 114 adjustable parameters 30 4 4 6 30 while the 5 source solution has 150 parameters 30 5 5 6 30 in all cases there are only 180 observations 30 6 this synthetic problem was rerun 1 000 1000 times with different random concentrations all the runs are performed adding random noise with normal distribution mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 0 01 in 912 cases the algorithm correctly identified the true number of sources 4 2 site analysis analysis nmfk is applied to analyze and deconstruct the groundwater geochemistry observed in the regional aquifer beneath the los alamos national laboratory lanl site for characterization of contaminant sources lanl is a research facility operated by the u s department of energy in north central new mexico lanl is currently investigating a chromium cr6 plume in the regional aquifer beneath sandia and mortandad canyons fig 1 to ensure contaminants do not threaten human health or the environment the chromium contamination is caused by infiltration of liquid effluents released from an electric power plant a comprehensive investigation of this plume has been ongoing since 2005 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 the site conceptual model describing the physical and biogeochemical processes controlling the movement of groundwater and contaminants in the environment is presented in detail in lanl 2012 and supported by multiples lines of evidence in general the site conceptual model that was proposed in lanl 2012 is still consistent with the recently collected data the establishment and the ongoing testing of the current conceptual model involved a series of field laboratory and modeling analyses lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 the contaminant source mass and the release history on the ground surface is highly uncertain also uncertain are the volume transients and location of the infiltrating water carrying the contamination in the subsurface the water and contaminants infiltrated through 300m thick vadose zone which includes several perching horizons before reaching the regional aquifer water table the hydraulic properties of the regional aquifer are highly heterogeneous the shape of the regional water table is impacted by these heterogeneities as well as by zones of infiltration from the vadose zone furthermore migration of the contaminants in the subsurface is also influenced by effluent and water discharges in two neighboring canyons mortandad and los alamos fig 1 past mortandad canyon effluent releases contain nitrate no 3 and tritium 3h past effluent releases in los alamos canyon are characterized by elevated 3h concentrations some of these mortandad and los alamos canyon tracers were collocated with contaminant released in sandia canyon and detected in the regional aquifer as a result the geochemistry of the regional aquifer groundwater is expected to be representative of several commingled groundwater types with different geochemical signatures the groundwater types can be related to different infiltration flowpaths as wells as background aquifer groundwater coming upgradient from the site a subset of the data collected at the site is applied for the nmfk analysis and is presented in table 7 the nmfk results are presented in table 8 the nmfk analysis suggest 5 original groundwater sources with different geochemical composition are mixed in the aquifer this estimate is based on the silhouette width s values note that s 1 for k 5 the aic values potentially suggest existence of 7 sources however the solutions for 6 and 7 sources are potentially over fitting the data some of the estimated 5 sources groundwater types are associated with contaminant releases table 9 based on table 9 the fifth source s 5 has the highest 3h concentrations the other geochemical components are elevated as well this source might be associated with infiltration along los alamos canyon the fourth source s 4 has high cr6 values and might be associated with infiltration along sandia canyon the second and third sources groundwater types are associated with elevated so 4 2 no 3 and cl so 4 2 concentrations respectively their origin is unknown they might be a result of geochemical processes occurring during groundwater infiltration the fifth source groundwater type represents background concentrations table 10 shows the mixing coefficient of the 5 groundwater types contaminant sources for each observation well note that the mixing coefficients for each well add up to 1 the background groundwater type is predominantly detected at the upgradient wells e g r 14 1 r 1 r 33 as well as in the deep screens of some of the 2 of the two screen wells the fourth and fifth source sources are detected at r 42 and r 28 which are located at the centroid of the existing chromium plume in the regional aquifer the third source groundwater type is predominantly detected in r 28 but interestingly it is not observed in r 42 the second source groundwater type is predominantly detected in r 43 1 and r 11 which are located in the northern portion of the site fig 1 the source concentrations estimated by nmfk are somewhat consistent with more complicated inverse analyses using numerical models applied to solve this problem lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 in the future the nmfk results will be applied as input to inverse analyses of site numerical models in this way instead of calibrating against all the geochemical data the numerical models would be calibrated against the nmfk predicted geochemical mixtures 5 conclusions our analyses demonstrate the applicability of our nmfk approach for identification of contaminant sources based on a non negative matrix factorization nmf technique combined with a custom semi supervised clustering the nmfk approach was originally presented by alexandrov and vesselinov 2014 however important changes and extensions were made in nmfk to develop an algorithm applicable for blind source identification based on geochemical data the analyses required application of non convex nonlinear optimization algorithm the classical multiplicative nmf optimization algorithm lee and seung 1999 is not applicable in this case furthermore additional constraints are imposed on the nmfk solutions the original method relied only non negativity constraints here the nmfk algorithm includes constraints on one of the factorized matrices the mixing matrix in eqs 2 and 5 where the mixture coefficients add up to 1 for each observation point the inverse problem solved in the nmfk analysis is under determined ill posed to address this the nmfk algorithm thoroughly explores the plausible inverse solutions and seeks to narrow the set of possible solutions by estimating the optimal number of contaminant source signals needed to robustly and accurately reconstruct the observed data this allows us to estimate the number of contaminant sources in the synthetic tests we generated datasets representing unknown contaminant sources detected as a set of mixed signals groundwater types contamination sources at a series monitoring wells detectors sensors using only the synthetic dataset representing the observations at the monitoring wells we correctly identified the number of contaminant sources we also applied nmfk on real world dataset related to the lanl chromium contamination site the results of this analysis are consistent with previous data and model analyses lanl 2012 vesselinov et al 2015 2013 nmfk allows the contaminant fields observed at a series of the detectors to be unmixed into a series of independent plumes with independent contamination sources this information can be applied to guide the conceptualization of the site conditions and the design of numerical models that are set up to represent these conditions in some cases decoupled model analyses might be applied to independently analyze the groundwater transport of each contaminant source which can be computationally more efficient nmfk results coupled with modeling analysis can yield information needed for site contaminant fate and transport predictions hazard and risk assessments and contaminant remediation it is important to note that the presented nmf analyses are following the classical bss formulation assuming a linear mixing problem eq 2 however since the nmf problem is solved using nonlinear minimization procedure as discussed in section 2 the bss problem can be expanded to account for nonlinear mixing and geochemical processes occurring in the subsurface this will increase the number of unknowns in eq 2 as well as the computational complexity but as long as data are available to represent nonlinear mixing process the bss problem can be solved we plan to extend our analyses to account for nonlinear mixing and geochemical processes in the future the presented analyses are focusing on two dimensional matrix data where the data define the concentrations of a series of geochemical species as measure at a series of monitoring wells the analyses currently ignore information about the well spatial coordinates the incorporation of the well locations in the analyses will increase the dimensionality of the data e g the problem can be five dimensional if the species concentrations depend on three spatial coordinates and time this will require application of tensor based factorization methods cichocki et al 2009 however currently there are no tensor based methods that can be applied to solve the multi dimensional geochemical mixing problems and we are currently working to address this issue the possible applications of the nmfk approach are not limited to groundwater contamination problems for example nmfk can readily be be used to identify contaminant sources based on soil and air pollution data nmfk can be applied to analyze any mixtures of ingredients in this case our constrained nmfk procedure can be applied to identify the ingredients of the sources that are mixed to produce observed mixtures acknowledgments this research was funded by the environmental programs directorate of the los alamos national laboratory los alamos national

1668,the characterisation of heterogeneous porous media at multiple length scales typically requires the classification of structure at some scale to allow the calculation of effective transport properties at a scale relevant for macroscopic description while such a classification may be derived from various imaging methods a shortcoming is often the simultaneous characterisation of the connectivity between regions representing different micro structure in this work we combine nmr based flow propagators with the simulations performed on corresponding reconstructed structure and relate the nmr measurements to their simulated global and local representations to study fluid transport locally and the exchange between micro and macro porous regions this is achieved by carrying out detailed lattice boltzmann simulations and random walk method to track the displacements of tracers in each kind of region using euclidean distance maps edt we analyse the fluid invasion to regions of different scale and relate it to the connectivity of the system we demonstrate that numerical simulation has great flexibility in providing additional sensitivity to the inference of region

evolution of concentration in reactive flow is of specific interest in contaminant hydrology one important step towards modellingmodeling of reactive transport in porous systems is understanding the

time can be expressed by the flow propagator the conditional probability p r 0 r δ that a molecule initially at position r 0 moves to location r during the time interval δ wang and uhlenbeck 1945 while for homogeneous media the average flow propagator independent of initial position would describe the system fully kärger and heink 1983 pointed out that for heterogeneous media the analysis is significantly more complex in particular it is difficult to characterise at the same time both the different heterogeneity length scales e g by direct imaging methods like micro x ray ct and the connectivity of the system at all relevant scales this is due to the finite field of view fov at given resolution for micro x ray ct methods and the finite time of flight tof or observation time using e g nmr propagator experiments the measurement of flow propagators by nmr has a long history and was introduced by stejskal 1965 an extensive treatment of nmr propagators was given by callaghan 1984

reconstructed fontainebleau sandstone in addition higher reynolds numbers in bead packs by simulation and experiment were considered by maier et al 1998 where fluid flow was simulated by the lattice boltzmann method and random walks carried out on the resulting velocity fields to calculate the propagators the nmr propagator technique was further developed to include two displacement directions in stapf et al 2000 experiments were carried out on fontainebleau sandstone and simulations on reconstructed fontainebleau sandstone in scheven et al 2005 the 13 interval pulse sequence of cotts et al 1989 for the minimisation of internal gradient effects was applied to measure propagators in a carbonate rock as well as mono disperse beads showing the potentially degrading effect of internal gradients on propagator measurements for non ideal porous media exhibiting high susceptibility contrast propagator measurement techniques were further improved through the introduction of a fast difftrain technique in mitchell et al 2008 which was applied to propagator measurements on bentheimer sandstone using the alternating pulsed gradient stimulated echo apgste pulse sequence more recently propagator measurements have been further accelerated by the introduction of compressed sensing techniques paulsen et al 2011 colbourne et al 2016 aforementioned nmr flow propagator studies consider homogeneous media experimental nmr average diffusion propagators on dual scale micro porous crystallites as a function of temperature were presented by kärger and heink 1983 an extension to flow propagators in bi porous bead packs and a reasonable agreement between simulation and experiment were demonstrated by kandhai et al 2002 an alternate way to characterise heterogeneity is by direct imaging methods over the last two decades these methods developed exponentially from early techniques using synchroton based x ray computed tomography spanne et al 1994 auzerais et al 1996 applications to opaque porous media benefited in particular from the simultaneous development in computing capability and micro x ray ct devices arns et al 2005 sakellariou et al 2007 sheppard et al 2014 methods developed for the simulation of tracer dispersion on mri images e g maier et al 1998 were applied to direct simulations on micro ct images in knackstedt et al 2006 recent developments saw significant advances in the modeling of tracer dispersion with applications to a range of reservoir rocks mostaghimi et al 2012 bijeljic et al 2013 nunes et al 2015 meyer and bijeljic 2016 consider now the case of the current generation of micro xray ct x ray ct imaging devices pore scale images tomograms acquired with sufficient field of view exhibit regions where the structure is not resolved in clastics or regolith material such regions are e g mixtures of clay minerals and porosity or fine grained sediments within gravel packs in carbonates they are micro porous regions the properties of these regions become important when they occur frequently or for particular physical properties an example is the electrical conductivity of thin bedded sandstones e g ghous et al 2005 in recent work it has been shown that the distribution of the thin beds can be determined with reasonable accuracy using multi variate pattern recognition techniques based on measures derived on the basis of the minkowski functionals arns et al 2005 ismail 2014 the latter offer a strong discrimination of microstructure arns et al 2004 and the resulting classification was successfully used in upscaling scenarious given such a labeling scheme the contribution of micro porosity to permeability at full and partial saturation was considered in norouzi apourvari and arns 2016 and fluid by passing characterised in alizadeh et al 2017 however in those studies the fully resolved micro structure was also available in general a partition into micro and macro porosity may be possible from a micro ct image but it may be impossible to directly calculate the respective transport properties of unresolved micro porous regions the nmr response of saturated porous rock is an ensemble average over a large set of spins the signal is essentially additive for different rock types or thin beds if they are significantly thicker than the typical displacement distance before relaxation for diffusion in fluids this distance is of the order of hundreds of microns e g 122μm for free diffusion of water at room temperature over a time interval of one second this fact has recently been used to decompose the nmr responses of thin bedded sandstone and to improve respective permeability predictions medellin et al 2015 arns et al 2010 alhwety et al 2016 a way to increase the interaction distance available to nmr measurements for such heterogeneous systems is either to consider auxiliary techniques like centrifuging shikhov and arns 2015 shikhov et al 2017 or flow propagators in this work we use regional averaging techniques to expand on nmr propagator simulations with the idea to extract connectivity parameters relevant for micro porosity and transition region modeling the article is organised as follows we first introduce the samples used in this study followed by the used nmr propagator measurement technique and then introduce lbm method based flow flow propagator simulations including global local flow propagator and edt based flow propagator simulations to quantify the exchange and penetration of tracers originating from either the macro or micro porosity to their counterparts e g micro and macro porosity respectively we conclude with a result and discussions section 2 sample characterisation 2 1 bead pack nmr flow propagator experiments were performed using a bead pack sample composed of two types of beads a soda lime glass slg beads 0 5mm actual mean diameter 0 495 0 040 mm produced by mo sci corp and b borosilicate glass bsg beads 1 5mm actual mean diameter 1 532 0 110 mm of unknown manufacturer fig 1 shows an in home built flow cell 3cm diameter and 5cm long containing clusters made by two types of beads labeled as a and b respectively the volumetric fraction of each type is even saturated porosity is the same ϕ 37 0 and mean pore size is different by a factor three blackthe bsg 1 5mm beads are diamagnetic with volumetric susceptibility χ v 4 4 0 4 μ si while the slg 0 5mm beads are weakly paramagnetic with χ v 26 5 9 2 μ si since measurements were performed at relatively low field strength 0 047teslat we consider the effect of internal fields as negligible to first order 2 2 grf model we generated a 3d structure capturing the salient features of the dual scale beads pack system by combining different stochastic processes fig 2 in particular we use a stationary gaussian random field grf to partition space into macro and micro porous regions see e g arns et al 2004 for an extensive description in each partition a stochastic process is carried out placing spheres the resulting model acknowledges beads size porosity and volumetric fraction of each type of beads the small beads are represented by spheres of 13voxels radius and the large ones have a radius of 39voxels and we assign a resolution of 38 5μm these spheres are placed following a poisson process with rejection arns et al 2001 followed by a dilation step to achieve a target porosity of 37 realising the so called cherry pit model torquato 2002 here for a dual scale medium it is worth mentioning that the grf model is more convenient than a micro ct image of a dual scale bead pack in our simulations this is due to the immediate provision of distinct labels for micro pores macro pores big spheres and small spheres during our simulations these labels are essential on the other hand imaging the sample using micro ct great efforts are required in segmentation process to generate relevant labels and it is difficult to properly partition micro porous regions and macro porous regions 3 nmr propagator measurements the nmr flow propagator measurements were performed on our 2mhz magritek rock core analyzer equipped with p54 probe fig 3 shows the pulse sequence diagram of a basic nmr flow propagator experiment based on tanner s 1970 pulsed field gradient pfg stimulated echo technique known as pgste this technique is frequently used to measure bulk and restricted diffusion and flow propagators as et al 1998 codd and altobelli 2003 seymour et al 2007 alternatively a bi polar variant of the pgste apgste pulse sequence is employed if internal gradients are of concern scheven et al 2004 singer et al 2006 sham et al 2013 the disadvantage of the apgste technique comparing to ordinary unipolar pgste is the approximately by factor two longer minimum displacement encoding time interval δ this is due to limitations of hardware requiring significant delay δ 2 after executing gradient pulses to dissipate eddy currents in our system this time interval is about 5ms we compared flow propagator measurements in bead packs using pgste and apgste and observed very similar results due to insignificance of internal gradients the pgste flow propagator relies on stimulated spin echo i e the first π 2 pulse tips the magnetization to the transverse plane and then a pulsed gradient field is applied to imprint the initial position distribution onto the phase space of the magnetization subsequently a second π 2 pulse is applied to store the phase information on the longitudinal direction for a period τ 2 during which no further phase shift is accumulated a third π 2 pulse rotates the stored magnetization back to the transverse plane followed by a refocusing pulsed gradient field to generate an echo the difference of the spin positions along the gradient direction z i for a single gradient setup at the first and second gradient pulses produces an accumulated phase given by 1 ϕ i δ γ g z δ z i δ z i 0 γ g z δ z i δ which is the phase shift of the i th spin that moved a distance z i δ along the direction of the applied gradients g z in eq 1 γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and δ denotes the duration of applied gradients the amplitude of the echo s δ is measured for a set of gradient intensities from g max to g max and the flow propagator p δ z is obtained from an inverse fourier transform of all echo amplitudes as function of the gradient intensity 2 s δ q z p δ z e i 2 π q z z δ d z where the amplitude of one dimensional magnetization wave vector q is given by q z γg z δ 2π kärger and heink 1983 flow propagators were acquired using 128 gradient steps n g spaced from 0 25 to 0 25t m providing sufficient field of flow fof for the selected experimental conditions 3 f o f 2 z m a x n g q z δ we used an observation time δ in the 40ms to 240ms interval which corresponds to fof of 4mms 1 or more which exceeds the maximum expected velocity by a wide margin thus satisfying one requirement for the fourier transformation we performed experiments using 4 step phase cycling the radio frequency π 2 pulse duration was 20μs and the gradient effective length accounted for ramping up and down was 3ms signals were accumulated over 8 scans with a long inter scan waiting time of 25secondss to ensure full polarisation teledyne isco d260 pumps were used to maintain continuous flow at a constant rate of up to 18ml min 4 lattice boltzmann simulations the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been widely employed in many areas of porous media simulation yua et al 2003 talon et al 2012 liu and mostaghimi 2016 in digital core analysis lbm has been applied to simulate the dynamics of single and two phase flow r rojas and tomiyama 2012 the distinct properties of lbm such as easy handling of boundary conditions as well as the approach being amenable to parallel computing makes it a good choice for applications on digital rocks talon et al 2012 pan et al 2006 in this study we apply two lbm schemes the more stable two relaxation time lattice boltzmann model to simulate the dynamics of single phase fluid flow in rock microstructure lattice boltzmann solvers are known to solve the discrete boltzmann equations and recover navier stokes behaviorbehaviour in the small knudsen number regime the methodology of the lattice boltzmann model starts with the initialization of distribution functions these functions then enter an iterative loop that computes macroscopic fluid properties according to 4 ρ i 1 n 19 f i 5 ρ u i 1 n 19 f e i where ρ is the macroscopic fluid density f i e q is the equilibrium distribution function e i are the microscopic velocity vectors and u is the macroscopic velocity after applying boundary conditions the fluid density then evolves according to the most distinctive aspect of the lattice boltzmann numerical model the stream and collide operation 6 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t f i x t f i e q x t τ here τ represents the relaxation time the definition of the relaxation time is the key defining algorithmic difference between the two lbm schemes used here pang et al 2004 a single relaxation time approach implies using a single relaxation rate to bring the distribution functions to equilibrium for the two relaxation time a choice has to be made of two rates of relaxation for the distribution functions this choice is not trivial and depends on what level of accuracy is required in a particular simulation manwart et al 2002 kuzmin and derksen 2011 huang and wu 2016 in the two relaxation time approach the user may need to set the so called magic parameters to recover a more accurate solution ginzburg et al 2010 fattahia et al 2015 dubois et al 2010 dubois et al 2008 d humières and ginzburg 2009 the two approaches have different levels of accuracy and different windows of stability in applying the single relaxation time lbm approach τ is allowed to take only one value between 0 6 and unity d humières et al 2002 in the two relaxation time approach two values are assigned to τ in the implementation here the approach in kuzmin and derksen 2011 allen and reis 2013 is followed the multiple relaxation time mrt lbm is adapted to a trt in this simulation we make a choice of 7 s 1 1 τ 8 s 2 8 2 τ 1 8 τ 1 here s 1 and s 2 are the even and odd order relaxation rates for detailed implementation of the trt lbm algorithm the reader is referred to yua et al 2003 and allen and reis 2013 5 simulation of flow propagators 5 1 global flow propagators in our study all measured propagators and the respective simulated propagators are specifically called global flow propagators in order to distinguish them from the simulated local flow propagator we propose for local analysis the global flow propagator measurements and simulations have been conducted on the dual scale bead pack to validate the methodology described in the following paragraphs the 3d structure is seeded with ϕ 8003 tracers thus one tracer in every pore voxel and all tracers are started at the respective centre point of their voxels the velocity field resultant from the lbm simulations fig 4 is loaded and convection diffusion movement is applied as transport model for each time step δt the displacement of tracers affected by convection d c is calculated from the velocity field 9 d c δ t v x y z where v x y z is a velocity vector for tracers at the position r x y z then we use a random walk method to simulate diffusion in 3d simulations the displacements of diffusion d d is are calculated by 10 d d 6 d δ t where d is the self diffusion coefficient of the fluid the direction of d d is randomly chosen arbitrarily from any direction on the 3d model bergman et al 1995 at last we count the displacements of all the tracers and derive the distribution along flow direction thus the simulated flow propagator p δ z 5 2 local flow propagators in order to characterise local properties of porous media and to study local transport behaviour we propose a new concept the local flow propagator the local flow propagator is derived by decomposing the global flow propagator according to a parameter f 11 f t m a c r o δ where t macro is the total time a tracer stayed in macro pore regions in the process of numerical simulations we record both the displacement and the time fraction f of tracers after an observation time of δ we count the displacements of all tracers and decompose the global flow propagator p δ z into a series of local flow propagators p δ z f on the time fraction domain in particular for f 0 the corresponding local flow propagator p δ z f 0 shows a probability distribution of tracers displacement in micro pore regions for f 1 the local flow propagator p δ z f 1 stands for the flow status in macro pore regions while for 0 f 1 the local flow propagators p δ z 0 f 1 reflect flow behaviour of tracers that crossed boundaries of micro pore and macro pore regions in addition we also count the number of tracers for different time fraction f and the corresponding volumetric fraction v can be derived via 12 v n f n where n f is the number of tracers for a certain time fraction and n is the total number of tracers 5 3 edt based flow propagators for the purpose of measuring the depth of intrusion from macro into micro porosity and vice versa we calculate the euclidean distance transformation edt of the macro porous and micro porous regions fig 5 by merging the such labeled porosity with the respective large or small spheres then carrying out the distance calculations using a parallelized version of the algorithm of saito and toriwaki 1994 see also arns et al 2005 instead of tracking displacement z in the flow direction we record how deep z euclidean distance tracers will invade from micro to macro pore regions and vice versa this newly defined flow propagator is noted as p δ z l ab or p δ z l ba depending on the direction of tracers invasion tracers starting from macro porous regions a that sit at micro porous regions b at time δ are labeled as l ab similarly some of the tracers we released everywhere are labeled as l ba 6 results 6 1 global flow propagators nmr flow propagator measurements were performed in this study to validate numerical simulations we measured global flow propagators for the dual scale bead pack the corresponding simulations were performed on the grf models a comparison of flow propagator measurements and simulations is illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 depicts the flow propagator measurements and simulations at different observation times for the dual scale bead pack and corresponding grf model the simulations agree well with nmr measurements in terms of the shapes of propagators at different observation times based on the flow propagators we calculated mean displacement and compare it with theoretical values which is the product of actual flow rate and certain observation times the differences between simulated mean displacements and theoretical values at observation times are less than 5 while experimentally the difference is around 20 many factors can be responsible for the mismatch especially the signal to noise ratio because we used a low field nmr system the negative displacements that are evident in fig 6 can be caused by self diffusion and back flow in the velocity field fig 4 negative velocities appear mainly in micro porous regions and their magnitudes are relatively small in simulations the velocity field is scaled to the actual flow rate 1154μm s the corresponding maximal and minimal velocity in the velocity field are 17145 17 145μm s and 1410 1410μm s for the observation time of 40ms theoretically the largest displacement is 685 8μm and the largest back flow is 56 4μm meanwhile according to eq 10 the mean displacement of self diffusion is 23μm which is comparable with theoretical maximal back flow thus it is difficult to decide which part is the main reason for negative displacements self diffusion or back flow although in this study focus on dual scale bead pack the simple geometry of spheres guaranteed a well connected system the single peak moves slowly to the positive direction of the axis with the increase of observation time meanwhile there is no second peak appearing near zero displacement which was observed for flow propagator measurements on sandstone and portland carbonate scheven et al 2005 the peak near zero displacement is caused by self diffusion of fluid trapped in isolated pore spaces the absence of the second peak in our study indicates a well connected system the mean displacement of measured flow propagator for 240ms is about 277μm which is smaller than the diameter of the small beads 500μm however in this study we fully exploit the flexibility of numerical simulations and carry out new concepts of local analysis including local flow propagator and edt based flow propagator in the current case the experimental and numerical displacements are limited to the order of the size of the smaller beads which will derive less demonstrating results ideally we can extend the observation times to get larger displacements more fluid exchange between different regions and further penetration of fluid from regions to regions of different pore size scale however experimentally it is very difficult to achieve the goal using the low field nmr system given that simulated and measured global flow propagators at four different observation times agree well we assume the numerical simulation is reliable and extend the simulation times to conduct local analysis the observation times for numerical simulation in local analysis are 280ms 560ms 1120ms and 2280ms in addition we also added three sets of mean velocities including 0μm s 574μm s 1842μm s to the originally used 1154μm s 6 2 local flow propagators as is described in section 5 2 we decomposed a global flow propagator simulated at mean velocity 1842μm for 2240ms into a series of local flow propagators based on time fraction f fig 7 among all the flow propagators the bandwidth of the local flow propagator of micro porous regions p δ z f 0 is much narrower than that of macro porous regions p δ z f 1 which directly illustrates the permeability difference of micro and macro porous regions for tracers which crossed region boundaries 0 0 f 1 0 the bandwidths of their flow propagators sit in between and a clear transition of the shapes of local propagators is observed from f 0 to f 1 the negative displacements of all local flow propagators at different time fractions overlapped in fig 7 as is described in the section 6 1 the mean displacement of self diffusion is comparable to that of back flow which mainly appears in micro porous regions however the negative displacements of local flow propagators at all time fractions particularly f 1 presented a similar behaviour indicating that the self diffusion may be the main reason for the appearance of negative displacements the parameter v is the volumetric fraction of tracers at a certain time fraction we sum v of all tracers of 0 0 f 1 0 and the result is the total volumetric fraction of exchanged fluids between micro and macro porous regions which we call normalised exchange volume in the following context for convenience we calculated the exchange volumes for different velocities and observation times and the results are listed in table 1 then the data in the table is depicted in fig 8 to study the influence of observation time and velocity on exchange volume separately fluid exchange between micro and macro porous regions may occur due to either convection flow or diffusion at a fixed observation time exchange volumes contributed from diffusion can be assumed constant and these volumes are plotted in fig 8 b where the velocity equals 0μm s in the fig 8 a the exchange volume increases almost linearly with velocity increase indicating a major contribution from convection flow at higher velocities this can be proven from the data points where the velocity is smaller than 574μm s these points deviate from the straight line at low velocities because diffusion effect is dominant to further illustrate this behaviour we plot the same data in a different way in fig 8 b for a fixed mean velocity a non linear correlation between exchange volume and observation time is observed different curves correspond to different velocities and higher velocities reduce the influence of diffusion so the curves transform gradually from a non linear shape for pure diffusion red line to more linear like shapes at higher mean velocities 6 3 edt based flow propagators consider now the edt map based propagators describing the fluid invasion from macro to micro porous regions p δ z l ab or on the opposite direction p δ z l ba fig 9 for self diffusion the displacement is depended on the tortuosity of the porous media for bead packs of different scales the tortuosity is the same so the tracers on both directions micro macro vs macro micro present a very similar probability decrease for flow the probability of tracers penetrating to both directions are very similar near regions boundaries euclidean distance is around zero with increasing euclidean distance the probability of tracers starting from macro porous regions labeled as l ab decreases steadily while for tracers invading macro porous regions the curve shows a sharp probability decrease at the beginning and then decreasing steadily this behaviour can be explained like this when tracers enter micro porous regions the convection flow is relatively weak and diffusion contributes a lot to the movement so the probability decrease in this case is similar to self diffusion on the other hand when tracers penetrate into macro porous regions the convection flow is strong and the tracers will be carried away immediately leading to a sharp decrease of probability near the boundary areas however the connectivity and permeability in macro porous regions is higher than that of micro porous regions so the invaded tracers can be carried further resulting in higher probability of large euclidean distances at very large distance the probability suddenly drops down we are not very sure about the reason probably it occurs due to insufficient of tracers although we released more than one billion seeds in total less than half of them actually exchanged between different regions in the exchanged volumes the number of invaded tracers those actually stayed in the target regions may be very small furthermore the number of invaded tracers with large distance is thousands of times smaller the ratio of mean displacements between p δ z l ab and p δ z l ba could potentially be a useful parameter to characterizecharacterise dual scale structures at fixed mean flow velocity and observation time homogeneous samples are excepted to exhibit a ratio close to 1 this could be studied in future work with different dual scale samples such as indiana limestone we also plot the transition probability map in a 2d slice fig 10 this is essentially a 2d visualisation of fig 9 please note that the color scales of color bars are not the same 7 discussion and conclusion in this work we measured global flow propagators in dual scale beads pack using nmr and they agree well with lbm and random walk assisted numerical simulations based on the global flow propagator measurements and simulations we propose two kinds of regional analysis methods local flow propagators and edt based flow propagators the former can be used to study the local flow behaviour and fluid exchange between regions of different scales and the latter edt based flow propagator is useful when investigating fluid invasion particular points to note include 1 more practical use of edt based propagator concept may be found in the context of contamination control as it can describe the depth of invasion of contaminants into micro porous regions which may control the ultimate time for contaminant being released from the micro porosity at significant proportions 2 we considered systems with a clear hierarchy of length scales a more complex case would be posed by carbonate rock where multiple classes representing different micro structure may be present 3 at this point we considered the case of single fluid phase transport a natural extension to multi phase flow is out of the scope of this work but will be the subject of a future publication 4 we assumed that relaxation effects in nmr measurements are not significant this might be a too optimistic assumption and additional contrast would be gained by including this effect the same situation applies to internal gradient effects acknowledgments the

1668,the characterisation of heterogeneous porous media at multiple length scales typically requires the classification of structure at some scale to allow the calculation of effective transport properties at a scale relevant for macroscopic description while such a classification may be derived from various imaging methods a shortcoming is often the simultaneous characterisation of the connectivity between regions representing different micro structure in this work we combine nmr based flow propagators with the simulations performed on corresponding reconstructed structure and relate the nmr measurements to their simulated global and local representations to study fluid transport locally and the exchange between micro and macro porous regions this is achieved by carrying out detailed lattice boltzmann simulations and random walk method to track the displacements of tracers in each kind of region using euclidean distance maps edt we analyse the fluid invasion to regions of different scale and relate it to the connectivity of the system we demonstrate that numerical simulation has great flexibility in providing additional sensitivity to the inference of region

engineering or contaminant flow in groundwater applications or the handling of waste water e g in mining applications to name but a few dispersion a phenomenon in fluid dynamics controlling the evolution of concentration in reactive flow is of specific interest in contaminant hydrology one important step towards modellingmodeling of reactive transport in porous systems is understanding the mechanisms time and spatial scales at which exchange of molecular populations occurs flow propagator is a convenient concept to study dynamics of these effects the dispersion of a neutral tracer over time can be expressed by the flow propagator the conditional probability p r 0 r δ that a molecule initially at position r 0 moves to location r during the time interval δ wang and uhlenbeck 1945 while for homogeneous media the average flow propagator independent of initial position would describe the system fully kärger and heink 1983 pointed out that for heterogeneous media the analysis is significantly more complex in particular it is difficult to characterise at the same time both the different heterogeneity length scales e g by direct imaging methods like micro x ray ct and the connectivity of the system at all relevant scales this is due to the finite field of view fov at given resolution for micro x ray ct methods and the finite time of flight tof or observation time using

bead pack sample composed of two types of beads a soda lime glass slg beads 0 5mm actual mean diameter 0 495 0 040 mm produced by mo sci corp and b borosilicate glass bsg beads 1 5mm actual mean diameter 1 532 0 110 mm of unknown manufacturer fig 1 shows an in home built flow cell 3cm diameter and 5cm long containing clusters made by two types of beads labeled as a and b respectively the volumetric fraction of each type is even saturated porosity is the same ϕ 37 0 and mean pore size is different by a factor three blackthe bsg 1 5mm beads are diamagnetic with volumetric susceptibility χ v 4 4 0 4 μ si while the slg 0 5mm beads are weakly paramagnetic with χ v 26 5 9 2 μ si since measurements were performed at relatively low field strength 0 047teslat we consider the effect of internal fields as negligible to first order 2 2 grf model we generated a 3d structure capturing the salient features of the dual scale beads pack system by combining different stochastic processes fig 2 in particular we use a stationary gaussian random field grf to partition space into macro and micro porous regions see e g arns et al 2004 for an extensive description in each partition a stochastic process is carried out placing spheres the resulting model acknowledges beads size porosity and volumetric fraction of each type of beads the small beads are represented by spheres of 13voxels radius and the large ones have a radius of 39voxels and we assign a resolution of 38 5μm these spheres are placed following a poisson process with rejection arns et al 2001 followed by a dilation step to achieve a target porosity of 37 realising the so called cherry pit model torquato 2002 here for a dual scale medium it is worth mentioning that the grf model is more convenient than a micro ct image of a dual scale bead pack in our simulations this is due to the immediate provision of distinct labels for micro pores macro pores big spheres and small spheres during our simulations these labels are essential on the other hand imaging the sample using micro ct great efforts are required in segmentation process to generate relevant labels and it is difficult to properly partition micro porous regions and macro porous regions 3 nmr propagator measurements the nmr flow propagator measurements were performed on our 2mhz magritek rock core analyzer equipped with p54 probe fig 3 shows the pulse sequence diagram of a basic nmr flow propagator experiment based on tanner s 1970 pulsed field gradient pfg stimulated echo technique known as pgste this technique is frequently used to measure bulk and restricted diffusion and flow propagators as et al 1998 codd and altobelli 2003 seymour et al 2007 alternatively a bi polar variant of the pgste apgste pulse sequence is employed if internal gradients are of concern scheven et al 2004 singer et al 2006 sham et al 2013 the disadvantage of the apgste technique comparing to ordinary unipolar pgste is the approximately by factor two longer minimum displacement encoding time interval δ this is due to limitations of hardware requiring significant delay δ 2 after executing gradient pulses to dissipate eddy currents in our system this time interval is about 5ms we compared flow propagator measurements in bead packs using pgste and apgste and observed very similar results due to insignificance of internal gradients the pgste flow propagator relies on stimulated spin echo i e the first π 2 pulse tips the magnetization to the transverse plane and then a pulsed gradient field is applied to imprint the initial position distribution onto the phase space of the magnetization subsequently a second π 2 pulse is applied to store the phase information on the longitudinal direction for a period τ 2 during which no further phase shift is accumulated a third π 2 pulse rotates the stored magnetization back to the transverse plane followed by a refocusing pulsed gradient field to generate an echo the difference of the spin positions along the gradient direction z i for a single gradient setup at the first and second gradient pulses produces an accumulated phase given by 1 ϕ i δ γ g z δ z i δ z i 0 γ g z δ z i δ which is the phase shift of the i th spin that moved a distance z i δ along the direction of the applied gradients g z in eq 1 γ is the gyromagnetic ratio and δ denotes the duration of applied gradients the amplitude of the echo s δ is measured for a set of gradient intensities from g max to g max and the flow propagator p δ z is obtained from an inverse fourier transform of all echo amplitudes as function of the gradient intensity 2 s δ q z p δ z e i 2 π q z z δ d z where the amplitude of one dimensional magnetization wave vector q is given by q z γg z δ 2π kärger and heink 1983 flow propagators were acquired using 128 gradient steps n g spaced from 0 25 to 0 25t m providing sufficient field of flow fof for the selected experimental conditions 3 f o f 2 z m a x n g q z δ we used an observation time δ in the 40ms to 240ms interval which corresponds to fof of 4mms 1 or more which exceeds the maximum expected velocity by a wide margin thus satisfying one requirement for the fourier transformation we performed experiments using 4 step phase cycling the radio frequency π 2 pulse duration was 20μs and the gradient effective length accounted for ramping up and down was 3ms signals were accumulated over 8 scans with a long inter scan waiting time of 25secondss to ensure full polarisation teledyne isco d260 pumps were used to maintain continuous flow at a constant rate of up to 18ml min 4 lattice boltzmann simulations the lattice boltzmann method lbm has been widely employed in many areas of porous media simulation yua et al 2003 talon et al 2012 liu and mostaghimi 2016 in digital core analysis lbm has been applied to simulate the dynamics of single and two phase flow r rojas and tomiyama 2012 the distinct properties of lbm such as easy handling of boundary conditions as well as the approach being amenable to parallel computing makes it a good choice for applications on digital rocks talon et al 2012 pan et al 2006 in this study we apply two lbm schemes the more stable two relaxation time lattice boltzmann model to simulate the dynamics of single phase fluid flow in rock microstructure lattice boltzmann solvers are known to solve the discrete boltzmann equations and recover navier stokes behaviorbehaviour in the small knudsen number regime the methodology of the lattice boltzmann model starts with the initialization of distribution functions these functions then enter an iterative loop that computes macroscopic fluid properties according to 4 ρ i 1 n 19 f i 5 ρ u i 1 n 19 f e i where ρ is the macroscopic fluid density f i e q is the equilibrium distribution function e i are the microscopic velocity vectors and u is the macroscopic velocity after applying boundary conditions the fluid density then evolves according to the most distinctive aspect of the lattice boltzmann numerical model the stream and collide operation 6 f i x e i δ t t δ t f i x t f i x t f i e q x t τ here τ represents the relaxation time the definition of the relaxation time is the key defining algorithmic difference between the two lbm schemes used here pang et al 2004 a single relaxation time approach implies using a single relaxation rate to bring the distribution functions to equilibrium for the two relaxation time a choice has to be made of two rates of relaxation for the distribution functions this choice is not trivial and depends on what level of accuracy is required in a particular simulation manwart et al 2002 kuzmin and derksen 2011 huang and wu 2016 in the two relaxation time approach the user may need to set the so called magic parameters to recover a more accurate solution ginzburg et al 2010 fattahia et al 2015 dubois et al 2010 dubois et al 2008 d humières and ginzburg 2009 the two approaches have different levels of accuracy and different windows of stability in applying the single relaxation time lbm approach τ is allowed to take only one value between 0 6 and unity d humières et al 2002 in the two relaxation time approach two values are assigned to τ in the implementation here the approach in kuzmin and derksen 2011 allen and reis 2013 is followed the multiple relaxation time mrt lbm is adapted to a trt in this simulation we make a choice of 7 s 1 1 τ 8 s 2 8 2 τ 1 8 τ 1 here s 1 and s 2 are the even and odd order relaxation rates for detailed implementation of the trt lbm algorithm the reader is referred to yua et al 2003 and allen and reis 2013 5 simulation of flow propagators 5 1 global flow propagators in our study all measured propagators and the respective simulated propagators are specifically called global flow propagators in order to distinguish them from the simulated local flow propagator we propose for local analysis the global flow propagator measurements and simulations have been conducted on the dual scale bead pack to validate the methodology described in the following paragraphs the 3d structure is seeded with ϕ 8003 tracers thus one tracer in every pore voxel and all tracers are started at the respective centre point of their voxels the velocity field resultant from the lbm simulations fig 4 is loaded and convection diffusion movement is applied as transport model for each time step δt the displacement of tracers affected by convection d c is calculated from the velocity field 9 d c δ t v x y z where v x y z is a velocity vector for tracers at the position r x y z then we use a random walk method to simulate diffusion in 3d simulations the displacements of diffusion d d is are calculated by 10 d d 6 d δ t where d is the self diffusion coefficient of the fluid the direction of d d is randomly chosen arbitrarily from any direction on the 3d model bergman et al 1995 at last we count the displacements of all the tracers and derive the distribution along flow direction thus the simulated flow propagator p δ z 5 2 local flow propagators in order to characterise local properties of porous media and to study local transport behaviour we propose a new concept the local flow propagator the local flow propagator is derived by decomposing the global flow propagator according to a parameter f 11 f t m a c r o δ where t macro is the total time a tracer stayed in macro pore regions in the process of numerical simulations we record both the displacement and the time fraction f of tracers after an observation time of δ we count the displacements of all tracers and decompose the global flow propagator p δ z into a series of local flow propagators p δ z f on the time fraction domain in particular for f 0 the corresponding local flow propagator p δ z f 0 shows a probability distribution of tracers displacement in micro pore regions for f 1 the local flow propagator p δ z f 1 stands for the flow status in macro pore regions while for 0 f 1 the local flow propagators p δ z 0 f 1 reflect flow behaviour of tracers that crossed boundaries of micro pore and macro pore regions in addition we also count the number of tracers for different time fraction f and the corresponding volumetric fraction v can be derived via 12 v n f n where n f is the number of tracers for a certain time fraction and n is the total number of tracers 5 3 edt based flow propagators for the purpose of measuring the depth of intrusion from macro into micro porosity and vice versa we calculate the euclidean distance transformation edt of the macro porous and micro porous regions fig 5 by merging the such labeled porosity with the respective large or small spheres then carrying out the distance calculations using a parallelized version of the algorithm of saito and toriwaki 1994 see also arns et al 2005 instead of tracking displacement z in the flow direction we record how deep z euclidean distance tracers will invade from micro to macro pore regions and vice versa this newly defined flow propagator is noted as p δ z l ab or p δ z l ba depending on the direction of tracers invasion tracers starting from macro porous regions a that sit at micro porous regions b at time δ are labeled as l ab similarly some of the tracers we released everywhere are labeled as l ba 6 results 6 1 global flow propagators nmr flow propagator measurements were performed in this study to validate numerical simulations we measured global flow propagators for the dual scale bead pack the corresponding simulations were performed on the grf models a comparison of flow propagator measurements and simulations is illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 depicts the flow propagator measurements and simulations at different observation times for the dual scale bead pack and corresponding grf model the simulations agree well with nmr measurements in terms of the shapes of propagators at different observation times based on the flow propagators we calculated mean displacement and compare it with theoretical values which is the product of actual flow rate and certain observation times the differences between simulated mean displacements and theoretical values at observation times are less than 5 while experimentally the difference is around 20 many factors can be responsible for the mismatch especially the signal to noise ratio because we used a low field nmr system the negative displacements that are evident in fig 6 can be caused by self diffusion and back flow in the velocity field fig 4 negative velocities appear mainly in micro porous regions and their magnitudes are relatively small in simulations the velocity field is scaled to the actual flow rate 1154μm s the corresponding maximal and minimal velocity in the velocity field are 17145 17 145μm s and 1410 1410μm s for the observation time of 40ms theoretically the largest displacement is 685 8μm and the largest back flow is 56 4μm meanwhile according to eq 10 the mean displacement of self diffusion is 23μm which is comparable with theoretical maximal back flow thus it is difficult to decide which part is the main reason for negative displacements self diffusion or back flow although in this study focus on dual scale bead pack the simple geometry of spheres guaranteed a well connected system the single peak moves slowly to the positive direction of the axis with the increase of observation time meanwhile there is no second peak appearing near zero displacement which was observed for flow propagator measurements on sandstone and portland carbonate scheven et al 2005 the peak near zero displacement is caused by self diffusion of fluid trapped in isolated pore spaces the absence of the second peak in our study indicates a well connected system the mean displacement of measured flow propagator for 240ms is about 277μm which is smaller than the diameter of the small beads 500μm however in this study we fully exploit the flexibility of numerical simulations and carry out new concepts of local analysis including local flow propagator and edt based flow propagator in the current case the experimental and numerical displacements are limited to the order of the size of the smaller beads which will derive less demonstrating results ideally we can extend the observation times to get larger displacements more fluid exchange between different regions and further penetration of fluid from regions to regions of different pore size scale however experimentally it is very difficult to achieve the goal using the low field nmr system given that simulated and measured global flow propagators at four different observation times agree well we assume the numerical simulation is reliable and extend the simulation times to conduct local analysis the observation times for numerical simulation in local analysis are 280ms 560ms 1120ms and 2280ms in addition we also added three sets of mean velocities including 0μm s 574μm s 1842μm s to the originally used 1154μm s 6 2 local flow propagators as is described in section 5 2 we decomposed a global flow propagator simulated at mean velocity 1842μm for 2240ms into a series of local flow propagators based on time fraction f fig 7 among all the flow propagators the bandwidth of the local flow propagator of micro porous regions p δ z f 0 is much narrower than that of macro porous regions p δ z f 1 which directly illustrates the permeability difference of micro and macro porous regions for tracers which crossed region boundaries 0 0 f 1 0 the bandwidths of their flow propagators sit in between and a clear transition of the shapes of local propagators is observed from f 0 to f 1 the negative displacements of all local flow propagators at different time fractions overlapped in fig 7 as is described in the section 6 1 the mean displacement of self diffusion is comparable to that of back flow which mainly appears in micro porous regions however the negative displacements of local flow propagators at all time fractions particularly f 1 presented a similar behaviour indicating that the self diffusion may be the main reason for the appearance of negative displacements the parameter v is the volumetric fraction of tracers at a certain time fraction we sum v of all tracers of 0 0 f 1 0 and the result is the total volumetric fraction of exchanged fluids between micro and macro porous regions which we call normalised exchange volume in the following context for convenience we calculated the exchange volumes for different velocities and observation times and the results are listed in table 1 then the data in the table is depicted in fig 8 to study the influence of observation time and velocity on exchange volume separately fluid exchange between micro and macro porous regions may occur due to either convection flow or diffusion at a fixed observation time exchange volumes contributed from diffusion can be assumed constant and these volumes are plotted in fig 8 b where the velocity equals 0μm s in the fig 8 a the exchange volume increases almost linearly with velocity increase indicating a major contribution from convection flow at higher velocities this can be proven from the data points where the velocity is smaller than 574μm s these points deviate from the straight line at low velocities because diffusion effect is dominant to further illustrate this behaviour we plot the same data in a different way in fig 8 b for a fixed mean velocity a non linear correlation between exchange volume and observation time is observed different curves correspond to different velocities and higher velocities reduce the influence of diffusion so the curves transform gradually from a non linear shape for pure diffusion red line to more linear like shapes at higher mean velocities 6 3 edt based flow propagators consider now the edt map based propagators describing the fluid invasion from macro to micro porous regions p δ z l ab or on the opposite direction p δ z l ba fig 9 for self diffusion the displacement is depended on the tortuosity of the porous media for bead packs of different scales the tortuosity is the same so the tracers on both directions micro macro vs macro micro present a very similar probability decrease for flow the probability of tracers penetrating to both directions are very similar near regions boundaries euclidean distance is around zero with increasing euclidean distance the probability of tracers starting from macro porous regions labeled as l ab decreases steadily while for tracers invading macro porous regions the curve shows a sharp probability decrease at the beginning and then decreasing steadily this behaviour can be explained like this when tracers enter micro porous regions the convection flow is relatively weak and diffusion contributes a lot to the movement so the probability decrease in this case is similar to self diffusion on the other hand when tracers penetrate into macro porous regions the convection flow is strong and the tracers will be carried away immediately leading to a sharp decrease of probability near the boundary areas however the connectivity and permeability in macro porous regions is higher than that of micro porous regions so the invaded tracers can be carried further resulting in higher probability of large euclidean distances at very large distance the probability suddenly drops down we are not very sure about the reason probably it occurs due to insufficient of tracers although we released more than one billion seeds in total less than half of them actually exchanged between different regions in the exchanged volumes the number of invaded tracers those actually stayed in the target regions may be very small furthermore the number of invaded tracers with large distance is thousands of times smaller the ratio of mean displacements between p δ z l ab and p δ z l ba could potentially be a useful parameter to characterizecharacterise dual scale structures at fixed mean flow velocity and observation time homogeneous samples are excepted to exhibit a ratio close to 1 this could be studied in future work with different dual scale samples such as indiana limestone we also plot the transition probability map in a 2d slice fig 10 this is essentially a 2d visualisation of fig 9 please note that the color scales of color bars are not the same 7 discussion and conclusion in this work we measured global flow propagators in dual scale beads pack using nmr and they agree well with lbm and random walk assisted numerical simulations based on the global flow propagator measurements and simulations we propose two kinds of regional analysis methods local flow propagators and edt based flow propagators the former can be used to study the local flow behaviour and fluid exchange between regions of different scales and the latter edt based flow propagator is useful when investigating fluid invasion particular points to note include 1 more practical use of edt based propagator concept may be found in the context of contamination control as it can describe the depth of invasion of contaminants into micro porous regions which may control the ultimate time for contaminant being released from the micro porosity at significant proportions 2 we considered systems with a clear hierarchy of length scales a more complex case would be posed by carbonate rock where multiple classes representing different micro structure may be present 3 at this point we considered the case of single fluid phase transport a natural extension to multi phase flow is out of the scope of this work but will be the subject of a future publication 4 we assumed that relaxation effects in nmr measurements are not significant this might be a too optimistic assumption and additional contrast would be gained by including this effect the same situation applies to internal gradient effects acknowledgments the

1669,sequestered mass in low permeability zones has been increasingly recognized as an important source of organic chemical contamination that acts to sustain downgradient plume concentrations above regulated levels however few modeling studies have investigated the influence of this sequestered mass and associated coupled mass transfer processes on plume persistence in complex dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones this paper employs a multiphase flow and transport simulator a modified version of the modular transport simulator mt3dms to explore the two and three dimensional evolution of source zone mass distribution and near source plume persistence for two ensembles of highly heterogeneous dnapl source zone realizations simulations reveal the strong influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the complexity of dnapl and sequestered immobile sorbed mass distribution small zones of entrapped dnapl are shown to serve as a persistent source of low concentration plumes difficult to distinguish from other sorbed and immobile dissolved sequestered mass sources results suggest that the presence of dnapl tends to control plume longevity in the near source area for the examined scenarios a substantial fraction 43 3 99 2 of plume life was sustained by dnapl dissolution processes the presence of sorptive media and the extent of sorption non ideality are shown to greatly affect predictions of near source plume persistence following dnapl depletion with plume persistence varying one to two orders of magnitude with the selected sorption model results demonstrate the importance of sorption controlled back diffusion from low permeability zones and reveal the importance of selecting the appropriate sorption model for accurate prediction of plume longevity large discrepancies for both dnapl depletion time and plume longevity were observed between 2 d and 3 d model simulations differences between 2 and 3 d predictions increased in the presence of sorption especially for the case of non ideal sorption demonstrating the limitations of employing 2 d predictions for field scale modeling keywords plume persistence sorption dnapl back diffusion

appreciated and demonstrated by analyses of groundwater monitoring well and soil core data at aged field sites e g ball et al 1997 brusseau and guo 2014 chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 parker et al 2004 at the laboratory scale a number of benchmark experiments in aquifer cells have demonstrated that mass flux from low permeability zones can cause persistent plume tailing after dnapl depletion e g chapman et al 2012 rodriguez 2006 sale et al 2008 b wilking et al 2013 yang et al 2015 most of these laboratory experiments have been confined to idealized geometrical representations of physical heterogeneity and simple aqueous phase mass loading conditions real source zones however exhibit much greater physical and chemical complexity characterized by more irregular physical heterogeneity and the presence of multiple phases dnapl aqueous sorbed and co existing mass transfer processes herein the term source zone refers to the subsurface region originally in contact with dnapl containing dnapl aqueous and sorbed phase mass nrc 2004 to date only a few laboratory studies have created source zones by injecting dnapl into aquifer cells rodriguez 2006 wilking et al 2013 but these have used highly simplified physical scenarios thus while providing qualitative insights pertaining to the process of bd the implications of these laboratory studies for field remediation practices are not easily identified mathematical models have been used in a number of studies to identify influential factors in plume persistence and to interpret laboratory and field data based upon their simplicity and ease of application analytical models have been employed by some researchers to predict the development of down gradient plumes during bd in one 1 d and two dimensional 2 d domains e g adamson et al 2015 ball et al 1997 bear et al 1994 brown et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 sale et al 2008 b seyedabbasi et al 2012 wilson 1997 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 as well as in three dimensions 3 d parker and kim 2015 these applications however have necessarily been restricted to idealized geometric configurations and have employed simplifying assumptions such as infinite or semi infinite clay layers no flow in low permeability zones and non diminishing dnapl volumes in contrast numerical models with the potential to be tailored to more detailed and realistic conditions have become important tools for long term site management and decision making a number of studies have employed numerical models to capture diffusive mass transport into low permeability zones and to predict persistence of plume tailing due to bd chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 in general these previous numerical simulation studies have been implemented on idealized domains i e those with horizontal layering perfect stratification chapman and parker 2005 matthieu et al 2014 or those consisting of homogeneous background units with one or several uniform inclusions of low permeable materials chapman et al 2012 maghrebi et al 2014 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 at real field sites however variability of permeability at the small scale can range over several orders of magnitude maghrebi et al 2015 is the only previous numerical modeling investigation of bd that incorporated a heterogeneous permeability field generated by a geostatistical model in addition to the previous research cited above a few numerical studies have investigated the influence of diffusion on contaminant transport in complex heterogeneous formations e g janković et al 2009 labolle and fogg 2001 rolle et al 2013 these studies however did not focus on plume persistence caused by bd although sorption is an important process within many low permeability units and can influence mass transfer the influence of sorption on the mass rebound process in chlorinated solvent source zones has not generally been as well recognized as that of diffusion while a few previous modeling studies maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 rodriguez 2006 have incorporated sorption and explored the effect of sorption properties on plume tailing most have emphasized the effect of diffusion in addition these studies have typically assumed local equilibrium and isotherm linearity many experimental studies however have demonstrated that the linear equilibrium assumption fails to capture observed behavior thus sorption processes in the subsurface should typically be characterized as nonlinear and or rate limited particularly over the wide range of concentrations encountered within dnapl source zones e g allen king et al 2002 rivett et al 2006 wang et al 2013 although matthieu et al 2014 briefly discussed the potential influence of sorption kinetics and equilibrium on the rates of mass removal in their work they did not use modeling results to support this discussion furthermore the use of simplified configurations of permeability heterogeneity in previous simulation studies also resulted in limited spatial variation of sorption parameters it is widely recognized however that heterogeneity of sorption properties can substantially influence solute transport and result in asymptotic concentration tailing e g aksoy and culver 2004 rabideau and miller 1994 most of the previous simulation studies cited above modeled mass emanating from dnapl source zones by incorporating source functions that were either constant chapman and parker 2005 maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 parker et al 2008 or adjusted based on known data chapman and parker 2005 rodriguez 2006 these models did not incorporate dnapl dissolution and thus could not include heterogeneous dnapl saturation distributions as model inputs however it is now widely recognized that the distribution of dnapl within a source zone also known as dnapl architecture developed under the influence of a number of site specific conditions e g dekker and abriola 2000 lemke et al 2004 a can be quite complex e g kueper et al 1993 mercer and cohen 1990 and that this dnapl architecture will largely control the behavior and longevity of dissolved mass plumes e g christ et al 2010 christ et al 2006 lemke et al 2004 b parker and park 2004 phelan et al 2004 thus it will be important to consider the spatial distribution of dnapl in any investigation of bd and plume persistence in heterogeneous source zones finally most of the previous simulations investigating bd have been performed in 2 d domains chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 with only a few conducted in 3 d maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 reduced dimensionality simulations however may not be able to completely capture flow bypassing effects or accurately predict the magnitude and penetration depth of mass in lower permeability zones thus plume persistence may vary with model dimensionality and it will be important to compare concentration rebound predictions in two and three dimensions as highlighted above although consideration of simplified scenarios can provide a preliminary assessment of the influence of bd on plume longevity models based upon such idealized scenarios cannot capture the full complexity of field conditions the objective of this study is to more comprehensively explore the influence of dissolution sorption and diffusion process coupling on source longevity and near source plume persistence in complex geologic environments through numerical modeling in this work a series of transport simulations was undertaken for a suite of dnapl source zone realizations in 2 d heterogeneous domains under a number of alternative sorption property scenarios selected comparisons with 3 d simulations provide additional insight into the influence of model dimensionality on plume longevity predictions 2 methodology transport simulations were performed using a modified version of the modular three dimensional transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 adapted to incorporate rate limited dissolution from an entrapped dnapl source zone and transient groundwater flow associated with changes in dnapl saturation christ et al 2010 christ et al 2006 parker and park 2004 initial dnapl source zone saturation distributions were obtained by simulating dnapl infiltration and entrapment in highly heterogeneous permeability fields using the simulators michigan vertical and lateral organic redistribution mvalor 2 d abriola et al 1992 or university of texas chemical compositional simulator utchem 3 d delshad et al 1996 the decoupling of infiltration and transport simulations is based on the assumption that the time scales of infiltration and plume development are vastly different weeks to months versus decades a similar decoupled modeling approach was employed by lemke et al 2004b and christ et al 2006

saturation values dnapl depletion results in an increase in aqueous phase mobility and subsequently groundwater flow velocity which in turn drives a faster exchange between dnapl and aqueous phase 2 2 permeability fields permeability field realizations were constructed based on an existing formation for which a high resolution analog dataset is available bayer et al 2011 heinz et al 2003 kostic et al 2005 aquifer materials in this formation were grouped into four dominant lithofacies table 1 based on the aquifer analog and measured permeabilities following the method by maji 2005 a series of 20 3 d realizations of categorical fields for hypothetical field 1were conditionally generated based on 18 synthetic boreholes using a transition probability based markov chain tp mc method carle 1999 2 d realizations were extracted from the x z cross section of the 3 d domains fig 1 using an analogous approach with the same geostatistics another 20 realizations were generated for a second hypothetical field field 2 the two sets of reconstructions capture horizontal stratigraphy present in the formation yet differ in the locations of low permeability layers dnapl infiltration and transport simulations were conducted in realizations of both fields to study the influence of the aquifer formation heterogeneity on plume persistence 2 3 infiltration simulations migration of dnapl

1992 was employed to account for entrapment hysteresis effects this approach uses an apparent effective water saturation that is a function of effective water saturation and immobile organic phase saturation the brooks corey burdine formulations brooks and corey 1964 burdine 1953 were adopted for modeling two phase capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations a detailed description of these constitutive relations can be found in rathfelder and abriola 1998 the coupled nonlinear mass balance equations along with the constitutive relations and the constraint s a s n 1 0 constitute a well posed problem details of the numerical implementation and solution algorithms in 2 and 3 d can be found in abriola et al 1992 and delshad et al 1996 respectively in this work pce was selected as a representative dnapl for all model simulations tables 1 and 2 summarize the input parameters used in the dnapl infiltration simulations for aquifer properties fluid properties and capillary pressure saturation relations air entry pressures and pore size index values for each aquifer material are listed in table 1 because it comprises the largest volumetric portion of the formation gcm was selected for estimation of the reference air entry pressure and pore size index grain size distribution curves obtained from heinz et al 2003 by employing the haverkamp and parlange 1986 method leverett scaling was used to determine the capillary entry pressure for the other three lithofacies table 1 for simplicity and in the absence of data the pore size index table 1 maximum residual dnapl saturation table 2 and irreducible water saturation parameters table 2 were assumed uniform for the four materials the ensembles of 2 d pce saturation distributions were generated by simulating infiltration events using mvalor a total volume of 80 l 130 kg pce was released at a rate of 0 5 l day for field 1 and 2 l day for field 2 from a four node area 0 5m2 in the top layer of the modeled domain fig 1 3 d dnapl infiltration simulations were conducted using utchem in these simulations a total of 320 l 520 kg pce dnapl was released at a rate of 2 l day from a central location in the top grid layer across a 5 4 grid block area of 2 5 m2 fig 1 here the spill volume per nodal area corresponded to that spilled in the 2 d simulations impermeable boundaries were specified for the bottom boundaries of the domains constant pressure and saturation boundaries were specified for the side boundaries and top boundaries the resulting nonuniform saturation distributions were then used as inputs to the transport model representative simulated 2 d and 3 d pce dnapl saturation distributions are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively examination of these figures reveals that the low permeability layers act as capillary barriers to vertical migration until a new vertical pathway is encountered the pce dnapl continues to accumulate and extend horizontally visual inspection of the permeability fields reveals that the occurrence of very high dnapl saturations 0 7 is associated with infiltration into high permeability media that are surrounded by low permeability media which prevent the dnapl from moving horizontally or vertically in comparison to the 2 d simulations the 3 d simulations exhibit different migration pathways with less vertical penetration and more extensive lateral movement of the dnapl the difference between maximum saturations in the 2 and 3 d simulations is however small 2 2 which suggests a relatively small influence of dimensionality in determining maximum dnapl saturation on the other hand a comparison of a and b in figs 2 and 3 reveals that dnapl distributions for fields 1 and 2 differ markedly attributed to the locations of low permeability layers in the domain for field 2 simulations much of the dnapl spreads and pools above low permeability layers at the bottom of the domain for field 1 simulations the dnapl either resides in the top part of the domain or penetrates down and accumulates on the bottom boundary a comparison of initial dnapl distribution table 3 shows that 3 d simulations exhibit fewer pools high saturation cells than those in 2 d attributed to the greater lateral spreading and field 1 has more dnapl pools than field 2 attributed to the low permeability layer configuration the slight reduction in average dnapl mass compared to the initial release volume is attributed to dnapl migration out of the domain across vertical boundaries during the infiltration simulation plots of the initial dnapl saturation distributions for the ensembles of 20 simulations for fields 1 and 2 can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 transport model parameters for the transport simulations a natural hydraulic gradient of 0 01 was imposed on the domain producing average linear groundwater velocities of approximately 0 9 m day in the majority of the domain and 0 02 m day in lower permeable zones the physicochemical parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 dispersivities and solid bulk density were taken from a modeling study of dnapl dissolution in a similar hydrogeological setting constructed by tp mc maji and sudicky 2008 table 4 lists sorption related parameters used in the simulations these were estimated from the literature since sorptive property information for the field materials was not available in the absence of measured data the linear equilibrium sorption of solutes to aquifer solids can be estimated using a distribution coefficient k d k oc f oc where k oc l3 m 1 is the partition coefficient to organic carbon and f oc is mass fractional of soil organic carbon estimated values of k oc for pce range from 200 ml g to 600 ml g boethling and mackay 2000 lyman et al 1990 a k oc value of 400 l kg was employed here based on sedimentary studies of the prototype aquifer in southwestern germany heinz et al 2003 kleineidam et al 1999 a 1999 b lithofacies gcm s x and bgcm were treated as low organic carbon content deposits with f oc of 0 035 the finest material gs x was treated as the most sorptive in the transport simulations with a f oc approximately one order of magnitude larger this relatively high value was selected so that the influence of a strongly sorptive medium on dnapl source zone persistence could be explored the value is consistent with other foc values reported for fine materials in the literature ranging from 0 1 to 2 delle site 2001 domenico and schwartz 1997 for consistency and to further facilitate the study of desorption and back diffusion herein the hydraulic conductivity and grain size were reduced for this lowest permeability material gs x bracketed values in table 1 in the transport simulations to better reflect hydraulic characteristics consistent with a highly sorptive material for the nonlinear equilibrium sorption model the freundlich exponent n f was selected from within the range 0 8 0 9 rivett et al 2006 the freundlich coefficient k f was then calculated to ensure comparability with the corresponding linear isotherm for each material by minimizing the difference in total sorbed mass between the linear and nonlinear models over an aqueous concentration range of 0 to the pce solubility value a first order mass transfer coefficient for solute pce sorption from gs x materials was selected within the range of reported literature values in published field scale simulations these vary over several orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 10 2 day 1 aksoy and culver 2004 and aksoy and culver 2000 goltz and roberts 1988 and goltz and roberts 1986 the other three materials were treated as less sorptive materials and thus assigned higher mass transfer rate values 3 d domains 16 40 7 m were discretized into 373 815 cells with a resolution of 0 25 0 5 0 1 m in the x y and z directions the same grid spacing in the x and z directions was used for 2 d domains 6 7 m an adaptive time step procedure with an initial time step maximum time step and a time step multiplier was implemented to handle the high concentration gradient near the dnapl source at early times and the relatively mild concentration change at later stages balancing computational efficiency and numerical stability an implicit finite difference method with upstream weighting was chosen as the numerical solution technique the spatial grid discretization was consistent with those used in the dnapl spill simulations wang 2013 showed that this level of grid resolution sufficiently resolved dnapl pathways and pool locations consistent with finer grid spacings furthermore this resolution was consistent with the development of the permeability field which was conditioned on 18 hypothetical boreholes with 0 25 m spacing in the vertical direction 2 5 mass loading and measuring metrics all simulations consisted of two consecutive stages a 30 year loading stage during which pce dnapl dissolves but no change in saturation is permitted and a flushing stage with dnapl dissolution progressing until a specified stopping criterion is satisfied for both stages adsorption and solute transport advection and dispersion were computed since solute transport and interphase mass transfer were not simulated during dnapl release and infiltration the first stage was designed to create conditions that are similar to untreated source zones where contaminants have accumulated over a period of years the second stage is of primary interest in the study and represents the natural restoration process during which contaminant infiltration has ceased and groundwater flow flushes the contaminated zone under natural gradient conditions until specified target goals are reached three restoration metrics total plume longevity dnapl removal time and post dnapl plume longevity were considered to evaluate the influence of dnapl dissolution and sorption retarded diffusion on near source plume behavior total plume longevity is defined as the period during which contaminant concentration along a transect of compliance located 8 m down gradient of the pce dnapl infiltration location is sustained above 0 001 mg l excluding the 30 year loading period dnapl removal time measures the time for removal of 99 99 of the initial dnapl post dnapl plume longevity is calculated by subtracting dnapl removal time from total plume longevity it represents the period during which plume tailing is sustained by sequestered mass sorbed and aqueous phase only flux averaged concentration and maximum concentration at down gradient transects of compliance were used to determine total plume and post dnapl plume longevity the pool mass fraction pf metric 1 gtp 1 was used to quantify the evolution of the dnapl mass distribution and to study the interplay between dnapl dissolution and transport processes metrics and metric statistics were evaluated for the ensemble of 2 d simulations and for 3 d simulations for four sorption cases no sorption nosp linear sorption kdsp freundlich sorption kfsp and rate limited sorption rlsp in total 160 numerical simulations were conducted for the 2 d fields and 8 numerical simulations for the 3 d fields 3 results 3 1 influence of sorption on restoration metrics in 2 d the simulation results for the ensemble of 20 realizations for hypothetical field 1 were used to investigate the coupled effect of sorption and bd on near source plume tailing fig 4 presents median ensemble statistics calculated based on the flux averaged concentration along the down gradient boundary inspection reveals that the presence of sorption substantially increases plume persistence total plume persistence increases by 22 52 and 55 for the cases with linear nonlinear and rate limited sorption respectively however the median dnapl removal time for the three sorption cases is only 2 3 higher than that of the no sorption case indicating a small influence of sorption on the dnapl dissolution process thus the effect of sorption on total plume persistence is attributed primarily to its influence on post dnapl plume persistence indeed the median post dnapl persistence is 6 times larger for the linear sorption case and the other two sorption cases exhibit even more persistent post dnapl plumes with persistence times a factor of 10 larger than those observed for the no sorption case extreme outliers for the two metrics of total plume longevity and dnapl removal time are observed for all of the four cases while there are no outliers for the metric of post dnapl plume longevity under almost all simulation conditions dnapl removal time represents more than half of the total plume longevity thus the large variances in total plume longevity and dnapl removal time can be attributed to the heterogeneity in space and magnitude of the initial dnapl saturation distribution the metric outliers are generally associated with persistent dnapl in certain parts of the domain inspection of table 5 reveals that the metric means for the four cases follow the trends observed for the metric medians note that the variance of total plume longevity decreases as the sorption model changes from no sorption to linear sorption to nonlinear sorption to rate limited sorption this reduction in the variance of total plume longevity is associated with a reduction in its range as the minimum longevity values increase more than the maximum in contrast for the post dnapl plume longevity the range and variance increases with sorption complexity this observation suggests that the sorbed mass has a larger influence on concentration tailing under conditions where the dnapl source doesn t persist this apparent effect can be explained by considering that while the remaining dnapl mass is dissolving in a small part of the domain the plume is being sustained by bd and desorption in other parts the dnapl dissolves away at different rates depletion of one cluster of dnapl pools initiates mass discharge from low permeability layers which is controlled by sorption and diffusion for the simulations with a persistent dnapl sequestered mass in low permeability layers in the vicinity of depleted dnapl pools may have sufficient time to fully diffuse into transmissive zones thus the existence of persistent dnapl influences not only the removal rate of dnapl but also the duration of the post dnapl period for the 20 simulations faster dnapl removal is usually associated with a longer post dnapl tailing period and vice versa fig 5 illustrates mass discharge from low permeability layers as the dnapl mass is dissolved demonstrating that local mass transfer behavior is governed by different processes in different parts of the domain the total longevity dnapl removal time and post dnapl longevity as determined by maximum concentration along the down gradient boundary are presented within parentheses in table 5 in comparison to the flux averaged concentration the maximum concentration is linked to local mass transfer behavior the negative minimum values reported for post dnapl persistence in the no sorption case are attributed to meeting the maximum concentration target prior to complete dnapl depletion to further understand the interplay between dnapl dissolution sorption and bd it is illustrative to examine a representative simulation fig 6 a presents the initial dnapl saturation distribution for a selected example along with the corresponding permeability field the evolution of flux averaged concentrations along the down gradient boundary and dnapl pool fraction are plotted in fig 6 a and b for the four sorption cases the right y axis in fig 6 a plots the associated removal for the final 10 of the entrapped dnapl mass the curves are divided into four segments corresponding to four regimes each dominated by a different mass transfer process the first regime is associated with the dissolution of low saturation ganglia 0 23 and is characterized by a sharp decrease in down gradient concentration and a steep rise in pool fraction the second regime is associated with the dissolution of high saturation dnapl pools and exhibits a decreasing concentration trend with several bumps here as the pool fraction decreases localized high concentrations are emitted from pool areas and travel down gradient creating concentration spikes which characterize the second regime the pool fraction continues to decrease until the pools become ganglia dissolution of which then results in a small increase in pool fraction the depletion rate for individual pools varies with size and accessibility thus pool fraction displays a decreasing trend with a series of small peaks during the second regime in the third regime the down gradient concentration is governed by the slow depletion of persistent or flow inaccessible dnapl resulting in concentration plateaus the pool fraction during this third regime exhibits a stepped decrease each step represents slow dissolution of one cluster of dnapl saturations existing in the domain the final step associated with a pool fraction of 0 persists for a long period of time in this realization the last remaining dnapl ganglia are either trapped in low permeability layers or enclosed by low permeability materials due to the similar initial dnapl release location and the presence of a low permeability zone at this location for each of the field 1 realizations the entrapped dnapl tended to create long plateaus in most simulations for field 1 the presence of these small inaccessible dnapl zones is also the reason for the outliers observed in fig 4 the complete removal of dnapl depends on the dissolution rate of this flow inaccessible mass for the field 1 ensemble the fourth and last regime is the post dnapl period during which the down gradient plume is influenced solely by mass diffusing out from low permeability zones the concentration curves for the four sorption cases begin to deviate from each other during this final regime 3 1 1 influence of permeability field to investigate the general validity of the findings presented above for a different permeability configuration within the release zone transport simulations were conducted for the ensemble of field 2 pce source realizations in these field 2 simulations the pce is released within a more permeable material and tends to penetrate much further into the domain the boxplot in fig 7 presents data for flux averaged concentration based and maximum concentration based metrics the trends of the median total plume persistence dnapl removal time and post dnapl plume persistence follow the pattern of simulation results for field 1 with the shortest longevity for the no sorption case and the longest for the rate limited sorption case the time scales for plume evolution in these two different scenarios however differ substantially the median total plume persistence for the field 2 ensemble simulations is halved and the median dnapl persistence is reduced by 2 3 in comparison with the field 1 values this difference is attributed to the existence of a lower pool fraction and less dnapl mass entrapment in low permeability zones in the field 2 scenario which were examined in section 2 3 the median post dnapl plume longevity increases by several years 10 for field 2 this behavior is attributed to three factors 1 the increased storage capacity for aqueous and sorbed mass in the thick low permeability zone at the bottom of the domain that has pooled dnapl above 2 the reduced flow accessibility to sequestered mass in the thick low permeability zones compared with those in the more distributed low permeability layers for realizations of field 1 and 3 the greatly shortened dnapl removal time regime 3 the comparison of these two scenarios suggests that the configuration of low permeability regions is a fundamental determinant of plume persistence we observed a major dependence of source zone configuration on locations of low permeability layers with extensive horizontal correlation length wang 2013 3 1 2 influence of dissolution mass transfer there are two factors potentially contributing to the determination of dissolution rate in the kinetic dissolution model eq 3 1 the lumped mass transfer coefficient κ an and 2 the solubility c eq a in this study κ an is calculated by the powers et al 1994 correlation eq 4 this correlation was developed from column dissolution experiments for s n 0 18 this saturation range encompasses saturations present in the majority of cells for the 2 d 81 07 97 51 and 3 d 74 70 and 97 87 simulations it is noted however that none of the sherwood number correlations e g imhoff et al 1994 miller et al 1990 nambi and powers 2003 powers et al 1994 available in the literature has been developed for as wide a range of initial dnapl saturations as that observed in this study trace to 0 9 among the available correlations the nambi and powers 2003 correlation is valid for a slightly wider range of condition s n 0 35 comparison of simulations conducted using the nambi and powers 2003 and the powers et al 1994 not shown here revealed that predicted plume longevities were not very sensitive to the choice of correlation additional tests not shown here were conducted by increasing the magnitude of the lumped mass transfer coefficient to approximate equilibrium dissolution the results were similar to the original ones simulated by the powers et al 1994 christ et al 2006 showed that the selection of a mass transfer correlation for dnapl dissolution has more influence on late time mass transfer 95 dnapl removal and suggested that use of a ganglia based mass transfer correlation may predict faster dnapl removal and shorter source longevity our simulation results however showed that longer dnapl persistence is not necessarily linked to longer post napl plume persistence plume persistence in this study was found to be the result of the interaction between dnapl dissolution diffusion and sorption solubility is another property that has been shown to influence source longevity e g seyedabbasi et al 2012 to explore this factor post spill transport simulations were conducted for a higher solubility dnapl with properties consistent with that of tce to compare with behavior observed in the previous pce simulations input properties for the dnapl included a solubility of 1000 mg l density of 1466 kg m3 aqueous phase diffusivity of 9 1e 6 cm2 s and k oc of 126 l kg three times smaller than that of pce the cases with no sorption and linear sorption were simulated for a release in one selected realization for fields 1 and 2 simulations results table 6 reveal that the total longevity decreased dramatically for the tce plume attributed to faster dnapl dissolution while the post dnapl period was sustained for a longer time for tce in the linear sorption cases the no sorption case simulations exhibited slightly shorter post dnapl longevity for tce than for pce in the no sorption cases with tce it is likely that the higher concentration gradient between transmissive and low permeability zones drives faster release of the sequestered mass from low permeability zones for the linear sorption cases with tce two factors are most likely contributing to longer post dnapl times 1 larger quantities of dissolved mass in the inaccessible zones in the domain and 2 the more rapid dnapl dissolution relative to the period of desorption and bd which are occurring at rates similar to that of pce thus the relative contribution of sorbed and low permeability sequestered mass to contaminant persistence increases as the contaminant solubility increases these simulation results also indicate that the loading and release of stored mass in low permeability zones are very sensitive to the inclusion and simulation of sorption it should be noted here that the tce dnapl spill distribution was assumed to be the same as that for pce in these simulations if the actual spill release were simulated tce spills would not be expected to penetrate as deep vertically due the smaller density which would significantly impact the mass distribution and persistence simulation results 3 2 3 d simulations to explore the influence of model dimensionality on remedial metrics simulations were conducted on two selected 3 d saturation realizations one for each of the fields with the four different sorption treatments again the three flux averaged concentration based metrics were examined fig 8 the 3 d results generally follow the trends predicted in the 2d mean simulations 1 the inclusion of sorption results in prolonged plume persistence i e total and post dnapl the extent of which depends on the sorption complexity 2 the total plume persistence is greater in field 1 than field 2 3 the dnapl removal time is not sensitive to sorption type and varies within 6 of the no sorption case and 4 the dnapl removal time is greater in the field 1 scenario than in the field 2 scenario the post dnapl removal time varies within a certain range for both fields in each sorption case appearing to be negligibly affected by the field configuration the consistency of trends observed between the 2 d and 3 d simulations supports conclusions reached above relating to the importance of sorption and permeability field heterogeneity in the source zone to the accurate prediction of plume persistence despite the similarities 2 d models tended to predict longer plume persistence than 3 d in these simulations the 2 d mean total plume persistence and dnapl removal time are approximately two fold greater than the corresponding metrics in 3 d in all four sorption cases for both fields the differences between 2 d mean and 3 d however could be an artifact of the single realization associated with the 3 d dnapl infiltration simulation to further explore the influence of dimensionality additional transport simulations were performed for the four sorption cases and both fields in 2 d with dnapl spills and permeability fields extracted from the center x z cross section in the 3 d spill scenarios results of these simulations labeled 2d in 3d are also presented in fig 8 although closer to the 3d simulations than those of the 2d mean these additional simulations produced longer total plume and dnapl persistence times for both fields in comparison with the 3 d simulations trends in post dnapl persistence time however were less clear although the same volume 80 l of dnapl was released in the center slice of the 3 d domain as the 2 d domain only a small portion of dnapl was eventually retained in the center cross section of the 3 d domain consequently horizontal migration and spreading of dnapl in the 3 d simulation resulted in increased access of the dnapl to groundwater flow and an acceleration of dissolution the spreading also resulted in access of dissolved mass to a larger medium volume but did not necessarily lead to more mass sequestration the sequestration of mass depends on the spatial distribution of the sorptive properties of the medium therefore the post dnapl persistence can be longer field 2 case or shorter field 1 case in 3 d than persistence in the 2d in 3d simulations in a heterogeneous domain the 2d in 3d or 2d simulations may not be representative of real conditions as the center of mass of the dnapl and sequestered mass may not be in the transect where the source is released to further explore the contribution of sequestered mass to near source plume persistence the ratio percent of post dnapl time to total plume persistence was calculated fig 8 comparison of the results for fields 1 and 2 shows that the influence of sequestered mass on plume persistence is highly dependent on the configuration of the permeability field in both 2 d and 3 d field 1 appears to be dnapl dominated while field 2 is the opposite in addition the influence of the sequestered mass on plume persistence is also associated with the sorption complexity of media fig 8 shows that there is little or no effect of sequestered mass and bd on plume tailing in the no sorption case regardless of model dimension sequestered mass becomes a more important contributor to plume tailing when sorption is a present e g in the linear nonlinear and rate limited sorption cases thus bd alone appears to be only a minor factor in sustaining downgradient plumes compared to dnapl dissolution when low permeability layers are thin and not very sorptive conversely predictions based upon assumptions of no sorption or linear sorption could be mistakenly optimistic about plume persistence times when the sorption properties of site media are complex in addition the discrepancies between 2 d and 3 d predictions of post dnapl time become larger as sorption is included this suggests that model dimensionality and sorption representation together can play important roles when predicting plume longevity for a heterogeneous field that is highly sorptive or has nonideal sorption in low permeability zones use of 3 d simulations may be more appropriate for sites with nonideal sorption where spreading in the transverse lateral direction will affect mass exchange between transmissive and low permeability zones discrepancies between 2 and 3 d simulations can be also understood in the context of the influence of reduced dimensionality on pce migration vertical pathways wang 2013 the dnapl spill simulations demonstrated that 2 d releases resulted in deeper penetration than the 3 d cases for mildly heterogeneous permeability fields christ et al 2005 came to the same conclusion for vertical spreading in 2 d and 3 d they also reported smaller gtp values in 2 d than in 3 d which means that simulations in 2 d scenarios were associated with more pooling and consequently longer persistence of down gradient plumes thus for both mildly and highly heterogeneous fields these results suggest that 2 d predictions cannot represent 3 d ones the initial averaged saturation per bulk volume calculated for 3 d is smaller than 2 d which could partially contribute to the more rapid cleanup in the 3 d simulations a thorough study that includes the whole ensemble of 3 d simulations would be needed to reach a more general conclusion 4 discussion and conclusions simulations conducted herein reveal that accurate representation of sorption processes in transport models is crucial to the accurate prediction of plume longevity especially for the prediction of post dnapl dissolution longevity while diffusive mass rebound or back diffusion has been heavily emphasized in previous investigations e g ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 the results of this study suggest that sorption processes will dominate the rate of mass release to transmissive zones simulations that neglected the storage capacity of low permeability compartments for sorbed contaminants tended to substantially underestimate the mass loading in low permeability compartments during the pre remediation period these results indicate that the achievement of remediation objectives would likely be compromised by optimistic predictions of plume longevity if sorption processes are neglected or an inappropriate sorption model is assumed note however that the simulations conducted herein revealed a very limited effect of sorption on the rate of dnapl dissolution chemical or biological transformations were not included in the modeling studies presented here if such reactions were simulated the longevity of dnapl and the aqueous source contaminant would likely be reduced the transformation products however would contribute to down gradient flux and plume persistence simulation results also demonstrated a strong influence of source zone complexity e g heterogeneity of the permeability field dnapl architecture process coupling on source zone mass transport and near source plume persistence results suggest that the presence of dnapl tends to control the clean up rate in the near source area in most cases simulations demonstrate how small isolated pockets of dnapl can evolve and persist in heterogeneous domains the removal of the last few percent of the dnapl or trace dnapl mass is especially important in terms of reducing plume tailing time since this part of the dnapl mass usually represents the most persistent source although neat phase dnapl is not typically detected at most sites this work suggests that trace amounts of dnapl source mass present in the field can be as influential as sequestered sorbed and dissolved mass in controlling plume tailing and that these small quantities of dnapl mass can be difficult to differentiate from the diffused and sorbed mass without exhaustive characterization rivett et al 2014 thus by neglecting consideration of the influence of dnapl architecture and dissolution previous studies would presumably have tended to over emphasize the importance of bd and may have been relatively inaccurate in their predictions of plume behavior and longevity e g ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008b yang et al 2015 the simulations presented herein also demonstrate that the evolving plume is directly linked to the spatial heterogeneity of the medium source mass distribution and sorption properties the inclusion of dnapl dissolution sorption and diffusion allows the model to capture the interplay between these processes in aged heterogeneous source zones due to the presence of heterogeneity different regimes within the domain where local mass behavior is governed by different processes i e dissolution and bd were shown to exist before complete napl removal from the domain in other words the release of sequestered mass does not begin at the same time at every spatial location a common method used to model a dnapl source in previous studies has been to use a source loading function followed by period during which this loading is halted to allow for bd e g chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 using this approach the spatial variations of source zone dnapl architecture are greatly simplified this approach cannot capture the interplay between different transport processes at the local scale that has been demonstrated here to be crucial in determining down gradient concentrations in highly heterogeneous sites in addition the large variability among the predicted longevity metrics of the simulations in this work also points to the importance of source zone heterogeneity in plume longevity predictions the location of low permeability layers especially thick and laterally persistent layers is controlling for both the formation of the source zone architecture and the solute plume in sum these results imply that simplified models that idealize subsurface stratigraphy or neglect process coupling will be unable to adequately predict plume persistence the conclusions drawn above are associated with the specific simulation conditions assumed in this work i e the selected dnapl permeability and associated media sorption characteristics the low permeability zones in this work were consistent with a silty sand or coarse grained silt the hydraulic conductivity of these materials however are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of clays which have been considered as low permeability zones in previous studies e g liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008b if a smaller hydraulic conductivity material were used for low permeability zones the discharge of stored mass out of the low permeability zones would be expected to be slower however the penetration depth and the amount of mass loaded into these zones would also likely be reduced for the lower conductivity materials longer dnapl persistence might also be possible due to more areas of flow bypassing thus further work would be useful to explore behavior in other depositional environments this study showed that reduced dimensionality has a substantial impact on predictions of plume longevity although results from the limited number of 3 d simulations presented are not exhaustive the large discrepancies observed between plume longevity predicted by the 3 d and 2 d simulations suggest that 2 d simulations although computationally efficient are only useful for examining trends in plume metrics in highly heterogeneous formations it is likely that predictions obtained by 2 d simulations will be most misleading in cases where strong nonideal sorption is present a more quantitative comparative analysis would require additional simulations in 3 d all of the scenarios considered here explored near source zone within 10 m of the dnapl zone plume evolution an examination of transport at larger distances down gradient of a dnapl source zone is a topic that is worthy of further investigation the complex interplay of heterogeneity and sorption bd processes will likely also be important at this larger plume scale for example relative to dnapl mass the influence of sorption and bd would be expected to become more significant along transects further down gradient from a source zone as the plume encounters more opportunities for sorption and diffusion into low permeability zones nrc 2004 however plume concentrations would also be more diluted by mixing with transport further down gradient reducing concentration gradients for mass sequestration into less permeable zones in addition concentration rebound and bd fluxes depend on the local contrasts between concentrations in the more mixed transmissive zones and the less permeable zones suggesting that bd rates and flux averaged concentrations would be greatly affected by local heterogeneity based upon the simulation comparisons for no sorption linear sorption nonlinear sorption and rate limited sorption models presented above it is anticipated that the plume tailing sustained by the sequestered mass will vary with different specifications of koc and sorption mass transfer rate it is likely that the effect of bd and sorption on plume tailing will be less significant with smaller koc and faster mass transfer the importance of including sorption and using a field specific sorption model and associated parameters may also depend on the heterogeneity of the permeability field as has been suggested in previous studies rivett et al 2006 rodriguez 2006 thus it will be important for site managers to explore sensitivity to sorption parameters for the permeability fields and properties representative of their particular field site and release conditions acknowledgments funding for this study was provided

1669,sequestered mass in low permeability zones has been increasingly recognized as an important source of organic chemical contamination that acts to sustain downgradient plume concentrations above regulated levels however few modeling studies have investigated the influence of this sequestered mass and associated coupled mass transfer processes on plume persistence in complex dense nonaqueous phase liquid dnapl source zones this paper employs a multiphase flow and transport simulator a modified version of the modular transport simulator mt3dms to explore the two and three dimensional evolution of source zone mass distribution and near source plume persistence for two ensembles of highly heterogeneous dnapl source zone realizations simulations reveal the strong influence of subsurface heterogeneity on the complexity of dnapl and sequestered immobile sorbed mass distribution small zones of entrapped dnapl are shown to serve as a persistent source of low concentration plumes difficult to distinguish from other sorbed and immobile dissolved sequestered mass sources results suggest that the presence of dnapl tends to control plume longevity in the near source area for the examined scenarios a substantial fraction 43 3 99 2 of plume life was sustained by dnapl dissolution processes the presence of sorptive media and the extent of sorption non ideality are shown to greatly affect predictions of near source plume persistence following dnapl depletion with plume persistence varying one to two orders of magnitude with the selected sorption model results demonstrate the importance of sorption controlled back diffusion from low permeability zones and reveal the importance of selecting the appropriate sorption model for accurate prediction of plume longevity large discrepancies for both dnapl depletion time and plume longevity were observed between 2 d and 3 d model simulations differences between 2 and 3 d predictions increased in the presence

appreciated and demonstrated by analyses of groundwater monitoring well and soil core data at aged field sites e g ball et al 1997 brusseau and guo 2014 chapman and parker 2005 liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 parker et al 2004 at the laboratory scale a number of benchmark experiments in aquifer cells have demonstrated that mass flux from low permeability zones can cause persistent plume tailing after dnapl depletion e g chapman et al 2012 rodriguez 2006 sale et al 2008 b wilking et al 2013 yang et al 2015 most of these laboratory experiments have been confined to idealized geometrical representations of physical heterogeneity and simple aqueous phase mass loading conditions real source zones however exhibit much greater physical and chemical complexity characterized by more irregular physical heterogeneity and the presence of multiple phases dnapl aqueous sorbed and co existing mass transfer processes herein the term source zone refers to the subsurface region originally in contact with dnapl containing dnapl aqueous and sorbed phase mass nrc 2004 to date only a few laboratory studies have created source zones by injecting dnapl into aquifer cells rodriguez 2006 wilking et al 2013 but these have used highly simplified physical scenarios thus while providing qualitative insights pertaining to the process of bd the implications of these laboratory studies for field remediation practices are not easily identified mathematical models have been used in a number of studies to identify influential factors in plume persistence and to interpret laboratory and field data based upon their simplicity and ease of application analytical models have been employed by some researchers to predict the development of down gradient plumes during bd in one 1 d and two dimensional 2 d domains e g adamson et al 2015 ball et al 1997 bear et al 1994 brown et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 sale et al 2008 b seyedabbasi et al 2012 wilson 1997 yang et al 2015 yang et al 2017 as well as in three dimensions 3 d parker and kim 2015 these applications however have necessarily been restricted to idealized geometric configurations and have employed simplifying assumptions such as infinite or semi infinite clay layers no flow in low permeability zones and non diminishing dnapl volumes in contrast numerical models with the potential to be tailored to more detailed and realistic conditions have become important tools for long term site management and decision making a number of studies have employed numerical models to capture diffusive mass transport into low permeability zones and to predict persistence of plume tailing due to bd chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 in general these previous numerical simulation studies have been implemented on idealized domains i e those with horizontal layering perfect stratification chapman and parker 2005 matthieu et al 2014 or those consisting of homogeneous background units with one or several uniform inclusions of low permeable materials chapman et al 2012 maghrebi et al 2014 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 at real field sites however variability of permeability at the small scale can range over several orders of magnitude maghrebi et al 2015 is the only previous numerical modeling investigation of bd that incorporated a heterogeneous permeability field generated by a geostatistical model in addition to the previous research cited above a few numerical studies have investigated the influence of diffusion on contaminant transport in complex heterogeneous formations e g janković et al 2009 labolle and fogg 2001 rolle et al 2013 these studies however did not focus on plume persistence caused by bd although sorption is an important process within many low permeability units and can influence mass transfer the influence of sorption on the mass rebound process in chlorinated solvent source zones has not generally been as well recognized as that of diffusion while a few previous modeling studies maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 rodriguez 2006 have incorporated sorption and explored the effect of sorption properties on plume tailing most have emphasized the effect of diffusion in addition these studies have typically assumed local equilibrium and isotherm linearity many experimental studies however have demonstrated that the linear equilibrium assumption fails to capture observed behavior thus sorption processes in the subsurface should typically be characterized as nonlinear and or rate limited particularly over the wide range of concentrations encountered within dnapl source zones e g allen king et al 2002 rivett et al 2006 wang et al 2013 although matthieu et al 2014 briefly discussed the potential influence of sorption kinetics and equilibrium on the rates of mass removal in their work they did not use modeling results to support this discussion furthermore the use of simplified configurations of permeability heterogeneity in previous simulation studies also resulted in limited spatial variation of sorption parameters it is widely recognized however that heterogeneity of sorption properties can substantially influence solute transport and result in asymptotic concentration tailing e g aksoy and culver 2004 rabideau and miller 1994 most of the previous simulation studies cited above modeled mass emanating from dnapl source zones by incorporating source functions that were either constant chapman and parker 2005 maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 parker et al 2008 or adjusted based on known data chapman and parker 2005 rodriguez 2006 these models did not incorporate dnapl dissolution and thus could not include heterogeneous dnapl saturation distributions as model inputs however it is now widely recognized that the distribution of dnapl within a source zone also known as dnapl architecture developed under the influence of a number of site specific conditions e g dekker and abriola 2000 lemke et al 2004 a can be quite complex e g kueper et al 1993 mercer and cohen 1990 and that this dnapl architecture will largely control the behavior and longevity of dissolved mass plumes e g christ et al 2010 christ et al 2006 lemke et al 2004 b parker and park 2004 phelan et al 2004 thus it will be important to consider the spatial distribution of dnapl in any investigation of bd and plume persistence in heterogeneous source zones finally most of the previous simulations investigating bd have been performed in 2 d domains chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 parker et al 2008 rodriguez 2006 with only a few conducted in 3 d maghrebi et al 2015 maghrebi et al 2014 reduced dimensionality simulations however may not be able to completely capture flow bypassing effects or accurately predict the magnitude and penetration depth of mass in lower permeability zones thus plume persistence may vary with model dimensionality and it will be important to compare concentration rebound predictions in two and three dimensions as highlighted above although consideration of simplified scenarios can provide a preliminary assessment of the influence of bd on plume longevity models based upon such idealized scenarios cannot capture the full complexity of field conditions the objective of this study is to more comprehensively explore the influence of dissolution sorption and diffusion process coupling on source longevity and near source plume persistence in complex geologic environments through numerical modeling in this work a series of transport simulations was undertaken for a suite of dnapl source zone realizations in 2 d heterogeneous domains under a number of alternative sorption property scenarios selected comparisons with 3 d simulations provide additional insight into the influence of model dimensionality on plume longevity predictions 2 methodology transport simulations were performed using a modified version of the modular three dimensional transport simulator mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 adapted to incorporate rate limited dissolution from an entrapped dnapl source zone and transient groundwater flow associated with changes in dnapl saturation christ et al 2010 christ et al 2006 parker and park 2004 initial dnapl source zone saturation distributions were obtained by simulating dnapl infiltration and entrapment in highly heterogeneous permeability fields using the simulators michigan vertical and lateral organic redistribution mvalor 2 d abriola et al 1992 or university of texas chemical compositional simulator utchem 3 d delshad et al 1996 the decoupling of infiltration and transport simulations is based on the assumption that the time scales of infiltration and plume development are vastly different weeks to months versus decades a similar decoupled modeling approach was employed by lemke et al 2004b and christ et al 2006 to study plume evolution from dnapl dissolution 2 1 governing equations the aqueous transport of a dissolving dnapl component can be represented as 1 t ϕs a c a ϕ s a c a v a ϕ s a d h a c a e an e as

correlation expressions have been developed in the literature to quantify the lumped mass transfer rate coefficient e g imhoff et al 1994 miller et al 1990 powers et al 1994 these correlations are generally a function of dnapl saturation grain size information and flow velocity for the simulations reported herein the lumped mass transfer coefficient was computed according to the following

size index dimensionless s w min is the irreducible water saturation dimensionless the flow was frequently adjusted by updating water relative permeability as a function of the newly computed dnapl saturation values dnapl depletion results in an increase in aqueous phase mobility and subsequently groundwater flow velocity which in turn drives a faster exchange between dnapl and aqueous phase 2 2 permeability fields permeability field realizations were constructed based on an existing formation for which a high resolution analog dataset is available bayer et al 2011 heinz et al 2003 kostic et al 2005 aquifer materials in this formation were grouped into four dominant lithofacies table 1 based on the aquifer analog and measured permeabilities following the method by maji 2005 a series of 20 3 d realizations of categorical fields for hypothetical field 1were conditionally generated based on 18 synthetic boreholes using a transition probability based markov chain tp mc method carle 1999 2 d realizations were extracted from the x z cross section of the 3 d domains fig 1 using an analogous approach with the same geostatistics another 20 realizations were generated for a second hypothetical field field 2 the two sets of reconstructions capture horizontal stratigraphy present in the formation yet differ in the locations of low permeability layers dnapl infiltration and transport simulations were conducted in realizations of both fields to study the influence of the aquifer formation heterogeneity on plume persistence 2 3 infiltration simulations migration of dnapl

represents the external sources sinks the coupled eq 6 were discretized and solved using the multiphase flow simulators mvalor 2 d and utchem 3 d the framework developed by kaluarachchi and parker 1992 was employed to account for entrapment hysteresis effects this approach uses an apparent effective water saturation that is a function of effective water saturation and immobile organic phase saturation the brooks corey burdine formulations brooks and corey 1964 burdine 1953 were adopted for modeling two phase capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability relations a detailed description of these constitutive relations can be found in rathfelder and abriola 1998 the coupled nonlinear mass balance equations along with the constitutive relations and the constraint s a s n 1 0 constitute a well posed problem details of the numerical implementation and solution algorithms in 2 and 3 d can be found in abriola et al 1992 and delshad et al 1996 respectively in this work pce was selected as a representative dnapl for all model simulations tables 1 and 2 summarize the input parameters used in the dnapl infiltration simulations for aquifer properties fluid properties and capillary pressure saturation relations air entry pressures and pore size index values for each aquifer material are listed in table 1 because it comprises the largest volumetric portion of the formation gcm was selected for estimation of the reference air entry pressure and pore size index grain size distribution curves obtained from heinz et al 2003 by employing the haverkamp and parlange 1986 method leverett scaling was used to determine the capillary entry pressure for the other three lithofacies table 1 for simplicity and in the absence of data the pore size index table 1 maximum residual dnapl saturation table 2 and irreducible water saturation parameters table 2 were assumed uniform for the four materials the ensembles of 2 d pce saturation distributions were generated by simulating infiltration events using mvalor a total volume of 80 l 130 kg pce was released at a rate of 0 5 l day for field 1 and 2 l day for field 2 from a four node area 0 5m2 in the top layer of the modeled domain fig 1 3 d dnapl infiltration simulations were conducted using utchem in these simulations a total of 320 l 520 kg pce dnapl was released at a rate of 2 l day from a central location in the top grid layer across a 5 4 grid block area of 2 5 m2 fig 1 here the spill volume per nodal area corresponded to that spilled in the 2 d simulations impermeable boundaries were specified for the bottom boundaries of the domains constant pressure and saturation boundaries were specified for the side boundaries and top boundaries the resulting nonuniform saturation distributions were then used as inputs to the transport model representative simulated 2 d and 3 d pce dnapl saturation distributions are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively examination of these figures reveals that the low permeability layers act as capillary barriers to vertical migration until a new vertical pathway is encountered the pce dnapl continues to accumulate and extend horizontally visual inspection of the permeability fields reveals that the occurrence of very high dnapl saturations 0 7 is associated with infiltration into high permeability media that are surrounded by low permeability media which prevent the dnapl from moving horizontally or vertically in comparison to the 2 d simulations the 3 d simulations exhibit different migration pathways with less vertical penetration and more extensive lateral movement of the dnapl the difference between maximum saturations in the 2 and 3 d simulations is however small 2 2 which suggests a relatively small influence of dimensionality in determining maximum dnapl saturation on the other hand a comparison of a and b in figs 2 and 3 reveals that dnapl distributions for fields 1 and 2 differ markedly attributed to the locations of low permeability layers in the domain for field 2 simulations much of the dnapl spreads and pools above low permeability layers at the bottom of the domain for field 1 simulations the dnapl either resides in the top part of the domain or penetrates down and accumulates on the bottom boundary a comparison of initial dnapl distribution table 3 shows that 3 d simulations exhibit fewer pools high saturation cells than those in 2 d attributed to the greater lateral spreading and field 1 has more dnapl pools than field 2 attributed to the low permeability layer configuration the slight reduction in average dnapl mass compared to the initial release volume is attributed to dnapl migration out of the domain across vertical boundaries during the infiltration simulation plots of the initial dnapl saturation distributions for the ensembles of 20 simulations for fields 1 and 2 can be found in the supplementary material 2 4 transport model parameters for the transport simulations a natural hydraulic gradient of 0 01 was imposed on the domain producing average linear groundwater velocities of approximately 0 9 m day in the majority of the domain and 0 02 m day in lower permeable zones the physicochemical parameters used in the simulations are listed in table 2 dispersivities and solid bulk density were taken from a modeling study of dnapl dissolution in a similar hydrogeological setting constructed by tp mc maji and sudicky 2008 table 4 lists sorption related parameters used in the simulations these were estimated from the literature since sorptive property information for the field materials was not available in the absence of measured data the linear equilibrium sorption of solutes to aquifer solids can be estimated using a distribution coefficient k d k oc f oc where k oc l3 m 1 is the partition coefficient to organic carbon and f oc is mass fractional of soil organic carbon estimated values of k oc for pce range from 200 ml g to 600 ml g boethling and mackay 2000 lyman et al 1990 a k oc value of 400 l kg was employed here based on sedimentary studies of the prototype aquifer in southwestern germany heinz et al 2003 kleineidam et al 1999 a 1999 b lithofacies gcm s x and bgcm were treated as low organic carbon content deposits with f oc of 0 035 the finest material gs x was treated as the most sorptive in the transport simulations with a f oc approximately one order of magnitude larger this relatively high value was selected so that the influence of a strongly sorptive medium on dnapl source zone persistence could be explored the value is consistent with other foc values reported for fine materials in the literature ranging from 0 1 to 2 delle site 2001 domenico and schwartz 1997 for consistency and to further facilitate the study of desorption and back diffusion herein the hydraulic conductivity and grain size were reduced for this lowest permeability material gs x bracketed values in table 1 in the transport simulations to better reflect hydraulic characteristics consistent with a highly sorptive material for the nonlinear equilibrium sorption model the freundlich exponent n f was selected from within the range 0 8 0 9 rivett et al 2006 the freundlich coefficient k f was then calculated to ensure comparability with the corresponding linear isotherm for each material by minimizing the difference in total sorbed mass between the linear and nonlinear models over an aqueous concentration range of 0 to the pce solubility value a first order mass transfer coefficient for solute pce sorption from gs x materials was selected within the range of reported literature values in published field scale simulations these vary over several orders of magnitude from 10 4 to 10 2 day 1 aksoy and culver 2004 and aksoy and culver 2000 goltz and roberts 1988 and goltz and roberts 1986 the other three materials were treated as less sorptive materials and thus assigned higher mass transfer rate values 3 d domains 16 40 7 m were discretized into 373 815 cells with a resolution of 0 25 0 5 0 1 m in the x y and z directions the same grid spacing in the x and z directions was used for 2 d domains 6 7 m an adaptive time step procedure with an initial time step maximum time step and a time step multiplier was implemented to handle the high concentration gradient near the dnapl source at early times and the relatively mild concentration change at later stages balancing computational efficiency and numerical stability an implicit finite difference method with upstream weighting was chosen as the numerical solution technique the spatial grid discretization was consistent with those used in the dnapl spill simulations wang 2013 showed that this level of grid resolution sufficiently resolved dnapl pathways and pool locations consistent with finer grid spacings furthermore this resolution was consistent with the development of the permeability field which was conditioned on 18 hypothetical boreholes with 0 25 m spacing in the vertical direction 2 5 mass loading and measuring metrics all simulations consisted of two consecutive stages a 30 year loading stage during which pce dnapl dissolves but no change in saturation is permitted and a flushing stage with dnapl dissolution progressing until a specified stopping criterion is satisfied for both stages adsorption and solute transport advection and dispersion were computed since solute transport and interphase mass transfer were not simulated during dnapl release and infiltration the first stage was designed to create conditions that are similar to untreated source zones where contaminants have accumulated over a period of years the second stage is of primary interest in the study and represents the natural restoration process during which contaminant infiltration has ceased and groundwater flow flushes the contaminated zone under natural gradient conditions until specified target goals are reached three restoration metrics total plume longevity dnapl removal time and post dnapl plume longevity were considered to evaluate the influence of dnapl dissolution and sorption retarded diffusion on near source plume behavior total plume longevity is defined as the period during which contaminant concentration along a transect of compliance located 8 m down gradient of the pce dnapl infiltration location is sustained above 0 001 mg l excluding the 30 year loading period dnapl removal time measures the time for removal of 99 99 of the initial dnapl post dnapl plume longevity is calculated by subtracting dnapl removal time from total plume longevity it represents the period during which plume tailing is sustained by sequestered mass sorbed and aqueous phase only flux averaged concentration and maximum concentration at down gradient transects of compliance were used to determine total plume and post dnapl plume longevity the pool mass fraction pf metric 1 gtp 1 was used to quantify the evolution of the dnapl mass distribution and to study the interplay between dnapl dissolution and transport processes metrics and metric statistics were evaluated for the ensemble of 2 d simulations and for 3 d simulations for four sorption cases no sorption nosp linear sorption kdsp freundlich sorption kfsp and rate limited sorption rlsp in total 160 numerical simulations were conducted for the 2 d fields and 8 numerical simulations for the 3 d fields 3 results 3 1 influence of sorption on restoration metrics in 2 d the simulation results for the ensemble of 20 realizations for hypothetical field 1 were used to investigate the coupled effect of sorption and bd on near source plume tailing fig 4 presents median ensemble statistics calculated based on the flux averaged concentration along the down gradient boundary inspection reveals that the presence of sorption substantially increases plume persistence total plume persistence increases by 22 52 and 55 for the cases with linear nonlinear and rate limited sorption respectively however the median dnapl removal time for the three sorption cases is only 2 3 higher than that of the no sorption case indicating a small influence of sorption on the dnapl dissolution process thus the effect of sorption on total plume persistence is attributed primarily to its influence on post dnapl plume persistence indeed the median post dnapl persistence is 6 times larger for the linear sorption case and the other two sorption cases exhibit even more persistent post dnapl plumes with persistence times a factor of 10 larger than those observed for the no sorption case extreme outliers for the two metrics of total plume longevity and dnapl removal time are observed for all of the four cases while there are no outliers for the metric of post dnapl plume longevity under almost all simulation conditions dnapl removal time represents more than half of the total plume longevity thus the large variances in total plume longevity and dnapl removal time can be attributed to the heterogeneity in space and magnitude of the initial dnapl saturation distribution the metric outliers are generally associated with persistent dnapl in certain parts of the domain inspection of table 5 reveals that the metric means for the four cases follow the trends observed for the metric medians note that the variance of total plume longevity decreases as the sorption model changes from no sorption to linear sorption to nonlinear sorption to rate limited sorption this reduction in the variance of total plume longevity is associated with a reduction in its range as the minimum longevity values increase more than the maximum in contrast for the post dnapl plume longevity the range and variance increases with sorption complexity this observation suggests that the sorbed mass has a larger influence on concentration tailing under conditions where the dnapl source doesn t persist this apparent effect can be explained by considering that while the remaining dnapl mass is dissolving in a small part of the domain the plume is being sustained by bd and desorption in other parts the dnapl dissolves away at different rates depletion of one cluster of dnapl pools initiates mass discharge from low permeability layers which is controlled by sorption and diffusion for the simulations with a persistent dnapl sequestered mass in low permeability layers in the vicinity of depleted dnapl pools may have sufficient time to fully diffuse into transmissive zones thus the existence of persistent dnapl influences not only the removal rate of dnapl but also the duration of the post dnapl period for the 20 simulations faster dnapl removal is usually associated with a longer post dnapl tailing period and vice versa fig 5 illustrates mass discharge from low permeability layers as the dnapl mass is dissolved demonstrating that local mass transfer behavior is governed by different processes in different parts of the domain the total longevity dnapl removal time and post dnapl longevity as determined by maximum concentration along the down gradient boundary are presented within parentheses in table 5 in comparison to the flux averaged concentration the maximum concentration is linked to local mass transfer behavior the negative minimum values reported for post dnapl persistence in the no sorption case are attributed to meeting the maximum concentration target prior to complete dnapl depletion to further understand the interplay between dnapl dissolution sorption and bd it is illustrative to examine a representative simulation fig 6 a presents the initial dnapl saturation distribution for a selected example along with the corresponding permeability field the evolution of flux averaged concentrations along the down gradient boundary and dnapl pool fraction are plotted in fig 6 a and b for the four sorption cases the right y axis in fig 6 a plots the associated removal for the final 10 of the entrapped dnapl mass the curves are divided into four segments corresponding to four regimes each dominated by a different mass transfer process the first regime is associated with the dissolution of low saturation ganglia 0 23 and is characterized by a sharp decrease in down gradient concentration and a steep rise in pool fraction the second regime is associated with the dissolution of high saturation dnapl pools and exhibits a decreasing concentration trend with several bumps here as the pool fraction decreases localized high concentrations are emitted from pool areas and travel down gradient creating concentration spikes which characterize the second regime the pool fraction continues to decrease until the pools become ganglia dissolution of which then results in a small increase in pool fraction the depletion rate for individual pools varies with size and accessibility thus pool fraction displays a decreasing trend with a series of small peaks during the second regime in the third regime the down gradient concentration is governed by the slow depletion of persistent or flow inaccessible dnapl resulting in concentration plateaus the pool fraction during this third regime exhibits a stepped decrease each step represents slow dissolution of one cluster of dnapl saturations existing in the domain the final step associated with a pool fraction of 0 persists for a long period of time in this realization the last remaining dnapl ganglia are either trapped in low permeability layers or enclosed by low permeability materials due to the similar initial dnapl release location and the presence of a low permeability zone at this location for each of the field 1 realizations the entrapped dnapl tended to create long plateaus in most simulations for field 1 the presence of these small inaccessible dnapl zones is also the reason for the outliers observed in fig 4 the complete removal of dnapl depends on the dissolution rate of this flow inaccessible mass for the field 1 ensemble the fourth and last regime is the post dnapl period during which the down gradient plume is influenced solely by mass diffusing out from low permeability zones the concentration curves for the four sorption cases begin to deviate from each other during this final regime 3 1 1 influence of permeability field to investigate the general validity of the findings presented above for a different permeability configuration within the release zone transport simulations were conducted for the ensemble of field 2 pce source realizations in these field 2 simulations the pce is released within a more permeable material and tends to penetrate much further into the domain the boxplot in fig 7 presents data for flux averaged concentration based and maximum concentration based metrics the trends of the median total plume persistence dnapl removal time and post dnapl plume persistence follow the pattern of simulation results for field 1 with the shortest longevity for the no sorption case and the longest for the rate limited sorption case the time scales for plume evolution in these two different scenarios however differ substantially the median total plume persistence for the field 2 ensemble simulations is halved and the median dnapl persistence is reduced by 2 3 in comparison with the field 1 values this difference is attributed to the existence of a lower pool fraction and less dnapl mass entrapment in low permeability zones in the field 2 scenario which were examined in section 2 3 the median post dnapl plume longevity increases by several years 10 for field 2 this behavior is attributed to three factors 1 the increased storage capacity for aqueous and sorbed mass in the thick low permeability zone at the bottom of the domain that has pooled dnapl above 2 the reduced flow accessibility to sequestered mass in the thick low permeability zones compared with those in the more distributed low permeability layers for realizations of field 1 and 3 the greatly shortened dnapl removal time regime 3 the comparison of these two scenarios suggests that the configuration of low permeability regions is a fundamental determinant of plume persistence we observed a major dependence of source zone configuration on locations of low permeability layers with extensive horizontal correlation length wang 2013 3 1 2 influence of dissolution mass transfer there are two factors potentially contributing to the determination of dissolution rate in the kinetic dissolution model eq 3 1 the lumped mass transfer coefficient κ an and 2 the solubility c eq a in this study κ an is calculated by the powers et al 1994 correlation eq 4 this correlation was developed from column dissolution experiments for s n 0 18 this saturation range encompasses saturations present in the majority of cells for the 2 d 81 07 97 51 and 3 d 74 70 and 97 87 simulations it is noted however that none of the sherwood number correlations e g imhoff et al 1994 miller et al 1990 nambi and powers 2003 powers et al 1994 available in the literature has been developed for as wide a range of initial dnapl saturations as that observed in this study trace to 0 9 among the available correlations the nambi and powers 2003 correlation is valid for a slightly wider range of condition s n 0 35 comparison of simulations conducted using the nambi and powers 2003 and the powers et al 1994 not shown here revealed that predicted plume longevities were not very sensitive to the choice of correlation additional tests not shown here were conducted by increasing the magnitude of the lumped mass transfer coefficient to approximate equilibrium dissolution the results were similar to the original ones simulated by the powers et al 1994 christ et al 2006 showed that the selection of a mass transfer correlation for dnapl dissolution has more influence on late time mass transfer 95 dnapl removal and suggested that use of a ganglia based mass transfer correlation may predict faster dnapl removal and shorter source longevity our simulation results however showed that longer dnapl persistence is not necessarily linked to longer post napl plume persistence plume persistence in this study was found to be the result of the interaction between dnapl dissolution diffusion and sorption solubility is another property that has been shown to influence source longevity e g seyedabbasi et al 2012 to explore this factor post spill transport simulations were conducted for a higher solubility dnapl with properties consistent with that of tce to compare with behavior observed in the previous pce simulations input properties for the dnapl included a solubility of 1000 mg l density of 1466 kg m3 aqueous phase diffusivity of 9 1e 6 cm2 s and k oc of 126 l kg three times smaller than that of pce the cases with no sorption and linear sorption were simulated for a release in one selected realization for fields 1 and 2 simulations results table 6 reveal that the total longevity decreased dramatically for the tce plume attributed to faster dnapl dissolution while the post dnapl period was sustained for a longer time for tce in the linear sorption cases the no sorption case simulations exhibited slightly shorter post dnapl longevity for tce than for pce in the no sorption cases with tce it is likely that the higher concentration gradient between transmissive and low permeability zones drives faster release of the sequestered mass from low permeability zones for the linear sorption cases with tce two factors are most likely contributing to longer post dnapl times 1 larger quantities of dissolved mass in the inaccessible zones in the domain and 2 the more rapid dnapl dissolution relative to the period of desorption and bd which are occurring at rates similar to that of pce thus the relative contribution of sorbed and low permeability sequestered mass to contaminant persistence increases as the contaminant solubility increases these simulation results also indicate that the loading and release of stored mass in low permeability zones are very sensitive to the inclusion and simulation of sorption it should be noted here that the tce dnapl spill distribution was assumed to be the same as that for pce in these simulations if the actual spill release were simulated tce spills would not be expected to penetrate as deep vertically due the smaller density which would significantly impact the mass distribution and persistence simulation results 3 2 3 d simulations to explore the influence of model dimensionality on remedial metrics simulations were conducted on two selected 3 d saturation realizations one for each of the fields with the four different sorption treatments again the three flux averaged concentration based metrics were examined fig 8 the 3 d results generally follow the trends predicted in the 2d mean simulations 1 the inclusion of sorption results in prolonged plume persistence i e total and post dnapl the extent of which depends on the sorption complexity 2 the total plume persistence is greater in field 1 than field 2 3 the dnapl removal time is not sensitive to sorption type and varies within 6 of the no sorption case and 4 the dnapl removal time is greater in the field 1 scenario than in the field 2 scenario the post dnapl removal time varies within a certain range for both fields in each sorption case appearing to be negligibly affected by the field configuration the consistency of trends observed between the 2 d and 3 d simulations supports conclusions reached above relating to the importance of sorption and permeability field heterogeneity in the source zone to the accurate prediction of plume persistence despite the similarities 2 d models tended to predict longer plume persistence than 3 d in these simulations the 2 d mean total plume persistence and dnapl removal time are approximately two fold greater than the corresponding metrics in 3 d in all four sorption cases for both fields the differences between 2 d mean and 3 d however could be an artifact of the single realization associated with the 3 d dnapl infiltration simulation to further explore the influence of dimensionality additional transport simulations were performed for the four sorption cases and both fields in 2 d with dnapl spills and permeability fields extracted from the center x z cross section in the 3 d spill scenarios results of these simulations labeled 2d in 3d are also presented in fig 8 although closer to the 3d simulations than those of the 2d mean these additional simulations produced longer total plume and dnapl persistence times for both fields in comparison with the 3 d simulations trends in post dnapl persistence time however were less clear although the same volume 80 l of dnapl was released in the center slice of the 3 d domain as the 2 d domain only a small portion of dnapl was eventually retained in the center cross section of the 3 d domain consequently horizontal migration and spreading of dnapl in the 3 d simulation resulted in increased access of the dnapl to groundwater flow and an acceleration of dissolution the spreading also resulted in access of dissolved mass to a larger medium volume but did not necessarily lead to more mass sequestration the sequestration of mass depends on the spatial distribution of the sorptive properties of the medium therefore the post dnapl persistence can be longer field 2 case or shorter field 1 case in 3 d than persistence in the 2d in 3d simulations in a heterogeneous domain the 2d in 3d or 2d simulations may not be representative of real conditions as the center of mass of the dnapl and sequestered mass may not be in the transect where the source is released to further explore the contribution of sequestered mass to near source plume persistence the ratio percent of post dnapl time to total plume persistence was calculated fig 8 comparison of the results for fields 1 and 2 shows that the influence of sequestered mass on plume persistence is highly dependent on the configuration of the permeability field in both 2 d and 3 d field 1 appears to be dnapl dominated while field 2 is the opposite in addition the influence of the sequestered mass on plume persistence is also associated with the sorption complexity of media fig 8 shows that there is little or no effect of sequestered mass and bd on plume tailing in the no sorption case regardless of model dimension sequestered mass becomes a more important contributor to plume tailing when sorption is a present e g in the linear nonlinear and rate limited sorption cases thus bd alone appears to be only a minor factor in sustaining downgradient plumes compared to dnapl dissolution when low permeability layers are thin and not very sorptive conversely predictions based upon assumptions of no sorption or linear sorption could be mistakenly optimistic about plume persistence times when the sorption properties of site media are complex in addition the discrepancies between 2 d and 3 d predictions of post dnapl time become larger as sorption is included this suggests that model dimensionality and sorption representation together can play important roles when predicting plume longevity for a heterogeneous field that is highly sorptive or has nonideal sorption in low permeability zones use of 3 d simulations may be more appropriate for sites with nonideal sorption where spreading in the transverse lateral direction will affect mass exchange between transmissive and low permeability zones discrepancies between 2 and 3 d simulations can be also understood in the context of the influence of reduced dimensionality on pce migration vertical pathways wang 2013 the dnapl spill simulations demonstrated that 2 d releases resulted in deeper penetration than the 3 d cases for mildly heterogeneous permeability fields christ et al 2005 came to the same conclusion for vertical spreading in 2 d and 3 d they also reported smaller gtp values in 2 d than in 3 d which means that simulations in 2 d scenarios were associated with more pooling and consequently longer persistence of down gradient plumes thus for both mildly and highly heterogeneous fields these results suggest that 2 d predictions cannot represent 3 d ones the initial averaged saturation per bulk volume calculated for 3 d is smaller than 2 d which could partially contribute to the more rapid cleanup in the 3 d simulations a thorough study that includes the whole ensemble of 3 d simulations would be needed to reach a more general conclusion 4 discussion and conclusions simulations conducted herein reveal that accurate representation of sorption processes in transport models is crucial to the accurate prediction of plume longevity especially for the prediction of post dnapl dissolution longevity while diffusive mass rebound or back diffusion has been heavily emphasized in previous investigations e g ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 seyedabbasi et al 2012 yang et al 2015 the results of this study suggest that sorption processes will dominate the rate of mass release to transmissive zones simulations that neglected the storage capacity of low permeability compartments for sorbed contaminants tended to substantially underestimate the mass loading in low permeability compartments during the pre remediation period these results indicate that the achievement of remediation objectives would likely be compromised by optimistic predictions of plume longevity if sorption processes are neglected or an inappropriate sorption model is assumed note however that the simulations conducted herein revealed a very limited effect of sorption on the rate of dnapl dissolution chemical or biological transformations were not included in the modeling studies presented here if such reactions were simulated the longevity of dnapl and the aqueous source contaminant would likely be reduced the transformation products however would contribute to down gradient flux and plume persistence simulation results also demonstrated a strong influence of source zone complexity e g heterogeneity of the permeability field dnapl architecture process coupling on source zone mass transport and near source plume persistence results suggest that the presence of dnapl tends to control the clean up rate in the near source area in most cases simulations demonstrate how small isolated pockets of dnapl can evolve and persist in heterogeneous domains the removal of the last few percent of the dnapl or trace dnapl mass is especially important in terms of reducing plume tailing time since this part of the dnapl mass usually represents the most persistent source although neat phase dnapl is not typically detected at most sites this work suggests that trace amounts of dnapl source mass present in the field can be as influential as sequestered sorbed and dissolved mass in controlling plume tailing and that these small quantities of dnapl mass can be difficult to differentiate from the diffused and sorbed mass without exhaustive characterization rivett et al 2014 thus by neglecting consideration of the influence of dnapl architecture and dissolution previous studies would presumably have tended to over emphasize the importance of bd and may have been relatively inaccurate in their predictions of plume behavior and longevity e g ball et al 1997 chapman and parker 2005 chapman et al 2012 liu and ball 2002 matthieu et al 2014 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008b yang et al 2015 the simulations presented herein also demonstrate that the evolving plume is directly linked to the spatial heterogeneity of the medium source mass distribution and sorption properties the inclusion of dnapl dissolution sorption and diffusion allows the model to capture the interplay between these processes in aged heterogeneous source zones due to the presence of heterogeneity different regimes within the domain where local mass behavior is governed by different processes i e dissolution and bd were shown to exist before complete napl removal from the domain in other words the release of sequestered mass does not begin at the same time at every spatial location a common method used to model a dnapl source in previous studies has been to use a source loading function followed by period during which this loading is halted to allow for bd e g chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 using this approach the spatial variations of source zone dnapl architecture are greatly simplified this approach cannot capture the interplay between different transport processes at the local scale that has been demonstrated here to be crucial in determining down gradient concentrations in highly heterogeneous sites in addition the large variability among the predicted longevity metrics of the simulations in this work also points to the importance of source zone heterogeneity in plume longevity predictions the location of low permeability layers especially thick and laterally persistent layers is controlling for both the formation of the source zone architecture and the solute plume in sum these results imply that simplified models that idealize subsurface stratigraphy or neglect process coupling will be unable to adequately predict plume persistence the conclusions drawn above are associated with the specific simulation conditions assumed in this work i e the selected dnapl permeability and associated media sorption characteristics the low permeability zones in this work were consistent with a silty sand or coarse grained silt the hydraulic conductivity of these materials however are one to two orders of magnitude higher than those of clays which have been considered as low permeability zones in previous studies e g liu and ball 2002 parker et al 2008 sale et al 2008b if a smaller hydraulic conductivity material were used for low permeability zones the discharge of stored mass out of the low permeability zones would be expected to be slower however the penetration depth and the amount of mass loaded into these zones would also likely be reduced for the lower conductivity materials longer dnapl persistence might also be possible due to more areas of flow bypassing thus further work would be useful to explore behavior in other depositional environments this study showed that reduced dimensionality has a substantial impact on predictions of plume longevity although results from the limited number of 3 d simulations presented are not exhaustive the large discrepancies observed between plume longevity predicted by the 3 d and 2 d simulations suggest that 2 d simulations although computationally efficient are only useful for examining trends in plume metrics in highly heterogeneous formations it is likely that predictions obtained by 2 d simulations will be most misleading in cases where strong nonideal sorption is present a more quantitative comparative analysis would require additional simulations in 3 d all of the scenarios considered here explored near source zone within 10 m of the dnapl zone plume evolution an examination of transport at larger distances down gradient of a dnapl source zone is a topic that is worthy of further investigation the complex interplay of heterogeneity and sorption bd processes will likely also be important at this larger plume scale for example relative to dnapl mass the influence of sorption and bd would be expected to become more significant along transects further down gradient from a source zone as the plume encounters more opportunities for sorption and diffusion into low permeability zones nrc 2004 however plume concentrations would also be more diluted by mixing with transport further down gradient reducing concentration gradients for mass sequestration into less permeable zones in addition concentration rebound and bd fluxes depend on the local contrasts between concentrations in the more mixed transmissive zones and the less permeable zones suggesting that bd rates and flux averaged concentrations would be greatly affected by local heterogeneity based upon the simulation comparisons for no sorption linear sorption nonlinear sorption and rate limited sorption models presented above it is anticipated that the plume tailing sustained by the sequestered mass will vary with different specifications of koc and sorption mass transfer rate it is likely that the effect of bd and sorption on plume tailing will be less significant with smaller koc and faster mass transfer the importance of including sorption and using a field specific sorption model and associated parameters may also depend on the heterogeneity of the permeability field as has been suggested in previous studies rivett et al 2006 rodriguez 2006 thus it will be important for site managers to explore sensitivity to sorption parameters for the permeability fields and properties representative of their particular field site and release conditions acknowledgments funding for this study was provided
